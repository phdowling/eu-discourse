"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 27.10.2016\nCOM(2016) 698 final\n2016/0344(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing for 2017 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nAll fishing opportunities regulations must limit the harvesting of the fish stocks to levels which must be consistent with the overall objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In this respect, Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy (\u201cthe basic regulation of the CFP\u201d) sets out the objectives for the annual proposals for catch and fishing effort limitations to ensure that Union fisheries are ecologically, economically and socially sustainable. \n\n\nThe fishing opportunities exercise represents an annual management cycle (biennial in the case of deep sea stocks). However, this does not stand in the way of the introduction of long-term management approaches. The Union has made progress in this regard and key stocks of commercial interest are now subject to multi-annual management plans; yearly TACs and effort ceilings must comply with those plans.\n\n\nThis proposal contains fishing opportunities that the Union establishes autonomously. However, it also features fishing opportunities resulting from multilateral or bilateral fisheries consultations. The outcome is implemented by providing for internal allocation among Member States on the principle of relative stability.\n\n\nThus this proposal covers, apart from autonomous Union stocks:\n\n\n\uf0b7Shared stocks, i.e. stocks that are jointly managed with Norway in the North Sea and the Skagerrak, or related to North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) Coastal State consultations.\n\n\n\uf0b7Fishing opportunities resulting from agreements reached in the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs).\n\n\nA number of fishing opportunities are marked as \"pm\" (pro memoria) in this proposal. This is due to the fact that:\n\n\n\u2013the advice on some stocks is not available at the time when the proposal is adopted; or\n\n\n\u2013certain catch limitations and other recommendations from the relevant RFMOs are pending because their annual meetings have not taken place yet; or\n\n\n\u2013for some stocks in Greenland waters, as well as shared stocks or stocks exchanged with Norway and other third countries, the figures are not available yet, pending the conclusion of consultations in November and December 2016 with those countries; or\n\n\n\u2013for a few TACs the advice has been received, but the evaluation is still ongoing.\n\n\nIt is suggested that TACs for certain short-lived species (sandeel, capelin and sprat) would be established by the Commission by means of implementing acts. This is necessary as scientific advice for these species is released shortly before the start of the fishery, allowing very little time for legislative procedures. Implementing acts are also used for necessary adjustments to effort regimes.\n\n\nStock overview\n\n\nAs usual, the Commission has reviewed the situation to which the fishing opportunities proposals must respond via its annual Communication from the Commission concerning a consultation on Fishing Opportunities (COM(2016)396), hereinafter \"Communication\"). The Communication provides an overview of the state of the stocks based on the findings of the scientific advice available. \n\n\nIn response to the Commission's request, the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) provided on 30 June 2016 its annual advice on most fish stocks covered by this proposal. ICES has taken into account the orientations presented by the Commission in its Communication.\n\n\nScientific advice delivered by ICES is essentially dependent on data: only stocks for which there is sufficient and reliable data can be fully assessed, so that stock size estimates are produced, as well as a forecast of how they will react to the various exploitation scenarios (this is referred to as \"catch options tables\"). Where sufficient data is available, the scientific bodies are able to provide estimates of adjustments to the fishing opportunities that will bring the stock to produce its maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The advice is then referred to as \"MSY advice\". In other cases, the scientific bodies rely on the precautionary approach to make recommendations as to what the level of fishing opportunities should be. The methodology followed by ICES to that end is presented in ICES published material pertaining to the implementation of advice for data limited stocks\n1\n.\n\n\n\n\nAll the proposed fishing opportunities respond to the scientific advice received by the Commission as to the state of the stocks, which has been used in the manner outlined in the Communication.\n\n\nLanding obligation introduced by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\n\n\nThe landing obligation introduced by the basic regulation of the CFP is becoming progressively applicable from 2015 to 2019. In 2019, all stocks under a TAC are to be subject to the landing obligation. As from 1 January 2016, certain demersal fisheries in the North Sea, North-Western and South-Western Atlantic waters have been placed under the landing obligation. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member States and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the Commission adopted Delegated Regulations laying down specific discard plans. In 2016 the Member States have submitted updated joint recommendations in order to progressively extend the landing obligation from 1 January 2017.\n\n\nWith the introduction of the landing obligation, and in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the fishing opportunities proposed are to reflect the change from amount landed to amount caught, taking into account that discards are no longer allowed. This is done on the basis of the received scientific advice for the fish stocks in fisheries referred to in Article 15(1) of the basic regulation of the CFP. The fishing opportunities should also be fixed in accordance with other relevant provisions, i.e. Articles 16(1) (referring to the principle of relative stability) and 16(4) (referring to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and the rules provided for in multiannual plans).\n\n\nAs a consequence, the Commission will propose TAC increases for stocks which will become subject to the landing obligation in 2017. Where catches from the same stock must be landed in the fisheries brought under the landing obligation in 2017, but other catches from the same stock can still be discarded (caught in fisheries coming under the landing obligation in 2018 and 2019), the Commission will propose, on the basis of the best available data, TAC increases corresponding to the amounts that will have to be landed.\n\n\nA number of stocks will be subject to top-ups, in order to compensate for former discards, which will have to be landed. These top-ups will be calculated on the basis of the data submitted by the Member States. Pending the submission of such data, it was decided for the time being in the Commission Proposal to include the figures without top-ups. The top-ups will be added as soon as the data enabling their calculation is provided.\n\n\nFinally, the links between the basic regulation of the CFP and Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 must be considered. The latter establishes additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs, including flexibility provisions under Articles 3 and 4 for precautionary and analytical stocks respectively. Under its Article 2, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4 shall not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, another flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine biological resources and hinder the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, it should be clarified that Article 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 cannot apply in addition to the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation 1380/2013.\n\n\nMeasures on sea bass\n\n\nICES assessment of the stock of sea bass in the Channel, Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and the southern North Sea continues to report a downward trend. However, this is not surprising,  as restorative actions are expected to take between 4 and 7 years to produce effectes and to be reflected in the assessment. There is an initial indication of higher recruitment. The immediate objective of the management measures remains the same, i.e. to provide protection to spawning aggregations and to reduce as far as possible other sources of mortlity. There has been a significant decrease in landings in 2015 and 2016, however, measures need to be strengthened and continued.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe measures proposed are consistent with other Union policies, in particular with the policies in the field of environment.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\n\nThe Union's obligations for sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources arise from obligations set out in Article 2 of the basic regulation of the CFP.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the Union exclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) of the Treaty. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason: the CFP is a common policy. According to Article 43(3) of the Treaty it is incumbent upon the Council to adopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n\n\nThe proposed Council Regulation allocates fishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Articles 16 and 17 of the basic regulation, Member States then proceed to allocate in turn such opportunities among regions or operators as they see fit. Therefore, Member States have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the social/economic model of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing opportunities.\n\n\nThe proposal has no new financial implications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by Council every year, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instrument: regulation. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nThe fishing opportunities regulation is revised several times per year to introduce the necessary changes to reflect the most recent scientific advice and other developments.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n(a)Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents\n\n\nThe Commission has consulted stakeholders, in particular through the Advisory Councils (ACs), and Member States on its proposed approach to its various fishing opportunities proposals on the basis of its Communication on Fishing Opportunities for 2017.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission has followed the orientations outlined in its Communication to the Council and European Parliament on improving consultation on Community fisheries management (COM(2006)246 final), which sets out the principles for the so-called front-loading process.\n\n\n(b)Summary of responses and how they were taken into account\n\n\nThe response to the Commission Communication on Fishing Opportunities mentioned above reflects the views of stakeholders on the evaluation made by the Commission of the state of the resources and how to ensure the appropriate management response. These responses have been considered by the Commission when formulating the Proposal.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nAs for the methodology used, the Commission consulted, as already noted, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Advice from ICES is based on an advice framework developed by its expert groups and decision-making bodies and issued in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the Commission.\n\n\nThe ultimate objective is to bring and maintain the stocks to levels that can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This objective has been incorporated expressly in the basic regulation of the CFP, in particular its Article 2(2) stating that this objective \u201cshall be achieved by 2015 where possible, and [\u2026] by 2020 for all stocks\". This reflects the commitment taken by the Union regarding the conclusions of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and its related Plan of Implementation. As already noted, for some stocks information on maximum sustainable yield levels is indeed available. Among these, there are very important stocks in terms of volume of catches and commercial value such as hake, cod, anglerfish, sole, megrims, haddock and Norway lobster. \n\n\nReaching the MSY objective may, in certain cases, need a reduction in fishing mortality rates and/or a reduction in catches. Against this background, this proposal makes use of the MSY advice, where available. In line with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, where TACs are proposed on the basis of MSY advice, the TAC corresponds to the level which, according to that advice, would ensure delivery of the MSY objective in 2017. This approach follows the principles presented in the Communication on fishing opportunities for 2017.\n\n\nFor data-limited stocks, the scientific advisory bodies issue recommendations as to whether to reduce, stabilise or allow catches to increase. ICES advice has in many cases provided quantitative guidance about such variations, based on their methodology of a +/- 20% maximum change in catches from one year to the other, on precautionary grounds. This guidance has been used to set the TACs proposed. Where there is no scientific advice at all, the precautionary approach has been followed, meaning precautionary TAC reductions by 20%.\n\n\n\nFor some stocks (mainly widely distributed stocks, sharks and rays) the advice will be issued in the autumn. This proposal will need to be updated as appropriate once that advice is received. Finally, as mentioned above, for certain stocks the advice is used for the purpose of implementing management plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe scope of the fishing opportunities regulation is circumscribed by Article 43(3) of the Treaty.\n\n\nThe Union has adopted a number of multiannual management plans for stocks of key economic importance, including cod, sole, plaice, and others. Before their adoption, such plans are subject to the requirement of an impact assessment. Once in force, they determine the TAC and effort levels that must be fixed for the given year in order to attain their long-term objectives. The Commission is bound to make its proposal for fishing opportunities in accordance with these plans as long as they remain scientifically valid and in force. As a result, many crucial fishing opportunities included in the proposal are the result of the specific impact assessment carried out for the plan they are based upon.\n\n\nFor the remainder, and despite the fact that multiannual plans may not be in place, the proposal seeks to avoid short-term approaches in favour of long-term sustainability decisions, and hence it takes into account initiatives from stakeholders and ACs if they have been positively reviewed by ICES and/or STECF. Furthermore, the Commission's CFP reform proposal was duly developed on the basis of an impact assessment (SEC(2011)891) in the context of which the MSY objective was analysed. Its conclusions identify this objective as a necessary condition to achieve environmental, economic and social sustainability. \n\n\n\nAs regards RFMO fishing opportunities and stocks which are shared with third countries, this proposal essentially transposes internationally agreed measures. Any elements relevant to assess possible impacts of the fishing opportunities are dealt with in the preparation and conduct phase of international negotiations in the framework of which the Union's fishing opportunities are agreed with third parties.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe proposal provides for simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (Union or national), in particular as regards requirements regarding the effort management.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposed measures will have no budgetary implications.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe provisions of the Regulation will be implemented and the compliance will be controlled in accordance with the existing Common Fisheries Policy.\n\n\n\n2016/0344 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\nfixing for 2017 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article\u00a043(3) of the Treaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 of the European\u00a0Parliament and of the Council\n2\n requires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and other advisory bodies, as well as in the light of any advice received from Advisory Councils.\n\n\n(3)It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article\u00a016(4) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article\u00a02(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article\u00a016(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member\u00a0States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member\u00a0State for each fish stock or fishery.\n\n\n(4)The total allowable catch (TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the Advisory Councils.\n\n\n(5)The landing obligation referred to in Article\u00a015 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 is introduced on a fisherybyfishery basis. In the region covered by this Regulation, when a fishery falls under the landing obligation, all species in that fishery subject to catch limits should be landed. From\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017, the landing obligation applies to the species that define the fisheries. Article\u00a016(2) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches. On the basis of the joint recommendations submitted by the Member\u00a0States and in accordance with Article\u00a015 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 the Commission adopted a number of delegated Regulations laying down specific discard plans applicable on a temporary basis for a maximum period of three years, in preparation for the full implementation of the landing obligation.\n\n\n(6)The fishing opportunities for stocks of species falling under the landing obligation from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017 should compensate for former discards and be based on scientific information and advice. In order to ensure fair compensation for the fish that has been previously discarded and that will have to be landed from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017, a topup should be calculated according to the following methodology: the new landings figure should be calculated by subtracting from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) figure of total catches the amounts that will continue to be discarded during the operation of the landing obligation; subsequently a topup applied to the TAC figure should be proportional to the change between the new calculated landings figure and the previous ICES landings figure.\n\n\n(7)According to scientific advice, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the Celtic Sea, Channel, Irish Sea and southern North Sea (ICES divisions IVb, IVc and VIIa, VIId\u2013VIIh) remains in a perilous state and the stock continues to decline. The conservation actions to prohibit fishing for sea bass should therefore be maintained in ICES divisions VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIIg, VIIj and VIIk, with the exception of the waters within 12 nautical miles of the baseline under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. Spawning aggregations of sea bass should be protected with commercial catches restricted further in 2017. On the basis of social and economic impacts limited fisheries using hooks and lines should be permitted, while providing for a closure to protect spawning aggregations. Additionally, due to incidental and unavoidable by-catches of sea bass by vessels using demersal trawls and seines, such by-catches should be limited to 1 % of the weight of the total catch of marine organisms on board. Catches of recreational fishermen should be restricted by a monthly limit.\n\n\n(8)For some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at\u00a00, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for this specific treatment is that the conservation status of those stocks is poor and, because of their high survival rates, discards will not raise fishing mortality rates for them, but are deemed as beneficial for the conservation of these species. As of\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02015, however, catches of those species in pelagic fisheries have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation foreseen in Article\u00a015 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013. Article\u00a015(4)(a) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the Common Fisheries Policy. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the fishing of those species in the areas concerned.\n\n\n(9)Pursuant to Article\u00a016(4) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013, for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, the TACs for stocks of sole in the Western Channel, of plaice and sole in the North Sea and of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Council Regulations (EC) No\u00a0509/2007\n3\n, (EC) No\u00a0676/2007\n4\n and (EC) No\u00a0302/2009\n5\n. The objective for the Southern hake stock as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005\n6\n is to rebuild the biomass of the stocks concerned to within safe biological limits, while staying in line with the scientific data. In accordance with scientific advice, in the absence of definitive data on a target spawning stock biomass and while taking into account changes in safe biological limits, it is appropriate, in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy as defined in Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, to fix the TAC on the basis of maximum sustainable yield advice, as provided by ICES.\n\n\n(10)As a result of the recent benchmark exercise, as regards the stock of herring to the west of Scotland, ICES has provided advice for the combined herring stocks in Divisions VIa, VIIb and VIIc (West of Scotland, West of Ireland). The advice covers two separate TACs (for VIaS, VIIb and VIIc on the one hand, and for Vb, VIb and VIaN on the other). According to ICES, a rebuilding plan has to be developed for these stocks. Since, according to scientific advice, the management plan for the northern stock\n7\n cannot be applied to the combined stocks, it is appropriate, in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy as defined in Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, to fix the TACs on the basis of the maximum sustainable yield advice.\n\n\n(11)For stocks for which there is no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates, management measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management as defined in Article\u00a04(1)(8) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013, while taking into account stockspecific factors, including, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries considerations.\n\n\n(12)Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96\n8\n introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs including, under Articles 3 and 4, flexibility provisions for precautionary and analytical TACs. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 or 4 shall not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.\n\n\n(13)The scientific advice for shortly-lived species is issued shortely before the start of the fishery. In order to ensure that the relevant catch limits are adapted in line with the scientific advice in order to allow the start of such fisheries, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to adopt implementing acts establishing catch limits for sandeel in Union waters of ICES divisions IIa and IIIa and subarea IV, capelin in Greenland waters of ICES subareas V and XIV and sprat in ICES division IIa and subarea IV. \n\n\n(14)Where a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member\u00a0State only, it is appropriate to empower that Member\u00a0State in accordance with Article\u00a02(1) of the Treaty to determine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when fixing that TAC level, the Member\u00a0State concerned acts in a manner fully consistent with the principles and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.\n\n\n(15)It is necessary to establish the fishing effort ceilings for\u00a02017 in accordance with Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0509/2007, Article\u00a09 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0676/2007, Articles\u00a011 and\u00a012 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01342/2008 and Articles\u00a05 and\u00a09 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0302/2009, while taking into account Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0754/2009\n9\n.\n\n\n(16)In order to guarantee full use of fishing opportunities, it is appropriate to allow for the implementation of a flexible arrangement between some of the TAC areas where the same biological stock is concerned.\n\n\n(17)In the light of the most recent scientific advice from ICES and in accordance with the international commitments in the context of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention (NEAFC), it is necessary to limit the fishing effort on certain deepsea species.\n\n\n(18)For certain species, such as certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a serious risk to their conservation. Fishing opportunities for such species should therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing those species.\n\n\n\n\n(19)At the\u00a011th Conference of the Parties of the Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, held in Quito from\u00a03 to\u00a09\u00a0November\u00a02014, a number of species were added to the lists of protected species in Appendices I and II of the Convention, with effect from\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02015. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the protection of those species with respect to Union fishing vessels fishing in all waters and nonUnion fishing vessels fishing in Union waters.\n\n\n(20)The use of fishing opportunities available to Union fishing vessels set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009\n10\n, and in particular to Articles\u00a033 and\u00a034 of that Regulation, concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by Member\u00a0States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n\n\n(21)It is appropriate, following advice from the ICES, to maintain a specific system to manage sandeel in Union waters of ICES divisions IIa and IIIa and ICES subarea IV. Given that the ICES scientific advice is expected to become available only in\u00a0February\u00a02017, it is appropriate to set the TAC and quotas for this stock provisionally at zero until such advice is released.\n\n\n(22)In accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway\n11\n and the Faroe Islands\n12\n the Union has held consultations on fishing rights with those partners. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreement and protocol on fisheries relations with Greenland\n13\n, the Joint Committee has established the level of fishing opportunities available for the Union in Greenland waters in\u00a02017. It is therefore necessary to include these fishing opportunities in this Regulation. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(23)At its Annual Meeting in\u00a02015, NEAFC adopted a conservation measure on the redfish stock in the Irminger Sea fixing for\u00a02016 the TAC and quotas for the contracting parties, including the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(24)At its Annual Meeting in\u00a02015, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted for the\u00a020162018 period a decrease of the TAC and quotas for bigeye tuna and an extension of the TACs and quotas for blue and white marlins. Furthermore, it confirmed for\u00a02016 TACs and quotas previously established for bluefin tuna, NorthAtlantic swordfish, SouthernAtlantic swordfish, SouthernAtlantic Albacore and North Atlantic Albacore. As it is already the case for the stock of bluefin tuna, it is appropriate that catches in recreational fisheries performed on all other ICCAT stocks included in Annex ID also be subject to the catch limits adopted by that organisation in order to guarantee that the Union does not exceed its quotas. Furthermore, Union fishing vessels of 20 meters length overall or greater fishing for bigeye tuna in the ICCAT Convention Area should be subject to the capacity limitations adopted by ICCAT in the ICCAT Recommendation 15-01. All these measures should be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(25)At its\u00a034th Annual Meeting in\u00a02015, the Parties to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted catch limits for both target and bycatch species for\u00a02015/2016 and\u00a02016/2017. The uptake of such quota during\u00a02015 should be considered when setting fishing opportunities for the year\u00a02016. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(26)At its Annual Meeting in 2016, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted catch limits for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). It also adopted a measure  reducing the use of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) and limiting the use of supply vessels. As the activities of supply vessels and the use of FADs are an integral part of the fishing effort exerted by the purse seine fleet, the measure should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n\n\n(27)The Annual Meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) will be held on\u00a018 \u2013 22 January\u00a02017. It is appropriate that current measures in the SPRFMO Convention Area are provisionally maintained until such Annual Meeting is held. However, the stock of jack mackerel should not be targeted before a TAC is set as a result of that Annual Meeting.\n\n\n(28)At its\u00a089th Annual Meeting in\u00a02015, the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) maintained its conservation measures for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna. IATTC also maintained its resolution on the conservation of oceanic whitetip sharks. Those measures should continue to be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(29)At its Annual Meeting in\u00a02015, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) adopted a conservation measure for biennial TACs for Patagonian toothfish and deepsea red crab, while the existing TACs for alfonsinos, orange roughy and pelagic armourhead remained in force. The currently applicable measures on allocation of fishing opportunities adopted by SEAFO should be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(30)At its\u00a012th Annual Meeting, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) confirmed the conservation and management measures in place. Those measures should continue to be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(31)At its Annual Meeting in\u00a02013, the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock resources in the central Bering Sea did not modify its measures regarding fishing opportunities. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union. [Recital to be modified, as well as the relevant provisions to which it refers, after the new consultations are held]\n\n\n(32)At its\u00a038th Annual Meeting in\u00a02016, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number of fishing opportunities for\u00a02017 of certain stocks in Subareas\u00a014 of the NAFO Convention Area. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n\n\n(33)At its 40th Annual Meeting in 2016, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) adopted catch and effort limits for certain small pelagic stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 in the geographical subareas 17 and 18 (Adriatic Sea) of the GFCM Agreement area. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n\n\n(34)Certain international measures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at the end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such measures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular, since the fishing season in CCAMLR Convention Area runs from\u00a01\u00a0December to\u00a030\u00a0November, and thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention Area are laid down for a period of time starting from\u00a01\u00a0December\u00a02016, it is appropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that date. Such retroactive application does not prejudice the principle of legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the CCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n\n\n(35)In accordance with the declaration by the Union addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters to fishing vessels flying the flag of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana\n14\n, it is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snapper available to Venezuela in Union waters.\n\n\n(36)In order to ensure uniform conditions for granting an individual Member\u00a0State an authorisation to benefit from the system of managing its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European\u00a0Parliament and of the Council\n15\n.\n\n\n(37)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission relating to the granting of additional days at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced scientific observer coverage as well as to establish the formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member\u00a0State.\n\n\n(38)In order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017, except for the provisions concerning fishing effort limits, which should apply from\u00a01\u00a0February\u00a02017, and certain provisions in particular regions, which should have a specific date of application. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\n\n\n\n\n(39)Fishing opportunities should be used in full compliance with the applicable law of the Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nArticle\u00a01\nSubject matter\n\n\n1.This Regulation fixes the fishing opportunities available in Union waters and, to Union fishing vessels, in certain nonUnion waters for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks.\n\n\n2.The fishing opportunities referred to in paragraph\u00a01 include:\n\n\n(a)catch limits for the year\u00a02017 and, where specified in this Regulation, for the year\u00a02018;\n\n\n(b)fishing effort limits for the period from\u00a01\u00a0February\u00a02017 to\u00a031\u00a0January\u00a02018, except where other periods are established for effort limits in Articles\u00a09, 26 and\u00a027 and Annex IIE;\n\n\n(c)fishing opportunities for the period from\u00a01\u00a0December\u00a02016 to\u00a030\u00a0November\u00a02017 for certain stocks in the CCAMLR Convention Area;\n\n\n(d)fishing opportunities for certain stocks in the IATTC Convention Area set out in Article\u00a028 for the periods in\u00a02017 and\u00a02018 specified in that provision.\n\n\nArticle\u00a02\nScope\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall apply to the following vessels:\n\n\n(a)Union fishing vessels;\n\n\n(b)thirdcountry vessels in Union waters.\n\n\n2.This Regulation shall also apply to recreational fisheries where they are expressly referred to in the relevant provisions.\n\n\nArticle\u00a03\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions referred to in Article\u00a04 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 apply.

Those vessels shall not be required to carry fishing authorisations issued in accordance with Article\u00a07 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009. Member\u00a0States concerned shall assess the fishing effort of those vessels by effort groups to which they belong, using appropriate sampling methods. During\u00a0the management period specified in Article  1(2)(b) of this Regulation the Commission shall seek scientific advice for evaluating the effort deployment of those vessels, with a view to their future inclusion into the effort regime.\n\n\n2.REGULATED GEARS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the gear groupings referred to in point\u00a01 of Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01342/2008 (\u2018regulated gear\u2019) and the groupings of geographical areas referred to in point\u00a02 of that Annex shall apply.\n\n\n3.AUTHORISATIONS\n\n\nIf a Member\u00a0State deems it appropriate in order to reinforce the sustainable implementation of this effort regime, it may introduce a prohibition to fish with regulated gear in any of the geographical areas to which this Annex applies by any of vessels flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in that area.\n\n\n4.MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE FISHING EFFORT\n\n\n4.1.The maximum allowable effort referred to in Article\u00a012(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01342/2008 and in Article\u00a09(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0676/2007 for the management period specified in Article 1(2)(b) of this Regulation, for each of the effort groups of each Member\u00a0State is set out in Appendix\u00a0to this\u00a0Annex.\n\n\n4.2.The maximum levels of annual fishing effort set in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01954/2003\n1\n shall not affect the maximum allowable fishing effort set in this Annex.\n\n\n5.MANAGEMENT\n\n\n5.1.Member\u00a0States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article\u00a09 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0676/2007, Article\u00a04 and Articles\u00a013 to\u00a017 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01342/2008 and Articles\u00a026 to\u00a035 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009.\n\n\n5.2.A Member\u00a0State may establish management periods for allocating all or parts of the maximum allowable effort to individual vessels or groups of vessels. In such case, the number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed at the discretion of the Member\u00a0State concerned. During any such management periods, the Member\u00a0State concerned may reallocate effort between individual vessels or groups of vessels.\n\n\n5.3.If a Member\u00a0State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within an area by hours, it shall continue measuring the consumption of days in accordance with the conditions referred to in point\u00a05.1. Upon request by the Commission, the Member\u00a0State concerned shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of effort within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a\u00a024hour period.\n\n\n6.FISHING EFFORT REPORT\n\n\nArticle\u00a028 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood, for the purpose of cod management, as each of the geographical areas referred to in point\u00a02 of this\u00a0Annex.\n\n\n7.COMMUNICATION OF RELEVANT DATA\n\n\n\n\nMember\u00a0States\u00a0shall transmit\u00a0to the Commission\u00a0the data on fishing effort deployed by their fishing vessels\u00a0in accordance with Articles\u00a033 and\u00a034 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009.

I\nGeneral Provisions\n\n\n1.SCOPE\n\n\nThis Annex shall apply to Union fishing vessels of\u00a010\u00a0metres\u2019 length overall or more carrying on board or deploying trawls, Danish seines or similar gears of mesh size equal to or larger than\u00a032\u00a0mm and gillnets of mesh size equal to or larger than\u00a060\u00a0mm or bottom longlines in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a02166/2005, and present in ICES divisions VIIIc and\u00a0IXa excluding the Gulf of C\u00e1diz.\n\n\n2.DEFINITIONS\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n\n\n(a)\u2018gear grouping\u2019 means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n\n\n\n\n(i)trawls, Danish seines or similar gears of mesh size equal to or larger than\u00a032\u00a0mm and\n\n\n(ii)gillnets of mesh size equal to or larger than\u00a060\u00a0mm and bottom longlines;\n\n\n(b)\u2018regulated gear\u2019 means any of the two gear categories belonging to the gear\u00a0grouping;\n\n\n(c)\u2018area\u2019 means ICES divisions VIIIc and IXa excluding the Gulf of C\u00e1diz;\n\n\n(d)\u2018current management period\u2019 means the period specified in Article 1(2)(b);\n\n\n(e)\u2018special conditions\u2019 means the special conditions set out in point\u00a06.1.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LIMITATION IN ACTIVITY\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article\u00a029 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009, each Member\u00a0State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union fishing vessels flying its flag shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days specified in Chapter\u00a0III of this Annex.\n\n\nChapter II\nAuthorisations\n\n\n4.AUTHORISED VESSELS\n\n\n4.1.A Member\u00a0State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from\u00a02002 to\u00a02015, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n\n\n4.2.A vessel flying the flag of a Member\u00a0State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article\u00a016(8) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point\u00a011 or\u00a012 of this Annex.\n\n\nChapter III\nNumber of days present within the area \nallocated to Union fishing vessels\n\n\n5.MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS\n\n\n5.1.During the\u00a0current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member\u00a0State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area having carried on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\n\n\n5.2.If a vessel\u00a0is able to demonstrate that\u00a0its hake catches represent less than\u00a08\u00a0%\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0total\u00a0live weight\u00a0of fish caught in a given fishing trip, the\u00a0flag Member\u00a0State of the vessel shall be allowed not to count the days at sea associated with that fishing trip\u00a0against the applicable maximum number of days at sea as set out in Table\u00a0I.\n\n\n6.SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF DAYS\n\n\n6.1.For the purposes of fixing the maximum number of days at sea that a Union fishing vessel may be authorised by its flag Member\u00a0State to be present within the area, the following special conditions shall apply in accordance with Table I:\n\n\n(a)the total landings of hake in each of the two calendar years\u00a02013 and\u00a02014 made by the vessel concerned shall represent less than\u00a05\u00a0tonnes according to the landings in live weight; and\n\n\n(b)the total landings of Norway lobster in the years specified in point (a) above made by the vessel concerned shall represent less than\u00a02,5\u00a0tonnes according to the landings in live\u00a0weight.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.If a vessel benefits from an unlimited number of days as a result of its compliance with the special conditions, the vessel\u2019s landings in the\u00a0current management period shall not exceed\u00a05\u00a0tonnes of the total landings in live weight of hake and\u00a02,5 tonnes of the total landings in live weight of Norway lobster.\n\n\n6.3.When either of the special conditions is not met by a vessel, that vessel shall, with immediate effect, no longer be entitled to the allocation of days corresponding to the given special\u00a0condition.\n\n\n6.4.The application of the special conditions referred to in point\u00a06.1. may be transferred from one vessel to one or more other vessels which replace that vessel in the fleet, provided that the replacing vessel uses similar gear and does not have in any year of its operation a record of landings of hake and Norway lobster higher than the quantities specified in point\u00a06.1.\n\n\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area by fishing gear per year\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial condition\n\n\n\n\nRegulated gear\n\n\n\n\nMaximum

allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear and special conditions as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear and to the special conditions is respected.\n\n\n7.2.This overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member\u00a0State and qualified for the regulated gear and, where applicable, the special conditions. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point\u00a07.1. were not applied. For as long as the number of days is unlimited according to Table I, the relevant number of days the vessel would benefit from is\u00a0360.\n\n\n7.3.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point\u00a07.1. shall submit a request to the\u00a0Commission, for the regulated gear and special conditions as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based\u00a0on:\n\n\n(a)the list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n\n\n(b)the track record of the years specified in point\u00a06.1.(a) for such vessels reflecting the catch composition defined in the special condition referred to in point\u00a06.1.(a) or (b), if these vessels are qualified for such special conditions;\n\n\n(c)the number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point\u00a07.1.\n\n\n7.4.On the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point\u00a07 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member\u00a0State to benefit from the system referred to in point\u00a07.1.\n\n\n8.ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR PERMANENT CESSATION OF FISHING ACTIVITIES\n\n\n8.1.An additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member\u00a0State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member\u00a0State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period, either in accordance with Article\u00a023 of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006\n2\n or Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0744/2008\n3\n. Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a casebycase basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member\u00a0State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing\u00a0activities.\n\n\n8.2.The effort expended in\u00a02003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using the regulated gear shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear during\u00a02003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table\u00a0I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n\n\n8.3.Points\u00a08.1. and\u00a08.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point\u00a03 or\u00a06.4., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n\n\n8.4.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point\u00a08.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by\u00a015\u00a0June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing, for the gear grouping and special conditions as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based\u00a0on:\n\n\n(a)lists of withdrawn vessels with their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n\n\n(b)the fishing activity deployed by such vessels in\u00a02003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears and, if necessary, special conditions.\n\n\n\n\n8.5.On the basis of such a request by a Member\u00a0State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member\u00a0State a number of days additional to that referred to in point\u00a05.1. for that Member\u00a0State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n8.6.During the\u00a0current management period, a Member\u00a0State may reallocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gears. Additional days stemming from a withdrawn vessel that benefited from a special condition referred to in point\u00a06.1.(a) or (b) may not be allocated to a vessel remaining active that does not benefit from a special condition.\n\n\n8.7.When the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period, the maximum number of days per Member\u00a0State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the\u00a0current management period.\n\n\n9.ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR ENHANCED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER\u00a0COVERAGE\n\n\n9.1.Three additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member\u00a0State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and shall go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0199/2008\n4\n and its implementing rules for national\u00a0programmes.\n\n\n9.2.Scientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the vessel and any crew member.\n\n\n9.3.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point\u00a09.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n\n\n9.4.On the basis of that description, and after consultation with STECF, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member\u00a0State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point\u00a05.1. for that Member\u00a0State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n9.5.If an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member\u00a0State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member\u00a0State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\n\n\nChapter IV\nManagement\n\n\n10.GENERAL OBLIGATION\n\n\nMember\u00a0States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article\u00a08 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02166/2005 and Articles\u00a026 to\u00a035 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009.\n\n\n11.MANAGEMENT PERIODS\n\n\n11.1.A Member\u00a0State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n\n\n11.2.The number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member\u00a0State concerned.\n\n\n11.3.Where a Member\u00a0State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member\u00a0State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point\u00a010. Upon request by the Commission, the Member\u00a0State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a\u00a024hour period.\n\n\nChapter V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n\n\n12.TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF A MEMBER STATE\n\n\n12.1.A Member\u00a0State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n\n\n12.2.The total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point\u00a012.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel\u2019s average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years\u00a0specified in point\u00a06.1.(a) multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that\u00a0vessel.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.The transfer of days as described in point\u00a012.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n\n\n12.4.The transfer of days is only permitted for vessels benefiting from an allocation of fishing days without special conditions.\n\n\n12.5.On request from the Commission, Member\u00a0States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. The format of spreadsheets for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n13.TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES\n\n\nMember\u00a0States may permit the transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points\u00a04.1. and\u00a04.2. and\u00a012 apply mutatis mutandis.

deploying beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than\u00a080 mm and static nets including gillnets, trammelnets and tanglenets with mesh size equal to or less than\u00a0220\u00a0mm in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a0509/2007, and present in ICES division\u00a0VIIe.\n\n\n1.2.Vessels fishing with static nets with mesh size equal to or larger than\u00a0120\u00a0mm and with track records of less than\u00a0300\u00a0kg live weight of sole per year during the three previous years, according to their fishing records, shall be exempt from the application of this Annex subject to the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)such vessels caught less than\u00a0300\u00a0kg live weight of sole during the\u00a02015 management\u00a0period;\n\n\n(b)such vessels do not tranship any fish at sea to another vessel;\n\n\n (c)by\u00a031\u00a0July\u00a02017 and\u00a031\u00a0January\u00a02018 each Member\u00a0State concerned makes a report to the Commission on these vessels\u2019 catch records for sole in the three previous years as well as on catches of sole in\u00a02017.\n\n\nWhere any of these conditions is not met, the vessels concerned shall cease to be exempt from the application of this Annex, with immediate effect.\n\n\n2.DEFINITIONS\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n(a)\u2018gear grouping\u2019 means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n\n\n(i)beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than\u00a080 mm and\n\n\n(ii)static nets, including gillnets, trammel nets and tanglenets, with mesh size equal to

Article\u00a029 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009, each Member\u00a0State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Union shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days set out in Chapter III of this Annex.\n\n\nChapter II\nAuthorisations\n\n\n4.AUTHORISED VESSELS\n\n\n4.1A Member\u00a0State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from\u00a02002 to\u00a02015, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n\n\n4.2However, a vessel with a track record of using a regulated gear may be authorised to use a different fishing gear, provided that the number of days allocated to this latter gear is greater than or equal to the number of days allocated to the regulated gear.\n\n\n4.3A vessel flying the flag of a Member\u00a0State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article\u00a016(8) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point\u00a010 or\u00a011 of this Annex.\n\n\nChapter III\nNumber of days present within the area \nallocated to Union fishing vessels\n\n\n5.MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS\n\n\nDuring the\u00a0current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member\u00a0State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area having carried on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\n\n\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area \nby category of regulated gear per year\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated gear\n\n\n\n\nMaximum

period, a Member\u00a0State may manage its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear is respected.\n\n\n6.2.This overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member\u00a0State and qualified for the regulated gear. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point\u00a06.1. were not applied.\n\n\n6.3.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point\u00a06.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n\n\n(a)the list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n\n\n(b)the number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point\u00a06.1.\n\n\n6.4.On the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point\u00a06 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member\u00a0State to benefit from the system referred to in point\u00a06.1.\n\n\n7.ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR PERMANENT CESSATION OF FISHING ACTIVITIES\n\n\n7.1.An additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member\u00a0State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member\u00a0State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period either in accordance with Article\u00a023 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006 or Regulation (EC) No\u00a0744/2008. Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a casebycase basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member\u00a0State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing\u00a0activities.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.The effort expended in\u00a02003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using a given gear grouping shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear grouping during\u00a02003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table\u00a0I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n\n\n7.3.Points\u00a07.1.and\u00a07.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point\u00a04.2., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at\u00a0sea.\n\n\n7.4.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point\u00a07.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by\u00a015\u00a0June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing for the gear grouping as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n\n\n(a)lists of withdrawn vessels with their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n\n\n(b)the fishing activity deployed by such vessels in\u00a02003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears.\n\n\n7.5.On the basis of such a request by a Member\u00a0State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member\u00a0State a number of days additional to that referred to in point\u00a05 for that Member\u00a0State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n7.6.During the\u00a0current management period, a Member\u00a0State may reallocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated\u00a0gears.\n\n\n7.7.When the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period the maximum number of days per Member\u00a0State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the\u00a0current management period.\n\n\n8.ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR ENHANCED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER\u00a0COVERAGE\n\n\n8.1.Three additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated between\u00a01\u00a0February\u00a02017 and\u00a031\u00a0January\u00a02018 to a Member\u00a0State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0199/2008 and its implementing rules for national\u00a0programmes.\n\n\n8.2.Scientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the fishing vessel and any crew member.\n\n\n8.3.A Member\u00a0State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point\u00a08.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n\n\n8.4.On the basis of that description, and after consultation with STECF, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member\u00a0State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point\u00a05 for that Member\u00a0State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n8.5.If an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member\u00a0State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member\u00a0State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\n\n\nChapter IV\nManagement\n\n\n9.GENERAL OBLIGATION\n\n\nMember\u00a0States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with Articles\u00a026 to\u00a035 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009.\n\n\n10.MANAGEMENT PERIODS\n\n\n10.1.A Member\u00a0State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n\n\n10.2.The number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member\u00a0State concerned.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.Where a Member\u00a0State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member\u00a0State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point\u00a09. Upon request by the Commission, the Member\u00a0State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a\u00a024hour period.\n\n\nChapter V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n\n\n11.TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF A MEMBER STATE\n\n\n11.1.A Member\u00a0State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet\u00a0register.\n\n\n11.2.The total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point\u00a011.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel\u2019s average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years\u00a02001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and\u00a02005 multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n\n\n11.3.The transfer of days as described in point\u00a011.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n\n\n11.4.On request from the Commission, Member\u00a0States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. Formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).\n\n\n12.TRANSFER OF DAYS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES\n\n\nMember\u00a0States may permit transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points\u00a04.2., 4.4., 5, 6 and\u00a010 apply mutatis mutandis.
