Large scale reconstruction works will be required, notably to restore the cultural heritage of the affected areas. Europe needs to be able to quickly provide additional, effective support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to Member States and regions hit by major or regional natural disasters, complementing the means available under the European Union Solidarity Fund. \n\n\nIn order to provide such additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the Commission proposes to introduce the possibility of a separate priority axis for reconstruction operations supported by the ERDF within an operational programme. Given the potential magnitude of the impact of such natural disasters, it is proposed to provide the possibility to finance such operations fully from the ERDF, without the need for national co-financing. Operations to be financed within this priority axis are those linked to reconstruction in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.\n\n\n\nSpecific provisions for the starting date of eligibility of expenditure are furthermore proposed to ensure that expenditure is eligible for reimbursement from the date of the disaster. \n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with the overall legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI) Funds and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EC) 1303/2013. The proposal complements the type of support available under Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund. \n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EC) 1303/2013 and maintains consistency with other Union policies. \n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to introduce an additional paragraph in Article 120 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to provide for the creation of a separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100% to support, under ERDF investment priorities, operations selected by managing authorities in response to major or regional disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund. \n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters by providing the possibility to finance reconstruction works by the ERDF with a co-financing rate of up to 100% from the EU budget requires an amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. The same result cannot be achieved through action at national level. \n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal is a limited and targeted change not going beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of providing additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters. \n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\u2022Ex post-evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nAn impact assessment has been carried out to prepare the proposal for Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. This limited and targeted change does not require a separate impact assessment.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental rights\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013.\n\n\n\nIt remains within the limits of the overall allocation for the period 2014-2020 and is therefore budgetary neutral. The increased co-financing rate up to 100% will lead to a partial front-loading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged. \n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the possibility of introducing a separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100% within an operational programme is proposed for the ERDF. The operations that may be co-financed under this separate priority axis are those linked to reconstruction in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund. \n\n\nFor operations under this separate priority axis, a derogation to the rule concerning the starting date of eligibility of expenditure as a result of an amendment of a programme is proposed. This would ensure that following the amendment of the programme expenditure incurred as from the date of the disaster can be declared for reimbursement. \n\n\nA provision has also been included to cover the case of expenditure declared for measures taken by Member State authorities directly after the disaster occurred, and before the operational programme is amended, and reimbursed at the existing co-financing rate. The higher co-financing rate would then be applied through the necessary adjustments to the next payment application and, where appropriate, to the next accounts, once the programme has been amended to include the separate priority axis. \n\n\n\n2016/0384 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards specific measures to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nAfter consulting the European Economic and Social Committee\n1\n, \n\n\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions\n2\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In order to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the possibility of introducing within an operational programme a separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100 % should be provided under the European Regional Development Fund ('ERDF') investment priorities, set out in Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n3\n. \n\n\n(2)The operations that may be co-financed under this separate priority axis are those linked to reconstruction in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002\n4\n establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.\n\n\n(3)For operations under the separate priority axis for natural disasters, a derogation to the general rules concerning the starting date of eligibility of expenditure in relation to expenditure that becomes eligible as a result of an amendment of a programme should be introduced to ensure the possibility to co-finance measures taken by Member State authorities directly after the disaster occurred and before the operational programme is amended. \n\n\n(4)In order to allow for the eligibility of expenditure incurred and paid from the date when the natural disaster occurred, even if this is before the entry into force of this Regulation, the corresponding provision on the starting date of eligibility of expenditure of beneficiaries should have retroactive effect. \n\n\n(5)Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 should be amended accordingly,\n\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nIn Article 120\u00a0of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the following paragraph is added. \n\n\n'8. A separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100\u00a0% may be established within an operational programme to support operations which fulfil the following conditions: \n\n\n\n\na) the operations are selected by managing authorities in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002; \n\n\n\nb) the operations aim at reconstruction in response to the natural disaster; and\n\n\n\nc) the operations are supported under an ERDF investment priority.\n\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 65(9), expenditure for operations under this priority axis shall be eligible from the date when the natural disaster occurred.\n\n\n\nWhere expenditure in relation to operations referred to in the first subparagraph has been included in a payment application submitted to the Commission before the establishment of the separate priority axis, the Member State shall make the necessary adjustments to the next payment application and, where appropriate, to the next accounts submitted following the adoption of the amendment to the programme.'\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nEntry into force and application\n\n\nThis regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n\nArticle 1 shall apply from 1 January 2014.\n\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\nThe President\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\n\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending amending Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards as regards specific measures to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters.\n\n\n2.ABM / ABB FRAMEWORK\n\n\nPolicy Area(s) concerned and associated Activity/Activities:\n\n\nRegional Policy; ABB activity 13.03\n\n\n3.BUDGET LINES\n\n\n3.1.Budget lines (operational lines and related technical and administrative assistance lines (ex- B.A lines)): \n\n\nThe proposed new action will be implemented on the following budget lines:\n\n\n\uf0b713.036000 Less developed regions  (ERDF)\n\n\n\uf0b713.036100 Transition regions (ERDF)\n\n\n\uf0b713.036200 More developed regions (ERDF)\n\n\n\uf0b713.036300 Additional allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions (ERDF)\n\n\n\uf0b713.036401 European Territoral Cooperation (ERDF)\n\n\n3.2.Duration of the action and of the financial impact:\n\n\nThe proposal remains within the limits of the overall allocation for the period 2014-2020 and is therefore budgetary neutral.

Since no new financial resources are proposed for commitment appropriations, no figures are inserted in the tables but n.a. (non-applicable) is indicated. The proposal is therefore in line with the multi-annual financial framework for 2014-2020. \n\n\nFor payments, the proposal would result in a higher rate of reimbursment to the Member States concerned. Based on the total cost of the damage from natural disasters for the cases accepted for support from the Solidarity Fund since 2014, and assuming on average an additional co-financing rate of 25%, the impact in additional payments could be estimated at some 1.6bn, spread over the period 2017-2019.\n\n\nThis proposal may imply an acceleration in the use of payment appropriations for the programmes concerned, which would be compensated by programme closure, leaving the proposal as budgetary neutral. The total payment appropriations for the whole programming period remains unchanged.\n\n\nOn the basis of the current estimates presented by Member States for payments in 2017 for Heading 1b, it is considered that this impact could be covered within the overall budget approved for 2017.

Europe needs to be able to quickly provide additional effective support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to Member States hit by major or regional natural disasters, complementing the means available under the European Solidarity Fund. \n\n\n\n5.2.Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy\n\n\nThe proposal will allow the continuation of the implementation of the programmes, injecting money into the economy while at the same time help reduce the burden on public expenditure for Member States affected by natural disasters.\n\n\n5.3.Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework\n\n\nThe objective is to provide additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, complementing the means available under the European Solidarity Fund.\n\n\n5.4.Method of Implementation (indicative)\n\n\nShow below the method(s) chosen for the implementation of the action.\n\n\n\uf0b7With Member States\n\n\n6.MONITORING AND EVALUATION\n\n\n\n\n6.1.Monitoring system\n\n\nNot needed as it falls under the established monitoring of European Structural and Investment Funds.\n\n\n6.2.Evaluation\n\n\n6.2.1.Ex-ante evaluation\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n6.2.2.Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n6.2.3.Terms and frequency of future evaluation\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n7.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES \n\n\nN.A.\n\n\n8.DETAILS OF RESOURCES\n\n\n8.1.Objectives of the proposal in terms of their financial cost\n\n\nCommitment appropriations in EUR million (to 3 decimal places)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Headings of Objectives, actions and outputs should be provided)\n\n\n\n\nType of output\n\n\n\n\nAv. cost\n\n\n\n\nYear n\n\n\n\n\nYear n+1\n\n\n\n\nYear n+2\n\n\n\n\nYear n+3\n\n\n\n\nYear n+4\n\n\n\n\nYear n+5 and later\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\nNo. outputs\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE No.1 Sustain the implementation of the operational programmes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL COST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0,000\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.Administrative Expenditure\n\n\n8.2.1.Number and type of human resources\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff to be assigned to management of the action using existing and/or additional resources (number of posts/FTEs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear n\n\n\n\n\nYear n+1\n\n\n\n\nYear n+2\n\n\n\n\nYear n+3\n\n\n\n\nYear n+4\n\n\n\n\nYear n+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials or temporary staff\u00a0(XX 01 01)\n\n\n\n\nA*/AD\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB*, C*/AST\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff financed by art.
