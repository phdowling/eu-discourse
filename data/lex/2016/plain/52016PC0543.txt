"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 30.8.2016\nCOM(2016) 543 final\n2016/0259(COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non a European Year of Cultural Heritage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe ideals, principles and values embedded in the European cultural heritage constitute a shared source of remembrance, understanding, identity, dialogue, cohesion and creativity for Europe. Since the adoption of the European Agenda for Culture\n1\n in 2007, cultural heritage has been a priority under successive Council Work Plans for Culture, including the current plan for the period 2015-2018\n2\n. Cooperation at European level has taken place mainly through the open method of coordination. In 2014, the role of heritage policies for delivering social and economic benefits was highlighted in the Council conclusions on cultural heritage as a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe\n3\n (21 May 2014), and in the Commission Communication Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe.\n4\n The Communication was welcomed by the Committee of the Regions in its Opinion of 16 April 2015\n5\n, and by the European Parliament, which adopted a Resolution on 8 September 2015\n6\n.\n\n\nIn particular, an invitation to the Commission to propose a \u2018European Year of Cultural Heritage\u2019 was included in the Council conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage, adopted on 25 November 2014\n7\n. The European Parliament made a similar invitation in its resolution and invited the Commission \u2018to designate, preferably for 2018, a European Year of Cultural Heritage\u2019. The Committee of the Regions also echoed that call in its opinion and stressed that a European Year of Cultural Heritage would contribute to the attainment of shared goals in the pan-European context.\n\n\nAs highlighted in the Commission Communication, the contribution of cultural heritage to economic growth and social cohesion in Europe is insufficiently known and often undervalued. At the same time, the heritage sector in Europe is facing many challenges. These include: decreasing public budgets; declining participation in traditional cultural activities; increasing environmental and physical pressures on heritage sites; transforming value chains and expectations as a result of the digital shift; and the illegal trafficking of cultural artefacts.\n\n\nAs with all European Years, the main objective is to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities and highlight the role of the EU in promoting shared solutions. In line with the objectives of the European Agenda for Culture, the European Year of Cultural Heritage should have the following overall objectives:\n\n\n\u2013It shall contribute to promoting the role of European cultural heritage as a pivotal component of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue. It should highlight the best means to ensure its conservation and safeguarding and its enjoyment by a wider and more diversified public. This includes through audience development measures and heritage education, in full respect of the competences of the Member States, thereby promoting social inclusion and integration.\n\n\n\u2013It should enhance the contribution of European cultural heritage to the economy and society, through its direct and indirect economic potential. This includes the capacity to underpin the cultural and creative industries and inspire creation and innovation, promote sustainable tourism, and generate long-term local employment.\n\n\n\u2013It should contribute to promoting cultural heritage as an important element of the EU\u2019s international dimension, building on the interest in partner countries for Europe\u2019s heritage and expertise. Heritage plays a major role in several programmes in the area of external relations, mainly \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 in the Middle East. The promotion of the value of cultural heritage is also a response to the deliberate destruction of cultural treasures in conflict zones\n8\n.\n\n\nThe European Year of Cultural Heritage will offer opportunities for European citizens to better understand the present through a richer and shared interpretation of the past. It will stimulate a better evaluation of the social and economic benefits of cultural heritage and of its contribution to economic growth and social cohesion. This can be assessed, for instance, in terms of the promotion of sustainable tourism and urban regeneration. It will highlight the challenges and opportunities linked to digitisation. It will also contribute to addressing the identified challenges, through the dissemination of best practices concerning: safeguarding; management; enhancement; governance; and research and innovation activities. Recent breakthroughs in terms of technological and social innovation in the field of cultural heritage, as well as the EU's initiatives in these domains, will be highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe European Year of Cultural Heritage will be implemented using existing EU programmes. Cultural heritage is currently eligible for significant EU funding under several EU programmes for conservation, digitisation, infrastructure, research and innovation, enhancement and skills. These programmes include: Creative Europe; the European structural and investment funds; Horizon 2020; Erasmus+; and Europe for Citizens. Three EU actions specifically dedicated to cultural heritage are funded under Creative Europe: European Heritage Days; the EU Prize for Cultural Heritage; and the European Heritage Label.\n\n\nThe European Year will be an opportunity to encourage Member States and stakeholders to work together to develop a stronger and more integrated approach to cultural heritage. This approach would aim to promote and protect Europe\u2019s cultural heritage, and maximise its intrinsic and societal value, and its contribution to jobs and growth. This will be pursued in full respect of the subsidiarity principle.\n\n\nSimilar to other European Years, measures will include information and promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels. They will serve to convey key messages and disseminate information about examples of good practice.\n\n\nEvery effort will be made to ensure that the activities organised in the course of the European Year are tailored to meet the needs and circumstances of each Member State. Member States are therefore invited to appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising their participation in the European Year of Cultural Heritage. A European steering group, including representatives of the national coordinators, will be set up. The Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and European level.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article 167 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This states that the EU \u2018shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore\u2019. The Union shall also encourage 'cooperation between Member States' in the field of culture and if necessary, support and supplement their action.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity \n\n\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be achieved to a sufficient extent solely by action undertaken by the Member States. This is because action at national level alone would not benefit from the European dimension of exchange of experience and good practice between Member States. Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union states that the European Union shall respect the Member States' rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced. The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it by the Treaties. In addition, Member States' action would benefit from the awareness and visibility created within and beyond the EU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposed course of action is simple. It relies on existing programmes and on refocusing communication activities on the themes of the European Year. It imposes no disproportionate management constraints on administrations implementing the proposal.\n\n\nEU action will support and complement the efforts of Member States. This action will firstly improve the effectiveness of the EU\u2019s own instruments. Secondly, it will act as an enabler by encouraging synergies and cooperation among Member States, cultural organisations and foundations, and private and public enterprises.\n\n\nEU action would not go beyond what is necessary to address the identified problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nA decision of the European Parliament and of the Council is the most appropriate instrument to ensure the full involvement of the legislative authority in designating 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nIn preparing its proposal, the Commission conducted a series of targeted consultations involving a wide range of stakeholders, reflecting the nature of the cultural heritage sector and its high level of organisation and specialisation, the competences of the Member States and the role of professional bodies and international organisations. In addition, the Commission took special account of the above-mentioned Council conclusions, the resolution of the European Parliament and the opinion of the Committee of the Regions.\n\n\nAt EU level, policy developments on cultural heritage have recently benefited from a rich debate. This has been facilitated by bodies bringing together authorities in charge of heritage policies in Member States. These include the Reflection Group \u2018EU and cultural heritage\u2019, and the European Heritage Heads Forum. Other intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations include the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), the Council of Europe. Other major networks active in the field include Europa Nostra, the European Heritage Alliance 3.3\n9\n, and the Network of European Museum Organisations (NEMO).\n\n\nThere have been various other developments. In April 2015, the Ministers of Culture of the Council of Europe adopted the Namur Declaration. In this, they welcomed the idea of the Council of the European Union to organise a European Heritage Year. They asked that the Council of Europe, and all States Parties to the European Cultural Convention, be invited to participate.\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the European Year of Architectural Heritage that was organised in 1975 under the auspices of the Council of Europe, the German Cultural Heritage Committee (Deutsches Nationalkomitee f\u00fcr Denkmalschutz) hosted a public discussion in Bonn on the proposal for a European Year, in conjunction with the session of the World Heritage Committee.\n\n\n\n\nAnother relevant discussion was organised in April 2015 by Europa Nostra\u2019s Brussels Office with a selected group of chief executive officers of member organisations. At its June 2015 General Assembly, the entire membership of Europa Nostra discussed the purpose of a European Year for Cultural Heritage and the main actions that could be developed. This was organised in Oslo, in the presence of the European Commission.\n\n\nStakeholders were also consulted in the framework of the open working group \u2018EYCH 2018\u2019, organised by the German Cultural Heritage Committee and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. This resulted in a concept paper (Sharing Heritage\u2019\n10\n) that was taken into account in preparing this proposal. The discussion was conducted with members of the Reflection Group \u2018EU and Cultural Heritage\u2019, including experts from the national administrations of Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Additional experts came from Estonia, Austria, Portugal, and Slovakia; and from various organisations with observer status, including the European network on cultural management and policy (ENCATC), Europa Nostra, and the Network of European Museum Organisations and others.\n\n\nA seminar on \u2018A European Year for Cultural Heritage: sharing heritage, a common challenge\u2019 was organised in Brussels on 28 October 2015 by the Permanent Representations of Italy and Spain to the EU. Stakeholder organisations such as Europa Nostra, national authorities and experts also participated.\n\n\nThe proposal was further discussed at meetings of the above-mentioned Reflection Group in Luxembourg on 23-24 September 2015, in Rome on 30 November \u2013 1 December 2015, in The Hague on 9 May 2016, and at the meeting of the European Heritage Heads Forum in Bern on 19-20 May 2016. Finally, another discussion took place in the framework of the European Culture Forum 2016 on 19 April 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe initiative will draw on independent analyses and studies, in particular the report Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe.\n11\n This was the result of a two-year comprehensive project, funded by the EU Culture Programme, to gather evidence of the value of cultural heritage and of its impact on Europe\u2019s economy, culture and society, and the environment.\n\n\nIt will also draw on the report of the Horizon 2020 expert group on cultural heritage \n\nGetting cultural heritage to work for Europe\n12\n and the Strategic Research Agenda developed by the Joint Programming Initiative Cultural Heritage and Global Change.\n13\n The initiative will eventually draw on the Horizon 2020 Social Platform on Cultural Heritage and European Identities, CULTURALBASE, a multiannual stakeholder consultation initiative\n14\n, as well as drawing on the establishment of new European Research Infrastructures, such as DARIAH- ERIC (Digital Research Infrastructure for Art and Humanities) and E-RIHS (European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science)\n15\n.\n\n\nWork Package 9: Culture and Tourism of the Ex post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2007-2013, focusing on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (CF) found that investing in culture and tourism can boost a region\u2019s economy and improve social inclusion.\n\n\nThe Ex post evaluation of the 7th EU Framework Programme 2007-2013 (FP7), the EU\u2019s research funding programme between 2007 and 2013, concluded that the programme was effective in boosting excellent science and strengthening Europe\u2019s industrial competitiveness. In so doing, it contributed to growth and jobs in Europe in areas that are typically a national endeavour. FP7 supported research, more than 180 M\u20ac, in various aspects of European cultural heritage (tangible, intangible and digital) under the themes Environment, Social Sciences and Humanities, Digital Cultural Heritage, Industrial Technologies, International cooperation and (E)-infrastructure. This existing body of knowledge should be further exploited. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nNo impact assessment is needed, since the objectives of the proposed initiative fall within the objectives of existing Union programmes. The European Year of Cultural Heritage can be implemented within existing budget limits by using those programmes that provide for setting funding priorities on an annual or multiannual basis. The proposed initiative would not commit the Commission to any specific actions of a legislative nature. Nor would it have any significant social, economic or environmental impact beyond that of the existing instruments.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNo additional funding is sought for the European Year. This initiative does not require additional EU budget. The flexibility for setting priorities on an annual or multiannual basis in the relevant programmes is sufficient to envisage an awareness-raising campaign on a scale similar to previous European Years\n\n\n\n\n2016/0259 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\n\n\non a European Year of Cultural Heritage\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in particular Article 167 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n16\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The ideals, principles and values embedded in the European cultural heritage constitute a shared source of remembrance, understanding, identity, dialogue, cohesion and creativity for Europe. Cultural heritage plays a role in the European Union, as stated in the preamble to the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which states that the signatories draw \u2018inspiration from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe\u2019.\n\n\n(2)Article 3.3 TEU states that the European Union shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and ensure that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.\n\n\n(3)Article 167(1) TFEU gives the European Union the task of contributing \u2018to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore\u2019. Union action is to be aimed at encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, supporting and supplementing their action, inter alia, in the area of improving the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples, and in the area of conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance (Article 167(2) TFEU).\n\n\n(4)As highlighted by the European Commission in its Communication \u2018Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\u2019\n17\n, cultural heritage is to be considered a shared resource and a common good held in trust for future generations, whose care is a common responsibility of all stakeholders.\n\n\n(5)Cultural heritage is of great value to European society from a cultural, environmental, social and economic point of view. Thus, its sustainable management constitutes a strategic choice for the 21st century, as stressed by the Council in its Conclusions of 21 May 2014 on 'cultural heritage as a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe'.\n18\n Its contribution in terms of value creation, skills and jobs, and quality of life is undervalued.\n\n\n(6)Cultural heritage is central to the European Agenda for Culture\n19\n. It is one of the four priorities for European cooperation on culture for the period 2015-2018, as set out in the current Work Plan for Culture, adopted by the Council on 25 November 2014.\n20\n\n\n\n(7)Cultural heritage encompasses a broad spectrum of \u2018resources inherited from the past in all forms and aspects \u2014 tangible, intangible and digital (born digital and digitised), including monuments, sites, landscapes, skills, practices, knowledge and expressions of human creativity, as well as collections conserved and managed by public and private bodies such as museums, libraries and archives\u2019, as stated in the aforementioned Conclusions of 21 May 2014.\n\n\n(8)Cultural heritage has been forged over time by the synthesis and combination of cultural expressions of the various civilisations that have populated Europe. A European Year will help to encourage and promote understanding of the importance of the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions. One way to achieve this would be through educational and greater public awareness programmes, in line with the obligations of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions\n21\n adopted by UNESCO on 20 October 2005, to which the EU is a party.\n\n\n(9)The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which the EU and most of Member States are party, states in Article 30 on participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport that States Parties recognise the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life, and that they shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities inter alia enjoy access to places for cultural performances or services, such as theatres, museums, cinemas, libraries and tourism services, and, as far as possible, enjoy access to monuments and sites of national cultural importance.\n\n\n(10)The European Access City Award has shown the feasibility and good practices of making cities cultural heritage accessible for people with disabilities, elderly people, and those with reduced mobility or other types of temporary impairments, in ways which respect their nature and values.\n\n\n(11)Cultural heritage can have an important role for community cohesion at a time when cultural diversity is increasing in European societies. New participatory and intercultural approaches to heritage policies and educational initiatives that attribute equal dignity to all cultural heritages have the potential to increase trust, mutual recognition and social cohesion.\n\n\n(12)This is also recognised in the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development\n22\n which acknowledges global citizenship, cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue as overarching principles of sustainable development. It recognises that all cultures and civilizations can contribute to, and are crucial enablers of, sustainable development. Culture is explicitly mentioned in several Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda: for example Goal 4 (Education), Goal 5 (Gender), Goal 8 and Goal 12 in relation to tourism (Sustainable growth/Consumption patterns) and in particular Goal 11 (Cities-Heritage).\n\n\n\n\n(13)The increased recognition at international level of the need to put people and human values at the centre of an enlarged and cross-disciplinary concept of cultural heritage reinforces the need to foster wider access to cultural heritage. This can be achieved by reaching out to different audiences and by increasing accessibility to places, buildings, products, and services, taking into account special needs and the implications of demographic change.\n\n\n(14)Policies for the maintenance, restoration, conservation, re-use, accessibility, and promotion of cultural heritage, and cultural heritage related services, are primarily national, regional or local responsibilities. Nonetheless, cultural heritage has a clear European dimension and is addressed in several EU policies beyond the cultural ones. These include the following policies: education, agriculture and rural development, regional development, social cohesion, maritime affairs, environment, tourism, the digital agenda, research and innovation, and communication.\n\n\n(15)In order to fully realise their potential for European economies and societies, the safeguarding, enhancement and management of heritage resources, which cut across several public policies, need effective multilevel governance and better cross-sectoral cooperation. This involves all stakeholders, including public authorities, private individuals, civil society organisations, NGOs and the voluntary sector.\n\n\n(16)The Council, in its Conclusions of 25 November 2014\n23\n, invited the Commission to consider presenting a proposal for a \u2018European Year of Cultural Heritage\u2019.\n\n\n(17)The European Parliament, in its resolution of 8 September 2015, recommended designating, preferably for 2018, a European Year of Cultural Heritage.\n24\n\n\n\n(18)The European Committee of the Regions, in its opinion of 16 April 2014\n25\n, welcomed the proposal of the Council for a 'European Year of Cultural Heritage', stressing its contribution to the attainment of shared goals in the pan-European context.\n\n\n(19)Declaring a European Year of Cultural Heritage is an effective way of raising public awareness, disseminating information about good practices and promoting research and innovation as well as policy debate. By creating an environment for simultaneously promoting these objectives at Union, national, regional and local levels, it can achieve greater synergy and a better use of resources.\n\n\n(20)Heritage is also a field of intervention in several programmes in the area of external relations \u2014 mainly but not exclusively in the Middle East. The promotion of the value of cultural heritage is also a response to the deliberate destruction of cultural treasures in conflict zones\n26\n. It will be important to ensure complementarity between the European Year of Cultural Heritage and all external relations initiatives developed within appropriate frameworks. Actions to protect and promote cultural heritage under relevant external relations instruments should, amongst other things, reflect the mutual interest associated with the exchange of experiences and values with third countries. It will promote mutual knowledge, respect and understanding of the respective cultures.\n\n\n(21)While this Decision is addressed to Member States, Enlargement countries should nevertheless be closely associated with actions under the European Year of Cultural Heritage. The involvement of European Neighbourhood Policy countries and other partner countries should also be sought, as appropriate. This can be pursued under the relevant frameworks for cooperation and dialogue, particularly in the context of the civil society dialogue between the EU and these countries.\n\n\n(22)The safeguarding, conservation and enhancement of the European cultural heritage comes under the objectives of existing Union programmes. Therefore, a European Year can be implemented by using these programmes under their existing provisions and setting funding priorities on an annual or multiannual basis. Programmes and policies in fields such as culture, education, agriculture and rural development, regional development, social cohesion, maritime affairs, environment, tourism, the Digital Single Market Strategy, research and innovation, and communication contribute directly and indirectly to the protection, enhancement, innovative re-use and promotion of the European cultural heritage, and may support the initiative in accordance with their respective legal frameworks.\n\n\n(23)The objective of this Decision is to support the efforts of Member States to protect, safeguard, enhance, re-use and promote the European cultural heritage. Since this cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, given the need for transnational exchange of information and the Union-wide dissemination of good practice, but can be better achieved at Union level, the European Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nThe year 2018 shall be designated as the \u2018European Year of Cultural Heritage\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018European Year\u2019).\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n1. In line with the objectives of the European Agenda for Culture, the overall objectives of the European Year shall be to encourage and support \u2014 notably through the exchange of experience and good practices \u2014 the efforts of the Union, the Member States, regional and local authorities to protect, safeguard, re-use, enhance, valorise and promote the European cultural heritage in the European Union (EU). In particular:\n\n\n(a)It shall contribute to promoting the role of European cultural heritage as a pivotal component of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue.

This includes through audience development measures and heritage education, in full respect of the competences of the Member States, thereby promoting social inclusion and integration.\n\n\n(b)It shall enhance the contribution of European cultural heritage to the economy and the society, through its direct and indirect economic potential. This includes the capacity to underpin the cultural and creative industries and inspire creation and innovation, promote sustainable tourism, enhance social cohesion and generate long-term employment.\n\n\n\n\n(c)It shall contribute to promoting cultural heritage as an important element of the Union\u2019s international dimension, building on the interest in partner countries for Europe\u2019s heritage and expertise.\n\n\n2. The specific objectives of the European Year of Cultural Heritage shall be to:\n\n\n(a)encourage approaches that are people-centred, inclusive, forward-looking, more integrated, and cross-sectoral, to make heritage accessible to all and to ensure the safeguarding, conservation, innovative re-use and enhancement of cultural heritage;\n\n\n(b)promote innovative models of multilevel governance and management of cultural heritage, involving all stakeholders, including public authorities, private individuals, civil society organisations, NGOs and the voluntary sector;\n\n\n(c)promote debate, research and innovation activities and exchange of good practices on the quality of conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage and on contemporary interventions in the historical environment as well as promoting solutions which are accessible for all, including for persons with disabilities;\n\n\n(d)highlight and stimulate the positive contribution of cultural heritage to society and the economy through research and innovation, including an EU level evidence base and through the development of indicators and benchmarks;\n\n\n(e)encourage local development strategies that tap into the potential of heritage, including through the promotion of sustainable cultural tourism;\n\n\n(f)support the development of specialised skills and improve knowledge management and knowledge transfer in the heritage sector, taking into account the implications of the digital shift;\n\n\n(g)promote heritage as a source of inspiration for contemporary creation and innovation, and highlight the potential for cross-fertilisation and stronger interaction between the cultural and creative sectors and communities and the heritage sector;\n\n\n(h)raise awareness of the importance of the European cultural heritage through education and lifelong learning, in particular by targeting young people and local communities;\n\n\n(i)highlight the potential of international cooperation in matters of cultural heritage for developing stronger ties with countries outside the EU, and encourage intercultural dialogue, post-conflict reconciliation and conflict prevention; \n\n\n(j)promote research and innovation on cultural heritage; facilitate the uptake and exploitation of research results by all stakeholders, in particular public authorities and the private sector, and facilitate the dissemination of research results to a broader audience; and\n\n\n(k)encourage synergies between the Union and Member States, including strengthening initiatives to prevent the illegal trafficking of cultural goods.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nContent of measures\n\n\n1. The measures to be taken to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2 shall include the following activities at European, national, regional or local level linked to the objectives of the European Year:\n\n\n\n(a)conferences, events and initiatives to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and value of cultural heritage and to facilitate engagement with citizens and stakeholders;\u00a0\n\n\n(b)information, education and awareness-raising campaigns to convey values such as diversity and intercultural dialogue using evidence from Europe\u2019s rich heritage and to stimulate the general public\u2019s contribution in heritage protection and management and more generally in achieving the objectives of the European Year;\n\n\n(c)sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional and local administrations, and other organisations, to disseminate information about cultural heritage; and\n\n\n(d)undertaking studies and research and innovation activities and the dissemination of their results on European or national scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

on previous experience in other culture-related actions, notably in the framework of the Creative Europe programme, it has been estimated that the average cost of a communication campaign on a EU level is around EUR 300,000, and that of a seminar may vary between EUR 100,000 and EUR 400,000 depending on the scope and number of attendees, so it has been assumed that the average cost of the seminars which will be organised in the framework of the European Year of Heritage may reasonably amount to EUR 250,000\n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative
