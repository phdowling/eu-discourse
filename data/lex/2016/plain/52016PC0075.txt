It covers production processes, utilisation and conservation of resources, environmental improvements and safety at work in sectors related to the coal and steel industry. The Programme is funded by the EU general budget with the revenues generated by the remaining assets of the (expired) ECSC. It is managed by and under the responsibility of the Commission.\n\n\nThe legal basis laying down the management rules of the RFCS was adopted by the Council in 2003\n1\n and has already been revised in 2008\n2\n. It provides for systematic periodical reassessments of the programme\u2019s relevance and of the effectiveness of its management rules (multiannual technical guidelines). \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe legal framework concerning \u2018Horizon 2020\u2019, the European Union programme for research and innovation (2014-2020) and in particular the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in \u2018Horizon 2020\u2019 influence the revision of the multiannual guidelines for RFCS, since the latter is designed to complement the actions undertaken under the Framework Programme H2020 (Article 2 of the legal basis). This complementarity applies at different levels (e.g. research topics, the type of instrument involved in the programmes, and their budgets, etc).\n\n\nThe proposed revision of the RFCS legal basis is focused on the management rules of the RFCS programme (chapter III) and aligns, as much as possible the procedures and concepts used for H2020 to facilitate the participation of same beneficiaries to both programmes (RFCS and H2020). In particular:\n\n\n\uf0b7The different category of actors in a funded project (participant, subcontractor, third party), their eligibility and obligations are defined in accordance with the definitions used in H2020 programme (new Article 29a);\n\n\n\uf0b7The H2020 appointment procedure for independent experts charged with the evaluation of proposals submitted applies for the appointment of independent experts in the RFCS programme (Article 39);\n\n\n\uf0b7The possibility to charge as eligible costs an amount fixed by the Commission as Staff costs for SME\u2019s owners and other natural persons not receiving a salary is authorised (Article 33). \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with Commission\u2019s horizontal rules\n\n\nA clarification on the nature of the experts appointed by the Commission to attend the Advisory Groups and the Technical Groups set up by the legal basis of the RFCS Programme is required to avoid any conflict of interests. The revised provisions are implementing the horizontal rules of the Commission concerning its advisory groups (Communication from the President to the Commission: Framework for Commission Expert Groups Horizontal rules and public register C(2010)7649).\n\n\n\n\nTo this end, the composition and tasks of the Advisory Groups (Articles 21 and 22) and the composition and tasks of the Technical Groups (Article 23) are revised. The competencies of the Advisory Groups are focused on the management rules and procedures, the segregation between Advisory and Technical groups is enhanced and the appointment procedure of their members is clarified.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Justification for the revision\n\n\nThe legal basis of the RFCS provides for two systematic periodical assessments:\n\n\n\uf0b7on the relevance of the programme : \u201cThe Commission shall carry out a monitoring exercise of the Research Programme, including an assessment of the expected benefits. A report on that exercise shall be issued by the end of 2013, and thereafter every seven years\u201d (Article 38 of the Council Decision 2008/376/EC); \n\n\n\uf0b7on the effectiveness of the management rules: \"The multiannual technical guidelines laid down in Chapter III shall be reviewed every seven years, first period ending on 31 December 2014. To this end, and at the latest in the first six months of the last year of each seven-year period, the Commission shall reassess the operation and the effectiveness of the multiannual technical guidelines and, where appropriate, propose any amendment.\u201d(Article 40 of Council Decision 2008/376/EC).\n\n\nOn this basis, the Commission has completed in 2013 a Monitoring and Assessment exercise and has reassessed in 2014 the multiannual technical guidelines laid down in Decision 2008/376/EC.\n\n\nWhile the Monitoring and Assessment exercise confirmed that the RFCS has fulfilled its mandate to support the competitiveness of the coal and steel industry, the assessment of the operation and the effectiveness of the multiannual technical guidelines confirmed that some changes were necessary to ensure a transparent, sound and efficient management of the RFCS and an appropriate level of simplification.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity and choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nUnder the legal basis, only the Commission is entrusted with the management of the RFCS Programme. Amendements to the management rules of the programme can only be made at EU level, through the revision of the legal basis.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe provisions concerning the Advisory Groups and the Technicals Groups have been aligned with the Commission horizontal rules on transparency while maintaining the architecture of the RFCS legal basis (the number of Groups as well as their core competencies are maintained) and ensuring a high level of professional expertise expected by the Commission from these groups (composition of the groups, appointment process).\n\n\n\n3.STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe RFCS stakeholders have been involved on the basis of a draft proposal in several ad-hoc meetings, specific Advisory Group meetings (Coal Advisory Group \u2013 CAG, Steel Advisory Group - SAG) and COSCO meetings (equivalent to the Programme Committee in Horizon 2020). Members of these groups had the opportunity to comment the draft proposal and the Commission services had the opportunity to explain the rationale behind the proposal and in particular the revised rules concerning the appointment of the members of the Advisory and Technical groups which have been detailed afterwards during the Commission\u2019s interservice consultation.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no budgetary implication.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe revision concerns the sole Chapter III of the legal basis (multiannual technical guidelines). The objectives and the scope of the Programme are unchanged. \n\n\nOnly the following Articles require modification: Articles 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 33, 38, 39, 41, 42 and a new Article 29a is inserted. All the orther Articles are unchanged.\n\n\n\nBeyond minor changes or updates, the substantial changes have been explained above : transparency rules for expert groups set up by the Commission (Articles 21, 22, 24), staff costs charged for SME\u2019s owners and other natural persons not receiving a salary (Article 33), and alignment with H2020 rules for the conditions of participation to funded projects for participants, subcontractors and third parties (Article 29a).\n\n\n\n\n2016/0047 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\namending Decision 2008/376/EC on the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and on the multiannual technical guidelines for this programme\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, \n\n\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2003/76/EC of 1 February 2003 establishing the measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel\n3\n, and in particular Article 4(3) thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n4\n, \n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) set out in Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of European Parliament and of the Council\n5\n ('Horizon 2020 Framework Programme') provides an incentive to review Council Decision 2008/376/EC\n6\n in order to ensure that the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel ('RFCS Programme') complements the\u00a0Horizon 2020 Framework Programme in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry.\n\n\n(2)In order to ensure a coherent framework for participation in both the RFCS Programme and Horizon 2020 Framework Programme it is necessary to align certain rules for participation under the RFCS Programme with those applicable under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. \n\n\n(3)It is necessary to revise the rules on the competencies and on the composition of the Advisory Groups and of the Technical Groups, notably as regards the nature of the experts appointed by the Commission to ensure increased transparency as well as compliance and coherence with the framework for Commission expert groups, and contribute, as far as possible, to a balanced representation of relevant areas of expertise and areas of interest as well as to an optimal gender balance. \n\n\n(4)It is appropriate to consider simpler funding rules to ease the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in the RFCS Programme and to permit the use of 'unit costs' to calculate eligible staff costs for SME owners and other natural persons not receiving a salary.\n\n\n(5)The measures necessary for the implementation of Decision 2008/376/EC should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n7\n.\n\n\n(6)Decision 2008/376/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nDecision 2008/376/EC is amended as follows: \n\n\n\n\n(1) Article 21 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u201cArticle 21\n\n\nTasks of the Advisory Groups\n\n\nFor the coal- and steel-related RTD aspects respectively, each Advisory Group shall advise the Commission on the following:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the overall development of the Research Programme, the information package as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0referred to in Article 25(3) and future guidelines;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the consistency and the possible duplication with other RTD programmes at\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Community and national level;
