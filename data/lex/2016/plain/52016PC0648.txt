It will also provide for a system of co-operation, exchange of information and dispute settlement in organic trade.\n\n\nChile will recognise as equivalent all Union's organic products included in the scope of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, namely: unprocessed plant products, live animals or unprocessed animal products (including honey), aquaculture products and seaweeds, processed agricultural products for use as food (including wine), processed agricultural products for use as feed, vegetative propagating material and seeds for cultivation.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Union will recognise as equivalent the following products from Chile: unprocessed plant products, honey, processed agricultural products for use as food (including wine), vegetative propagating material and seeds for cultivation. \n\n\nChilean production rules for animal products other than apiculture as well as feed were not found equivalent and could possibly only be recognised as equivalent at a later stage, once Chile develops its legislation for these products. Although Chile has no rules for organic aquaculture, it has accepted to recognise EU organic aquaculture products and seaweeds. \n\n\nWhile for the Union no conditions on imported ingredients are foreseen, processed agricultural products for use as food that have been processed in Chile must use Chilean organically grown ingredients or ingredients imported to Chile either from the Union or from a third country recognised as equivalent (in accordance with Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EC) No 834/2007) by the Union - but not from third countries for which the EU has only recognised control authorities or bodies (in accordance with Article 33 (3) Regulation (EC) No 834/2007).\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\nThe Commission negotiated this agreement according to Council Decision of 16 June 2014 that authorised the Commission to negotiate agreements between the EU and third countries on trade in organic products and adopted the relevant negotiating directives. \n\n\nTrade policy is within Union's exclusive competence. Consequently, this Agreement is negotiated and signed in accordance with Articles 207 and 218 of the TFEU.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nNot applicable\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNo budgetary implications \n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n2016/0316 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 16 June 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to conclude agreements on trade in organic products. \n\n\n(2)The Commission has negotiated, on behalf of the Union, an agreement with the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products (\u2018the Agreement\u2019). \n\n\n(3)In this Agreement, the Union and the Republic of Chile recognise the equivalence of their rules on organic production and control systems as regards organic products.\n\n\n(4)The Agreement aims at fostering trade in organic products, contributing to the development and expansion of the organic sector in the Union and in the Republic of Chile, achieving a high level of respect of the principles of organic production rules, of guarantee of the control systems and of integrity of organic products. The protection of the respective organic logos should also be improved. The Agreement also aims at enhancing regulatory cooperation between the Parties on issues related to organic production.\n\n\n(5)Therefore, the Agreement should be signed on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date, \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products is hereby approved on behalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of the said Agreement.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement to be signed is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe Council Secretariat-General shall establish the instrument of full powers to sign the Agreement, subject to its conclusion, for the person(s) indicated by the negotiator of the Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on [\u2026].\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The

\u2018Chile\u2019,\n\n\nof the other part,\n\n\ntogether referred to hereinafter as \u2018the Parties\u2019,\n\n\nRECOGNISING their longstanding and strong trade partnership based on the common principles and values reflected in the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part;\n\n\nRESOLVED to contribute to the development and expansion of their organic sectors by creating new export opportunities;\n\n\nDETERMINED to foster trade in organic products and convinced that this Agreement will facilitate trade of organically grown and produced products between the Parties;\n\n\nSEEKING to achieve a high level of respect of the principles of organic production rules, of

reciprocity and transparency in international trade for the benefit of all stakeholders;\n\n\nBEARING in mind that the World Trade Organization Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade encourages World Trade Organization Members to give positive consideration to accepting as equivalent technical regulations of other Members, even if they differ from their own, provided they are satisfied that these regulations adequately fulfil the objectives of their own regulations;\n\n\nNOTING that permanent confidence in the continued reliability of the other Party\u2019s assessment procedures and control system is an essential element of such an acceptance of equivalency;\n\n\nBUILDING on their respective rights and obligations under the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and other multilateral, regional and bilateral agreements and arrangements to which they are a party;\n\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to foster trade in organically produced agricultural products and foodstuffs between the Union and Chile, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply: \n\n\n(1)\u2018Equivalence\u2019 means the capability of different laws and regulations, inspection and certification systems to meet the same objectives.\n\n\n(2)\u2018Competent authority\u2019 means an official agency having jurisdiction on the laws and regulations listed in Annex III or in Annex\u00a0IV, responsible for the implementation of this Agreement.\n\n\n(3)\u2018Control authority\u2019 means the authority of a Member State of the Union to which the relevant authority has

in Annex IV as equivalent to its laws and regulations as listed in Annex III.\n\n\n2.With respect to the products listed in Annex II, Chile recognises the laws and regulations of the Union listed in Annex III as equivalent to its laws and regulations as listed in Annex IV.\n\n\n3.In case of modification, revocation or replacement of, or addition to, the laws and regulations listed in Annex III or in Annex IV, the new rules shall be considered equivalent to the other Party\u2019s rules unless the other Party objects in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph 4.\n\n\n4.If a Party

Party to amend the relevant law, regulation or administrative procedure and practice and provide an adequate time frame, which shall not be less than three months, for ensuring equivalence.
