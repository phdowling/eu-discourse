"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nStrasbourg, 25.10.2016\nCOM(2016) 686 final\n2016/0338(CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\non Double Taxation Dispute Resolution Mechanisms in the European Union\n{SWD(2016) 343 final}{SWD(2016) 344 final}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nFrom the first day of its mandate, this Commission has placed on top of its political agenda job creation, growth and investment. To achieve these overarching priorities the Commission has been, inter alia, pushing an ambitious reform agenda for a deeper and fairer internal market, as an essential foundation for building a stronger and more competitive EU economy.\n\n\nThese objectives translate, as regards taxation, in the need to build a fair and efficient corporate tax system in the EU.\n\n\nTo ensure the fairness of the tax systems, the Commission has made the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning a key priority and has pushed a very active reform agenda. In this context the Commission - in close cooperation with Member States and with the support of the European Parliament - is building a solid defence structure against tax evasion and avoidance in Europe, a robust response system against external threats to Member States' tax bases and a clear path towards fairer taxation for all EU citizens and businesses. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that tax systems are also efficient, so that they could support a stronger and more competitive economy. This should be done by creating a more favourable tax environment for businesses that reduces compliance costs and administrative burdens, and ensure tax certainty. In particular, the importance of tax certaintly in promoting investment and stimulating growth has been recently recognised by G20 leaders and has become the new global focus in the taxation area.\n\n\n\nFighting against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, both at EU and global level, must therefore go hand in hand with creating a competitive tax environment for businesses.  They are the two sides of the same coin. A fair tax system is not only one that ensures that profits are actually taxed where they are generated but also one that ensures that profits are not taxed twice.\n\n\nOne of the main problems that businesses operating across border currently face is double taxation. There are already mechanisms in place that deal with the resolution of double taxation disputes. They are the Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP) which are foreseen in Double Taxation Conventions (DTCs) entered into by Member States as well as in the Union Arbitration Convention\n1\n on the elimination of double taxation on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises. The Commission monitors the number of cases that are dealt with by Member States and the respective results on an annual basis. The analysis shows that there are cases that are prevented from entering existing mechanisms, that are not covered by the scope of the Union Arbitration Convention or DTCs, that get stuck without the taxpayer being informed about the reasons or that are not resolved at all. \n\n\nAlthough the existing mechanisms work well in many cases, there is a need to make them work better regarding access for taxpayers to those mechanisms, coverage, timeliness and conclusiveness. Moreover, the traditional methods of resolving disputes no longer fully fit with the complexity and risks of the current global tax environment.\n\n\nThere is therefore a need to improve existing double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms in the EU with the aim to design a fair and efficient tax system that increases legal certainty. This is a key contribution to the creation of a fair tax system as well as ensuring that the EU internal market remains an attractive area for investment.\n\n\n\nThe proposed directive focusses on business and companies, the main stakeholders affected by double taxation situations. It builds on the existing Union Arbitration Convention, which already provides for a mandatory binding arbitration mechanism, but broadens its scope to areas which are not currently covered and adds targeted enforcement blocks to address the main identified shortcomings, as regards enforcement and effectiveness of this mechanism.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Communication on an Action Plan for a Fair and Efficient Corporate Tax System in the EU, which was adopted on 17 June 2015\n2\n identified five key areas for action. One of these areas related to creating a better tax environment for business in the EU, with a view to foster growth and jobs in the Single Market. The Communication identified the proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which is planned to be adopted on the same day as this proposal, as a major step towards a better tax environment for business but recognised that, in the meantime, other initiatives should enhance the EU's tax environment for business.\n\n\nThis proposal complements the one on CCCTB. Since consolidation is only part of the second phase of the new approach to CCCTB, there would still be a need for effective dispute resolution mechanisms. Moreover, although a fully adopted CCCTB is designed to ensure that profits are taxed where they are generated, not all companies will be within the mandatory scope of the CCCTB. Therefore, it can be expected that even after a number of double taxation disputes will continue to arise, for which appropriate mechanisms need to be in place.\n\n\nFurthermore, this proposal builds on existing policy provisions in the policy area, in particular the Union Arbitration Convention. The proposed Directive aims at broadening the scope and improving procedures and mechanisms in place without replacing them. This is a way to ensure that Member States on the one hand are provided with more detailed procedural provisions for the elimination of double taxation disputes but at the same time are left with sufficient flexibility to agree amongst them on a mechanism of their choice. The situation for the taxpayer is improved in several respects. According to the proposed Directive taxpayers get enhanced rights to enforce \u2013 subject to certain criteria - the setting up of resolution mechanisms, will be better informed about the procedure and can rely on the Member States being forced to achieve binding results.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal falls within the ambit of the Commission\u2019s initiatives for fairer and more effective taxation. It would contribute to the elimination of tax obstacles, which create distortions that impede the proper functioning of the internal market. It would therefore contribute to a deeper and fairer internal market.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nDirect tax legislation falls within the ambit of Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). The clause stipulates that legal measures of approximation under that article shall be in the legal form of a Directive.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\n\nThis proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity. The nature of the subject requires a common initiative across the internal market. The rules of this Directive aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms as they create serious impediments to a well-functioning Internal Market. double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms are by nature bi- or multilateral procedures, requiring coordinated action between the Member States. Member States are inter-dependent when applying the double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms: even if relevant double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms are available, the shortcomings identified such as denials of access or length of the procedure will only be effectively solved if addressed and agreed mutually by the Member States. \n\n\nLegal certainty and predictability at the level of the taxpayer can only be addressed through a common set of rules setting up a clear obligation of result, terms and conditions of the effective elimination of double taxation and ensuring implementation of the double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms decisions consistently throughout the EU. Furthermore, an EU initiative would add value, as compared to the existing national rules or bilateral treaties by offering a coordinated and flexible framework. \n\n\nSuch an approach is therefore in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 TFEU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe envisaged measure does not go beyond what is strictly necessary to achieve its objectives. It builds on the existing mechanisms and adds a limited number of rules to improve them. These rules are tailored to address the shortcomings identified. The Directive refers also to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms and recourse procedures that already exist in other areas. Finally, the Directive ensures the essential degree of coordination within the Union.\n\n\nThe objectives of this proposal can be achieved with minimal costs for businesses and Member States, while avoiding tax and compliance costs for companies as well as unnecessary administrative costs for Member States' tax administrations.\n\n\nIn light of this, the proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives and is therefore compliant with the principle of proportionality.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on a Directive, the instrument available under the legal base of Article 115 TFEU.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultation\n\n\nA public consultation was run from 17 February to 10 May 2016 by the European Commission asking for feedback on the status quo, objectives, possible kinds of action, and the options envisaged. In total 87 submissions were received.\n\n\nThe initiative received general support from business stakeholder groups and from a number of Member States who are primarily concerned about the negative impact of non-action at EU level. Non-governmental organisations, private individuals and other respondents to the consultation did not express a negative position but in contrast underlined the rather positive impact of other initiatives such as the CCCTB.\n\n\nThe vast majority of respondents considered that effective measures should be in place to ensure that double taxation is removed within the EU and that the existing mechanisms are not sufficient as regards the scope of mandatory binding dispute resolution, enforceability and efficiency. They considered that the current situation is detrimental to growth, creates barriers and prevents foreign investors from investing in the EU internal market. Respondents generally confirmed that there was a need for taking action in the EU and that this should build on the existing mechanisms. As regards the objectives, they should ensure the elimination of double taxation, be compatible with international developments and provide a stronger role for the taxpayer.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThe Commission services held a meeting of the European Joint Transfer Pricing Forum (EU JTPF) and the Platform for Tax Good Governance (EU Platform) respectively on 18 February 2016 and on 15 March 2016\n3\n to discuss the subject matter with relevant stakeholders and Member States. A synopsis report on all the consultation activities carried out by the European Commission to support this initiative is available on the web site of the European Commission. The initiative was also further discussed with Member States representatives on 26 July 2016.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe proposal is supported by an impact assessment which was reviewed by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 7 September 2016. The Board issued a positive opinion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on the preferred option identified in the impact assessment, which is to set up a mandatory binding effective dispute resolution mechanism, i.e. a Mutual Agreement Procedure combined with an arbitration phase, with a clear time limit and an obligation of result for all Member States. The proposal applies to all taxpayers that are subject to one of the listed income taxes on business profits.\n\n\nIn terms of economic impact, the proposal will reduce the compliance and litigation burden for companies operating in the EU as regards their cross-border activities. It will also alleviate both external costs and internal administration costs related to the management of such disputes. It will facilitate the investment decisions within the EU by providing more certainty and predictability to investors, as regards the neutralisation of additional costs arising from double taxation. At the level of tax administrations, the proposal should reduce delays and procedure costs but also be a strong incentive to adjust the administration capacity and internal procedures optimally. It will therefore improve efficiency. It should have a positive effect on tax collection in the medium and long term, as it should boost growth and investment in the European Union but also improve confidence of the taxpayers in the tax system overall, thus stimulating voluntary compliance.\n\n\nIn terms of societal benefits, this initiative responds to the increased expectation from the public for a fair and effective tax system. It will ensure consistency in the treatment of double taxation disputes for cross-border transactions at the EU level and provide also for more transparency on how these disputed cases are solved.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect of the right to a fair trial, by giving taxpayers access to their national competent court at the Dispute Resolution stage in case of denial of access or when the Member States fail to establish an Advisory Commission. It also safeguards the freedom to conduct a business.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\nThe impact of the proposal on the EU budget is presented in the financial statement accompanying the proposal and will be met within available resources.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe Commission will monitor the implementation of this Directive in cooperation with Member States. The relevant information will be gathered primarily by Member States. \n\n\nThe current monitoring of the Union Arbitration Convention at the level of the EU JTPF is proposed to be extended to all cases of double taxation disputes in cross-border situations covered by the new legal instrument and gathered on a yearly basis.\u00a0The following information collected will enable the Commission to assess whether the objectives are met: \n\n\n\uf0b7number of initiated/ closed/ pending cases across the EU\n\n\n\uf0b7duration of dispute resolution mechanisms including the reasons for not adhering to the timelines foreseen \n\n\n\uf0b7number of instances where access was denied by a Member State\n\n\n\uf0b7amounts of tax involved in cases (in general and for those who go to arbitration)\n\n\n\uf0b7number of instances of arbitration requested.\n\n\nAs statistical data is already collected and should continue to be collected on a yearly basis, it is expected that the costs of such activity would remain unchanged, for Member States and for the Commission. \n\n\nFive years after the implementation of the instrument, the Commission will evaluate the situation as regards double taxation resolution in cross-border situations for companies in the EU with respect to the objectives and the overall impacts on companies and the internal market. \n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe Directive builds to a large extent on the terms of the Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustments of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC)\n4\n, the Union Arbitration Convention, which is part of the EU acquis. Once implemented the Directive will reinforce mandatory binding dispute resolution in the EU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would broaden the scope of dispute resolution mechanisms to all cross-border situations subject to double income tax imposed on business profits (Article 1). The objective of eliminating double taxation and the specific situations this should cover are restated in the same terms as in the Union Arbitration Convention. The proposed Directive however adds an explicit obligation of result for Member States as well as a clearly defined time-limit. On the other hand, situations which characterise double non-taxation or cases of fraud, wilful default or gross-negligence are excluded (Article 15).\n\n\nIn line with the Union Arbitration Convention the Directive allows for a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP), initiated by the complaint of the taxpayer, under which the Member States shall freely cooperate and reach an agreement on the double taxation dispute within 2 years (Article 4). If the MAP fails, it automatically leads to a dispute resolution procedure with the issuance of a final mandatory binding decision by the competent authorities of the Member States involved.\n\n\nThe diagram below summarises the three key procedural stages, the complaint, the MAP and the dispute resolution procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles 3 to 5 provide formal rules to clarify the conditions under which a complaint shall be  admissible to the MAP, i.e. the time frame for the complaint, the explanation of the double taxation situation by the taxpayer and the provision of the information in order to enable the competent authorities to examine the case and to consider its admissibility. They also strengthen the information provided to the taxpayer and sets obligations for the Member States to send notifications if a case is rejected or considered as not admissible.\n\n\nThe diagrams below summarise the different steps followed at the stage of the complaint and the connection with the two subsequent steps, i.e. the MAP or dispute resolution phase:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles 6 to 7 complement the initial MAP phase with an automatic arbitration procedure which foresees solving the dispute by way of arbitration within a timeline of fifteen months in case Member States failed to reach an agreement during the initial amicable phase. Situations where both Member States do not agree on admissibility of the taxpayer's case to the MAP phase can also be submitted to arbitration at an earlier stage, so as to solve this conflict on admissibility of the case (potential denial of access), provided that the taxpayer requests for it and establishes that it has renounced domestic remedies or that the recourse period for such remedies has expired. Under this supplemental arbitration procedure and according to Article 8 of the Directive, a panel of three to five independent persons (arbitrators) have to be appointed (one or two for each Member State plus one independent chairman), together with two representatives of each Member State. This \u2018Advisory Commission\u2019, issues a final opinion on eliminating the double taxation in the disputed case, which would be binding for Member States, unless they agree on an alternative solution to remove the double taxation (Article 13).\n\n\nA default fast-track enforcement mechanism supervised by the competent national courts of each Member State involved is created in cases where the Advisory Commission is not set up within a certain time limit (Article 7). The taxpayer would have the possibility to refer to the national court in this case, to appoint the independent persons who would then chose the chairman. The independent persons and the chair will be chosen from a pre-established list maintained by the European Commission.\n\n\nThe following diagrams describe the dispute resolution phase as well as the new resolution process set up in case of denial of access at an early stage as a result of only one Member State denying the acceptance or the admissibility of the complaint with the other Member State accepting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis enforcement and default appointment mechanism for the arbitration body is modelled on existing mechanisms in EU Member States according to which national courts appoint arbitrators when parties having entered into an arbitration agreement fail to do\u00a0so. The national competent court which would be designated by the Member States would specifically address the cases corresponding to the shortcomings identified in the impact assessment, i.e. denial of access where Member States do not agree on the admissibility of the double taxation disputes, blocked and prolonged procedure exceeding two years.\n\n\nArticle 8 follows the requirements agreed in the Union Arbitration Convention regarding the setting up of an Advisory Commission and the terms and conditions under which the list of independent persons who can be members of the Advisory Commission is set up and maintained by the European Commission. Article 6 provides for the possibility for the competent authorities of the Member States concerned to agree and set up an alternative form of dispute resolution body, which can solve the case using other dispute resolution techniques, such as mediation, conciliation, expertise or any other appropriate and effective technique.\n\n\nArticle 10 provides a functioning framework for the Advisory Commission, the Rules of Functioning (RoF). These cover substantial aspects such as the description of the case, the definition of the underlying legal basis and questions to be addressed by the Advisory Commission and some key logistical and organisational aspects. These include the timeline, organisation of meetings and hearings, exchange of documents, working language and cost administration. \n\n\nArticle 12 reflects the Union Arbitration Convention and deals with information requirements and procedural aspects of the Advisory Commission. \n\n\nArticles 13 and 14 follow the Union Arbitration Convention as regards the terms and conditions, including the constrained timeline, under which the Advisory Commission should issue its opinion, which should be the reference for the subsequent final and binding decision of the competent authorities. Specific obligations of the Member States regarding costs are provided for in Article 11 and reflect the provisions of the Union Arbitration Convention on these aspects.\n\n\nThe interaction with domestic judicial proceedings and appeals is dealt with in Article 15 in a way similar to the Union Arbitration Convention. It includes provisions on exceptional cases which should not fall within the scope of the procedure (i.e. cases of fraud, wilful default or gross-negligence are excluded).\n\n\nEnhanced transparency is one of the objectives of the proposed Directive. Article 16 includes the provisions of the Union Arbitration Convention in this respect, according to which the competent authorities may publish the final arbitration decision and more detailed information, subject to agreement by the taxpayer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 17 defines the role of the European Commission in the procedure, in particular as regards the maintaining of the list of independent persons according to Article 8(4).\n\n\nArticle 18 provides for the European Commission to adopt the practical arrangements necessary for the proper functioning of the procedures introduced by this Directive, with the assistance of a Committee on double taxation dispute resolution.\n\n\n\nArticle 19 empowers the European Commission to adopt legal acts as defined by Article 20 in order to update Annexes I and II to take account of new circumstances.\n\n\n2016/0338 (CNS)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\n\n\non Double Taxation Dispute Resolution Mechanisms in the European Union\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n5\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n6\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Situations, in which different Member States tax the same income or capital twice can create serious tax obstacles for businesses operating cross border. They create an excessive tax burden for businesses and are likely to cause economic distortions and inefficiencies, as well as to have a negative impact on cross border investment and growth.\n\n\n(2)For this reason, it is necessary that mechanisms available in the Union ensure the resolution of double taxation disputes and the effective elimination of the double taxation at stake.\n\n\n(3)The currently existing mechanisms provided for in bilateral tax treaties do not  achieve the provision of a full relief from double taxation in a timely manner in all cases. The existing Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustments of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC)\n7\n ('the Union Arbitration Convention') has a limited scope as it is only applicable to transfer pricing disputes and attribution of profits to permanent establishments. The monitoring exercise carried out as part of the implementation of the Union Arbitration Convention has revealed some important shortcomings, in particular as regards access to the procedure and the length and the effective conclusion of the procedure.\n\n\n(4)With a view to create a fairer tax environment, rules on transparency need to be enhanced and anti-avoidance measures need to be strengthened. At the same time in the spirit of a fair taxation system, it is necessary to ensure that taxpayers are not taxed twice on the same income and that mechanisms on dispute resolution are comprehensive, effective and sustainable. Improvements to double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms are also necessary to respond to a risk of increased number of double or multiple taxation disputes with potentially high amounts being at stake due to more regular and focused audit practices established by tax administrations.\n\n\n(5)The introduction of an effective and efficient framework for resolution of tax disputes which ensures legal certainty and a business friendly environment for investments is therefore a crucial action in order to achieve a fair and efficient corporate tax system in the Union. The double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms should also create a harmonised and transparent framework for solving double taxation issues and as such provide benefits to all taxpayers. \n\n\n\n\n(6)The elimination of double taxation should be achieved through a procedure under which, as a first step, the case is submitted to the tax authorities of the Member States concerned with a view to settling the dispute by Mutual Agreement Procedure. In the absence of such agreement within a certain time frame, the case should be submitted to an Advisory Commission or Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission, consisting both of representatives of the tax authorities concerned and of independent persons of standing. The tax authorities should take a final binding decision by reference to the opinion of an Advisory Commission or Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission.\n\n\n(7)The improved double taxation dispute resolution mechanism should build on existing systems in the Union including the Union Arbitration Convention. However, the scope of this Directive should be wider than that of the Union Arbitration Convention, which is limited to disputes on transfer pricing and attribution of profits to permanent establishments only. This Directive should apply to all taxpayers that are subject to taxes on income from business profits as regards their cross-border transactions in the Union. In addition, the arbitration phase should be strengthened. In particular, it is necessary to provide for a time limit for the duration of the procedures to resolve double taxation disputes and to establish the terms and conditions of the dispute resolution procedure for the taxpayers.\n\n\n(8)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n8\n.\n\n\n(9)This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for the right to a fair trial and the freedom to conduct a business.\n\n\n(10)Since the objective of this Directive, to establish an effective and efficient procedure to resolve double taxation disputes in the context of the proper functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\n(11)The Commission should review the application of this Directive after a period of five years and Member States should provide the Commission with appropriate input to support this review,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter and scope \n\n\nThis Directive lays down rules on the mechanisms to resolve disputes between Member States on how to eliminate double taxation of income from business and the rights of the taxpayers in this context.\n\n\nThis Directive applies to all taxpayers that are subject to one of the taxes on income from business listed in Annex I, including permanent establishments situated in one or more Member State whose head office is either in a Member State or in a jurisdiction outside the Union.\n\n\nThis Directive does not apply to any income or capital within the scope of a tax exemption or to which a zero tax rate applies under national rules.\n\n\nThis Directive shall not preclude the application of national legislation or provisions of international agreements where it is necessary to prevent tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n1.'competent authority' means the authority of a Member State which has been designated as such by the Member State concerned;\n\n\n2.'competent court' means the court of a Member State which has been designated by the Member State concerned;\n\n\n3.'double taxation' means the imposition of taxes listed in Annex I to this Directive by two (or more) tax jurisdictions in respect of the same taxable income or capital by their national or judicial authorities when it gives rise to either (i) additional tax, (ii) increase in tax liabilities or (iii) cancellation or reduction of losses, which could be used to offset taxable profits;\n\n\n4.'taxpayer' means any person or permanent establishment subject to income taxes listed in Annex I to this Directive.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nComplaint\n\n\n1.Any taxpayer subject to double taxation shall be entitled to submit a complaint requesting the resolution of the double taxation to each of the competent authorities of the Member States concerned within three years from the receipt of the first notification of the action resulting in double taxation, whether or not it uses the remedies available in the national law of any of the Member States concerned. The taxpayer shall indicate in its complaint to each respective competent authority which other Member States are concerned. \n\n\n2.The competent authorities shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint within one month from the receipt of the complaint. They shall also inform the competent authorities of the other Member States concerned on the receipt of the complaint.\n\n\n3.The complaint is admissible if the taxpayer provides the competent authorities of each of the Member States concerned with the following information.\n\n\n(a)name, address, tax identification number and other information necessary for identification of the taxpayer(s) who presented the complaint to the competent authorities and of any other taxpayer directly affected;\n\n\n(b)tax periods concerned;\n\n\n(c)details of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case (including details of structure of the transaction and of the relations between the taxpayer and the other parties to the relevant transactions) and more generally, the nature and date of the actions giving rise to the double taxation as well as the related amounts in the currencies of the Member States concerned, with a copy of any supporting documents;\n\n\n(d)applicable national rules and double taxation treaties;\n\n\n(e)the following information provided by the taxpayer who presented the complaint to the competent authorities with a copy of any supporting documents:\n\n\n(i) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an explanation of why the taxpayer considers that there is double taxation;\n\n\n(ii) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the details of any appeals and litigation initiated by the taxpayers regarding the relevant transactions and any court decisions concerning the case;\n\n\n(iii) a commitment by the taxpayer to respond as completely and quickly as possible to all appropriate requests made by a competent authority and provide any documentation at the request of the competent authorities;\n\n\n(iv) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a copy of tax assessment notices, tax audit report or equivalent leading to alleged double taxation and of any other documents issued by the tax authorities with regard to the disputed double taxation.\n\n\n(f)any specific additional information requested by the competent authorities.\n\n\n4.The competent authorities of the Member States concerned may request the information referred to in point (f) of paragraph 3 within a period of two months from the receipt of the complaint.\n\n\n5.The competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall take a decision on the acceptance and admissibility of the complaint of a taxpayer within six months of the receipt thereof. The competent authorities shall inform the taxpayers and the competent authorities of the other Member States of their decision. \n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nDecision accepting a complaint \u2013 Mutual Agreement Procedure\n\n\n1.Where the competent authorities of the Member States concerned decide to accept the complaint according to Article 3(5), they shall endeavour to eliminate the double taxation by mutual agreement procedure within two years starting from the last notification of one of the Member States\u2019 decision on the acceptance of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\nThe period of two years referred to in the first subparagraph may be extended by up to six months at the request of a competent authority of a Member State concerned, if the requesting competent authority provides justification it in writing. That extension shall be subject to the acceptance by taxpayers and the other competent authorities.\n\n\n2.The double taxation shall be regarded as eliminated in either of the following cases:\n\n\n(a)the income subject to double taxation is included in the computation of the taxable income in one Member State only;\n\n\n(b)the tax chargeable on this income in one Member State is reduced by an amount equal to the tax chargeable on it in any other Member State concerned.\n\n\n3.Once the competent authorities of the Member States have reached an agreement to eliminate the double taxation within the period provided for in paragraph 1, each competent authority of the Member States concerned shall transmit this agreement to the taxpayer as a decision which is binding on the authority and enforceable by the taxpayer, subject to the taxpayer renouncing the right to any domestic remedy.

Upon request by a taxpayer the competent authorities shall not publish information that concerns any trade, business, industrial or professional secret or trade process, or that is contrary to public policy.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall establish standard forms for the communication of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2).\n\n\n5.The competent authorities shall notify the information to be published in accordance with paragraph 3 to the Commission without delay. \n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nRole of the Commission and Administrative support\n\n\n1.The Commission shall make available online and keep up to date the list of the independent persons of standing referred to in Article 8(4), indicating which of those persons can be appointed as chair.

A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force. \n\n\n4.As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. \n\n\n5.A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 19 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council. \n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\nTransposition\n\n\n1.Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2017 at the latest.

Following up on this, one related area for action in the Commission work programme for 2016 is to improve Double Taxation Dispute Resolution Mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\u00a0\n\n\n\nSpecific objective No\n\n\nTo improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the DTDRM system in the Internal Market, with the view to ensuring effective resolution of double taxation disputes (see Impact Assessment prepared by the Commission Sevices as regards the proposal).\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nABB 3\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nAn effective Double Taxation Dispute Resolution Mechanism will overall improve the EU business environment; boost investment, growth and jobs. Indeed, it will ensure more certainty and predictability for the business and companies and will therefore provide a more stable and certain basis for trade and taking investment decisions. \n\n\nThe tax revenues of the Member States will increase in the long term as a result of an increase in economic activity and tax collection. The actual elimination of double taxation through an effective dispute resolution will also increase Member States' level of compliance with their international obligations and reduce their administrative costs.\n\n\nThe trust of the public, citizens and taxpayers in general to the fairness and reliability of the tax systems will be strengthened.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact\u00a0\n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe indicators for monitoring the implementation are detailed in the Impact Assessment (section 7).\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative\u00a0\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo protect the companies in cross border transactions against negative consequences of unresolved double and multiple taxation.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency and avoid mismatches through common rules and procedures in all Member States. Inconsistencies and gaps in the implementation by Member States would endanger the success of the whole project.\n\n\nThe EU added value is grounded in the fact that uniform and coordinated implementation is necessary for effectively improving dispute resolution. It is also necessary to address them consistently in the current context of a global fight against tax avoidance and evasion. The EU Transfer Pricing framework will be improved in terms of efficiency and enforceability when combined with the solution proposed.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready in 1976, the Council had been submitted a proposal for on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of transfer of profit between associated enterprises (arbitration procedure). This has led to the signature in 1990 of the Convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (90/436/EEC).\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe proposal is part of a package that comprises several initiatives. Positive synergy effects may be derived from the interaction between measures within the package and with proposals which feature in the Transparency Package of March 2015 and the Action Plan of June 2015.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2612 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nThe proposal is of legislative nature.
