Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers\n2\n. Given that the implementing acts form part of the common commercial policy, the examination procedure should be used for their adoption. \n\n\nWhere the Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to apply urgent measures necessary to deal with the situation, the Commission should adopt\u00a0such implementing acts immediately. For measures concerning agricultural and fishery products, the Commission, in cases of duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, should adopt such implementing acts immediately. \n\n\nThe Agreement stipulates that certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Kosovo may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management and review of these tariff quotas in order to allow for their thorough assessment.\n\n\nThis Regulation contains implementing measures for the Agreement, and should thus apply from the entry into force of the Agreement, in order to ensure the effective application and management of the tariff quotas granted under the Agreement, as well as to ensure legal certainty and equal treatment with regard to the levying of duties. \n\n\n2016/0218 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo\n3* of the other part\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo\n4\n* of the other part, ('the Agreement') was signed on 27 October 2015.
