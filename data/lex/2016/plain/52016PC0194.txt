The package consisted of three proposals: (1) a Regulation for an Entry/Exit System (EES) for the recording of information on the time and place of entry and exit of third country nationals entering the Schengen area, (2) a Regulation for a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP)  to allow third country nationals who have been pre-vetted to benefit from facilitation of border checks at the Union external border, (3) a Regulation amending  the Schengen Borders Code\n1\n in order to take into account the existence of the EES and RTP.\n2\n\n\n\nDuring the first examination of the package which was completed in February 2014, the co-legislators voiced technical, financial and operational concerns on certain aspects of the design of the systems. However the  preferred policy options proposed in 2013 (i.e. centralised systems based on biometrics) were not questioned. The European Parliament (EP) referred the proposal to its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). It did not issue a legislative resolution on the proposals.\n\n\nIn order to further assess the technical, organisational and financial impacts of the proposed policy options, the Commission initiated, with the support of both co-legislators, a so-called \u2018proof of concept\u2019 exercise consisting of two stages:\n\n\n\uf02dA Commission-led Technical Study on Smart Borders (hereinafter 'The Technical Study') published in October 2014\n3\n, and\n\n\n\uf02dA testing phase led by eu-LISA on the impact of the use of various biometric identifiers on the border control processes (hereinafter 'The Pilot') for which a report was published in November 2015\n4\n.\n\n\nBased on the findings of the Technical Study, the results of The Pilot, the technical discussions with co-legislators and stakeholders as well as a public consultation\n5\n, the Commission prepared a detailed Impact Assessment which is accompanying this proposal. This Impact Assessment builds on the Impact Assessments\n6\n accompanying the 2013 proposals, and focuses on elements of the 2013 proposals where modifications are proposed, notably (a) the architecture of the system, (b) biometrics to be used, (c) the use of process facilitators, (d) the retention of data and (e) access by law enforcement authorities.\n\n\nOn the basis of these extensive preparations, the Commission has considered necessary improvements and simplifications to the 2013 proposals.  The Commission has decided to:\n\n\n\u2013revise its 2013 proposal for a Regulation for the establishment of an Entry/Exit System (EES);\n\n\n\u2013revise its 2013 proposal for Regulation amending the Schengen Borders Code to integrate the technical changes that result from the new proposal for a Regulation establishing an Entry/Exit System (EES). \n\n\n\u2013withdraw its 2013 proposal for a Regulation for a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\uf0b7\u00a0Rationale for the establishment of an EU Entry/Exit System\n\n\nAs explained in the Impact Assessment, the establishment of an EU Entry/Exit System is considered necessary to address the following challenges:\n\n\n1. Addressing Border check delays and improving quality of border checks for third country nationals\n\n\nPassenger flows at the external borders  of the European Union have been growing and will continue to increase in the future. The total number of regular border crossings in 2025 is forecast to rise to 887 million, of which around one-third are expected to be by third country nationals traveling to Schengen countries for a short term visit. While 'minimum checks' are performed on EU citizens and persons enjoying the right of free movement, third country nationals crossing the Schengen area external borders are subject to \u2018thorough checks\u2019 made today manually at borders (both at entry and exit). \n\n\nThe Schengen Borders Code has no provisions on the recording of travellers\u2019 cross border movements into and out of the Schengen area.  As a general rule, third country nationals have the right to enter for a short stay of up to 90 days within any 180 day period. Currently the stamping of the travel document indicating the dates of entry and exit is the sole method available to border guards and immigration authorities to calculate the duration of stay of third country nationals and to verify if someone is overstaying. These stamps can be difficult to interpret: they may be unreadable or the result of counterfeiting. Similarly, it is difficult for consulates having to process visa applications to establish the lawfulness of previous visas on the basis of stamps present in the travel document. As a result, the whole procedure is considered error prone and not always systematically implemented. \n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the EES will ensure:\n\n\n- precise information, rapidly delivered on demand to border guards during border checks, by replacing the current slow and unreliable system of manual stamping of passports; this will allow for both a better monitoring of the authorised stay as well as more efficient border checks;\n\n\n- information to border guards on refusals of entry of third country nationals and will allow for refusals of entry to be checked electronically in the EES; \n\n\n- precise information to travellers on the maximum length of their authorised stay;\n\n\n- possibility for automated border controls for third country nationals under the supervision of the border guards in accordance with the conditions foreseen in Article 8d of the revised proposal to amend the Schengen Borders Code. \n\n\n2. Ensuring systematic and reliable identification of \u2018overstayers\u2019\u00a0\n\n\nIrregular immigrants include both persons who crossed the borders irregularly \u2013 usually not at an official border crossing point - and the so-called \u201coverstayers\u201d: persons having legally entered the EU at an official border crossing point but who stayed after their entitlement to do so expired. The EES addresses this category of irregular migration. As border crossings by third country nationals are currently not registered, it is not possible to establish lists of overstayers. \n\n\nThe introduction of EES will:\n\n\n- provide precise information on who is overstaying their authorised stay, which will support controls within the territory and allow to apprehend irregular migrants more efficiently;\n\n\n- support the identification of irregular migrants; by storing biometrics in the EES on all persons not subject to the visa requirement, and taking into account that the biometrics of visa holders are stored in the VIS, Member States' authorities will be able to identify any undocumented irregular migrant found within the territory that crossed the external border legally; this will in turn facilitate the return process;\n\n\n- allow for an evidence-based approach through the analysis generated by the system. In the case of  visa policy for instance, the EES will provide precise data on whether there is problem with overstayers of a given nationality or not, which would be an important element when deciding whether to impose or lift visa obligations on a third country in question;\n\n\n3. Reinforcing internal security and the fight against terrorism and serious crime.\u00a0\n\n\nCriminal activities such as trafficking in human beings, people smuggling or the smuggling of illicit goods involve numerous border crossings, which are facilitated by the absence of registration of the border crossings of the third country nationals concerned. Likewise, terrorist organisations and radicalised individuals can benefit from the absence of registration of border crossings. Controls of third country nationals at external borders involve identity checks and searches against various databases of known persons or groups posing a threat to public security that should be either apprehended or denied entry to the territory. However, if a third country national destroys his/her official documentation once inside the Schengen area, it can be very difficult for law enforcement authorities to identify that person in case he/she is suspected of a crime or is a victim of crime. \n\n\nThe introduction of EES will:\n\n\n- support the reliable identification of terrorists, criminals as well as of suspects and victims; \n\n\n- provide a record of travel histories of third country nationals including crime suspects. It would thus complement the information available in the Schengen Information System.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Relevant developments since 2013\n\n\nIn preparing this revised proposal, the Commission also took account of relevant developments since 2013, which changed the political, legal and institutional environment compared to 2013, when the original Smart Borders proposals were submitted: \n\n\n\n\n\u2013The Visa Information System became fully operational. Its 'roll-out' to Member States consulates in all relevant third countries was concluded in November 2015. The biometric verification of visa-holders against VIS at Schengen external borders is now compulsory. Law enforcement authorities increasingly use VIS for identification and investigation purposes.\n\n\n\u2013Visa liberalisation dialogues with countries in the Western Balkans and at the Eastern and South-Eastern borders of the EU were concluded or have been accelerated, which will lead to an increasing proportion of visa-exempt travellers to the EU. It is expected that this trend will continue in the coming years.\n\n\n\u2013The Internal Security Fund (ISF-B) was adopted, which earmarked \u20ac 791 million for the development of Smart Borders, to be used after the adoption of the relevant legal basis. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u2013The European Agenda on Migration\n7\n identified \"border management\" as one of the \"four pillars to manage migration better\". Securing external borders and managing them more efficiently implies making better use of the opportunities offered by IT systems and technologies. Furthermore, at the Justice and Home Affairs and European Councils in December 2015, Member States emphasised the need to improve the controls at external borders through the use of new technologies.\n\n\n\u2013Rapid developments in the area of biometric technology opened up new possibilities for 'lighter' and 'faster' enrolment and verification of travellers, not only for fingerprints, but also for facial images.\n\n\n\u2013The Court judgment on the Data Retention Directive provided legal clarity on the conditions and safeguards that need to be respected for the storage and use of EES data. \n\n\n\u2013The December 2015 political agreement of the co-legislators on the reform of EU data protection rules will put in place a modern data protection framework across the EU. The General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Directive will be formally adopted by the European Parliament and Council in the course of 2016.        \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Main elements of the revised smart borders package\n\n\nThe scope of the new Entry Exit System includes border crossings by all third country nationals visiting the Schengen area for a short stay (maximum 90 days period in any period of 180 days), both visa-required and visa-exempt travellers,or eventually, on the basis of a touring visa\n8\n (up to one year). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFamily members of EU citizens enjoying the right of free movement or of third country nationals who enjoy the same rights of free movement equivalent to those of Union citizens and who do not yet have a residence card should be registered in the EES but are not subject to the short stay rule, and checks on this category shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC\n9\n. Such family members in possession of a residence card referred to in Directive 2004/38/EC are excluded from the EES.\n\n\nThe system will collect data and register entry and exit records with the view to both facilitating the border crossing of bona fide travellers,  and better identifying overstayers. The EES will also record refusals of entry of third country nationals falling within its scope.\n\n\nThe main differences between this modified proposal and the 2013 proposals are:\n\n\n- The architecture of the system: only one system is proposed, the Entry Exit System.  The connection of the national border infrastructures to the EES central system will be done through a National Uniform Interface which will be identical for all Member States, and will allow the use of the existing national Entry Exit Systems. However, data from the central system cannot be copied into these existing national EES.\n\n\n- Interoperability is ensured between the EES and VIS in order to achieve more efficiency and rapidity at border checks. To this effect, a connection will be established between the central systems of the EES and the VIS and direct access between them will be regulated for specific purposes. This will reduce the duplication of personal data processing in accordance with the 'privacy by design' principle.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n- Biometric identifiers: while the 2013 EES proposals were relying on ten fingerprints, the revised EES proposals suggests a combination of four fingerprints and the facial image as biometric identifiers introduced from the start of operations of the EES. This choice will allow for sufficiently accurate verifications and identifications, considering the expected size of the EES, while keeping the amount of data to a reasonable level while at the same time speeding up border controls and enabling a wider use of self-service systems at border crossing points. The four fingerprints are used at enrolment to check if the third country national was already registered in the system while the facial image allows for a quick and reliable (automatic) verification at subsequent entry that the individual subject to the border control is the one already registered in the EES.\n\n\n- Personal data protection: there is a significant reduction in the volume of personal data recorded in EES: 26 data items are to be recorded in EES instead of 36. The right of access, rectification and deletion of personal data are clearly defined and safeguarded. The European Data Protection Supervisor and the national data protection authorities will be in charge of supervision for data processing. \n\n\n- Data retention period: The retention time for stored data is five years. The five year data retention period reduces the re-enrolment frequency and will be beneficial for all travellers, while allowing the border guard to perform the necessary risk analysis required by the Schengen Border Code before authorising a traveller to enter the Schengen area. For the border guard the systematic deletion of the EES record after 181 days as proposed in 2013 would have removed any trace of the third country national recent history of entries and exits from the Schengen area which is required for a risk analysis. It would be a regression of useful information compared to what the border guard currently uses: consulting stamps in a travel document gives in many cases information that stretches a period of several years. A longer data retention period is thus necessary to allow the border guard performing the necessary risk analysis requested by the Schengen Border Code before authorising a traveller entering the Schengen area. The processing of visa application in consular posts requires also analysing the travel history of the applicant to assess the use of previous visas and the respect of the conditions of stay. The abandoning of passport stamping will be compensated by a consultation of the EES. The travel history available in the system should therefore cover a period of time which is sufficient for the purpose of visa issuance.\n\n\nThe longer data retention period will reduce the re-enrolment frequency and will be beneficial for all travellers as the average border crossing time will decrease as will do the waiting time at border crossing points. Even for a traveller entering only once in the Schengen area, the fact that other travellers being already registered in the EES will not have to re-enrol will reduce the waiting time at border.\n\n\n\n\nA longer data retention period will also be necessary to allow for facilitation at border crossing by using process accelerators and self-service systems. Facilitation is dependent of the data registered in the system. A short data retention period would reduce the group of travellers that can benefit of such facilitation and thereby undermine the stated objective of EES to facilitate border crossing.\n\n\nFor non EU family members of EU citizens who fall within the scope of the present Regulation, each entry/exit record shall be kept for a maximum period of one year after the last exit. Their individual file should be kept for five years so as to enable the family member to benefit of the facilitation for border crossing.\n\n\nFor overstayers not yet found at the end of the data retention period, following a national decision, an alert based on the EES data can be created in the Schengen Information System, based upon a national decision, before deletion of the EES data.\n\n\n- The facilitation of border crossings: the approach for facilitation is based on the implementation of self-service systems and e-gates, which will allow third country nationals to initiate the procedure for border clearance, to be completed by providing additional information to the border guard on request. The use of these accelerators (introduced in the proposal amending the Schengen Borders Code) is optional for Member States, open to most of the travellers and does not require the development of any new system. \n\n\n- In addition there will be a harmonised legal basis (again introduced in the amendments to the Schengen Borders Code) for the establishment of national Registered Travellers Programmes by Member States, on a voluntary basis.   \n\n\n- Law enforcement access: from the start of operations, Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol will have access to the EES, under strictly defined conditions. The EES will contain reliable data on entry and exit dates of third country nationals falling within the scope of the EES that can be of decisive importance in individual law enforcement files, to which access should be given in accordance with the purpose of the instrument and with respect for data protection rules.  \n\n\nThe access to VIS data for law enforcement purpose has already proven its usefulness. Member States have reported cases of people who died violently and whose identification was only possible through accessing the VIS. Other cases reported are related to human being trafficking, terrorism or drug trafficking for which the access to VIS data allowed the investigators to make substantial progress.\n\n\n- The costs: in the 2013 proposals, 1,1 billion EUR was set aside as an indicative amount for the development of an EES and an RTP. For the revised proposal, based on the preferred option of a single EES system including the law enforcement access, the amount needed has been estimated at EUR 480 million. \n\n\nThis revised proposal for a Regulation establishing an EES constitutes the core instrument for the legal framework of the EES. It also contains consequential amendments to existing EU legislation (i.e. to Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011\n10\n, to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008\n11\n and to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement).\u00a0This complementary proposal to amend the Schengen Borders Code as regards the use of the system as part of the border management process is presented in parallel with this proposal.\n\n\n\uf0b7\u00a0Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\n\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code).\n\n\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No 1931/2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention.\n\n\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No 767/2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation).\n\n\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas.\n\n\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 establishing as part of the Internal Security Fund, the Instrument for financial support for external borders and visa and repealing Decision No 574/2007/EC.\n\n\n2.CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\uf0b7Consultation of interested parties\n\n\nA detailed description of stakeholder consultation is  included in the accompanying impact assessment in Annex 2. During 2015 the Commission carried out targeted consultations for the preparation of its revised Smart Borders proposals with the EDPS in a workshop on the preparation of the revised Smart Borders proposals of 20 March 2015, with civil society in a meeting of 5 May 2015, with carriers, transport, tourism and infrastructure operators in a meeting of 28 May 2015 and with the Fundamental Rights Agency in two meetings of 22 June and 23 July 2015. In addition, the Commission organised a meeting with law enforcement practitioners of the Member States on 9 July 2015 and two technical meetings with Member States\u2019 experts on 24 September 2015 and on 26 October 2015\n\n\nA public consultation, that took place from the 29 July to the 29 October 2015, collected the views of individuals, organisations, carriers and public authorities (the results of the public consultation are explained in detail in Annex 2 of the Impact Assessment). \n\n\n\n\nThe LIBE Committee of the European Parliament organised an inter-parliamentary committee with national parliaments on Smart Borders on 23-24 February 2015.\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nA first impact assessment\n12\n was carried out in 2008 when preparing the Commission Communication on this subject and a second one was finalised in 2012\n13\n in preparation of the 2013 proposals. \n\n\nThe third Impact Assessment was finalised in 2016. Taking into account the Technical Study, the report on the Pilot Project, the result of the consultation of interested parties  and the discussions in the Council and the European Parliament, the impact assessment analysed key implementation options and suboptions for both the EES and the RTP. The preferred options resulting from the Impact Assessment are directly reflected in the main changes included in the current proposal as compared to the 2013 proposals (See point I \"Main elements of the revised proposal\")\n\n\nThe Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB) reviewed the draft impact assessment and delivered its positive opinion on 22 January 2016\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Summary of the proposed actions\n\n\nThe purposes, functionalities and responsibilities for the EES must be defined. Furthermore, a mandate needs to be given to the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA)  to develop and operationally manage the system. A detailed explanation of the present revised proposal by article can be found in a separate Commission Staff Working Paper.\n\n\nConsequential amendments to this proposal need to be adopted to Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011, Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and the (Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement) as referred to under point 1.  \n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe present revised proposal uses Article 77(2)(b) and (d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  as the legal basis for this Regulation. Article 77(2)(b) and (d) is the appropriate legal basis for further specifying the measures on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States and developing standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at such borders. Article 77(2)(b) and (d) is the legal basis of the establishment of the EES. In addition, the revised proposal relies on Article 87(2)(a) as a legal basis to allow access for law enforcement purposes and Article 88(2)(a) to allow access by Europol, both under strict conditions Both these additional legal bases for the law enforcement and Europol access to EES data command the same ordinary legislative procedure which is applicable under Article 77(2)(b) and (d).\n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nUnder Article 77(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has the power to adopt measures relating to the checks on persons and efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders of the Member States. The current EU provisions on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States need to be modified to take into account that there are currently no reliable means to monitor the travel movements of third country nationals admitted for a short stay given the complexity and slowness of the current stamping obligation, which is insufficient for allowing Members States' authorities to assess the authorised stay at the border check of the traveller or at checks within the territory and the very limited value of national systems for such purposes in an area without internal border control.\n\n\nThe information on who has been refused entry into EU territory, on who is on EU territory and who complies with the maximum allowed short stay of 90 days within 180 days, on nationalities and groups (visa exempt/required) of travellers overstaying and to support random checks within the territory to detect irregularly staying persons should be available to\u00a0increase the efficiency of migration management.\n\n\nA common regime is needed in order to establish harmonised rules on the records of refusals of entry, cross border movements and monitoring of authorised short stays for the Schengen area as a whole.\n\n\nTherefore, this objective of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. \n\n\nA revision of the 2013 EES proposal is also required in order to allow law enforcement access to data in the EES for the purpose of the fight against terrorism and serious crime and ensure a high level of internal security. This objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, since such an amendment can only be proposed by the Commission. \n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality principle\n\n\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European Union states that action by the Union shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. The form chosen for this EU action must enable the proposal to achieve its objective and be implemented as effectively as possible. The proposed initiative constitutes a further development of the Schengen acquis in order to ensure that common rules at external borders are applied in the same way in all the Member States which have abolished controls at internal borders. It creates an instrument providing to the European Union information on how many third country nationals enter and leave the territory of the EU, which is indispensible for sustainable and evidence based policy making in the field of migration and visa. It also grants access to the EES to law enforcement authorities, which is a timely, accurate, secure and cost-efficient way to identify visa exempt nationals who are suspects (or victims) of terrorism or of a serious crime and to enable them to consult the travel history of both visa holder and visa exempt third country nationals who are suspects (or victims) of such crimes.\n\n\nThe proposal which conception is driven by the privacy by design principles is proportionate in terms of the right to protection of personal data in that it does not require the collection and storage of more data for a longer period than is absolutely necessary to allow the system to function and meet its objectives. In addition, all the safeguards and mechanisms required for the effective protection of the fundamental rights of travellers particularly the protection of their private life and personal data will be foreseen and implemented.\n\n\n\n\nNo further processes or harmonisation will be necessary at EU level to make the system work; thus the envisaged measure is proportionate in that it does not go beyond what is necessary in terms of action at EU level to meet the defined objectives.\n\n\nThe preferred option is also proportionate in terms of costs, taking into account the benefits the system will provide to all Member States in managing the common external border and progressing towards a common EU migration policy.\n\n\nThe proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of instrument \n\n\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\n\n\nOther means would not be adequate for the following reason(s):\n\n\nThe present proposal will set up a centralised system through which Member States cooperate with each other, something which requires a common architecture and operating rules. Moreover it will\u00a0lay down rules on border checks at the external borders and on access to the system including for the purpose of law enforcement which are uniform for all Member States. As a consequence, only a Regulation can be chosen as a legal instrument.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation has an impact on fundamental rights, notably on right to dignity (Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU); the prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 5 of the Charter); right to liberty and security (Article 6 of the Charter), respect for private and family life (Article 7 of the Charter), the protection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter), right to asylum (Article 18 of the Charter) and protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition (Article 19 of the Charter), the right to non-discrimination (Article 21 of the Charter), the rights of the child (Article 24 of the Charter) and the right to an effective remedy (Article 47 of the Charter).\n\n\nThe prohibition of slavery and forced labour as well as the right to liberty and security are positively affected by the implementation of an EES. A better and more accurate identification (through the use of biometrics) of third country national crossing the external border of the Schengen area supports the detection of identity fraud, human being trafficking (particularly in the case of minors) and cross border criminality and thus contributes to improving the security of the citizens present in the Schengen area.\n\n\nConcerning the right to protection of personal data, the proposal contains safeguards as regards personal data, in particular access thereto, which should be strictly limited only to the purpose of this Regulation and to the therein designated competent authorities. Safeguards as regards personal data also include the right of access to or the right of correction or deletion of data. The limitation of the retention period of data referred to above in chapter 1 of this explanatory memorandum also contributes to the respect for personal data as a fundamental right.\n\n\nThe proposal provides for access to the EES for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences for the purposes of identification of third country nationals crossing the external borders and for the purpose of accessing data on their travel history. As stipulated by Article 52(1) of the Charter, any limitation to the right to the protection of personal data must be appropriate for attaining the objective pursued and not going beyond what is necessary to achieve it. Article 8(2) of the European Convention of Human Rights also recognises that interference by a public authority with a person\u2019s right to privacy may be justified as necessary in the interest of national security, public safety or the prevention of crime, as it is the case in the current proposal. The ECJ has also recognised\n14\n that the fight against terrorism and serious crime, in particular against organised crime and terrorism, is indeed of the utmost importance in order to ensure public security and its effectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques and hence, access to personal data granted for those specific purposes could be justified if considered necessary. \n\n\nThe proposal provides for access to the EES for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences for the purposes of identification of third country nationals crossing the external borders and for the purpose of accessing data on their travel history. Access to the EES for identification purposes should only be possible where a prior search has been conducted in national databases without success and, in the case of searches with fingerprints where a prior search has been conducted in the automated fingerprint verification system under Decision 2008/615/JHA. Although data exist in the VIS on visa holders, neither data on visa exempt nationals or data on travel movements are available in any other EU database.\n\n\nAccess to EES data for law enforcement purposes may only be granted for the prevention, detection or investigation of criminal offences or other serious criminal offences as defined in Council Framework Decisions 2002/475/JHA on combatting terrorism and 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and only if it is necessary for a specific case. Moreover, designated law enforcement authorities may only request access to EES data if there are reasonable grounds to consider that such access will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of the criminal offence in question. Such request are verified by a designated law enforcement authority in order to check whether the strict conditions for requesting access to the EES for law enforcement purposes are fulfilled. \n\n\nFurthermore, the proposal also lays down strict data security measures to ensure the security of personal data processed and establishes supervision of the processing activities by independent public data protection authorities and documentation of all searches conducted. The proposal also states that the processing of all personal data carried out by law enforcement authorities on the EES once they have been extracted is subject to Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. \n\n\nThe proposal establishes strict access rules to the EES system and the necessary safeguards. It also foresees the individuals' rights of access, correction, deletion and redress in particular the right to a judicial remedy and the supervision of processing operations by public independent authorities,. Therefore, the proposal fully complies with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular as regards the right to the protection of personal data, and is also in line with Article 16 TFEU which guarantees everyone the right to protection of personal data concerning them. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nIn the 2013 EES proposal, reference was made to the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF) which included a proposal of 4,6 billion EUR for the Internal security Fund (ISF) for the period 2014-2020. In the 2013 EES proposal, 1,1 billion EUR was set aside as an indicative amount for the development of an EES and an RTP assuming development costs would start from 2015. This amount was calculated on the basis of the development and operational management of two separate systems and on 3 years of development and 4 years of operations.\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 establishing as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa and repealing Decision No 574/2000/EC (ISF Borders Regulation) provided in Article 5.5b) that EUR 791 million should be allocated for developing IT systems, based on existing and/or new IT systems, supporting the management of migration flows across the external borders. The amount of EUR 791 million corresponded to 3 years of development (2017-2019 inclusive) with already some preparatory activities in 2016 with operations starting in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the technical study and the Impact Assessment, the current proposal is based on the preferred option of a single EES system and the amount needed has been assessed as EUR 480 million which takes also into account the purpose of law enforcement access. Consequently, a proposal for the amendment of the ISF Borders Regulation is included in the present proposal to align it to the new reduced amount. \n\n\nThis financial support would cover not only the costs of central components for the entire MFF period (EUR 288 million \u2013 at EU level, both development and operational cost via indirect management) but also the costs for the integration of the existing national border infrastructures in Member States with the EES via the National Uniform Interfaces (NUI) (EUR 120 million - via direct management). Providing financial support for national integration costs would ensure that difficult economic circumstances at national level do not jeopardise or delay the projects. During the development phase (2017-2019) the Commission will spend a total amount of 52,7 mio \u20ac (via direct management) for the expenses related to the operations in the Member States. \n\n\nOnce the new system would be operational, future operational costs in the Member States could be supported by their national programmes in the framework of the ISF (shared management). An amount of EUR 20 million has been earmarked for this purpose within the overall envelope of EUR 480 million. This will include operational support for one year. \n\n\nThe cost model applied is explained in Annex 6 - Cost Model for EES System of the Impact Assessment. \n\n\n5.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n\n\uf0b7Participation\n\n\nThis proposal builds upon the Schengen acquis in that it concerns the crossing of external borders. Therefore the following consequences in relation to the various protocols and agreements with associated countries have to be considered:\n\n\nDenmark: In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (no 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures pursuant to Title V of part Three of the TFEU. \n\n\nGiven that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland: In accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union and Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part in Regulation (EU) 2016/399 (Schengen Borders Code) nor in any other of the legal instruments which are commonly known as the \"Schengen acquis\", viz. the legal instruments organising and supporting the abolition of controls at internal borders and the flanking measures regarding the controls at external borders.\n\n\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of this acquis, and therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\nIn line with the judgment of the Court of Justice in case C-482/08, United Kingdom v. Council, ECLI:EU:C:2010:631, the circumstance that this Regulation has Articles 87(2)a) and Article 88(2)a) as legal bases alongside Article\u00a077(2)b) and (d) TFEU does not affect the above conclusion, as the access for law enforcement purposes is ancillary to the establishment of the Entry/Exit System.\n\n\nIceland and Norway: The procedures laid down in the Association Agreement concluded by the Council and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis are applicable, since the present proposal builds on the Schengen acquis as defined in Annex A of this Agreement\n15\n.\n\n\nSwitzerland: This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n16\n.\n\n\nLiechtenstein: This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n17\n.\n\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romenia: This Regulation establishing the EES replaces the obligation to stamp the passport of third country nationals. This provision was  to be applied by the acceding Member States upon accession to the European Union.\n\n\n2016/0106 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nestablishing an Entry/Exit System (EES) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third country nationals crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes   and \n\n\namending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular, Article 77(2)(b) and (d), Article 87(2)(a) and Article 88(2)(a) thereof , \n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n18\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n19\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, \n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Communication of the Commission of 13 February 2008 entitled 'preparing the next steps in border management in the European Union'\n20\n outlined the need, as part of the European integrated border management strategy, to establish an Entry/Exit System (EES) which registers electronically the time and place of entry and exit of third country nationals admitted for a short stay to the Schengen area and which calculates the duration of their authorised stay.\n\n\n(2)The European Council of 19 and 20 June 2008 underlined the importance of continuing to work on the development of the EU's integrated border management strategy, including better use of modern technologies to improve the management of external borders.\n\n\n(3)The Communication of the Commission of 10 June 2009, entitled 'An area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizens', advocates establishing an electronic system for recording entry to and exit from Member\u00a0States' territory\u00a0via the crossing of external borders to ensure more effective management of access to this territory.\n\n\n(4)The European Council of 23 and 24 of June 2011 called for work on \"smart borders\" to be pushed forward rapidly. The Commission published a Communication \"Smart borders \u2013 options and the way ahead\" on 25 October 2011.\n\n\n(5)The European Council in its Strategic guidelines adopted in June 2014 stressed that \u201cthe Schengen area, allowing people to travel without internal border controls, and the increasing numbers of people travelling to the EU require efficient management of the EU\u2019s common external borders to ensure strong protection. The Union must mobilise all the tools at its disposal to support the Member States in their task. To this end: integrated Border Management of external borders should be modernised in a cost efficient way to ensure smart border management inter alia with an entry-exit system and supported by the new agency for large-scale IT systems (eu-LISA)\".\n\n\n(6)The Communication of the Commission of 13 May 2015 entitled \u201cA European agenda on migration\u201d noted that \"a new phase would come with the \u201cSmart Borders\u201d initiative to increase the efficiency of border crossings, facilitating crossings for the large majority of \u2018bona fide\u2019 third country travellers, whilst at the same time strengthening the fight against irregular migration  by creating a record of all cross-border movements by third country nationals, fully respecting proportionality\". \n\n\n(7)It is necessary to specify the objectives of the Entry/Exit System (EES) and its technical architecture, to lay down rules concerning its operation and use and to define responsibilities for the system, the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which the data are to be entered, the criteria for their entry, the authorities authorised to access the data and further rules on data processing and the protection of personal data.\n\n\n(8)The EES should apply to third country nationals admitted for a short stay to the Schengen area. It should also apply to third country nationals whose entry for a short stay has been refused.\n\n\n(9)The EES should have the objective of improving the management of external borders, preventing irregular immigration and facilitating the management of migration flows. The EES should, in particular and when relevant, contribute to the identification of any person who does not or no longer fulfils the conditions of duration of stay within the territory of the Member States. \n\n\n(10)To meet those objectives, the EES should process alphanumeric data and biometric data (fingerprints and facial image). The use of biometrics, despite its impact on the privacy of travellers, is justified for two reasons. Firstly, biometrics are a reliable method to identify third country nationals within the territory of the Member States not in possession of travel documents or any other means of identification, a common modus operandi of irregular migrants. Secondly, biometrics provide for the more reliable matching of entry and exit data of legal travellers. Where facial images are used in combination with fingerprint data, it allows for the reduction of fingerprints registered while enabling the same result in terms of accuracy of the identification. \n\n\n(11)Four fingerprints of visa exempt third country nationals should be enrolled in the EES, if physically possible, to allow for accurate verification and identification (ensuring that the third country national is not already enrolled under another identity or with another travel document) and to guarantee that sufficient data is available in every circumstance. The check of the fingerprints of visa holders will be done against the Visa Information System. (VIS) established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC\n21\n. The facial image of both visa exempt and visa holding third country nationals should be registered in the EES and it should be used as the main biometric identifier for verifying the identity of third country nationals who have been previously registered in the EES and for as long as their individual file has not been deleted. Alternatively, that verification should be performed using fingerprints. \n\n\n(12)The EES should consist of a Central System, which will operate a computerised central database of biometric and alphanumeric data, a National Uniform Interface in each Member State, a Secure Communication Channel between the EES Central System and the VIS Central System and the Communication Infrastructure between the Central System and the National Uniform Interfaces. Each Member State should connect its national border infrastructures to the National Uniform Interface. \n\n\n\n\n(13)Interoperability should be established between the EES and the VIS by way of a direct communication channel between the Central Systems to enable the border authorities using the EES to consult the VIS in order to retrieve visa-related data to create or update the individual file; to enable the border authorities to verify the validity of the visa and the identity of a visa holder by means of fingerprints directly against the VIS at the external borders and to enable the border authorities to verify the identity of visa exempt third country nationals against the VIS with fingerprints. Interoperability should also enable the border authorities using the VIS to directly consult the EES from the VIS for the purposes of examining visa applications and decisions relating to those applications and enable visa authorities to update the visa-related data in the EES in the event that a visa is annulled, revoked or extended. Regulation (EC) No 767/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n should be amended accordingly. \n\n\n(14)This Regulation should define the authorities of the Member States which may  be authorised to have access to the EES to enter, amend, delete or consult data for the specific purposes of the EES and to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks. \n\n\n(15)Any processing of EES data should be proportionate to the objectives pursued and necessary for the performance of tasks of the competent authorities. When using the EES, the competent authorities should ensure that the human dignity and integrity of the person, whose data are requested, are respected and should not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.\n\n\n(16)In the fight against terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences, it is imperative that law enforcement authorities have the most up-to-date information if they are to perform their tasks. Access to VIS data for law enforcement purpose has already proven its usefulness in identifying people who died violently or for helping investigators to make substantial progress in cases related to human being trafficking, terrorism or drug trafficking. Access to the information contained in the EES is necessary to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences as referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA\n23\n or other serious criminal offences as referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA\n24\n. The data generated by the EES may be used as an identity verification tool both in cases where the third country national has destroyed his/her documents and where law enforcement authorities are investigating a crime through the use of fingerprints or facial image and wish to establish an identity. It may also be used as a criminal intelligence tool to construct evidence by tracking the travel routes of a person suspected of having committed a crime or a victim of crime. Therefore, the data in the EES should be available, to the designated authorities of the Member States and the European Police Office ('Europol'), subject to the conditions set out in this Regulation. \n\n\n(17)Moreover, Europol plays a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States\u2019 authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation. Consequently, Europol should also have access to the EES within the framework of its tasks and in accordance with Council Decision 2009/371/JHA.\n25\n\n\n\n(18)Access to the EES for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights to respect for the private life of individuals and to protection of personal data of persons whose personal data are processed in the EES.  Any such interference must be in accordance with the law, which must be formulated with sufficient precision to allow individuals to adjust their conduct and it must protect individuals against arbitrariness and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. Any interference must be necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate and proportionate interest and proportionate to the legitimate objective to achieve.\n\n\n(19)Comparisons of data on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the dactyloscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene, is fundamental in the field of police cooperation. The possibility to compare a latent fingerprint with the fingerprint data which is stored in the EES in cases where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the perpetrator or victim may be registered in the EES should  provide the law enforcement authorities of the Member States with a very valuable tool in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, when for example the only evidence at a crime scene are latent fingerprints. \n\n\n(20)It is necessary to designate the competent authorities of the Member States as well as the central access point through which the requests for access to EES data are made and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request such access for the specific purposes for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.\n\n\n(21)Requests for access to data stored in the Central System should be made by the operating units within the designated authorities to the central access point and should be justified. The operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request access to  EES data should not act as a verifying authority. The central access points should act independently of the designated authorities and should be responsible for ensuring, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access as established in this Regulation. In exceptional cases of urgency, where early access is necessary to respond to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, the central access point should  be able to process the request immediately and only carry out the verification afterwards. \n\n\n(22)To protect personal data and to exclude systematic searches, the processing of EES data should only take place in specific cases and when it is necessary for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. The designated authorities and Europol should only request access to the EES when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such access will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence. \n\n\n(23)In addition, access to the EES for identification of unknown suspects, perpetrators or victims  of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences should be allowed only on the condition that searches with the national fingerprint databases of the Member State and with the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA\n26\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject Furthermore, access to the EES to consult the entry/exit records of a known person should be duly justified.\u00a0\n\n\n(24)For the purpose of efficient comparison and exchange of personal data, Member States should fully implement and make use of the existing international agreements as well as of Union law concerning the exchange of personal data already in force, in particular of Decision 2008/615/JHA.\n\n\n(25)The personal data stored in the EES should be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the EES. It is appropriate to keep the data related to third country nationals for  a period of five years for border management purposes in order to avoid the need for third country nationals to re-enrol in the EES before that period has lapsed. For third country nationals who are family members of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC\n27\n applies or of a national of a third country enjoying the right of free movement under Union law and who do not hold a residence card referred to under Directive 2004/38/EC, it is appropriate to store each coupled entry/ exit reccord for a maximum period of one year after the last exit. \n\n\n(26)A five year data retention period is necessary to allow the border guard performing the necessary risk analysis requested by the Schengen Borders Code before authorising a traveller entering the Schengen area. The processing of visa application in consular posts requires also analysing the travel history of the applicant to assess the use of previous visas and the respect of the conditions of stay. The abandoning of passport stamping will be compensated by a consultation of the EES. The travel history available in the system should therefore cover a period of time which is sufficient for the purpose of visa issuance. The five year data retention period will reduce the re-enrolment frequency and will be beneficial for all travellers as the average border crossing time will decrease as will do the waiting time at border crossing points. Even for a traveller entering only once in the Schengen area, the fact that other travellers being already registered in the EES will not have to re-enrol will reduce the waiting time at border. This data retention period will also be necessary to allow for facilitation for the border crossing by using process accelerators and self-service systems. Such facilitation is dependent of the data registered in the system. A shorter data retention period would have a negative impact on the duration of border controls. A shorter data retention period would also reduce the group of travellers that can benefit of such facilitation and thereby undermine the stated objective of EES to facilitate border crossing.\n\n\n(27)The same retention period of five years would be necessary for data on persons who have not exited the territory of the Member States within the authorised period of stay in order to support the identification and return process and for persons whose entry for a short stay {or on the basis of a touring visa} has been refused. The data should be deleted after the period of five years, unless there are grounds to delete it earlier.\n\n\n(28)Precise rules should be laid down as regards the responsibilities for the development and operation of the EES and the responsibilities of the Member States for the connection to the EES. The Agency for the operational management of large-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, established by Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n28\n, should be responsible for the development and operational management of a centralised EES in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 should be amended accordingly. \n\n\n(29)Rules on the liability of the Member States in respect to damage arising from any breach of this Regulation should be laid down. \n\n\n(30)Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n29\n applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application of this Regulation unless such processing is carried out by the designated or verifying authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences. \n\n\n(31)The processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences pursuant to this Regulation should be subject to a standard of protection of personal data under their national law which complies with Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA\n30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n(32)Personal data obtained by Member States pursuant to this Regulation should not be transferred or made available to a third country, an international organisation or any private party established in or outside the Union except if necessary in individual cases in order to assist the identification of a third country national in relation to his/her return and subject to strict conditions. \n\n\n\n\n(33)Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council\n31\n applies to the activities of the Union institutions or bodies when carrying out their tasks as responsible for the operational management of EES. \n\n\n(34)The independent supervisory authorities established in accordance with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst the European Data Protection Supervisor as established by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should monitor the activities of the Union institutions and bodies in relation to the processing of personal data. The European Data Protection Supervisor and the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other in the monitoring of the EES.\n\n\n(35)National supervisory authorities established in accordance with Article 25 of Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes by the Member States, and the national supervisory authorities established in accordance with Article 33 of Decision 2009/371/JHA should monitor the lawfulness of data processing activities performed by Europol. \n\n\n(36)\"(...) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on \u2026 \n\n\n(37)The proposal establishes strict access rules to the EES system and the necessary safeguards. It also sets out the individuals' rights of access, correction, deletion and redress, in particular the right to a judicial remedy and the supervision of processing operations by public independent authorities. This Regulation therefore respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to dignity (Article 1 of the Charter); the prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 5 of the Charter); the right to liberty and security (Article 6 of the Charter), respect for private and family life (Article 7 of the Charter), the protection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter), the right to non-discrimination (Article 21 of the Charter), the rights of the child (Article 24 of the Charter), the rights of elderly (Article 25 of the Charter ), the rights of persons with disabilities (article 26 of the Charter) and\u00a0the right to an effective remedy (Article 47 of the Charter).  \n\n\n(38)The effective monitoring of the application of this Regulation requires evaluation at regular intervals. The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented.\n\n\n(39)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n32\n.\n\n\n(40)The establishment of a common EES and the creation of common obligations, conditions and procedures for use of data cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Union level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, the Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n\n\n(41)Following the entry into operation of the Entry/Exit System, Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement should be amended as it is incompatible with Article 77(2)(a) and (c) of the Treaty on Functioning of the European Union due to the fact that the common policy on visas cannot be based on the existence or non-existence of bilateral visa waiver agreements concluded by Member States and the authorised length of stay of third country nationals should not depend on the number and content of such bilateral agreements. Furthermore the Entry/Exit system could not take into account of and calculate the authorised length of stay of visa free third country nationals benefitting from such agreements and they should be eliminated.\n\n\n(42)The projected costs of the EES are lower than the budget earmarked for Smart Borders in Regulation (EU) 515/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council\n33\n. Accordingly, following the adoption of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 5(5)(b) of Regulation (EU) 515/2014, the Commission should, by means of a delegated act, re-allocate the amount currently attributed for developing IT systems supporting the management of migration flows across the external borders.\n\n\n(43)This Regulation establishing the EES replaces the obligation to stamp passports of third country nationals which is applicable by all acceding Member States. Stays in Member States which are not yet fully applying the Schengen acquis in accordance with their respective Acts of Accession should not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of the authorised stay in the Schengen area.

For third country nationals exempt from the visa obligation, Articles 14(2) to 14(4) shall apply.\n\n\n2.Children under the age of 12 shall be exempt from the requirement to give fingerprints for legal reasons.\n\n\n3.Persons for whom fingerprinting is physically impossible shall be exempt from the requirement to give fingerprints for factual reasons.\n\n\nHowever, where the physical impossibility is of a temporary nature, the person shall be required to give the fingerprints at the subsequent entry. The border authorities shall be entitled to request further clarification on the grounds for the temporary impossibility to provide fingerprints.\n\n\n\n\nMember States shall ensure that appropriate procedures guaranteeing the dignity of the person are in place in the event of difficulties encountered in capturing fingerprints.\n\n\n4.Where the person concerned is exempt from the requirement to give fingerprints for legal or factual reasons pursuant to paragraphs 2 or 3, the specific data field shall be marked as \u2018not applicable\u2019. The system shall allow a distinction to be made between the cases where fingerprints are not required to be provided for legal reasons and the cases where they cannot be provided for factual reasons.\n\n\n\nArticle 16Personal data for third country nationals who have been refused entry\n\n\n1.Where a decision has been taken by the border authority, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 and Annex V thereto, to refuse the entry of a third country national referred to in Article 2(2) of this Regulation  to the territories of the Member States, and where no previous file has been registered in the EES for that third country national the border authority shall create an individual file in which it shall  enter the data required pursuant to  Article 14(1) in the case of visa holding third country nationals and the data required pursuant to Article 15(1) in the case of visa exempt third country nationals. \n\n\n2.In order to create the individual file of visa holder third country nationals, the data provided for  in  Article 14 (1)  (d), (e) and (g) may be retrieved and imported directly from the VIS into the EES by the competent border  authority in accordance with Article 18a of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. \u00a0\n\n\n3. For both visa holding and visa exempt third country nationals the following data shall be entered in a separate refusal of entry record: \n\n\n(a) the date and time of refusal of entry, \n\n\n(b) the border crossing point,\n\n\n(c)  the authority that refused the entry,\n\n\n(d) the letter(s) corresponding to the reason(s) for refusing entry, in accordance with Annex V, Part B of Regulation (EU) 2016/399. \n\n\n4.Where a previous file already exists in the EES the data provided for  in paragraph 2 shall be added to the existing file.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 17Data to be added where an authorisation to stay is revoked, annulled or extended\n\n\n1.Where a decision has been taken to revoke or annul an authorisation to stay or a visa\u00a0or to extend the duration of the authorised stay or visa, the competent authority that has taken the decision shall add the following data to the individual file:\n\n\n(a)the status information indicating that the authorisation to stay or the visa has been revoked or annulled or that the duration of the authorised stay or the visa has been extended;\n\n\n(b)the identity of the authority that revoked or annulled the authorisation to stay or the visa or extended the duration of the authorised stay or visa; \n\n\n(c)the place and date of the decision to revoke or annul the authorisation to stay or the visa or to extend the duration of the authorised stay or the visa;\n\n\n(d)the new visa sticker number including the three letter code of the issuing country;\n\n\n(e)the period of the extension of the authorised duration of stay;\n\n\n(f)the new expiry date of the authorisation to stay or the visa. \n\n\n\n\n2.Where a decision has been taken to annul, revoke or extend a visa, the visa authority which has taken the decision shall immediately retrieve and import the data provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article from the VIS directly into the EES in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. \n\n\n3.The entry/exit record shall indicate the ground(s) for revocation of the authorisation to stay, which shall be: \n\n\n(a)the grounds on which the person is being expelled;\n\n\n(b)any other decision taken by the competent authorities of the Member State, in accordance with national legislation, resulting in the removal or departure of the third country national who does not fulfil or no longer fulfils the conditions for the entry into or for the stay in the territory of the Member States.\n\n\n4.The entry/exit record shall indicate the grounds for extending the duration of an authorised stay.\n\n\n5.When a person has departed or has been removed from the territories of the Member States pursuant to a decision as referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authority shall enter the data in accordance with Article 13(2) in the entry/exit record of that specific entry.\n\n\nArticle 18\nData to be added in case of rebuttal of the presumption that the third country national  does not fulfil the conditions of duration of stay in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 20, where a third country national present on the territory of a Member State is not registered in the EES or the entry/exit record does not contain an exit date following the date of expiry of the authorised length of stay, the competent authorities may presume that the third country national does not fulfil or no longer fulfils the conditions relating to duration of stay in the territory of the Member States.  \n\n\nIn that case Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 shall apply and if that presumption is rebutted by proof that the third country national  concerned has respected the conditions relating to the condition of short stay, the competent authorities shall create an individual file for that third country national in the EES if necessary, or update the latest entry/exit record by entering the missing data in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 or delete an existing file where Article 32 applies. \n\n\nArticle 19\nFall-back procedures in case of technical impossibility to enter data or failure of the EES\n\n\nIn the event of technical impossibility in entering data in the Central System or in the event of a failure of the Central System, the data referred to in Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 shall be temporarily stored in the National Uniform Interface as provided for  in Article 6. If this is not possible, the data shall be temporarily stored locally. In both cases, the data shall be entered into the Central System of the EES as soon as the technical impossibility or failure has been remedied. The Member States shall take the appropriate measures and deploy the required infrastructure, equipment and resources to ensure that such temporary local storage can be carried out at any time and for any of their border crossing points. \n\n\nArticle 20\nTransitional period and transitional measures \n\n\n1.For a period of six months after the EES has started operations, in order to verify at entry that the third country national has not exceeded the number of entries authorised by the single or double entry visa and to verify at entry and at exit that third country nationals entering for a short stay have not exceeded the length of the maximum authorised stay, the competent border authorities shall take into account the stays in the territories of the Member States during the 180 days preceding the entry or the exit by checking the stamps in the travel documents in addition to the entry/exit data recorded in the EES. \n\n\n2.Where a third country national has entered the territory of the Member States and has not yet exited it before the EES has started operations, an individual file shall be created and the date of that entry as stamped in the passport shall be entered in the entry/exit record in accordance with Article 14(2) when the third country national exits. This rule shall not be limited to the six months after the EES has started operations as referred to in paragraph 1. In case of discrepancy between the entry stamp and the data recorded in the EES, the stamp shall prevail.  \u00a0\n\n\nArticle 21\nUse of data for verification at the external borders\n\n\n1.Border authorities shall have access to the EES for verifying the identity and previous registration of the third country national, for updating the data registered into the EES where necessary and for consulting the data to the extent required for the performance of border control tasks.\n\n\n2.Pursuant to paragraph 1, the border authorities shall have access to search with the data referred to in Article 14(1)(a), (b) and (c). \n\n\nIn addition, for third country nationals who are subject to a visa requirement to cross the external borders, the border authorities may launch a search in the VIS directly from the EES using the same alphanumeric data for the purposes of carrying out the consultation of the VIS for verification at external borders in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n\n\nIf the search in the EES with those data indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, the border authorities shall compare the live facial image of the third country national with the facial image referred to in Article 14(1)(f). Where the technology is not available at the border crossing for the use of live facial image, the border authorities shall, in the case of visa exempt third country nationals, proceed to a verification of fingerprints against the EES and in the case of visa holding third country nationals, proceed to a verification of fingerprints directly against the VIS in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 767/2008. For the verification of fingerprints against the VIS for visa holders, the border authorities may launch the search in the VIS directly from the EES as provided in Article 18(6) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n\n\nIf the verification of the facial image fails, the verification shall be carried out using fingerprints and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n3.If the search with the data set out  in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, the competent authority shall be given access to consult the data of the individual file of that third country national and the entry/exit record(s) linked to it.\n\n\n4.Where the search with the alphanumeric data set out   in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the third country national are not recorded in the EES, where a verification of the third country national pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article fails or where there are doubts as to the identity of the third country national, the border authorities shall have access to data for identification in accordance with Article 25. \n\n\nIn addition, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n\n(a)for third country nationals who are subject to a visa requirement to cross the external borders, if the search in the VIS with the data referred to in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 indicates that that third country national is recorded in the VIS, a verification of fingerprints against the VIS shall be carried out in accordance with Article 18 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. For this purpose, the competent authority may launch a search from the EES to the VIS as provided for in Article 18(6) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. In circumstances where a verification of the person pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article failed, the border authorities shall access the VIS data for identification in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n\n\n(b)for third country nationals who are not subject to a visa requirement to cross the external borders and who are not found in the EES further to the identification run in accordance with Article 25, the VIS shall be consulted in accordance with Article 19a of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. The competent authority may launch a search from the EES to the VIS as provided for in Article 19a of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\"\n\n\n5. For third country nationals whose data are already recorded in the EES but who had their individual file created in the EES by a Member State which is not subject to the application of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in accordance with its Act of Accession, the border authorities shall consult the VIS in accordance with point( a) or (b) of paragraph 4 of this Article when, for the first time after the creation of the individual file, the third country national intends to cross the external borders of a Member State which is subject to the application of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\nEntry of data and use of the EES by other authorities \n\n\nArticle 22\nUse of the EES for examining and deciding on visa applications\n\n\n1.Visa authorities shall consult the EES for examining visa applications and adopting decisions relating to those applications, including decisions to annul, revoke or extend the period of validity of an issued visa, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n46\n\n\n\n2.The visa authority shall be given access to search the EES directly from the VIS with one or several of the following data:\n\n\n(a)the data referred to in Article 14(1)(a), (b) and (c);\n\n\n(b)the visa sticker number, including the three letter code of the issuing Member State referred to in Article 14(1)(d);\n\n\n(c)the biometric data as referred to in Articles 14(1)(f) and 15.\n\n\n3.If the search with the data set out  in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, visa authorities shall be given access to consult the data of the individual file of that third country national and the entry/exit records linked to it.\n\n\nArticle 23 \nUse of the EES for examining applications for access to national facilitation programmes\n\n\n1.The competent authorities referred to in Article 8e of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 shall consult the EES for the purposes of the examination of applications for access to national facilitation programmes referred to in that Article as regards the use of the Entry/Exit System and the adoption of decisions relating to those applications, including decisions to refuse, revoke or extend the period of validity of access to the national facilitation programmes in accordance with that Article.\n\n\n2.The competent authority shall be given access to search with one or several of the data referred to in Article 14(1)(a), (b), (c) and (f). \n\n\n3.If the search with the data set out  in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, the competent authority shall be given access to consult the data of the individual file of that third country national  and the entry/exit records linked to it.\n\n\nArticle 24\nAccess to data for verification within the territory of the Member States \n\n\n\n\n1.For the purpose of verifying the identity of the third country national and/or whether the conditions for entry to or stay on the territory of the Member States are fulfilled, the authorities of the Member States competent to carry out checks within the territory of the Member States as to whether the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States are fulfilled, shall have access to search with the data referred to in Article 14(1)(a), (b) and (c).\n\n\nIf the search indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, the  competent authorities shall compare the live facial image of the third country national with the facial image referred to in Article 14(1)(f). Where the technology is not available for the use of live facial imaging, the competent authorities shall proceed with the verification of fingerprints of visa exempt third country nationals in the EES and of visa holding third country nationals in the VIS in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. \n\n\n2.If the search with the data set out in paragraph 1 indicates that data on the third country national is recorded in the EES, the competent authority shall be given access to consult the data of the individual file of that person and the entry/exit record(s) linked to it.\n\n\n3.Where the search with the data set out in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the third country national are not recorded in the EES, where verification of the third country national fails or where there are doubts as to the identity of the third country national, the border authorities shall have access to data for identification in accordance with Article 25. \n\n\nArticle 25\nAccess to data for identification\n\n\n1.For the sole purpose of identifying any third country national  who may have been registered previously in the EES under a different identity or who does not or no longer fulfils the conditions for entry to, for stay or for residence on the territory of the Member States, the competent authorities for carrying out checks at external border crossing points in accordance with  Regulation (EU) 2016/399 or within the territory of the Member States as to whether the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States are fulfilled shall have access to search with the biometric data of that third country national  referred to in Articles 14(1)(f) and 15(1). \n\n\nWhere the search with the data referred to in Articles 14(1)(f) and 15(1) indicates that data on that third country national  are not recorded in the EES, access to data for identification shall be carried out in  the VIS in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. At external borders, prior to any identification against the VIS, the competent authorities shall first access the VIS in accordance with Articles 18 or 19a of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. \n\n\nWhere the fingerprints of that third country national  cannot be used or the search with the fingerprints and the facial image has failed, the search shall be carried out with the data referred to in Article 14(1)(a) or (b) or in both.  \n\n\n2.If the search with the data set out in paragraph 1 indicates that data on the third country national are recorded in the EES, the competent authority shall be given access to consult the data of the individual file and the linked entry/exit records\n\n\nCHAPTER IV:\n\n\nProcedure and conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes\n\n\nArticle 26 \n\n\nMember States' designated law enforcement authorities\n\n\n1.Member States shall designate the law enforcement authorities which are entitled to consult the data stored in the EES in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. \n\n\n2.Each Member State shall keep a list of the designated authorities. Each Member State shall notify in a declaration to eu-LISA and the Commission its designated authorities and may at any time amend or replace its declaration with another declaration. The declarations shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n\n\n3.Each Member State shall designate a central access point which shall have access to the EES. The central access point shall be an authority of the Member State which is responsible for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences. The central access point shall verify that the conditions to request access to the EES laid down in Article 29 are fulfilled. \n\n\nThe designated authority and the central access point may be part of the same organisation if permitted under national law, but the central access point shall act independently when performing its tasks under this Regulation. The central access point shall be separate from the designated authorities and shall not receive instructions from them as regards the outcome of the verification.\n\n\nMember States may designate more than one central access point to reflect their organisational and administrative structure in the fulfilment of their constitutional or legal requirements. \n\n\n4.Each Member State shall notify in a declaration to eu-LISA and the Commission their central access point(s) and may at any time amend or replace its declaration with another declaration. The declarations shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  \n\n\n5.At national level, each Member State shall keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request access to data stored in the EES through the central access point(s). \n\n\n\n\n6.Only duly empowered staff of the central access point(s) shall be authorised to access the EES in accordance with Articles 28 and 29.\n\n\nArticle 27\n\n\nEuropol \n\n\n1.Europol shall designate an authority which is authorised to request access to the EES through its designated central access point in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. The designated authority shall be an operating unit of Europol.\n\n\n2.Europol shall designate a specialised unit with duly empowered Europol officials as the central access point. The central access point shall verify that the conditions to request access to the EES laid down in Article 30 are fulfilled.\n\n\nThe central access point shall act independently when performing its tasks under this Regulation and shall not receive instructions from the designated authority referred to in paragraph 1 as regards the outcome of the verification.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\nProcedure for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes\n\n\n1. The operating units referred to in Article 26(5) shall submit a reasoned electronic request to the central access points referred to in Article 26(3) for access to data stored in the EES. Upon receipt of a request for access, the central access point(s) shall verify whether the conditions for access referred to in Article 29 are fulfilled. If the conditions for access are fulfilled, the duly authorised staff of the central access point(s) shall process the requests. The EES data accessed shall be transmitted to the operating units referred to in in Article 26(5) in such a way as to not compromise the security of the data.\n\n\n2. In an exceptional case of urgency, where there is a need to prevent an imminent danger associated with a terrorist offence or another serious criminal offence, the central access point(s) shall process the request immediately and shall only verify ex post whether all the conditions of Article 29 are fulfilled, including whether an exceptional case of urgency actually existed. The ex post verification shall take place without undue delay after the processing of the request.\n\n\n3. Where an ex post verification determines that the access to EES data was not justified, all the authorities that accessed such data shall erase the information accessed from the EES and shall inform the central access points of the erasure. \n\n\nArticle 29\u00a0\n\nConditions for access to EES data by designated authorities of Member States\n\n\n1. Designated authorities may access the EES for consultation if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a) access for consultation is necessary for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of a terrorist offences or another serious criminal offence, thus making  a search of the database proportionate  if there is an overriding public security concer;\n\n\n(b) access for consultation is necessary in a specific case;\n\n\n(c) reasonable grounds exist to consider that the consultation of the EES data may substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the criminal offences in question, in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls under a category covered by this Regulation;\n\n\n2.  The access to the EES as a criminal identification tool for the purpose of identifying an unknown suspect, perpetrator or suspected victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence shall be allowed when the conditions listed in paragraph 1 are met and the following additional conditions are met:\n\n\n(a) a prior search has been conducted in national databases without success;\n\n\n(b) in the case of searches with fingerprints, a prior search has been conducted without success in the automated fingerprint verification system of the other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA where comparisons of fingerprints are technically available.\n\n\nHowever, that prior search does not have to be conducted where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a comparison with the systems of the other Member States would not lead to the verification of the identity of the data subject. Those reasonable grounds shall be included in the electronic request for comparison with EES data sent by the designated authority to the central access point(s).\n\n\nSince fingerprint data of visa holding third country nationals are only stored in the VIS, a request for consultation of the VIS on the same data subject  may be submitted in parallel to a request for consultation of the EES in accordance with the conditions laid down in Decision 2008/633/JHA provided the searches carried out in accordance with points(a) and (b) of the first subparagraph did not lead to the verification of the identity of the data subject. \n\n\n\n\n3.The access to the EES as a criminal intelligence tool to consult the travel history or the periods of stay in the Schengen area of a known suspect, perpetrator or suspected victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence shall be allowed when the conditions listed in paragraph 1 are met and where there is a duly justified need to consult the entry/exit records of the person concerned.\n\n\n4. Consultation of the EES for identification shall be limited to searching in the application file with any of the following EES data:\n\n\n(a) Fingerprints (including latents) of visa exempt third country nationals; \n\n\n(b)Facial image. \n\n\nConsultation of the EES, in case of a hit, shall give access to any other data taken from the individual file as listed in Article 14(1) and Article 15(1).  \n\n\n5. Consultation of the EES for the travel history of the third country national concerned shall be limited to searching with any of the following EES data in the individual file or in the entry/exit records:\n\n\n(a) Surname(s) (family name); first name(s) (given names); date of birth, nationality or nationalities and sex;\n\n\n(b) Type and number of travel document or documents, three letter code of the issuing country and date of expiry of the validity of the travel document; \n\n\n(c) Visa sticker number and the date of expiry of the validity of the visa .\n\n\n(d) Fingerprints (including latents); \n\n\n(e) Facial image;\n\n\n(f) Date and time of entry, entry authoriser authority and entry border crossing point;\n\n\n(g)   Date and time of exit and exit border crossing point;\n\n\nConsultation of the EES shall, in the event of a hit, give access to the data listed in this paragraph as well as to any other data taken from the individual file and the entry/exit records including data entered in respect of revocation or extension of authorisation to stay in accordance with Article 17.\n\n\nArticle 30\n\n\nProcedure and conditions for access to EES data by Europol\n\n\n1. Europol shall have access to consult the EES   where all the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a) the consultation is necessary to support and strengthen action by Member States in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences falling under Europol's mandate, thus making a search of the database proportionate  if there is an overriding public security concern; \n\n\n(b) the consultation is necessary in a specific case; \n\n\n(c) reasonable grounds exist to consider that the consultation may  substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the criminal offences in question,  in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls under  a category covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n2.The conditions laid down in Article 29 (2) to (5) shall apply accordingly. \n\n\n3. Europol's designated authority may submit a reasoned electronic request for the consultation of all data or a specific set of data stored in the EES to the Europol central access point referred to in Article 27. Upon receipt of a request for access the Europol central access point shall verify whether the conditions for access referred to in paragraph 1 are fulfilled. If all conditions for access are fulfilled, the duly authorised staff of the central access point(s) shall process the requests. The EES data accessed shall be transmitted to the operating units referred to in Article 27 (1) in such a way as not to compromise the security of the data.\n\n\n4. The processing of information obtained by Europol from consultation with EES data shall be subject to the authorisation of the Member State of origin. That authorisation shall be obtained via the Europol national unit of that Member State.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\nRetention and amendment of the data\n\n\nArticle 31\nRetention period for data storage\n\n\n1Each entry/exit record or refusal of entry record linked to an individual file shall be stored for five years following the date of the exit record or of the refusal of entry record, as applicable.\n\n\n2. Each individual file together with the linked entry/exit record(s) or refusal of entry records shall be stored in the EES for five years and one day following the date of the last exit record if there is no entry record within five years from that last exit record or refusal of entry record.\n\n\n3.If there is no exit record following the date of expiry of the authorised period of stay, the data shall be stored for a period of five years following the last day of the authorised stay. The EES shall automatically inform the Member States three months in advance of the scheduled deletion of data on overstayers in order for them to adopt the appropriate measures. \n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation to paragraphs (2) and (3), the entry/exit record(s) generated by third country nationals in their condition of family members of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies or of a national of a third country enjoying the right of free movement under Union law and who do not hold a residence card referred to under Directive 2004/38/EC, shall be stored in the EES for a maximum of one year after the last exit record.  \n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon expiry of the retention period referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 such data shall automatically be erased from the Central System \n\n\nArticle 32\nAmendment of data and advance data deletion\n\n\n1.The Member State responsible shall have the right to amend data which it has introduced into the EES, by correcting or deleting such data. \n\n\n2If the Member State responsible has evidence to suggest that data recorded in the EES are factually inaccurate or that data were processed in the EES in contravention of this Regulation, it shall check the data concerned and, if necessary, amend or erase them without delay from the EES and, where applicable, from the list of identified persons referred to in Article 11.

data of third country nationals crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes and amending Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice and Regulation (EC) 767/2008

action\u00a0\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\n- Border management \u2013 saving lives and securing external borders\n\n\nManaging EU borders more efficiently also implies making better use of the opportunities offered by IT systems and technologies. The \"Smart Borders\" initiative will increase the efficiency of border crossings, facilitating crossings for the large majority of 'bona fide' third country travellers, whilst at the same time strengthening the fight against irregular migration by creating a record of all cross-border movements by third country nationals, fully respecting proportionality. \n\n\n- Better information exchange\n\n\nCommon high standards of border management, in full respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights, are essential to preventing cross-border crime and terrorism. \n\n\nThe proposal is part of the continuous development of the Integrated Border Management Strategy of the European Union.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective No 2\n\n\nSupporting integrated border management including promoting further harmonisation of border management-related measures in accordance with common Union standards and through sharing of information between Member States and between Member States and the Frontex Agency, to ensure, on one hand, a uniform and high level of control and protection of the external borders, including by tackling irregular immigration, and, on the other hand, the smooth crossing of external borders in conformity with the Schengen acquis, while guaranteeing access to international protection for those needing it, in accordance with the obligations contracted by Member States in the field of human rights, including the principle of non-refoulement.\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nChapter Security and Safeguarding Liberties: Internal Security\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe general policy objectives are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To improve the management of external borders \n\n\n(2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To reduce irregular migration, by addressing the phenomenon of overstaying. \n\n\n(3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To contribute to the fight against terrorism and serious crime and ensure a high level of internal security'. \n\n\nImproved border management can be measured by its effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness in border management is achieved if it facilitates the border crossing of legitimate travellers whilst at the same time preventing that travellers not meeting the entry conditions from entering the Schengen area or apprehending them at exit. Efficiency in border management is achieved when the increase of border crossings does not require a similar increase of border guards, \n\n\nThe fulfilment of the second objective is dependent on the first, but also requires utilisation of the Entry Exit System by relevant authorities within the territory of the Schengen area. The EES will contribute to the implementation of the EU policy on the return of illegally staying third country nationals. \n\n\nThe implementation of EES will ensure a better identification of third country nationals and will allow for the detection of people using several identities. This will help to achieve to a certain extent the third policy objective. However, this objective can only be fully realised when access to the entry exit system is granted to law enforcement authorities.\n\n\nNo new policy in new areas will be developed. The proposal is part of the continuous development of the Integrated Border Management Strategy of the European Union.\n\n\nSpecific policy objectives:\n\n\nThe main policy objectives of the Entry Exit System and modifications of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 (the Schengen Borders Code) are to:\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the efficiency of border checks through monitoring of the rights to authorised stay at entry and exit;\n\n\n(2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Identify and detect overstayers (also within the territory) and enable national authorities of the Member States to take appropriate measures including to increase the possibilities for return; \n\n\n(3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free up border control resources from performing checks that can be automated and enable better focus on traveller assessment;\n\n\n(4)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Facilitate the crossing by third country nationals of EU external borders through self-service systems and semi-automated or automated systems while maintaining the current level of security; \n\n\n(5)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enable consulates to have access to information on the lawful use of previous visas;\n\n\n(6)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inform third country nationals of the duration of their authorised stay;\n\n\n(7)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Improve the assessment of the risk of overstay;\n\n\n(8)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support evidence based EU migration policy making;\n\n\n(9)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Combat identity fraud.\n\n\n(10)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To contribute to the fight against terrorism and serious crime.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nDuring the development\n\n\nAfter the approval of the draft proposal and the adoption of the technical specifications the Entry Exit System (EES), together with a common National Uniform Interface (NUI) (facilitating the integration of MS national infrastructures to the EES) will be developed by eu-LISA.\n\n\neu-LISA will also coordinate the integration of the NUI carried out by Member States at  national level. A detailed overall governance is defined for the development phase as well as reporting requirements to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\n\n\nSpecific Objective: Ready for operations by the end of 2019\n3\n.\n\n\nIndicator: In order to go live, eu-LISA has notified the successful completion of a comprehensive test of the EES which shall be conducted by the Agency together with the Member States \n\n\nOnce the system is operational\n\n\neu-LISA shall ensure that systems are in place to monitor the functioning of the Entry Exit System against objectives. Two years after the system starts operations and every two years thereafter, eu-LISA should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission a report on the technical functioning of the system including the security thereof. Moreover, two years after the Entry Exit System starts operations and every four years thereafter, the Commission should produce an overall evaluation of the system. This overall evaluation shall include an examination of results achieved against objectives and the impact on fundamental rights and an assessment of the continuing validity of the underlying rationale, the application of the Regulation, the security of the EES and any implications on future operations, and shall make any necessary recommendations. The Commission shall transmit the evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council. \n\n\nOf particular importance for the evaluation would be the indicators related to the number of overstayers and data on the border crossing time, and for the latter information would be gathered from experiences from the VIS also, as well as an in-depth analysis of the impact of giving access to data for law enforcement purposes. The Commission should submit the report on the evaluation to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\nSpecific Objective: enhance the efficiency of border checks through monitoring of the rights to authorised stay at entry and exit and to improve the assessment of the risk of overstay;\n\n\nIndicator: Processing time at the border crossing points + All third country nationals are informed of the authorised duration of stay  Processing time at the border crossing points is measured as the time between the start of reading the data from the travel document as this is recorded in EES and the moment of recording an authorisation of entry. Durations are recorded permanently and automatically and statistics can be produced on request. Comparison will be made vs a baseline taken before entry into operations.\n\n\nThe indicator that all third country nationals are informed of the authorised duration of stay can be assessed annually by looking at the processes and devices in place. Comparisons will be made between successive years.\n\n\nSpecific Objective: identify and detect overstayers (also within the territory) and to enable national authorities of the Member States to take appropriate measures including to increase the possibilities for return;\n\n\nIndicator: Number of identified overstayers by category (visa-required/visa-exempt), by type of border (land/sea/air), by Member State, by country of origin/nationality, Number of alerts leading to the apprehension of overstayers  Number of identified overstayers result from the analysis of overstay data as recorded by EES. Statistics can be produced at any moment but for evaluation purposes would be produced on an annual basis. Trend can be analysed over successive years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber of alerts leading to the apprehension of overstayers to be obtained from the aggregation of Member State data. EES can however provide as a first indicator the number of biometric verification and identification requests triggered by Immigration enforcement services as these can be differentiated from the ones done for other purposes. Trend can be analysed over successive years.\n\n\nSpecific Objective: facilitate the crossing by third country nationals of EU external borders through a semi-automated or automated system.\n\n\nIndicator: Average duration of border crossing of third-county nationals at EU external borders when using semi-automated or automated systems and process accelerators - implemented in the relevant border crossing points\n\n\nSpecific Objective: support evidence based EU migration policy making.\n\n\nIndicator: Statistics on border crossing and overstay are available and provide breakdown per citizenship and other characteristics (e.g. traveller's age, gender and border crossing point).   Statistics can be produced on request but for evaluation purposes, yearly statistics are used. Comparisons will be made between successive years.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\n\n\n (1) Border crossing procedures for Third Country Nationals need to give room for more automation in order to cope with a 57% increase of traveller flow by 2025.\n\n\n(2) Control of authorised period of stay of Third Country Nationals has to be reliable, quick, easy to process and systematic.\n\n\n(3) Border control process has to report and identify overstayers systematically, easily and in a reliable manner; reliable information on irregular immigration is produced and helps for return.\n\n\n(4) The fight against international criminality, terrorism and other security threats is  reinforced.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nNo Member State alone is able to cope on its own with irregular immigration. A person may enter the Schengen area at a border crossing point in a Member State where a national register of entry/exit data is used, but exit through a border crossing point where no such system is used. The monitoring of compliance with EU rules on authorised stays can therefore not be done by Member States acting alone. Third country nationals who enter the Schengen area are able to travel freely within it. In an area without internal borders, action against irregular immigration should be undertaken in common. Considering all this the EU is better placed than Member States to take the appropriate measures.\n\n\nThe European Agenda on Migration identifies \"border management\" as one of the \"four pillar to manage migration better\". Securing external borders and managing them more efficiently implies making better use of the opportunities offered by IT systems and technologies. The use of the three existing EU large-scale IT systems (SIS, VIS and Eurodac) brings benefits to border management. A new phase will come with the Entry Exit System implementation to increase the efficiency of border crossings, facilitating crossings for the large majority of 'bona fide' third country travellers, whilst at the same time strengthening the fight against irregular migration by creating a record of all cross-border movements by third country nationals, fully respecting proportionality.\n\n\nThe implementation of an EU wide Entry Exit System will result, amongst other things, in the automation of certain tasks and activities related to border controls. This automation will ensure a homogeneous and systematic control of the authorised period of stay of third country nationals.\n\n\nThe use of EES in combination with new possibilities for using self-services systems and automatic or semi-automatic border control solutions will facilitate the work of border guards and help them absorbing the forecasted increase of border crossings. From the traveller\u2019s perspective this will result in a facilitation of border crossing, as the waiting time will be reduced and border checks will be faster.\n\n\nAlthough Member States may retain their national systems in accordance with security-related national legislation, an EU Entry Exit System would allow Member State authorities to access data on third country nationals who crossed the EU external border in one country and exited via another Schengen country.\n\n\nBetter information on cross border movements of third country nationals at EU level would establish a factual basis to develop and adapt the EU migration policy, including its visa policy. It would help setting priorities for readmission agreements and visa facilitation agreement with third countries. It would contribute to a common understanding of immigration issues and priorities in policy dialogues with countries of origin and transit.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe experience with the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and of the Visa Information System (VIS) showed the following lessons:\n\n\n1) As a possible safeguard against cost overruns and delays resulting from changing requirements, any new information system in the area of freedom, security and justice, particularly if it involves a large-scale IT system, will not be developed before the underlying legal instruments setting out its purpose, scope, functions and technical details have been definitively adopted.\n\n\n2) For SIS II and VIS, Member States National developments could be co-financed under the External Borders Fund (EBF) but this was not compulsory. Hence it was not possible to have an overview of the level of advancement in those who had not foreseen the respective activities in their multi-annual programming or lacked precision in their programming. Therefore, it is now proposed that the Commission reimburse all the integration costs incurred by the MS, so as to be able to monitor the advancement of these developments. \n\n\n3) With a view to facilitating the general coordination of the implementation, eu-LISA will develop not only the central system but also a common national uniform interface (NUI) to be used by all member states to link their existing national border IT infrastructure.  \n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThis proposal should be seen as part of the continuous development of the Integrated Border Management Strategy of the European Union, and in particular the Smart Borders Communication\n4\n, as well as in conjunction with the ISF borders\n5\n, as part of the MFF and the establishing Regulation of eu-LISA\n6\n. The legislative financial statement attached to the Commission proposal for the Agency\n7\n covers the costs for the existing IT systems EURODAC, SIS II, VIS but not for the future border management systems that are not yet entrusted to the Agency via a legal framework. Therefore, the ISF borders Regulation\u00a0foresees an amount of 791 mio \u20ac under Article 5 developing IT systems, based on existing and/or new systems, supporting the migration flow across the external borders. Within the Commission DG HOME is the Directorate General responsible for the establishment of an area of free movement in which persons can cross internal borders without being submitted to border checks and external borders are controlled and managed coherently at the EU level. The system has the following synergies with the Visa Information System:\n\n\na) for visa holders, the Biometric Matching System will also be used for the purpose of Entry/Exit;\n\n\nb) the Entry/Exit System will complement the VIS\n8\n. The VIS contains only visa applications and issued visas, whereas for visa holders the EES will store also concrete entry and exit data related to the issued visas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Preparatory period 2016\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2017 to 2019,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation in 2020.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\nThe ISF borders Regulation is the financial instrument where the budget for the implementation of the smart borders package has been included. \n\n\nIt provides in Article 5 that 791 million EUR shall be implemented through a programme for setting up IT systems supporting the management of migration flows across the external border under the conditions laid down in Article 15. \n\n\nRegarding the methods of implementation, the ISF Borders Regulation provides as follows: \n\n\nArticle 5(4) last paragraph provides that \u2018The method(s) of implementation of the budget for the programme on the development of IT systems, based on existing and/or new IT systems shall be set out in the relevant Union legislative acts subject to their adoption\u2019.\n\n\nArticle 15 provides as follows: 'The programme on the development of IT systems based on existing and/or new IT systems shall be implemented subject to adoption of the Union legislative acts defining those systems and their communication infrastructure with the aim in particular of improving the management and control of travel flows at the external borders by reinforcing checks while speeding up border crossings for regular travellers. Where appropriate, synergies with existing IT systems shall be sought in order to avoid double spending. \n\n\nThe breakdown of the amount referred to in point b) of Article 5(5) shall be made either in the relevant Union legislative acts or following the adoption of those legislative acts through a delegated act in accordance with Article 17.\u2019 \n\n\nThe legislator clearly decided that the method of implementation of the budget for Smart Borders is not defined in the ISF borders and will have to be defined in the \"relevant Union legislative acts\" i.e. the Regulations on EES and RTP. Regarding the breakdown of the 791 million, the legislator followed the same rationale (to be included in the \"relevant Union legislative acts\") but left open the possibility to set this breakdown through a delegated act following the adoption of the smart borders regulations. This means that whereas the method of implementation should be defined in the relevant Union legislative acts, the breakdown of costs could be defined afterwards through a delegated act, which would give certain flexibility in case of modification of this breakdown.\n\n\nThe methods of implementation envisaged in the proposal are the following:\n\n\n\n1) Indirect management: During the 2017-2019 period the development of the EES will be executed by eu-LISA. This will cover the development part of all strands of the project, i.e. Central System, National Uniform Interface (NUI) and the communication infrastructure between the central system and the NUI. During the period of operations starting in 2020 eu-LISA will execute all operational activities linked to the maintenance of the central system and the communication infrastructure.\n\n\nAs of 2017, it is envisaged to transfer a total amount of 288 Mio \u20ac from the ISF to the eu-LISA budget line to cover these activities.\n\n\n2) Direct management: During the development phase (2017-2019) the Commission will spend a total amount of 120 Mio \u20ac to manage the grants to Member States for the integration of the NUI \n\n\n3) Shared management:  During the development phase (2017-2019) the Commission will spend a total amount of 52,7 mio \u20ac for the expenses related to the operations in the Member States. During the operations starting in 2020 an amount of 19,7 mio \u20ac has been reserved to ensure the necessary staff for 24h/24h shift in the Member States. This will need a revision of the national programmes under the ISF-Borders & Visas to include new specific actions.Such inclusion of an additional specific action will be made through a delegated act once the smart borders regulation will be adopted.\n\n\nThe remaining budget of the Smart Borders line (791 Mio \u20ac initial allocation minus 480 Mio \u20ac Smart Borders budget = 311 Mio \u20ac) will be used as defined in Article 5(5) b of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 (ISF-B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment phase\n\n\n(2017-2019)\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations\n\n\nphase\n\n\n(2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement mode\n\n\n\n\n\nActor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nIndirect\n\n\n\n\nEu-LISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment and Maintenance Central System\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nIndirect\n\n\n\n\neu-LISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment National Uniform Interface (NUI)\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect\n\n\n\n\neu-LISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration NUI and related administration during development\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nDirect / Shared\n\n\n\n\nCOM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance National Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nShared\n\n\n\n\nCOM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe rules on monitoring and evaluation of the Entry Exit System (EES) are foreseen in Article 64 of the proposal:\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0eu-LISA shall ensure that procedures are in place to monitor the development of the EES against objectives relating to planning and costs and to monitor the functioning of the EES against objectives relating to the technical output, cost-effectiveness, security and quality of service. \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Six months after the entry into force of this Regulation and every six months thereafter during the development phase of the EES, eu-LISA shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the state of play of the development of the Central System, the Uniform Interfaces and the communication infrastructure between the Central System and the Uniform Interfaces. Once the development is finalised, a report shall be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council explaining in detail how the objectives in particular relating to planning and costs, were met as well as justifying any divergences.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of technical maintenance, eu-LISA shall have access to the necessary information relating to the data processing operations performed in the EES.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years after the start of operations of the EES and every two years thereafter, eu-LISA shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission a report on the technical functioning of EES, including the security thereof.\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three years after the EES is brought into operation and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall produce an overall evaluation of the EES. This overall evaluation shall include an examination of results achieved against objectives and the impact on fundamental rights, and assessing the continuing validity of the underlying rationale, the application of the Regulation, the security of the EES and any implications on future operations, and shall make any necessary recommendations. The Commission shall transmit the evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States and Europol shall provide eu-LISA and the Commission with the information necessary to draft the reports referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 according to the quantitative indicators predefined by the Commission and/or eu-LISA . This information shall not jeopardise working methods or include information that reveals sources, staff members or investigations of the designated authorities.\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0eu-LISA shall provide the Commission with the information necessary to produce the overall evaluations referred to in paragraph 5.\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While respecting the provisions of national law on the publication of sensitive information, each Member State and Europol shall prepare annual reports on the effectiveness of access to EES data for law enforcement purposes containing information and statistics on:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- the exact purpose of the consultation (whether for identification or for entry/exit records) including the type of terrorist or serious criminal offence,\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- reasonable grounds given for the substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim is covered by this Regulation \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- the reasonable grounds given not to conduct consultation of other Member States\u2019 automated fingerprint identification systems under Decision 2008/615/JHA in accordance with Article 29(2)b).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- the number of requests for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- the number and type of cases which have ended in successful identifications and\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- the need and use made of the exceptional case of urgency including those cases where that urgency was not accepted by the ex-post verification carried out by the Central Access Point;\n\n\nMember States and Europol annual reports shall be transmitted to the Commission by 30 June of the subsequent year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\n1) Difficulties with the technical development of the system\n\n\nMember States have technically different national IT systems. Furthermore, border control processes may differ according to the local circumstances (available space at the border crossing point, travel flows, etc.). The EES needs to be integrated into the national IT architecture and the national border control processes. Additionally, the integration of the National Uniform Interfaces (NUIs) needs to be fully aligned with central requirements. There are two main risks identified in this area:\n\n\na) The risk that technical and legal aspects of the EES may be implemented in different ways by different Member States, due to insufficient coordination between the central and national sides.The NUI concept envisaged should mitigate this risk.\n\n\nb) The risk of inconsistency in how this future system is used depending on how Member States implement the EES into the existing border control processes.\n\n\n2) Difficulties with the timely development\n\n\nFrom the experience gained during the development of the VIS and the SIS II, it can be anticipated that a crucial factor for a successful implementation of the EES will be the timely development of the system by an external contractor. As a center of excellence in the field of development and management of large-scale IT systems, eu-LISA will also be responsible for the award and management of contracts, in particular for sub-contracting the development of the system. There are several risks related to the use of an external contractor for this development work:\n\n\na) in particular, the risk that the contractor fails to allocate sufficient resources to the project or that it designs and develops a system that is not state-of-the-art;\n\n\nb) the risk that administrative techniques and methods to handle large-scale IT projects are not fully respected as a way of reducing costs by the contractor;\n\n\nc) finally,  the risk of the contractor facing financial difficulties for reasons external to this project cannot be entirely excluded.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe Agency is meant to be a center of excellence in the field of development and management of large-scale IT systems. It shall execute the activities linked to the development and the operations of the central part of the system including uniform interfaces in the Member States and the networks. This will allow to avoid most of the drawbacks that the Commission met when developing the SIS II and VIS.\n\n\nDuring the development phase (2017-2019), all development activities will be executed by eu-LISA. This will cover the development part of all strands of the project, i.e. Central System, National Uniform Interface (NUI), Networks and Office space in the Member States. The costs for integration of the NUI as well as those related to the administration of the systems in Member States during the development will be managed by the Commission via grants.\n\n\nDuring the operational phase starting in 2020, eu-LISA will be responsible for the technical and financial management of the central system, notably the award and management of contracts whereas the Commission will manage the grants to Member States for the expenses for national systems maintenance via the ISF/Borders (national programs).\n\n\nIn order to avoid delays at national level, an efficient governance between all stakeholders is to be foreseen prior to the start of the development. The Commission has proposed in the draft Regulation that an Advisory Group composed of Member States national experts shall provide the Agency with the expertise related to the EES. \n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe measures foreseen to combat fraud are laid down in Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 1077/2011 which provides as follows:\n\n\n1. In order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 shall apply.\n\n\n2. The Agency shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate provisions applicable to all the employees of the Agency.\n\n\n3. The decisions concerning funding and the implementing agreements and instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may carry out, if necessary, on-the-spot checks among the recipients of the Agency's funding and the agents responsible for allocating it.\n\n\nIn accordance with this provision, the decision of the Management Board of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice concernin gthe terms and conditions for internal investigation sin relation to the prevention of fraud, corruption and any illegal activity detrimental to the Union's interests was adopted on 28 June 2012.\n\n\nDG HOME's fraud prevention and detection strategy will apply.\n\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n\uf0b7Existing budget
