To achieve this, the Energy Union needs strong Governance ensuring that policies and measures at various levels are coherent, complementary and sufficiently ambitious. The main objective of this initiative is to set out the necessary legislative foundation for this process in view of delivering the Energy Union, which will have to be complemented by non-legislative measures and action for the Governance to succeed. \n\n\nIn line with the Commission's strong commitment to Better Regulation, the proposal will result in significant reduction of administrative burden for the Member States, the Commission and other EU Institutions. Current planning and reporting requirements (for both the Commission and Member States) in the energy and climate fields provide benefits in terms of detailed information on specific policy areas and support the implementation of sectorial legislation. Nevertheless, they are found in a wide range of separate pieces of legislation adopted at different points in time, which has led to certain redundancy, incoherence and overlaps and lacking integration between energy and climate areas. Moreover, some of the current requirements have been defined in view of the achievement of the corresponding 2020 targets, and are for that reason not suited to support the achievement of the 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate, nor synchronised with the planning and reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement\n1\n. \n\n\nThis proposal will bring together the existing scattered planning and reporting obligations from the main pieces of EU legislation across energy, climate and other Energy Union related policy areas and thereby achieve a major simplification of obligations. It reduces, aligns and updates such requirements, and removes existing duplications. In total, the proposal integrates, streamlines or repeals more than 50 existing individual planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of the energy and climate acquis (integrating 31 and deleting 23). The streamlined political Governance process between the Commission and Member States, with close involvement of other EU Institutions, will align frequency and timing of obligations, significantly enhance transparency and cooperation and thereby bring additional benefits in terms of reducing administrative burden.\n\n\nIn its conclusions of 24 October 2014 the European Council agreed on the 2030 Framework for energy and climate\n2\n, based on the Commission's proposal\n3\n. The conclusions required the development of a reliable and transparent Governance, without any unnecessary administrative burden, to help ensure that the EU meets its energy policy goals, with the necessary flexibility for Member States and fully respecting their freedom to determine their energy mix. It emphasized that this Governance should build on existing building blocks, such as national climate programmes, national plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the need to streamline and bring together separate planning and reporting strands. \n\n\nThe Energy Union Strategy of 25 February 2015 broadened the scope of Governance \u2013 beyond the 2030 Framework for energy and climate \u2013 to all five dimensions of the Energy Union (energy security solidarity and trust; internal energy market; moderation of demand; decarbonisation including renewable energy; and research, innovation and competitiveness).\n\n\nThe State of the Energy Union of 18 November 2015 and the Commission's Guidance to Member States on the national energy and climate plans annexed to it provided further details and specified that the Governance should be anchored in legislation.\n\n\nThe Conclusions of the Energy Council of 26 November 2015 recognised that the Governance will be an essential tool for the efficient and effective construction of the Energy Union. In parallel, regular discussions are held between the Commission and Member States in the framework of the Technical Working Group on National Energy and Climate Plans.\n\n\nThe European Parliament's resolution \"Towards a European Energy Union\" of 15 December 2015 called for the Energy Union Governance to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved.\n\n\nOn this basis, this proposal aims to establish the regulatory framework for the Governance of the Energy Union with two main pillars: First, the streamlining and integration of existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations in the energy and climate field in order to reflect Better Regulation principles. Second, the definition of a robust political process between Member States and the Commission with close involvement of other EU institutions in view of the achievement of the Energy Union objectives, in particular its 2030 targets for energy and climate.\n\n\nOn 5 October 2016, the European Union ratified the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016. The proposed Regulation contributes to the implementation of the Paris Agreement including its 5 years review cycle and ensures that monitoring, reporting and verification requirements under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement are harmoniously integrated in the governance of the Energy Union.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nBased on the outcome of a Fitness Check of the energy acquis and the relevant parts of the climate acquis, the proposed Regulation either leaves intact, repeals or amends planning and reporting obligations on Member States and monitoring obligations on the Commission currently found in sectorial legislation. The proposal has been prepared in parallel to the Commission's reviews of the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the Renewable Energy Directive, and of the various pieces of legislation encompassed by the Market Design Initiative with a view to ensure full coherence among these initiatives. Consistency with other pieces of EU legislation in the climate and energy fields has also been ensured. \n\n\nMoreover, the proposal fully integrates the Climate Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) to ensure integration between the energy and climate fields. The proposal, in general, continues the approach of existing planning, reporting and monitoring provisions under the MMR, which was the result of an earlier streamlining exercise in the climate field. However, this proposal streamlines the existing provisions of the MMR with legislation in the energy field, updates the existing provisions to make them fit for monitoring the implementation of the proposed Effort Sharing and the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulations and for fulfilling the EU's commitments under the Paris Agreement. As the proposal covers a range of subject areas, it was decided not to propose a recast of the MMR. Nevertheless, the Commission attaches significant importance to maintaining all content that was in the MMR that is not proposed to be changed by the current proposal. \n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe initiative is also linked to other policy areas such as transport, environment, industry, economy, research and competition. It is however important to note that this initiative \u2013 as far as streamlining and integration of planning and reporting is concerned \u2013 focuses on the energy and climate areas, while at the same time incorporating some specific reporting and planning strands in other areas. This is necessary to ensure a manageable process with a focus on the main objectives of the Energy Union.\n\n\nThe aspect of Commission recommendations to Member States as set out by the proposed Regulation is complementary to and consistent with the recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester, which focuses on macro-economic and structural reform issues (rarely linked to energy or climate), whereas the Governance addresses energy and climate specific policy issues. Where energy and climate specific policy issues have macroeconomic or structural reform relevance, they should still be part of the European Semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe legal bases of all provisions of the Regulation are Articles 191, 192 and 194, TFEU.\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation pursues a legitimate objective within the scope of these articles. The ordinary legislative procedure applies generally for the adoption of measures according to Article 192(1) TFEU and in Article 194(2) of the TFEU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\n\nThe need to respect the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental considerations behind the Governance based on the approach that the Member States themselves should establish the national plans and the objectives and measures set out therein. \n\n\nNecessity of EU action\n\n\nAs several elements of the Energy Union Strategy relate to objectives set at EU level, action at EU level is needed to ensure the attainment of these objectives, as well as coherence of energy and climate policies within the EU and across its Member States, while preserving flexibility for Member States. Moreover, the majority of the energy challenges facing the Union cannot be met through uncoordinated national action. The same holds true for climate change, which is by its very nature trans-boundary and cannot be solved by local, national or even EU action alone. \n\n\nMoreover, because of the cross-border relevance of each dimension of the Energy Union, EU action is needed to further promote enhanced cooperation among Member States. None of the Energy Union dimensions could be effectively implemented in the absence of an EU Governance between Member States and the Commission fostering regional cooperation in energy and climate policy. EU level action is also necessary to ensure that the EU is ready to participate fully in the review processes under the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nFinally, EU action is necessary to streamline existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations, as existing requirements in this regard are set in EU legislation \u2013 these can only be amended and / or repealed through a legislative proposal at EU level.\n\n\nEU added-value\n\n\nThe establishment of a solid Energy Union Governance will help to ensure that the EU and its Member States collectively achieve the agreed objectives of the Energy Union, including the 2030 targets for energy and climate, and find coordinated and common solutions to common challenges in an effective and affordable manner. This is imperative in view of the considerable investment needs in the energy sector over the next decades. \n\n\nMember States will benefit from a streamlined and simplified planning and reporting framework for their energy and climate policies. More efficient and coherent administrative procedures both within national authorities and between the Member States will enable a more efficient development and implementation of energy and climate policies. The private sector will benefit from more transparent national regulatory frameworks as basis for investment decisions in the energy and climate fields; and citizens will seize the benefits of better information on the implementation of the Energy Union and its associated policies.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe Governance proposal anchored in legislation (rather than a non-legislative approach) is necessary to ensure that all Member States contribute to the process and attainment of common objectives and targets in a comparable manner, to improve regulatory stability and investor certainty, and to ensure a common monitoring between Member States and the Union.\n\n\nThe approach to national planning and reporting is based on the Fitness Check (see below) which had as a main objective to assess the proportionality of the current approach and as appropriate improve the respect of the principle.\n\n\nThe approach to the iterative process between Member States and the Commission is based on Commission recommendations rather than e.g. Commission Decisions to ensure proportionality and full respect of the Member State's rights under Article 194 TFEU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nA Regulation rather than a Directive is necessary to ensure direct applicability of the provisions and thereby ensure comparability of national energy and climate plans and reports. The direct applicability has the further advantage to enable the plans to be in place well before 2021.\n\n\nMoreover, many of the provisions of the Regulation are not directed to Member States and could therefore not be implemented by national transposition (e.g. obligations on the Commission, the process around Commission recommendations, the European Environment Agency, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nEnsuring regulatory fitness and simplification is one of the core objectives of the proposed Regulation. In line with the Commission's commitment to Better Regulation, the proposal has been prepared inclusively, based on transparency and continuous engagement with stakeholders.\n\n\nThe Fitness Check (REFIT) supporting the proposed Regulation suggests that significant reduction of administrative burden on Member States as well as on the Commission could be expected from the new approach, while being able to only partially quantify such impacts due to the limited availability of reliable data. At the same time, the new approach would result in a series of benefits significantly enhancing coherence and effectiveness. The proposal does not include any exemptions with regard to micro-enterprises nor does it include any dedicated approach to SMEs as such entities are not impacted by the initiative.\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation will enhance the role of e-reporting, which is expected to further reduce administrative burden.\n\n\n\n \u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal has been prepared and developed in line with the applicable Better Regulation guidance, and the Regulatory Scrutiny Board has issued a positive opinion. Improvements as recommended by the Board have been incorporated in the final version. With regard to policy options for streamlining of planning, reporting and monitoring obligations, the options assessed range from soft (non-legislative) guidance to Member States to various legal approaches to streamline and integrate existing obligations.\n\n\nVarious policy options were also assessed with respect to e.g. updates and periodicity of national plans and reports and the Commission's monitoring; the iterative process between Member States and the Commission including recommendations to Member States; the possible policy response where the aggregated efforts by Member States would be insufficient to meet the agreed objectives at EU level; and the role of regional consultation in the development of national plans.\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment concluded that a new, single legal act fully incorporating the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) is the preferred option. It pointed to the need to allow for some formal updates of the national plans and biennial progress reports from the Member States and monitoring reports from the Commission (including annual reports for specific policy areas). It concluded that the iterative process with the Commission should cover both the development (ambition) and implementation (delivery) of national plans and that Commission recommendations on national plans and progress reports will be necessary. In addition it concluded that mandatory regional consultations of other Member States on draft and final national plans are necessary to ensure adequate coordination of national planning processes and policies in the context of the Energy Union.\n\n\nThe above mentioned combination of preferred policy options would result in the best impacts in terms of reduced administrative burden and flexibility to Member States while at the same time ensuring a Governance that is sufficiently strong to ensure that the objectives of the Energy Union are met.\n\n\nReference of the Executive Summary of the Impact Assessment: SWD(2016)395\n4\n\n\n\nReference of the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board: SEC(2016)494\n5\n \n\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nA Fitness Check of the planning, reporting and monitoring obligations within the EU energy acquis (REFIT) supported the preparations of the proposed Regulation. The Fitness Check also evaluated interlinkages between the planning, reporting and monitoring obligation in the energy acquis with the obligations under key EU climate legislation. \n\n\nThe general conclusion of the Fitness Check is that while the existing planning, reporting and monitoring system within the EU energy acquis has delivered overall good results, there is potential for significant improvement of the current EU energy acquis in this regard, as well as strengthening interlinkages with the EU climate acquis, thus significantly improving the current benefits/costs ratio. \n\n\nOn this basis the Fitness Check strongly suggested that a systematic integration of Member States' planning and reporting as well as of the Commission's monitoring will be necessary to ensure coherence and enable Member States as well as the Commission to make full use of synergies and ensure consistency between various planning and reporting strands, also to  make the system fit for purpose under the new overarching framework of the Energy Union, including the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework targets. The proposed Regulation implements the recommendations of the Fitness Check with the exception of a few cases where this was not possible mainly due to the fact that the frequency did not coincide with the one foreseen in the Governance Regulation or that the obligation proved to be too technical.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nA public consultation was launched on 11 January 2016 to collect views and input from stakeholders and citizens. The consultation lasted over 12 weeks and closed on 22 April 2016.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe online survey received a total of 103 submissions with additional submissions by email, out of which 15 from Member States\n7\n. The responses to this public consultation fed into the Commission's evaluation and Fitness Check of existing planning and reporting obligations as well as into the Impact Assessment underpinning the proposed Regulation.\n\n\nA vast majority of respondents recognised the importance of existing planning and reporting obligations, but also agreed on the need to better streamline, align and integrate existing planning and reporting obligations to avoid gaps, duplications and inconsistencies and to focus the streamlining efforts on planning obligations more closely related to the objectives of the 2030 Framework. Several stakeholders pointed towards the necessity to better integrate current national plans in these areas\n8\n, while also highlighting the necessity of streamlining and reducing overall planning obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vast majority of respondents considered that a single legislative act is the preferred option for streamlining planning and reporting obligations in the energy and climate field post 2020. Member States were more divided between the legislative and the non-legislative options. \n\n\nMost respondents considered that the national plans should reflect all five dimensions of the Energy Union, be produced on the basis of a detailed template (also confirmed by Member States in the Technical Working Group) and have a clear focus on the areas with quantified EU targets. A limited number of respondents \u2013 including several Member States \u2013 rather favoured short strategic national plans. Several stakeholders, including a majority of Member States, insisted on the necessity of avoiding new administrative burden or additional costs.\n\n\nOn the political process governing the finalisation and review of the plans, many respondents advocated a transparent and participatory planning process conducive to investor confidence and widespread public acceptance. \n\n\nFinally, respondents generally agreed that the new Governance system should facilitate the coordination of national energy policies and foster regional cooperation and that the Commission should play an important role in the process.\n\n\nA more extensive summary of the public consultation is included in the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThe Fitness Check and the Impact Assessment underpinning the proposed Regulation were supported by two studies carried out on behalf of the Commission by Trinomics and Amec Foster Wheeler during the first half of 2016.\n\n\nThe scope and approach to the national plans in the proposed Regulation and its Annex 1 (template for national plans) has benefitted from the work carried out by the Technical Working Group on National Energy and Climate Plans, chaired by the Commission with representation of all Member States.\n\n\nExpertise reflected in stakeholder contributions during the public consultation has been used as additional source of knowledge to complement the analysis.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nAs the proposed policy primarily addresses Member States as institutional actors, it is consistent with the Charter for fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe main objectives of this proposal are to streamline the planning, reporting and monitoring obligations and to establish a Governance mechanism. Member States would have to submit integrated plans and reports to the Commission at regular intervals. On the basis of the information provided by the Member States, the Commission should produce the necessary monitoring reports. Officials, temporary agents or external personnel working in the Energy and Climate action policy areas will be allocated for the performance of the tasks of the Commission, within the Commission's existing overall human resources outlook. Regarding the European Environment Agency (EEA), a phasing in of additional contract agents (up to 3 in 2020) is requested on top of the existing human resources programming for the EEA.\n\n\nThe costs resulting from the implementation of the proposed Regulation by DG ENER and DG CLIMA \u2013 which are further set out in the attached legislative financial statement \u2013 will be fully accommodated under the current programmed financial envelope of the budget items in question until 2020. In so far as the financial resources needed for the European Environment Agency are concerned, those will be additional in comparison to the current financial programming. \n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe Commission's and Member States' reporting and assessment set out in this Regulation will ensure a close monitoring of the implementation of the Regulation.\n\n\nThe Regulation will be subject to a formal review in 2026. The review should take into account the results of the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nChapter One of the proposed Regulation sets out its scope and subject matter and sets outs the definitions of terms used.\n\n\nChapter Two of the proposed Regulation sets out the obligation for Member States to produce a national integrated energy and climate plan for the period 2021 to 2030 by 1 January 2019, as well as for subsequent ten-year periods. Annex I provides a binding template for the plans, providing further elements on e.g. policies, measures and analytical bases.\n\n\nThis Chapter also establishes an iterative consultation process between the Commission and the Member States before the finalisation of the plan, based on the draft national plan to be provided to the Commission by 1 January 2018, and every ten years thereafter for the following ten year periods. In this framework the Commission will be able to make recommendations regarding the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions as well as on specific policies and measures included in the plan. Other Member States will also be able to comment on the draft plan in the framework of regional consultations. The plans need to be updated by 1 January 2024 (still with a 2030 perspective). \n\n\nChapter Three sets out the obligation for Member States to prepare and report to the Commission long-term low emission strategies with a 50 years perspective, which are key to contribute towards economic transformation, jobs, growth and the achievement of broader sustainable development goals, as well as moving in a fair and cost-effective manner towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement. \n\n\nChapter Four of the proposed Regulation sets out the obligation for Member States to produce biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans from 2021 onwards across the five dimensions of the Energy Union to track progress. In these progress reports, Member States are also required to report biennially on their national climate change adaptation planning and strategies, aligning the timeline with the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nThis Chapter also specifies the reports which have to be produced annually, e.g in view of complying with the international commitments of the European Union and its Member States, and to have the necessary basis for the compliance assessment under Regulation [OP: act number XXX on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for  a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change]\n9\n and Regulation [OP: act number XXX on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change]\n10\n. These reports relate to e.g. GHG inventories and the support to developing countries and allow the Union and its Member States to demonstrate progress in implementing their commitments under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. It also provides for transparency on the use of revenue generated from the auctioning of allowances under the Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading (the ETS Directive). \n\n\nThis Chapter also provides for the necessary content of these reports across the five dimensions, and establishes an e-reporting platform which should build on and benefit from existing reporting processes, databases and e-tools, such as those of the European Environment Agency (EEA), Eurostat (ESTAT) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC).\n\n\nChapter Five of the proposed Regulation sets out the necessary monitoring and assessment by the Commission to monitor Member States progress in relation to the objectives set in the national plan. It also sets out a process for the Commission to make recommendations on how to enhance the ambition of the national plans or regarding the implementation of the plans in order to achieve the objectives already set. \n\n\nThis Chapter furthermore provides for the aggregate assessment of the first national plans to identify an eventual gap to the EU targets as a whole. It provides for Commission recommendations based on the progress reports and sets out that the Commission shall take action at the EU level or request measures from Member States if the assessment of progress suggests that the EU's 2030 targets for energy and climate will not be met (i.e. reducing potential ambition and delivery gaps, or closing these gap). It also sets out the approach to the Commission's annual State of the Energy Union. \n\n\n\nChapter Six of the proposed Regulation sets out the requirements for national and Union inventory systems for GHG emissions, policies, measures and projections. The establishment of such systems is required internationally. They will also support the implementation of National Plans with regard to the decarbonisation dimension. \n\n\nThis Chapter also provides the legal basis for the establishment of Union and national registries in order to take account for the nationally determined contributions and allows for the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes under Articles 4(13) and 6 of the Paris Agreement. \n\n\nChapter Seven of the Proposed Regulation sets out the mechanisms and principles for cooperation and support between Member States and the Union. It also sets out the role of the European Environmental Agency to support the Commission as appropriate with monitoring and reporting work under this Regulation.\n\n\nChapter Eight of the proposed Regulation sets out the necessary provisions for conferral of certain powers to the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts in precisely defined situations. \n\n\nChapter Nine of the proposed Regulation establishes an Energy Union Committee (an examination committee under Regulation (EU) No 182/2011) and sets out provisions on the review of the Regulation in 2026, repeals and amendments of other pieces of EU legislation to ensure coherence, as well provisions on transitional measures and entry into force.\n\n\n2016/0375 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the Governance of the Energy Union,\n\n\namending Directive 94/22/EC, Directive 98/70/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC, Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 663/2009, Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 715/2009, Directive 2009/73/EC, Council\u00a0Directive 2009/119/EC, Directive 2010/31/EU, \nDirective 2012/27/EU, Directive 2013/30/EU and Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1) and 194(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n[Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n11\n,]\n\n\n[Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n12\n,]\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)This Regulation sets out the necessary legislative foundation for a reliable and transparent Governance that ensures the achievement of the objectives and targets of the Energy Union through complementary, coherent and ambitious efforts by the Union and its Member States, while promoting the Union's Better Regulation principles.\n\n\n(2)The European Energy Union should cover five key dimensions: energy security; the internal energy market; energy efficiency; decarbonisation; and research, innovation and competitiveness.\n\n\n(3)The goal of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy at its core is to give Union consumers, both households and businesses, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, which requires a fundamental transformation of Europe's energy system. That objective can only be achieved through coordinated action, combining both legislative and non-legislative acts at Union and national level.\n\n\n(4)The Commission's proposal was developed in parallel to and is adopted together with a series of initiatives in sectorial energy policy, notably with regard to renewable energy, energy efficiency and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme of energy efficiency first, the Union\u2019s global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers.\n\n\n(5)The European Council agreed on 24 October 2014 on the 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate for the Union based on four key targets: at least 40% cut in economy wide greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency with a view to a level of 30%, at least 27% for the share of renewable energy consumed in the Union, and at least 15% for electricity interconnection. It specified that the target for renewable energy is binding at Union level and that it will be fulfilled through Member States\u2019 contributions guided by the need to deliver collectively the Union target.\n\n\n(6)The binding target of at least a 40% domestic reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 was formally approved as the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Union and its Member States to the Paris Agreement at the Environment Council meeting on 6 March 2015. The Paris Agreement was ratified by the Union on 5 October 2016\n13\n and entered into force on 4 November 2016. It replaces the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which will not be continued beyond 2020. Therefore the Union\u2019s system for monitoring and reporting emissions and removals should be updated in the light of this.\n\n\n(7)The European Council also concluded on 24 October 2014\n14\n that a reliable and transparent governance system, without any unnecessary administrative burden, should be developed to help ensure that the Union meets its energy policy goals, with the necessary flexibility for Member States and fully respecting their freedom to determine their energy mix. It emphasized that such governance system should build on existing building blocks, such as national climate programmes, national plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the need to streamline and bring together separate planning and reporting strands. It also agreed to step up the role and rights of consumers, transparency and predictability for investors, inter alia by systematic monitoring of key indicators for an affordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy system and to facilitate coordination of national energy policies and foster regional cooperation between Member States.\n\n\n(8)The Commission's Energy Union Strategy of 25 February 2015 states the need for an integrated Governance to make sure that energy-related actions at Union, regional, national and local level all contribute to the Energy Union's objectives, thereby broadening the scope of Governance \u2013 beyond the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy \u2013 to all five key dimensions of the Energy Union.\n\n\n(9)In its Communication on the State of the Energy Union of 18 November 2015\n15\n the Commission further specified that integrated national energy and climate plans, addressing all five key dimensions of the Energy Union, are necessary tools for a more strategic energy and climate policy planning. As part of the State of the Energy Union, the Commission Guidance to Member States on integrated national energy and climate plans provided the basis for Member States to start developing national plans for the period 2021 to 2030 and set out the main pillars of the governance process. The State of the Energy Union also specified that the Governance should be anchored in legislation.\n\n\n(10)The Conclusions of the Council of 26 November 2015\n16\n recognised that the Governance of the Energy Union will be an essential tool for the efficient and effective construction of the Energy Union and the achievement of its objectives. They underlined that the governance system should be based on the principles of integration of strategic planning and reporting on the implementation of climate and energy policies and coordination between actors responsible for energy and climate policy, at Union, regional and national level. They also underlined that the Governance should ensure that the agreed energy and climate targets for 2030 are met; and that the Governance would monitor the Union\u2019s collective progress towards the achievement of the policy objectives across the five dimensions of the Energy Union. \n\n\n(11)The European Parliament's resolution \"Towards a European Energy Union\" of 15\u00a0December 2015\n17\n called for the Governance framework for the Energy Union to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved.\n\n\n(12)Therefore, the main objective of the Energy Union Governance should be to enable the achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union and in particular the targets of the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy. This Regulation is therefore linked to sectorial legislation implementing the 2030 targets for energy and climate. While Member States need flexibility to choose policies that are best-matched to their national energy mix and preferences, that flexibility should be compatible with further market integration, increased competition, the attainment of climate and energy objectives and the gradual shift towards a low-carbon economy.\n\n\n\n\n(13)The transition to a low-carbon economy requires changes in investment behaviour and incentives across the entire policy spectrum. Achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions requires a boost to efficiency and innovation in the European economy and in particular should also lead to improvements of air quality.\n\n\n(14)As greenhouse gases and air pollutants largely derive from common sources, policy designed to reduce GHGs can have co-benefits for air quality that could offset some or all of the near-term costs of GHG mitigation. As data reported under Directive 2001/81/EC\n18\n represent an important input for the compilation of the GHG inventory and the national plans, the importance of compilation and reporting of consistent data between Directive 2001/81/EC and the GHG inventory should be recognised.\n\n\n(15)The experience gained in implementing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013\n19\n indicated the need for synergies and coherence with reporting under other legal instruments, in particular with Directive 2003/87/EC\n20\n, Regulation\u00a0(EC)\u00a0No\u00a0166/2006\n21\n, Regulation (EC) No 517/2014\n22\n, and Regulation\u00a0(EC)\u00a0No 1099/2008\n23\n. The use of consistent data to report greenhouse gas emissions is essential to ensuring the quality of emissions reporting.\n\n\n(16)In line with the Commission's strong commitment to Better Regulation, the Energy Union Governance should result in a significant reduction of administrative burden for the Member States, the Commission and other Union Institutions and it should help to ensure coherence and adequacy of policies and measures at Union and national level with regard to the transformation of the energy system towards a low-carbon economy.\n\n\n(17)The achievement of the Energy Union objectives should be ensured through a combination of Union initiatives and coherent national policies set out in integrated national energy and climate plans. Sectorial Union legislation in the energy and climate fields sets out planning requirements, which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level. Their introduction at different moments in time has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas. Current separate planning, reporting and monitoring in the climate and energy fields should therefore as far as possible be streamlined and integrated. \n\n\n(18)The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five key dimensions of the Energy Union and corresponding policies and measures to meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The national plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the national plans are consistent with and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n(19)A mandatory template for the national plans should be established to ensure that all national plans are sufficiently comprehensive and to facilitate comparison and aggregation of national plans, while at the same time ensuring sufficient flexibility to Member States to set out the details of national plans reflecting national preferences and specificities.\n\n\n(20)The implementation of policies and measures in the areas of the energy and climate has an impact on the environment. Member States should therefore ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in and to be consulted on the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance, where applicable, with the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC\n24\n and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"UNECE\") Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (the \"Aarhus convention\"). Member States should also ensure involvement of social partners in the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans.\n\n\n(21)Regional cooperation is key to ensure an effective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union. Member States should get the opportunity to comment on other Member States' plans before they are finalised to avoid inconsistencies and potential negative impacts on other Member States and ensure that common objectives are met collectively. Regional cooperation in elaborating and finalising national plans as well as in the subsequent implementation of national plans should be essential to improve effectiveness and efficiency of measures and foster market integration and energy security. \n\n\n(22)National plans should be stable to ensure transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investor certainty. Updates of national plans should however be foreseen once during the ten-year period covered to give Member States the opportunity to adapt to significant changing circumstances. For the plans covering the period from 2021 to 2030, Member States should be able to update their plans in 2024. Targets, objectives and contributions should only be modified to reflect an increased overall ambition in particular as regards the 2030 targets for energy and climate. As part of the updates, Member States should make efforts to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that become apparent as part of the integrated reporting.\n\n\n(23)Stable long-term low emission strategies are crucial to contribute towards economic transformation, jobs, growth and the achievement of broader sustainable development goals, as well as to move in a fair and cost-effective manner towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, Parties to the Paris Agreement are invited to communicate, by 2020, their mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. \n\n\n(24)As is the case for planning, sectorial Union legislation in the energy and climate fields sets out reporting requirements, many of which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level, but those requirements have been introduced at different moments in time which has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas such as GHG mitigation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and market integration. To strike the right balance between the need to ensure a proper follow-up of the implementation of national plans and the need to reduce administrative burden, Member States should therefore establish biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans and other developments in the energy system. Some reporting however, particularly with regard to reporting requirements in the climate field stemming from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNFCCC\") and Union Regulations, would still be necessary on a yearly basis. \n\n\n(25)Member States' integrated progress reports should mirror the elements set out in the template for the national plans. A template for the integrated progress reports should be detailed in subsequent implementing act(s) given their technical nature and the fact that the first progress reports are due in 2021. The progress reports should be carried out in order to ensure transparency towards the Union, other Member States and market actors including consumers. They should be comprehensive across the five dimensions of the Energy Union and, for the first period, at the same time put emphasis on areas covered by the targets of the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework.\n\n\n(26)Under the UNFCCC, the Union and its Member States are required to develop, regularly update, publish and report to the Conference of the Parties national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases using comparable methodologies agreed by the Conference of the Parties. The GHG inventories are key to enabling the tracking of progress with the implementation of the decarbonisation dimension and for assessing compliance with the legislation in the field of climate, in particular Regulation [OP: act number XXX on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for  a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change]\n25\n (\"Regulation [ ] [ESR]\") and Regulation [OP: act number XXX on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change] (\"Regulation [ ] [LULUCF]\")\n26\n.\n\n\n(27)Decision 1/CP.16 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC requires the establishment of national arrangements to estimate anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases. This Regulation should enable the establishment of those national arrangements.\n\n\n(28)The experience in the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 demonstrated the importance of transparency, accuracy, consistency, completeness and comparability of information. Building on that experience, this Regulation should ensure that Member States report on their policies and measures and projections as a key component of the progress reports. The information in those reports should be essential for demonstrating the timely implementation of commitments under Regulation [ ] [ESR]. Operating and continuously improving systems at Union and Member State level coupled with better guidance on reporting should significantly contribute towards an on-going strengthening of the information necessary in order to track progress in the decarbonisation dimension. \n\n\n(29)This Regulation should ensure reporting by Member States on adaptation to climate change and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries, thereby facilitating the implementation of the Union's commitments under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. Furthermore, information on national adaptation actions and support is also important in the context of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans, especially as regards adaptation to those adverse effects of climate change related to the security of the Union's energy supply such as the availability of cooling water for power plants and biomass availability for energy, and information on support relevant to the external dimension of the Energy Union.\n\n\n(30)In order to limit administrative burden on Member States and the Commission, the latter should establish an online reporting platform to facilitate communication and promote cooperation. That should ensure timely submission of reports and facilitate improved transparency on national reporting. The e-reporting platform should complement, build on and benefit from existing reporting processes, databases and e-tools, such as those of the European Environment Agency (EEA), Eurostat (ESTAT), the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the lessons learned from the Union's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).\n\n\n(31)As concerns data to be provided to the Commission by means of national planning and reporting, information from Member States should not duplicate data and statistics which have already been made available via Eurostat in the context of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics\n27\n in the same form as under the planning and reporting obligations of this Regulation and are still available from Eurostat with the same values. Where available and appropriate in terms of timing, reported data and projections provided in the national energy and climate plans should build on and be consistent with Eurostat data and the methodology used for reporting European statistics in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\n\n\n(32)It will be essential for the Commission to assess draft national plans as well as the implementation of notified national plans by means of progress reports in view of the collective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union Strategy, for the first period in particular with regard to the Union-level 2030 targets for energy and climate and national contributions to those targets. Such assessment should be undertaken on a biennial basis, and on an annual basis only where necessary, and should be consolidated in the Commission's State of the Energy Union reports.\n\n\n\n\n(33)Aviation has impacts on the global climate as a result of the release of CO2 as well as of other emissions, including nitrogen oxides emissions, and mechanisms, such as cirrus cloud enhancement. In the light of the rapidly developing scientific understanding of those impacts, an updated assessment of the non-CO2 impacts of aviation on the global climate is already foreseen in Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. The modelling used in this respect should be adapted to scientific progress. Based on its assessments of such impacts, the Commission could consider relevant policy options for addressing them.\n\n\n(34)To help ensure coherence between national and Union policies and objectives of the Energy Union, there should be an on-going dialogue between the Commission and the Member States. As appropriate, the Commission should issue recommendations to Member States including on the level of ambition of the national plans, on the subsequent implementation of policies and measures of the notified national plans, and on other national policies and measures of relevance for the implementation of the Energy Union. Member States should take utmost account of such recommendations and explain in subsequent progress reports how they have been implemented.\n\n\n(35)Should the ambition of integrated national energy and climate plans or their updates be insufficient for the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives and, for the first period, in particular the 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the Commission should take measures at Union level in order to ensure the collective achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any 'ambition gap'). Should progress made by the Union towards these objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission may, in addition to issuing recommendations, take measures at Union level or request additional measures from Member States in order to ensure their achievement (thereby closing any 'delivery gap'). Such measures should take into account early ambitious contributions made by Member States to the 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency when sharing the effort for collective target achievement. In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include financial contributions by Member States to a financing platform managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to renewable energy projects across the Union. Recommendations and measures in the area of renewable energy should take into account early ambitious contributions made by Member States to collectively achieve the Union's 2030 target. Member States' national renewable energy targets for 2020 should serve as baseline shares of renewable energy from 2021 onwards. In the area of energy efficiency, additional measures can in particular aim at improving the energy efficiency of products, buildings and transport.\n\n\n(36)The Union and the Member States should strive to provide the most up-to-date information on their greenhouse gas emissions and removals. This Regulation should enable such estimates to be prepared in the shortest timeframes possible by using statistical and other information, such as, where appropriate, space-based data provided by the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme and other satellite systems.\n\n\n(37)Under Regulation [ ] [ESR], the approach of the annual commitment cycle taken in Decision No 406/2009/EC\n28\n will continue. That requires a comprehensive review of Member States\u2019 greenhouse gas inventories to enable the assessment of compliance and the application of corrective action, where necessary. A review process at Union level of the greenhouse gas inventories submitted by Member States is necessary to ensure that compliance with Regulation [ ] [ESR] is assessed in a credible, consistent, transparent and timely manner.\n\n\n(38)Member States and the Commission should ensure close cooperation on all matters relating to the implementation of the Energy Union and this Regulation, with close involvement of the European Parliament. The Commission should as appropriate assist Member States in implementing this Regulation, particularly with regard to the establishment of the national plans and associated capacity building.\n\n\n(39)Member States should ensure that integrated national energy and climate plans take into consideration the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.\n\n\n(40)The European Environment Agency should assist the Commission, as appropriate and in accordance with its annual work programme, with assessment, monitoring and reporting work. \n\n\n(41)The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend the general framework for integrated national energy and climate plans (template), set up a financing platform to which Member States can contribute in case the Union trajectory towards the 2030 Union renewable energy target is not collectively met, take account of changes in the global warming potentials (\"GWPs\") and internationally agreed inventory guidelines, set substantive requirements for the Union inventory system and set up the registries pursuant to Article 33. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. It should also take into account, where necessary, decisions adopted under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n(42)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Articles 15(3), 17(4), 23(6), 31(3) and (4) and 32(3) of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\u00a0February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers.\n\n\n(43)The Commission should be assisted in its tasks under this Regulation by an Energy Union Committee to prepare implementing acts. It should replace and take on the assignments of the Climate Change Committee and other committees as appropriate. \n\n\n(44)The Commission should review the implementation of this Regulation in 2026 and make amending proposals as appropriate to ensure the proper implementation of the Regulation and the achievement of its objectives. The review should take into account evolving circumstances and be informed by the results of the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, where necessary.\n\n\n(45)This Regulation integrates, amends, replaces and repeals certain planning, reporting and monitoring obligations currently contained in sectorial energy and climate Union legislation to ensure a streamlined and integrated approach to the main planning, reporting and monitoring strands. Directives 94/22/EC\n29\n, 98/70/EC\n30\n, 2009/31/EC\n31\n, Regulations\u00a0(EC) No 663/2009\n32\n, (EC) No 715/2009\n33\n, Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n34\n, Council\u00a0Directive 2009/119/EC\n35\n, Directives 2010/31/EU\n36\n, 2012/27/EU\n37\n, 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council \n38\n and Council Directive (EU) 2015/652\n39\n should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(46)This Regulation also integrates in full the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. As a consequence, Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 should be repealed as of 1 January 2021. However, in order to ensure that the implementation of Decision No 406/2009/EC continues under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and that certain aspects linked to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol remain covered by legislation, it is necessary that certain provisions remain applicable after this date.\n\n\n(47)Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\u00a0\nSubject matter and scope\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation establishes a Governance mechanism to \n\n\n\n\n(a)implement strategies and measures designed to meet the objectives and targets of the Energy Union, and for the first ten-year period from 2021 to 2030 in particular the EU's 2030 targets for energy and climate; \n\n\n(b)ensure the timeliness, transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability and completeness of reporting by the Union and its Member States to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement secretariat.\n\n\nThe governance mechanism shall be based on integrated national energy and climate plans covering ten-year periods starting from 2021 to 2030, corresponding integrated national energy and climate progress reports by the Member States and integrated monitoring arrangements by the European Commission.

action redirected towards a new action\u00a0\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation aims at ensuring a coordinated and coherent implementation of the Energy Union Strategy across its five dimensions, as well as the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives through a combination of EU and national measures on the basis of streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring obligations and a functional governance process between the Commission and Member States. \n\n\nThe setting up of an Energy Union is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and this proposal is an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union.\n\n\nThe proposal is jointly prepared by DG Energy and DG Climate Action. \n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective No\n\n\nFor DG Energy: Specific Objective 6: Implementation and follow-up on the overall Energy Union strategy.\n\n\n\nFor DG Climate Action: Specific objective 6: Implementation of the Energy Union Strategy towards an enhanced climate and energy governance mechanism including streamlined reporting and planning post 2020 (coordination with DG ENER).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nSpending of DG Energy is taking place through ABB activity 32.02 Conventional and Renewable Energy (or ABB1: Conventional and Renewable Energy).\n\n\nIn the 2016 Management Plan and in line with the new structure of specific objectives following the Energy Union, ABB 1 contributes to all 6 specific objectives including the competitiveness aspects of specific objective 5. \n\n\nFor DG CLIMA it is under activity ABB Activity 34 02 \u2013 \"Climate action at Union and international level \n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans and corresponding Progress Reports should minimise administrative burden for the Member States and the Commission, while improving the quality of information and transparency, ensuring a timely implementation and monitoring of the Energy Union objectives, as well as improving inter-linkages and synergies between the energy and climate fields.\n\n\nStreamlining existing planning, reporting obligations of Member States and monitoring obligations of the Commission would improve the situation for all stakeholders in line with the Better Regulation principles of effectiveness, efficiency, EU added value, relevance and coherence.\n\n\nFurthermore, this proposal will specify the content and adequate periodicity of National Plans, Progress Reports and integrated monitoring by the Commission, as well as the related governance process between the Member States and the Commission including regional coordination. It aims at synchronising with the Paris Climate Agreement's 5-year review cycles.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the proposal should ensure transparent information on the progress of Member States and of the EU collectively towards the Energy Union objectives for 2030 and beyond and provide a governance framework that is suitable for the implementation of the Energy Union Strategy.\n\n\nIndicator for the implementation of the proposal is: Number of Member States that provide integrated plans in time (as specified in the Regulation).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nMember States would have to submit less national plans and reports required by different sectorial legal instruments, but instead should submit integrated plans and reports to the Commission at regular intervals. On the basis of the information provided by the Member States, the Commission should produce the necessary monitoring reports.  \n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, having in mind that several elements of the Energy Union Strategy relate to objectives set at the EU level, action at EU level is needed to ensure the attainment of these objectives as well as coherence of energy and climate policies within the EU and across its Member States, while preserving flexibility for Member States. \n\n\nMoreover, the majority of the energy challenges facing the Union cannot be met through uncoordinated national action. The same holds true for climate change, which by its nature is a trans-boundary problem and cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Therefore, coordination of climate action at both European and global level is necessary. Consequently, EU action is justified to monitor the progress of implementation of energy and climate policies across the EU in line with the Energy Union objectives as well as the functioning of the internal energy market.\n\n\nSecond, because of the cross-border relevance of each dimension of the Energy Union, EU action is needed to further promote enhanced cooperation among Member States. None of the Energy Union dimensions could be effectively implemented in the absence of an EU governance process between Member States and the Commission which will also ensure a more regional approach to energy and climate policy. It is also necessary to create the enabling framework to ensure that the EU is ready to participate fully in the review processes under the Paris Agreement, ensuring maximum synchronisation and synergies.\n\n\nThird, EU action is justified for the initiative's objective of streamlining existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations, as existing EU legislation in the energy acquis as well as the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation can only be amended by means of legislative proposals in order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States and the Commission and enhance the coherence of planning and reporting as well as to ensure comparability of National Plans and Progress Reports. \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nMost of the current planning, reporting and monitoring obligations provide benefits in terms of useful information on a specific policy area and support the implementation of specific policy objectives set out in sectorial legislation. The current reporting obligations on the Commission ensure that the Commission informs the European Parliament, the Council and the general public about the results achieved by EU legislation and the progress made by the EU and its Member States in fulfilling their respective obligations under international commitments under the UNFCCC. \n\n\nHowever, the existing framework is unsuitable for the 2030 targets for energy and climate and Energy Union objectives, as it fails to ensure policy coherence among obligations in the energy field and consistency between the energy and climate fields. Furthermore, some of the current plans and reports are seen as having high administrative costs. \n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with the review of Directive 2009/28/EC (Renewable Energy Directive), of Directive 2010/31/EU (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), of Directive 2012/27/EU (Energy Efficiency Directive) and with the Market Design Initiative. \n\n\nIt is also consistent with the Decision 406/2009 EC (Effort Sharing Decision \u2013 valid 2013-20), its proposed successor for the period 2021-30, COM(2016) 482 final - 2016/0231 (COD) (Proposal for a Regulation on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for  a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change), as well as the LULUCF Proposal, COM(2016) 479 final - 2016/0230 (COD) (Proposal for a Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change). These initiatives aim at establishing a post-2020 sector-specific legal framework, while the current proposal shall establish the overall governance framework for reaching the Energy Union objectives.\n\n\nIt is also consistent with Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2018 for unlimited duration,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n42\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2611 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\nx\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013x bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nThe participation of the JRC and EEA will be needed for the implementation of the requirements of this Regulation. \n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Regulation sets the periodicity and conditions for planning, reporting and monitoring by Member States and the Commission. External technical support from a contractor would be needed for the Commission's monitoring tasks. Furthermore, it is planned that a new communication tool is set up, including a web platform and a public website for the exchange of information and best practices and divulgation to the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nMember States may become delayed in their planning and reporting obligations. Also for this reason, there will be a web database established. Data quality and completeness may also be important risks particularly at the beginning of the process.\n\n\nThe risks related to the functioning of the web platform relate mainly to IT-related problems, such as a possible breakdown of the system and confidentiality issues. \n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe control methods envisaged are laid

redirected towards a new action\u00a0\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nThe proposed Regulation aims at ensuring a coordinated and coherent implementation of the Energy Union Strategy across its five dimensions, as well as the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives through a combination of EU and national measures on the basis of streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring obligations and a functional governance process between the Commission and Member States. \n\n\nThe setting up of an Energy Union is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and this proposal is an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union.\n\n\nThe proposal is jointly prepared by DG Energy and DG Climate Action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective No\n\n\nFor DG Energy: Specific Objective 6: Implementation and follow-up on the overall Energy Union Strategy.\n\n\nFor DG Climate Action: For DG Climate Action: Specific objective 6: Implementation of the Energy Union Strategy towards an enhanced climate and energy governance mechanism including streamlined reporting and planning post 2020 (coordination with DG ENER).\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nSpending of DG Energy is taking place through ABB activity 32.02 Conventional and Renewable Energy (or ABB1: Conventional and Renewable Energy).\n\n\nIn the 2016 Management Plan and in line with the new structure of specific objectives following the Energy Union, ABB 1 contributes to all 6 specific objectives including the competitiveness aspects of specific objective 5. \n\n\nFor DG CLIMA it is under activity ABB Activity 34 02 \u2013 \"Climate action at Union and international level. \n\n\nThe proposal also concerns Strategic area 1.3 of the European Environment Agency\u2019s Multiannual Work Programme: \u201cInforming policy implementation on climate change mitigation and energy\u201d, as well as Strategic area 3.2 \u201cTechnical systems development\u201d.\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans and corresponding Progress Reports should minimise administrative burden for the Member States and the Commission, while improving the quality of information and transparency, ensuring a timely implementation and monitoring of the Energy Union objectives, as well as improving inter-linkages and synergies between the energy and climate fields.\n\n\nStreamlining existing planning, reporting obligations of Member States and monitoring obligations of the Commission would improve the situation for all stakeholders in line with the Better Regulation principles of effectiveness, efficiency, EU added value, relevance and coherence.\n\n\nFurthermore, this proposal will specify the content and adequate periodicity of National Plans, Progress Reports and integrated monitoring by the Commission, as well as the related governance process between the Member States and the Commission including regional coordination. It aims at synchronising with the Paris Climate Agreement's 5-year review cycles.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the proposal should ensure transparent information on the progress of Member States and of the EU collectively towards the Energy Union objectives for 2030 and beyond and provide a governance framework that is suitable for the implementation of the Energy Union Strategy.\n\n\nIndicator for the implementation of the proposal is: Number of Member States that provide integrated plans, biennial progress reports and annual reports in time (as specified in the Regulation).\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nMember States would have to submit less national plans and reports required by different sectorial legal instruments, but instead should submit integrated plans and reports to the Commission at regular intervals. On the basis of the information provided by the Member States, the Commission should produce the necessary monitoring reports.  \n\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nFirst, having in mind that several elements of the Energy Union Strategy relate to objectives set at the EU level, action at EU level is needed to ensure the attainment of these objectives as well as coherence of energy and climate policies within the EU and across its Member States, while preserving flexibility for Member States. \n\n\nMoreover, the majority of the energy challenges facing the Union cannot be met through uncoordinated national action. The same holds true for climate change, which by its nature is a trans-boundary problem and cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Therefore, coordination of climate action at both European and global level is necessary. Consequently, EU action is justified to monitor the progress of implementation of energy and climate policies across the EU in line with the Energy Union objectives as well as the functioning of the internal energy market.\n\n\nSecond, because of the cross-border relevance of each dimension of the Energy Union, EU action is needed to further promote enhanced cooperation among Member States. None of the Energy Union dimensions could be effectively implemented in the absence of an EU governance process between Member States and the Commission which will also ensure a more regional approach to energy and climate policy. It is also necessary to create the enabling framework to ensure that the EU is ready to participate fully in the review processes under the Paris Agreement, ensuring maximum synchronisation and synergies.\n\n\nThird, EU action is justified for the initiative's objective of streamlining existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations, as existing EU legislation in the energy acquis as well as the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation can only be amended by means of legislative proposals in order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States and the Commission and enhance the coherence of planning and reporting as well as to ensure comparability of National Plans and Progress Reports.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nMost of the current planning, reporting and monitoring obligations provide benefits in terms of useful information on a specific policy area and support the implementation of specific policy objectives set out in sectorial legislation. The current reporting obligations on the Commission ensure that the Commission informs the European Parliament, the Council and the general public about the results achieved by EU legislation and the progress made by the EU and its Member States in fulfilling their respective obligations under international commiments under the UNFCCC. \n\n\nHowever, the existing framework is unsuitable for the 2030 targets for energy and climate and Energy Union objectives, as it fails to ensure policy coherence among obligations in the energy field and consistency between the energy and climate fields. Furthermore, some of the current plans and reports are seen as having high administrative costs.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with the review of Directive 2009/28/EC (Renewable Energy Directive), of Directive 2010/31/EU (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), of Directive 2012/27/EU (Energy Efficiency Directive) and with the Market Design Initiative. \n\n\nIt is also consistent with the Decision 406/2009 EC (Effort Sharing Decision \u2013 valid 2013-20), its proposed successor for the period 2021-30, COM(2016) 482 final - 2016/0231 (COD) (Proposal for a Regulation on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 for  a resilient Energy Union and to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change), as well as the LULUCF Proposal, COM(2016) 479 final - 2016/0230 (COD) (Proposal for a Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework and amending Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change). These initiatives aim at establishing a post-2020 sector-specific legal framework, while the current proposal shall establish the overall governance framework for reaching the Energy Union objectives.\n\n\nIt is also consistent with Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2018 for unlimited duration,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n57\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2611 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\nx\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013x bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nThe participation of the EEA will be needed for the implementation of the requirements of this Regulation. \n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Regulation sets the periodicity and conditions for planning, reporting and monitoring by Member States and the Commission.

Existing policies and measures encompass implemented and adopted policies and measures. Adopted policies and measures are those for which an official government decision has been made by the date of submission of the national plan and there is a clear commitment to proceed with implementation. Implemented policies and measures are those for which one or more of the following applies at the date of submission of the national plan: national legislation is in force, one or more voluntary agreements have been established, financial resources have been allocated, human resources have been mobilised. \n\n\n\n(22)\nThe selection of exogenous factors may be based on the assumptions made in the EU Reference Scenario 2016 or other subsequent policy scenarios for the same variables. Besides, Member States specific results of the EU Reference Scenario 2016 as well as results of subsequent policy scenarios may also be a useful source of information when developing national projections with existing policies and measures and impact assessments.\n\n\n\n(23)\nIn accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU.\n\n\n\n(24)\nThis reference business as usual projection shall be the basis for the 2030 final and primary energy consumption target which is described in 2.3 and conversion factors.\n\n\n\n(25)\nWith reference to overviews of existing transmission infrastructure by Transmission System Operators (TSOs).\n\n\n\n(26)\nWith reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs.\n\n\n\n(27)\nWith reference to overviews of existing transmission infrastructure by TSOs.\n\n\n\n(28)\nWith reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs.\n\n\n\n(29)\nPlanned policies and measures are options under discussion and having a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the national plan. The resulting projections under section 5.1.i shall therefore include not only implemented and adopted policies and measures (projections with existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.\n\n\n\n(30)\nDirective [as proposed by COM/2013/0920] on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC.\n\n\n\n(31)\nFor the plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030: For each parameter/variable in the list, trends over the years 2005-2040 (2005-2050 where appropriate) including for the year 2030 in five year intervals shall be reported both in section 4 and 5. Parameter based on exogenous assumptions vs. modelling output shall be indicated. \n\n\n\n(32)\nAs far as possible, reported data and projections shall build on and be consistent with EUROSTAT data and methodology used for reporting European statistics in respective sectorial legislations, as European statistics are the primary source of statistical data used for reporting and monitoring, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics.\n\n\n\n(33)\nNote: all projections are to be performed on the basis of constant prices (2016 prices used as base year)\n\n\n\n(34)\nThe Commission will provide recommendations for key parameters for projections, at least covering oil, gas, and coal import prices as well as EU ETS carbon prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
