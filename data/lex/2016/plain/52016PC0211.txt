"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 18.4.2016\nCOM(2016) 211 final\n2016/0114(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council decision establishes the Union position on a Decision by the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee under the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part ('the Agreement') on the modification of Annex XXIV of the Agreement. The Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014, and is provisionally applied in part, since 1 September 2014. \n\n\nThe proposed modification aims to implement the provisions of Chapter 4 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement. In particular, in Article 181 of the Agreement the Republic of Moldova committed to submit a list of Union sanitary and phytosanitary acquis to which it intends to approximate its domestic legislation. That list is to be added to Annex XXIV of the Agreement, by decision of the EU-Moldova Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Union\u2019s common commercial policy towards the Republic of Moldova, an Eastern Neighbourhood Partner country, based on the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement and in particular its objective to create a free-trade area between the parties. This proposal implements the Agreement's provisions that aim to boost agricultural trade between the parties and in particular improve agricultural export capacity of the Republic of Moldova, on the basis of the Union acquis. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with and contributes to the implementation of other external policies of the Union, notably the European Neighbourhood Policy and the development cooperation policy in relation to the Republic of Moldova.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0establishing the Union position to be taken in the committees set up by the Agreement is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU'), and in particular its Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments set out in the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(9) of the TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe Republic of Moldova prepared the list of Union acquis to which it intends to approximate its domestic legislation, in line with appropriate domestic procedures. EU stakeholder consultations are not applicable to this proposal.\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Union made its expertise in sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare matters available to the authorities of the Republic of Moldova for the purpose of preparing the list of Union acquis intended for approximation by that partner country. \n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nThe trade and trade-related provisions of the Agreement have been subject to an ex-ante impact assessment in 2009, followed by the Commission DG Trade's Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment of 2012, which fed into the DCFTA negotiation process. That study confirmed that implementation of trade and trade-related provisions would have no negative impact on the Union, its acquis or its policies, while projecting a positive impact on the economic development of the Republic of Moldova. This proposal does not have any impact on the economic, social or environmental policy of the Union. \n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe Agreement is not subject to REFIT procedures at this stage; it does not imply any costs for the Union SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights in the Union. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe implementation of the Agreement is reviewed regularly by the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Council and its sub-ordinate bodies established by that Agreement. The European Commission also committed to report annually on the implementation of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement, including on the elements included in this proposal, to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims to adopt a Union position in relation to the amendment of Annex XXIV-B to the Agreement. In accordance with Article 181(4) of the Agreement, that Annex is to list the Union acquis to which the Republic of Moldova intends to approximate its legislation in the area of sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare measures, for the purpose of achieving a status of equivalence for a product or a group of products, as provided for in Article 183 of the Agreement. \n\n\nThe Republic of Moldova prepared such a list of Union acquis in accordance with its domestic procedures, submitted the proposal in November 2014 and finalised it, in consultation with the European Commission, in July 2015. \n\n\nThe EU-Republic of Moldova Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee is empowered to take a decision on modification of Annex XXIV-B in accordance with Article 191 of the Agreement. In line with the provisions of that Article, the Sub-Committee monitors the implementation of Chapter 4 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) of Title V (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement and takes decisions, as appropriate, on the modification of Annexes XVII-XXV to the Agreement.\n\n\n2016/0114 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 464(3) and (4) of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, and their Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part, ('the Agreement') provide for the provisional application of the Agreement in part, as specified by the Union.\n\n\n(1)Article 3 of Council Decision 2014/492/EU\n1\n specifies the provisions of the Agreement to be applied provisionally, including the provisions on the sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare measures, the establishment and functioning of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee and the related Annexes XVII to XXV to the Agreement.
