The objective is to ensure a legislative framework that is fit for purpose and of high-quality, as referred to in the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making. To that end, the Commission has identified these obsolete Regulations which the Commission is proposing to repeal.\n\n\n1.1.Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89\n\n\nBased on Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 introduced arrangements for structural improvements in the inland waterway sector for the fleets operating on the linked inland waterway networks of Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria.   \n\n\nThe objective of that Regulation was to reduce overcapacity in the inland waterway fleets by means of vessel-scrapping schemes coordinated at Community level. Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 was designed to be limited in time as explained in article 8(1). It stopped producing effect as of 28 April 1999.\n\n\nOn 29 March 1999 Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport was adopted in order to ensure that the appropriate tools continued to be available to the inland waterway transport sector and to manage the fleet capacity. This Regulation entered into force on 29 April 1999 to succeed to Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89.\n\n\n1.2.Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000\n\n\nBased on Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 distributed the quotas for heavy goods vehicles which the Community received from Switzerland for years 2001 to 2004 among its Member States. \n\n\nArticle 8 of the \n\nAgreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road\n\n, which was signed on 21 June 1999 and which entered into force on 1 June 2002, provided for such quotas for vehicles with a total weight between 34 tonnes and 40 tonnes as transitional arrangements for years 2001 to 2004. \n\n\nIn accordance with Article 8(6) of the Agreement and with effect from 1 January 2005, all vehicles meeting the technical standards of Directive 96/53/EC (that is to say, up to a maximum weight of 40 tonnes) \"shall be exempt, under Article 32, from any quota or authorisation arrangements.\"\n\n\nAs from 2005 there is no longer a need to distribute quotas amongst  Member States, Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 has become obsolete and should be repealed. \n\n\n1.1.Regulation (EC) No 685/2001\n\n\nBased on Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 685/2001 lays down the rules for the distribution between the Member States of authorisations available to the Community by virtue of Article 6(2) of the agreements between the European Community and the Republic of Bulgaria and between the European Community and Romania establishing certain conditions for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport. \n\n\nThe Regulation has become obsolete as Bulgaria and Romania have acceded to the Union and as Member States they are no longer subject to a system of authorisations as far as access to the haulage market is concerned.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe proposal consists of repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 685/2001 and (EC) No 2888/2000. \n\n\n\n\n2016/0368 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nrepealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 \n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n1\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n2\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission have confirmed their joint commitment to update and simplify legislation in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016\n3\n.\n\n\n(2)In order to clean-up and reduce the volume of the legislative acquis, it is necessary to regularly analyse it and identify obsolete legislation. Repealing the obsolete legislation is useful for keeping the legislative framework transparent, clear and easy to use by Member States and relevant stakeholders, in this case the road haulage sector.\n\n\n(3)The Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89\n4\n in 1989. Ten years later, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 718/1999\n5\n  in order to ensure that the appropriate tools continued to be available to the inland waterway transport sector and to manage the fleet capacity. That Regulation covered the same subject matter as Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, without repealing the latter. \n\n\n(4)In accordance with Article 8(6) of the \n\nAgreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road\n\n\n6\n, all vehicles meeting the technical standards of Council Directive 96/53/EC\n7\n have been exempt from any quota or authorisation arrangements since 1 January 2005. Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 of the European Parliament and the Council\n8\n which concerns the distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles travelling in Switzerland should therefore be considered as obsolete. \n\n\n(5)Following the accession of both the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the Union on 1 January 2007, Regulation No 685/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council\n9\n is no longer necessary as those Member States are no longer required to obtain authorisation for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport.\n\n\n(6)As a consequence, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 685/2001 and (EC) No 2888/2000 should be repealed,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 are repealed.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\nThe President\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(4)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 of 27 April 1989 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (OJ L 116, 28.4.1989, p. 25).\n\n\n\n(5)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 of 29 March 1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport (OJ L 90, 2.4.1999, p. 1).\n\n\n\n(6)\nO.J.
