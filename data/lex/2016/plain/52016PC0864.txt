At the same time, the energy sector plays a key role in the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by at least 40% until 2030 with an expected share of 50% of renewables by 2030. \n\n\nThe proposals for a recast of the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity, the Regulation on the electricity market and the Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are part of the Commission's broader package of initiatives (\"Clean Energy for All Europeans\"). The Package comprises the Commission's key proposals to implement the Energy Union, as foreseen in the Energy Union Roadmap\n1\n. It includes both legislative proposals as well as non-legislative initiatives to create a conducive enabling framework to deliver tangible benefits for citizens, jobs, growth and investments while contributing to all five dimensions of the Energy Union. The key priorities for the package are thus energy efficiency first, the EU's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers.\n\n\nBoth the European Council\n2\n and the European Parliament\n3\n have repeatedly stressed that a well-functioning integrated energy market is the best tool to guarantee affordable energy prices, secure energy supplies and to allow for the integration and development of larger volumes of electricity produced from renewable sources in a cost efficient manner. Competitive prices are essential for achieving growth and consumer welfare in the European Union, and hence are at the heart of EU energy policy. The current electricity market design is based on the rules of the \"Third Energy Package\n4\n\", adopted in 2009. These rules have subsequently been complemented by legislation against market abuses\n5\n and implementing legislation concerning electricity trade and grid operation rules\n6\n. The EU internal energy market is built on well-established principles, such as the right of access for third parties to electricity grids, free choice of suppliers for consumers, robust unbundling rules, the removal of barriers to cross-border trade, market supervision by independent energy regulators, and the EU-wide cooperation of regulators and grid operators within the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO).\n\n\nThe Third Energy Package has brought tangible progress for consumers. It has led to increased liquidity of European electricity markets and significantly increased cross-border trade. Consumers in many Member States can now benefit from more choice. Increased competition notably on wholesale markets helped to keep wholesale prices in check. New consumer rights introduced by the Third Energy Package have clearly improved the position of consumers in energy markets. \n\n\nNew developments have led to fundamental changes in European electricity markets. The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E) has steeply increased. This shift towards RES-E will continue as it is a key condition to fulfil the Union's obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate. The physical nature of RES-E \u2013 more variable, less predictable and decentralised than traditional generation \u2013 requires an adaptation of market and grid operation rules to the more flexible nature of the market. In parallel, state interventions, often designed in an uncoordinated manner, have led to distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade\n7\n. Significant changes are also taking place on the technological side. Electricity is traded almost European-wide through so-called \"market coupling\", jointly organised by power exchanges and transmission system operators. Digitalisation and the rapid development of internet-based metering and trading solutions enable industry, businesses and even households to generate and store electricity, as well as participate in electricity markets via so-called 'demand response' solutions. The electricity market of the next decade will be characterised by more variable and decentralised electricity production, an increased interdependence between Member States and new technological opportunities for consumers to reduce their bills and actively participate in electricity markets through demand response, self-consumption or storage. \n\n\nThe present electricity market design initiative thus aims to adapt the current market rules to new market realities, by allowing electricity to move freely to where it is most needed when it is most needed via undistorted price signals, whilst empowering consumers, reaping maximum benefits for society from cross-border competition and providing the right signals and incentives to drive the necessary investments to decarbonise our energy system. It will also give priority to energy efficiency solutions, and contribute to the goal of becoming a world leader in energy production from renewable energy sources, thus contributing to the Union's target to create jobs, growth and attract investments.\n\n\nAdapting market rules\n\n\nThe existing market rules are based on the predominant generation technologies of the last decade, i.e. centralised, large-scale fossil fuel-based power plants with limited participation of consumers. As variable RES-E will play an increasing role in the generation mix in future, and consumers should be enabled to participate in the markets if they wish so, the rules need to be adapted. Short-term electricity markets which allow trading RES-E across borders are key for the successful integration of RES-E into the market. This is because most generation from renewables can only be accurately forecasted shortly before the actual production (due to weather uncertainties). The creation of markets which allow participation at short notice before actual delivery (so-called \"intraday\" or \"balancing\" markets) are a crucial step to enable RES-E producers to sell their energy at fair terms and it will also increase liquidity in the market. Short-term markets will provide new business opportunities for participants to offer \"back-up\" energy solutions at times of high demand and scarce renewable generation. This includes the possibility for consumers to shift their demand (\"demand response\"), storage operators or flexible generators. While dealing with variability in small regions can be very expensive, aggregation of variable production over larger areas could help consumers save significant amounts of money. Yet, integrated short-term markets are still missing.\n\n\nThe shortcomings of the current market arrangements reduce the attractiveness of the energy sector for new investment. An adequately interconnected, market-based energy system in which prices follow market signals will stimulate the necessary investments into generation and transmission in an effective manner and ensure that they are made where they are most needed by the market, thereby minimising the need for state-planned investments. \n\n\nNational market rules (e.g. price caps) and state interventions currently hinder prices from reflecting when electricity is scarce. Furthermore, price zones do not always reflect actual scarcity if poorly configured and instead follow political borders. The new market design aims to improve price signals to drive investment in areas where it is needed most, reflecting grid constraints and demand centres, rather than national borders. Price signals should also allow for adequate remuneration of flexible resources (including demand-response and storage), as these resources rely on rewards for shorter periods of time (e.g. modern gas plants which are only used for peak hours or  the reduction of industrial demand at times of peak demand or system stress). Effective price signals also ensure the efficient dispatch of existing generation assets. It is therefore critical to review any existing rules that distort price formation (such as rules prioritising the dispatch of certain installations) in order to activate and fully realise the flexibility potential that the demand side can offer\n\n\nPutting consumers at the heart of the energy market \n\n\nFully integrating industrial, commercial and residential consumers into the energy system can avoid significant costs for 'backup' generation; costs which consumers would otherwise end up paying. It even allows consumers to benefit from price fluctuations and to earn money through participation in the market. Activating consumer participation is therefore a prerequisite for managing the energy transition successfully and in a cost-effective way. \n\n\nDelivering a new deal for energy consumers is a key commitment of the Energy Union. However, current market rules often do not allow consumers to benefit from these new opportunities. Although consumers can generate and store electricity as well as manage their energy consumption more easily than ever, the current design of the retail market prevents them from being able to fully benefit from such opportunities.\n\n\nIn most Member States, consumers have little or no incentive to change their consumption in response to changing prices in the markets, as real-time price signals are not passed on to final consumers. The market design package is an opportunity to deliver on this commitment. More transparent real time price signals will stimulate consumer participation, either individually or through aggregation, and make the electricity system more flexible, facilitating the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources. Besides offering great energy saving potential for households, technological developments mean that appliances and systems, such as smart white electronics, electric vehicles, electric heating, air conditioning and heat pumps in insulated buildings and district heating and cooling, can automatically follow price fluctuations and, on a large scale, offer a significant and flexible contribution to the electricity grid. In order to enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities, they must have access to fit-for-purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices linked to the spot market. In addition to consumers adjusting their consumption to price signals, new demand services are currently emerging whereby new market actors offer to manage the electricity consumption of a number of consumers by paying them a compensation for their flexibility. Although such services are already encouraged under existing EU legislation, the evidence suggests that these provisions have not been effective in removing the primary market barriers for those service providers to enter the market. Sharpening these provisions is necessary to further encourage such new services.\n\n\nIn many Member States, electricity prices do not follow demand and supply, but are regulated by the public authorities. Price regulation can limit the development of effective competition, discourage investments and the emergence of new market players. The Commission therefore committed in its Energy Union Framework Strategy\n8\n to phase-out regulated prices below cost and to encourage Member States to establish a road map for the phasing-out of all regulated prices.\u00a0The new market design aims at ensuring that supply prices are free of any public intervention, and only with duly justified exceptions.\n\n\n\n\nRapidly falling technology costs mean that more and more consumers are able to reduce their energy bills by using technologies such as rooftop solar panels and batteries. However, self-generation is still hampered by a lack of common rules for 'prosumers'. Appropriate rules could remove these barriers, e.g. by guaranteeing consumers' rights to generate energy for their own consumption and sell surplus into the grid, while taking into account the costs and benefits for the system as a whole (e.g. appropriate participation in grid costs).\n\n\nLocal energy communities can be an efficient way of managing energy at community level by consuming the electricity they generate either directly for power or for (district) heating and cooling, with or without a connection to distribution systems. To ensure that such initiatives can freely develop, the new market design requires Member States to put in place appropriate legal frameworks to enable their activities.\n\n\nToday, more than 90% of variable renewable electricity sources are connected to distribution grids. The integration of local generation has in fact contributed to a significant increase in network tariffs for household consumers. In addition, taxes and levies to finance grid extensions and renewables' investments have risen drastically. The new market design and the revision of the Renewables Directive provide an opportunity to address these shortcomings, which can disproportionately impact certain household consumers.\n\n\nAllowing Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to manage some of the challenges associated with variable generation more locally (e.g. by managing local flexibility resources) could significantly reduce network costs. However, since many DSOs are part of vertically integrated companies which are also active in the supply business, regulatory safeguards are necessary to guarantee the DSOs' neutrality in their new functions, e.g. in terms of data management and when using flexibility to manage local congestions. \n\n\nAnother key driver to competition and consumer engagement is information. Previous Commission consultations and studies have shown that consumers complain about a lack of transparency in electricity markets, reducing their ability to benefit from competition and actively participate in markets. Consumers do not feel informed enough about alternative suppliers, the availability of new energy services and complain about the complexity of offers and procedures for switching suppliers. The reform will also ensure data protection as an increased use of new technologies (notably smart metering systems) will generate a range of energy data carrying high commercial value.\n\n\nIn putting consumers at the heart of the energy market, an essential consideration in the new market design is how to ensure that the most vulnerable in society are protected and that the overall number of energy-poor households will not further increase. With rising levels of energy poverty as well as a lack of clarity on the most appropriate means of tackling consumer vulnerability and energy poverty, the new market design proposal requires Member States to duly measure and regularly monitor energy poverty based on principles defined at EU level. The revised Energy Efficiency and Energy Performance of Building Directives provide for further measures to tackle energy poverty.\n\n\nSecurity of electricity supply\n\n\nSecurity of electricity supply is indispensable in modern societies which largely depend on electricity and internet driven systems. It is therefore necessary to assess the ability of the European electricity system to offer sufficient generation and flexibility to ensure reliable electricity supply at all times (resource adequacy). Ensuring security of supply is not only a national obligation, but a key pillar of European energy policy\n9\n. This is because security of supply can, in a fully interconnected and synchronised network with well-functioning markets, be organised far more efficiently and competitively than on a purely national basis. Grid stability in individual Member States often heavily depends on electricity flows from neighbouring countries and potential security of supply problems therefore usually have a regional impact. For this reason, the most efficient remedies to national generation deficits are often regional solutions, allowing Member States to benefit from generation surpluses in other countries. A coordinated European adequacy assessment should therefore be introduced, following a jointly agreed methodology, in order to obtain a realistic picture of possible generation needs, taking into account the integration of electricity markets and potential flows from other countries. If the coordinated adequacy assessment shows that capacity mechanisms are necessary in certain countries or regions, such mechanisms should be designed so as to minimise distortions to the internal market. Clear and transparent criteria to minimise distortions of cross-border trade, maximise use of demand response, and reduce impacts affecting decarbonisation should therefore be defined to avoid the risk of fragmented national capacity mechanisms creating new market barriers and undermining competition\n10\n.  \n\n\nStrengthening regional cooperation\n\n\nThe close interconnection of EU Member States through the common trans-European grid is unique in the world and a great asset when it comes to dealing efficiently with the energy transition. Without the ability to rely on generation or demand resources from other Member States, the costs of the energy transition for consumers would increase significantly. Today, system operation across borders is much more interrelated than it was in the past. This is due to the increase in variable and decentralised generation, together with closer market integration, especially in shorter market time intervals. This also means that national actions by regulators or grid operators can have an immediate effect on other EU Member States. Experience has shown that uncoordinated national decisions can lead to significant costs for European consumers. \n\n\nThe fact that some interconnectors are only used to 25% of their capacities, often due to uncoordinated national limitations, and that Member States have not been able to agree on appropriate price zones illustrates that there is a need for more coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and regulators. Successful examples of voluntary and mandatory cooperation between TSOs, regulators and governments have shown that regional cooperation can improve market functioning and reduce costs significantly. In certain areas, e.g. for the EU-wide 'market coupling' mechanism, TSO cooperation has already become mandatory, and the system of majority voting on some issues has proven to be successful in areas where voluntary cooperation (leaving each TSO a veto right) did not lead to efficient results for regional problems. Following this successful example, mandatory cooperation should be expanded to other areas in the regulatory framework. To this end, TSOs could decide within 'Regional Operational Centres' (ROCs) on those issues where fragmented and uncoordinated national actions could negatively affect the market and consumers (e.g. in the fields of system operation, capacity calculation for interconnectors, security of supply and risk preparedness). \n\n\nAdapting regulatory oversight to regional markets\n\n\nIt appears appropriate to also adapt regulatory oversight to the new realities of the market. All main regulatory decisions are currently taken by national regulators, even in cases where a common regional solution is needed. While ACER has been successful in providing a forum for the coordination of national regulators with diverging interests, its main role is currently confined to coordination, advising and monitoring. While market actors increasingly cooperate across borders and decide on certain matters concerning grid operation and electricity trading with qualified majority at a regional or even Union level\n11\n, there is no equivalent for these regional decision-making procedures at regulatory level. Regulatory oversight therefore remains fragmented, leading to a risk of diverging decisions and unnecessary delays. Strengthening the powers of ACER for those cross-border issues which require a coordinated regional decision would contribute to faster and more effective decision-making on cross-border issues. National regulators, deciding within ACER on those issues through majority voting, would remain fully involved in the process.\n\n\nIt also appears appropriate to better define the role of ENTSO-E in order to strengthen its coordination role and render its decision-making process more transparent. \n\n\nText clarifications \n\n\nFinally, the recast of the Electricity Regulation, the Agency Regulation and the Electricity Directive will be used to provide some editorial clarifications on some of the existing rules and to restructure some of them in order to make the-highly technical-rules of the three acts more comprehensible, without touching upon the substance of the provisions. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other provisions and proposals in the policy area\n\n\nThe market design initiative is strongly linked to other energy and climate legislative proposals brought forward in parallel. These notably include initiatives to improve Europe's energy efficiency, a renewable energy package, and the overarching initiative addressing governance and reporting mechanisms for the Energy Union. All those initiatives aim at implementing the necessary measures to achieve the objective of a competitive, secure and sustainable Energy Union. The intention of packaging the different initiatives, consisting of multiple legislative and non-legislative levers, is to ensure utmost coherence of the different but closely interlinked policy proposals. \n\n\nTherefore, although the current proposal is centred on updating market rules so as to make a clean energy transition economically advantageous, these provisions work in synergy with the wider EU climate and energy policy framework. These links are further explained in the Commission's Impact Assessment\n12\n.\n\n\nThe proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a revised Renewable Energy Directive, providing for a framework to achieve the 2030 renewable target, including also principles in relation to support schemes for renewable energy sources, which would make them more market-oriented, cost-effective and more regionalised in scope in cases where Member States are opting to keep support schemes. Those measures aimed at the integration of renewable energies in the market, such as provisions on dispatching, market-related barriers to self-consumption and other market access rules \u2013 previously contained in the Renewable Energy Directive \u2013, have now been integrated in the Electricity Regulation and the Electricity Directive. \n\n\n\n\nThe proposal for a Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union will contribute to ensuring policy coherence by streamlining planning and reporting obligations by Member States so as to better support the convergence towards energy and climate goals set at EU level. As a new planning, reporting and monitoring instrument, it shall provide a temperature gauge on the state of progress from a Member State on the implementation of European-wide market requirements introduced by the present acts.\n\n\nThe proposal for a Regulation on risk preparedness in the electricity sector complements the current proposal, focusing in particularly on government actions to manage electricity crisis situations and to prevent short term risks for the electricity system. \n\n\nThe current proposal is closely aligned with the Commission's competition policy in the field of energy. It incorporates notably the results of the Commission's Sector Inquiry on Capacity Mechanisms, ensuring full coherence with the Commission's energy state aid enforcement policy.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal seeks to implement key objectives of the Energy Union, as defined in the Framework Strategy for a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy. As already stated above, the details of the package are also in line with the recent global-level engagement by the Union to achieve ambitious climate targets under the agreement found in Paris at the 21st UN Conference of the Parties (COP21). The current proposal is mutually reinforcing and complementary to the proposal for the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System made in July 2015.\n\n\nFurther, to the extent that a revision of the electricity market design is aimed at making Europe's energy market more competitive and accessible for new energy technologies, the proposal also contributes to fulfilling the Union's objectives to generate jobs and growth. By offering market opportunities for new technologies, the proposal will spur the uptake of a number of services and products that would give European businesses a first-mover advantage as the clean energy transition advances globally.  \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed measures is Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which consolidated and clarified the competences of the EU in the field of energy. According to Article 194 TFEU, the main aims of the EU\u2019s energy policy are to: ensure the functioning of the energy market; ensure security of energy supply in the Union; promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy; and promote the interconnection of energy networks. \n\n\nThe present initiative also builds upon a comprehensive set of legislative acts that have been adopted and updated during the past two decades. With the objective of creating an internal energy market, the EU has adopted three consecutive legislative packages between 1996 and 2009, with the overarching aim of integrating markets and liberalising national electricity and gas markets. These provisions cover a wide range of aspects, from market access to transparency, consumer rights and the independence of regulatory authorities, to name a few.\n\n\nWith an eye on existing legislation and the general trajectory of growing energy market integration, the current initiative should thus also be seen as part of an ongoing effort to ensure the integration and effective operation of Europe\u2019s energy markets.\n\n\nRecent calls from the European Council\n13\n and the European Parliament for action at EU level to complete the European energy market have also created further ground for action. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsidiarity \n\n\nThe proposed changes to the provisions of the Regulation on electricity markets, the Directive on common rules for the internal electricity market and the Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are necessary to achieve the purpose of an integrated EU electricity market and cannot be reached at national level in an equally efficient manner. As set out in detail in the evaluation of the recast legislative acts\n14\n, evidence has shown that isolated national approaches have led to delays in the implementation of the internal energy market, leading to sub-optimal and incompatible regulatory measures, unnecessary duplication of interventions and delays in correcting market inefficiencies. The creation of an internal energy market that delivers competitive and sustainable energy for all cannot be achieved on the basis of fragmented national rules where they concern the trading of energy, the operation of the shared grid and a certain amount of product standardisation.\n\n\nThe increasing interconnection of EU electricity markets requires closer coordination between national actors. National policy interventions in the electricity sector have a direct impact on neighbouring Member States due to energy interdependence and grid interconnections. Ensuring the stability of the grid and its efficient operation is increasingly difficult to do at national level alone, as rising cross-border trade, the uptake of decentralised generation and enhanced consumer participation, all increase the potential for spill-over effects. No state can effectively act alone and the consequences of unilateral action have become more pronounced over time. This general principle applies across the range of measures introduced by the current proposal, whether they concern energy trading, the operation of the grid and consumers\u2019 effective participation.\n\n\nSince common regional issues which require a coordinated decision often have a significant economic impact on individual Member States, past experience has shown that voluntary cooperation, while useful in many areas of cooperation between Member States, has often not been able to overcome technically complex conflicts with significant distributive effects between Member States\n15\n. Existing voluntary initiatives, such as the Pentalateral Energy Forum, are also limited in their geography, as they only cover parts of the EU electricity market and do not necessarily combine all countries which are physically most closely interconnected. \n\n\nTo illustrate on a concrete example, uncoordinated national policies concerning the principles for distribution tariffs may distort the internal market to an extent that distributed generation or energy storage services will be under very different incentives to participate in the market. With the uptake of new technologies and energy services increasingly traded across borders, EU action has a significant value in ensuring a level playing field and more efficient market outcomes for all parties involved.\n\n\nThe coordinating function of ACER has been adapted to new developments in energy markets, such as the increased need for coordination in times of higher energy flows across borders and the rise of energy production from volatile RES-E. The independent national regulatory authorities (NRAs) play a major role in providing regulatory oversight over their national energy sector. A system which becomes more and more interdependent between the Member States both when it comes to market transactions and system operation requires, however, regulatory oversight beyond national borders. ACER is the body established to provide such regulatory oversight as far as situations are concerned which cover more than two Member States. The main role of ACER as a coordinator of the action of national regulators has been preserved; limited additional competences have been assigned to ACER in those areas where fragmented national decision-making on issues with cross-border relevance would lead to problems or inconsistencies for the internal market. For example, the creation of regional operational centres (ROCs) in the [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2] calls for supra-national monitoring which needs to be performed by ACER, as the ROCs cover several Member States. Similarly, the introduction of an EU-wide coordinated adequacy assessment in the [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2] calls for a regulatory approval of its methodology and calculations that may only be attributed to ACER as the adequacy assessment is to be performed across Member States.\n\n\nWhile the assignment of new tasks to ACER will require a reinforcement of its staff, the coordinating role of ACER will lead to a lower burden for national authorities, thus freeing up administrative resources at national level. The proposed approach will streamline regulatory procedures (e.g. by introducing direct approval within ACER instead of 28 separate approvals). The coordinated development of methodologies (e.g. concerning adequacy assessment) will reduce the workload for national authorities and avoid extra work resulting from potential problems through non-aligned national regulatory action.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe policy choices covered by the Electricity Regulation, the Electricity Directive and the Agency Regulation seek to adapt the electricity market design to the increasing share of decentralized generation and to ongoing technological developments. \n\n\nThe proposed reforms are strictly oriented on what is indispensable to achieve the necessary progress for the internal market, while leaving utmost competencies and responsibilities for Member States, national regulators and national actors. \n\n\nOptions considering a more far-reaching harmonisation, e.g. by proposing a single independent European energy regulator, a single integrated European transmission system operator or more straightforward prohibitions of state interventions without exemption possibilities have been consistently dismissed in the Impact Assessment. Instead the proposals aim at well-balanced solutions which only restrict the national scope for regulatory action where coordinated action clearly brings more benefits for the consumer. \n\n\nThe policy options adopted are aimed at creating a level playing field amongst all generation technologies and removing market distortions so that, amongst other things, renewable energy sources may compete on an equal footing in the energy market. In addition, all market participants would bear a financial responsibility for keeping the grid in balance. Barriers to services that provide flexibility to the grid, such as demand-response services, will be removed. Further, the measures seek to create a more liquid short-term market, so that price fluctuations can properly reflect scarcity and offer adequate incentives for a flexible grid.\n\n\nAt retail market level, Member States will also be encouraged to progressively phase-out blanket price regulation, starting with prices below cost. Vulnerable consumers can be protected by a transitional price regulation. To further increase competition, the use of contract termination fees will be restricted, so as to encourage switching. Equally, high-level principles shall ensure that energy bills are clear and easy to understand, and non-discriminatory access to consumer data will be granted, all whilst keeping in place general privacy provisions.\n\n\nIn line with the evolution of cross-border trade in electricity and the gradual integration of the market, the institutional framework will be adapted in line with the need for additional regulatory cooperation and new tasks. ACER is to be given additional tasks, especially in the regional operation of the energy system, all whilst keeping the national regulators' centre role in energy regulation.\n\n\nAll of the options have been extensively checked to meet the requirements of proportionality, in the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal. It should be noted here that the proposed policies present a compromise between bottom-up initiatives and top-down steering of the market. In keeping with proportionality, the measures do not in any way substitute the role of national governments, NRAs and TSOs in carrying out a variety of critical functions. If anything, national regulators are encouraged to come together more effectively in a regional setting, both formally and informally, to address issues arising from the management of the electricity system at a scale that is commensurate with the scale of the problem.  \n\n\nFar from endorsing a \"full harmonisation\" approach, the measures seek to create a level playing field for all market players, particularly where market opportunities extend beyond national borders. Ultimately, a certain standardisation of rules and products is essential to the effective trading of electricity across borders; whilst decisions concerning the operation of the grid would lead to sub-optimal market outcomes if left to single Member States and regulators acting in isolation. Direct experience in the formulation and adoption of common network and trading rules (so called \u201cNetwork Codes\u201d and \"Guidelines\") since the Third Energy Package of 2009 has shown a clear added value in having regulators and national authorities coming around the table to agree common rules and methodologies, both on high level and technical principles.\n\n\nThere is an increasing competitiveness gap between retail and wholesale markets, with the former still lagging behind in terms of service offer and tangible benefits to consumers. By monitoring energy poverty, transparency and clarity of consumer information and access to data, the proposed measures will not unduly limit national prerogatives.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of legal instrument\n\n\nThe proposal will amend the key legal acts that were part of the Third Energy Package. These include the Electricity Regulation (No 714/2009) and the Electricity Directive (No 2009/72/EC), alongside the Regulation establishing ACER (No 713/2009). The choice of a recast of said legal acts will enhance legal clarity. Recourse to an amending act may have been inadequate to address a wide set of new provisions. The choice of the instrument thus calls for a revision of rules already adopted and implemented, as a natural evolution of current legislation. \n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex-post evaluations/fit-for-purpose checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe Commission services have evaluated the performance of the current legislative framework (Third Energy Package) against five set criteria: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and EU added value. A stand-alone evaluation has been carried out alongside the Impact Assessment, and the results of the evaluation have been reflected in the problem identification of the impact assessment.\n\n\nThe evaluation found that, overall, the Third Energy Package's aim to increase competition and remove obstacles to cross-border competition in electricity markets has been met. Active enforcement of the legislation has led to positive results for electricity markets and consumers, and markets are in general less concentrated and more integrated than in 2009. As regards retail markets, the set of new consumer rights introduced by the Third Energy Package have clearly improved the position of the consumer in energy markets. \n\n\nHowever, the success of the rules of the Third Energy Package in developing the internal electricity market remains limited in a number of fields, both at the wholesale and the retail level. In general, the evaluation showed that large gains can still be made by an improvement of the market design framework, as shown by untapped general welfare gains and ultimate benefits to consumers. At the level of wholesale markets, barriers to cross-border trade persist and interconnector capacities are rarely fully exploited. These originate, amongst other things, from insufficient cooperation between national grid operators and regulators on the shared use of interconnectors. The national perspective of the parties involved still prevents effective cross-border solutions in many cases and ultimately limits otherwise beneficial cross-border flows. The picture is not the same across all markets and timeframes, with varying degrees of integration across day-ahead, intra-day and balancing markets.\n\n\nWith regards to retail markets, competition performance could be significantly improved. Electricity prices still vary significantly from Member State to Member State for non-market reasons, and prices have risen steadily for households as a result of significant increases in non-contestable charges in recent years; these being network charges, taxes and levies. With regard to consumer protection, rising energy poverty, as well as lack of clarity on the most appropriate means of tackling consumer vulnerability and energy poverty, have been a drag on the further deepening of the internal energy market. Switching-related fees such as contract termination charges continue to constitute a significant financial barrier to consumer engagement. In addition, the high number of complaints related to billing\n16\n suggests that there is still scope to improve the comparability and clarity of billing information.\n\n\nIn addition to shortcomings in meeting the original objectives sought by the Third Energy Package, a new set of challenges has emerged which had not been envisaged at the time of preparing the Third Energy Package. These include, as mentioned above, the very strong increase of renewable sources in electricity generation, the increase of state interventions in the electricity markets for security of supply purposes, and changes taking place on the technological side. These have all led to significant changes in the way markets operate, especially during the past five years, to a dampening of the positive effect of the reforms for consumers and also an untapped potential from modernisation. This has opened a gap in the existing legislation regarding how to deal with these developments. \n\n\nIn line with the outcome of the evaluation and the related Impact Assessment, the current proposal seeks to close the gap and present an enabling framework to reflect technological developments in the sector as our energy systems' transition to new production and consumption models.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the present initiative, the Commission has conducted several public consultations. These were open to EU citizens and Member States' authorities, energy market participants and their associations, as well as to any other relevant stakeholders, including SMEs and energy consumers.\n\n\nThree consultations and their respective results shall be highlighted in particular:\n\n\n1) Resource adequacy related issues were the subject of a public consultation\n17\n conducted from 15 November 2012 to 7 February 2013, as per the \"Consultation on generation adequacy, capacity mechanisms, and the internal market in electricity\". This was aimed at obtaining stakeholders' views on ensuring resource adequacy and security of electricity supply in the internal market. \n\n\nThe consultation received 148 individual responses from public bodies, industry (both energy producing and consuming) and academia. A detailed chart of responses to the consultation is available online\n18\n, as well as all individual contributions and a summary of results from the consultation\n19\n. \n\n\n2) A public consultation dedicated to electricity retail markets and end-consumers\n20\n was conducted from 22 January 2014 to 17 April 2014. The Commission received 237 responses to the consultation, with about 20% of submissions coming from energy suppliers, 14% from DSOs, 7% from consumer organisations, and 4% from NRAs. A significant number of individual citizens also participated in the consultation. A full summary of responses is available on the Commission's website\n21\n. \n\n\n3) A wide public consultation\n22\n on a new energy market design\u00a0was conducted from 15 July 2015 to 9 October 2015. \n\n\nThe Commission received 320 replies to this consultation. About 50% of submissions have come from national or EU-wide industry associations. 26% of answers originated from companies active in the energy sector (suppliers, intermediaries, consumers) and 9% from network operators. 17\u00a0national governments and several NRAs also fed back on the consultation. A significant number of individual citizens and academic institutes participated to the consultation as well. A detailed description of stakeholders' opinions under each of the specific policy options is available in the Impact Assessment accompanying this legislative initiative. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe preparation of the proposed regulation and the Impact Assessment is based on a large body of material, all of which is referenced in the footnotes in the Impact Assessment. These include close to 30 studies and modelling tools, conducted mostly by independent external parties, aimed at assessing specific options under the current proposal. These are listed in full under Annex V of the Impact Assessment. The studies cover a range of methodologies, with a focus on quantitative estimates of economic and social cost benefit analyses.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission has also been conducting a sector inquiry into national capacity mechanisms whose interim outcomes were promptly fed into the preparatory phase of the current proposal\n23\n. The results from these studies have complemented the extensive feedback obtained by stakeholders as described above and, overall, have given the Commission an extensive evidence basis on which to ground the current proposals.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\nAll proposed measures are supported by the Impact Assessment. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on 7 November 2016. The manner in which the Regulatory Scrutiny Board's views were taken into account is set out in Annex I of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment looked at a number of policy options for each problem set identified. These problem sets and the alternative routes for intervention are listed below:\n\n\nAdapting Market Design to the rise in renewables and technological development:\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment endorsed an enhancement of current market rules in order to create a level-playing field among all generation technologies and resources by removing existing market distortions. It addresses rules that discriminate between resources and which limit or favour the access of certain technologies to the electricity grid. In addition, all market participants would bear financial responsibility for imbalances caused on the grid and all resources would be remunerated in the market on equal terms. Barriers to demand-response would be removed. The chosen option would also strengthen short-term markets by bringing them closer to real-time in order to provide maximum opportunity to meet flexibility needs and by rendering balancing markets more efficient. The chosen option includes measures that would help pulling all flexible distributed resources concerning generation, demand and storage, into the market via proper incentives and a market framework better adapted to them and measures to better incentivise DSOs.\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach was dismissed as providing little scope for improving the market and ensuring a level-playing field among resources. Indeed, the current EU regulatory framework in the relevant areas is limited or even non-existent for other areas. Furthermore, voluntary cooperation was deemed not to provide the appropriate level of harmonisation or certainty to the market. Equally, the option of full harmonisation of market rules was also discarded as the changes might breach proportionality principles and would generally be unnecessary given the state of European energy markets at present.\n\n\nAddressing future generation investments and uncoordinated capacity mechanisms\n\n\nVarious policy options going beyond the baseline scenario were assessed, with each option proposing varying degrees of alignment and coordination among Member States at EU level, and a different extent to which market participants would rely on energy market payments.\n\n\nA so-called 'energy-only market' option would see European markets being sufficiently improved and interconnected that it provides the necessary price signals to spur investments in new resources and in the right places. In such a scenario, no capacity mechanisms would be required any longer. \n\n\nThe chosen option builds on this energy-only market scenario but does not discard the possibility for Member States of using capacity mechanisms, provided however these are based on a shared resource adequacy assessment methodology carried out in full transparency through ENTSO-E and ACER and comply with common design features for better compatibility between national capacity mechanisms and harmonised cross-border cooperation. This option builds on the European Commission Guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020, alongside the Sector Inquiry on capacity mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach was rejected as existing provisions under EU legislation are not sufficiently clear and robust to cope with the challenges facing the European electricity system. In addition, voluntary cooperation may not provide for appropriate levels of harmonisation across all Member States or certainty to the market. Legislation is needed in this area to address the issues in a consistent way.  The option in which, based on regional or EU-wide generation adequacy assessments, entire regions or ultimately all EU Member States would be required to roll out capacity mechanisms on a mandatory basis was discarded as being disproportionate.\n\n\nUnder-performance of Retail Markets: slow deployment and low levels of services \n\n\nThe endorsed option includes a gradual phasing-out by Member States of blanket price regulation by a deadline set in EU legislation, starting with prices below costs. This option allows for transitional price regulation for vulnerable consumers. To increase consumer engagement, the use of contract termination fees is restricted. Consumer confidence in comparison websites is to be fostered through national authorities implementing a certification tool. In addition, high-level principles will ensure that energy bills are clear and easy to understand, through minimum content requirements. Member States are also required to monitor the number of households on energy poverty. Finally, to allow the development of new services by new entrants and energy service companies, non-discriminatory access to consumer data is ensured.  \n\n\nOther options considered, but discarded, included a full harmonization of consumer legislation alongside extensive consumer safeguards; exemptions to price regulation defined at EU level on the basis of either a consumption threshold or a price threshold; a standard data handling model to be enforced and the responsibility assigned to a neutral market actor such as a TSO; all switching fees including contract termination fees would be banned and the content of energy bills partially harmonized; and finally, an EU framework to monitor energy poverty based on an energy efficiency survey done by Member States of the housing stock as well as preventive measures to avoid disconnections are put in place. These options were all discarded on grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality principles. Maintaining the status quo was not considered a viable option either by almost all of the stakeholders consulted. \n\n\nImprovement of the institutional framework and role of the Agency\n\n\nThe Third Package institutional framework aims at fostering the cooperation of NRAs as well as between TSOs. Since their establishment, ACER and the ENTSOs have played a key role in the progress towards a functioning internal energy market. However, the recent developments in the European energy markets that are considered in the current Impact Assessment and the subsequent proposals of the Market Design Initiative require an adaptation of the institutional framwork. In addition, the implementation of the Third Package has also highlighted areas with room for improvement concerning the framework applicable to ACER and the ENTSOs. In terms of options considered for reforming the institutional framework, a business as usual scenario was discarded for it would open up regulatory and market surveillance gaps, in line with evolving market provisions introduced elsewhere in this proposal as well as with the ongoing progress at EU level of secondary legislation.\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach of \"stronger enforcement\" and voluntary collaboration without any new, additional measures to adapt the institutional framework was considered.  Improved enforcement of existing legislation entails the continued implementation of the Third Package and full implementation of network codes and guidelines \u2013 as described under option \"business as usual\" \u2013 combined with stronger enforcement. However, stronger enforcement alone would not provide any improvement to the current institutional framework.\n\n\nA legislative option transforming ACER to something closer to a pan-European regulator was also considered but ultimately discarded. In order for the Agency to perform such a role, it would require a significant reinforcement of ACER's budget and staff as this would make a strong concentration of experts in the Agency necessary. It appears also appropriate to maintain the involvement of national regulators in the Agency's decision-making process and not to substitute systematically majority decisions by national regulators through decisions by the director. \n\n\nLegislative options to improve ACER on the basis of the existing framework were thus considered. The option endorsed by the Impact Assessment enables the adaptation of the EU institutional framework to the new realities of the electricity system. It also addresses the resulting need for additional regional cooperation and the existing and anticipated regulatory gaps in the energy market, thereby providing for flexibility by a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches.\n\n\nIn addition, in order to address the existing regulatory gap as regards NRAs' regulatory functions at regional level, the policy initiatives under this option would set out a flexible regional regulatory framework to enhance the regional coordination and decision-making of NRAs. This option would introduce a system of coordinated regional decisions and oversight of certain topics by NRAs of the region (e.g. ROCs and others deriving from the proposed market design initiatives) and would give ACER a role for safeguarding the EU-interest.\n\n\nFundamental rights \n\n\nThe present proposal may have an impact on a number of fundamental rights established by the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the EU, in particular: the respect for private and family life (Article 7), the right to protection of personal data (Article 8), the prohibition of discrimination (Article 21), the right to social assistance (Article 34), access to services of general economic interest (Article 36), the integration of a high level of environmental protection (Article 37) and the right to an effective remedy (Article 47).\n\n\nThis is addressed in particular through a number of provisions concerning consumer protection, energy poverty, protection of vulnerable customers, access to services of general economic interest, data protection and privacy. \n\n\nA summary of the Impact Assessment can be found on the Commission website\n24\n, alongside the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe proposal may increase administrative requirements, albeit to a limited extent. For example, by bringing in a level-playing field for all technologies to participate fully in energy markets, these technologies would have to abide with a number of market compliance requirements that may generate some administrative workload. \n\n\nThe measures envisaged to improve the liquidity and integration of energy markets may also generate some short-term impact to businesses as these would have to adapt for new energy trading arrangements. These are however considered minimal compared to the baseline scenario of no action, as the economic gains of the reform would very largely surpass any short or long-term administrative reorganization.\n\n\nEqually, the gradual phasing out of regulated prices at Member State level will require NRAs to step up efforts in monitoring markets, ensuring efficient competition and guaranteeing consumer protection. These impacts may be offset by increased consumer engagement, which would naturally act to foster competition in the market.\n\n\nThe range of activities to be performed under the updated institutional setting shall also generate a new set of requirements for engagement at administrative level on the part of national regulators and transmission operators. These include participation within ACER and through the decision-making processes leading to the agreement of methodologies and practices for the smooth trading of energy at the border. \n\n\nA detailed administrative and economic impact on business and public authorities for each of the policy options considered can be found in chapter 6 of the Impact Assessment. \n\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe budgetary impact associated to the proposal under this package concerns the resources of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) which are described in the Legislative Financial Statement accompanying the Commission proposal for a recast of the Regulation establishing ACER. Essentially, the new tasks to be carried out by ACER, notably as regards the assessment of system adequacy and the establishment of Regional Operation Centres, require a phasing in of up to 18 additional FTE in the Agency in 2020, as well as corresponding financial resources.\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe Commission will monitor the transposition and compliance of the Member States and other actors with the measures that shall be ultimately adopted, and shall take enforcement measures if and when required. In addition, as it has already done in the context of the implementation of the Third Energy Package, the Commission will provide guidance documents providing assistance on the implementation of the adopted measures. \n\n\nAcross monitoring and implementation purposes, the Commission will notably be supported by ACER. The annual reporting by the Agency and parallel evaluations carried out by the Commission, together with the reporting from the Electricity Coordination Group are all part of the provisions in the current initiative. The Agency will be invited to further review its monitoring indicators to ensure their continuing relevance for monitoring progress towards the objectives underlying the present proposals, so that these may be adequately reflected, amongst other things, through ACER's annual market monitoring report document.\n\n\nParallel to the proposed initiatives, the Commission will bring forward an initiative concerning the governance of the Energy Union that will streamline the planning, reporting and monitoring requirements. Based on the initiative of the governance of the Energy Union, the current monitoring and reporting requirements of the Commission and Member States in the Third Energy Package will be integrated in horizontal progress and monitoring reports. More information on the streamlining of the monitoring and reporting requirements can be found in the impact assessment for the governance of the European Union.\n\n\nA more extensive treatment of monitoring mechanisms and benchmark indicators can be found in Chapter 8 of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explanation of the specific provisions of the proposals\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on\u00a0common rules for the internal market in electricity (Recast)\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Directive provides some clarifications to the scope and subject matter of the Directive, emphasising the focus on consumers and the importance of the internal market and its main principles. It provides also for an update of the main definitions used in the Directive. \n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Directive lays down the general principle that Member States have to ensure that the EU electricity market is competitive, consumer-centred, flexible and non-discriminatory. It emphasises that national measures should not unduly hamper cross-border flows, consumer participation or investments. It further enshrines the principle that supply prices shall be market-based, subject to duly justified exceptions. The chapter also clarifies certain principles relating to the functioning of the EU electricity markets, such as the right to choose a supplier. It also provides for updated rules on possible public service obligations which may be imposed by Member States on energy undertakings under certain circumstances. \n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Directive reinforces pre-existing consumer rights and introduces new rights that aim at putting consumers at the heart of the energy markets by ensuring that they are empowered and better protected. It sets rules on clearer billing information and on certified comparison tools. It contains provisions ensuring that consumers are able to freely choose and change suppliers or aggregators, are entitled to a dynamic price contract and are able to engage in demand response, self-generation and self-consumption of electricity. It entitles every consumer to request a smart meter equipped with a minimum set of functionalities. It also improves pre-existing rules on the consumers' possibility to share their data with suppliers and service providers by clarifying the role of the parties responsible for data management and by setting a common European data format to be developed by the Commission in an implementing act. It also aims to ensure that energy poverty is addressed by Member States. It further requires Member States to define frameworks for independent aggregators and for demand response along principles that enable their full participation in the market. It defines a framework for local energy communities which may engage in local energy generation, distribution, aggregation, storage, supply or energy efficiency services. It further provides some clarifications to pre-existing provisions on smart meters, single points of contacts, and rights to out-of-court settlement, universal service and vulnerable consumers.  \n\n\nChapter IV of the proposed Directive provides for some clarifications concerning the tasks of DSOs, notably relating to the activities of DSOs concerning the procurement of network services to ensure flexibility, the integration of electrical vehicles and data management. It also clarifies the role of DSOs with respect to storage and recharging points for electric vehicles.\n\n\nChapter V of the proposed Directive summarises the general rules applicable to TSOs, largely based on existing text, providing only some clarifications concerning ancillary services and the new Regional Operational Centres. \n\n\nChapter VI of the proposed Directive, setting out the rules on unbundling as developed in the Third Energy Package, remains unchanged as concerns the main substantive rules on unbundling, notably with respect to the three regimes for TSOs (ownership unbundling, independent system operator and independent transmission operator), as well as with respect to the provisions on TSO designation and certification. It only provides a clarification on the possibility for TSOs to own storage or to provide ancillary services.\n\n\nChapter VII of the proposed Directive contains the rules on establishment, scope of powers and duties as well as rules of functioning of the independent national energy regulators. The proposal notably emphasises the obligation of regulators to cooperate with neighbouring regulators and ACER in case issues of cross-border relevance are concerned and updates the list of tasks of regulators, inter alia with respect to the supervision of the newly created Regional Operational Centres. \n\n\n\nChapter VIII of the proposed Directive changes some general provisions, inter alia on derogations to the Directive, exercise of delegated powers by the Commission and the Committee established under comitology rules pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 \n\n\nThe new Annexes to the proposed Directive set out more requirements on comparison tools, billing and billing information and amends pre-existing requirements for smart meters and their roll-out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on\u00a0the \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0internal electricity market (Recast)\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Regulation sets out the scope and subject matter and the definitions of terms used in it. It emphasises the importance of undistorted market signals to provide for increased flexibility, decarbonisation and innovation and updates and complements the main definitions used in the Regulation.\n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Regulation introduces a new Article which sets out the key principles to be respected by national energy legislation in order to allow for a functioning internal electricity market. It also sets out the main legal principles for electricity trading rules within different trading timeframes (balancing, intraday, day-ahead and forward markets), including principles for price formation. It clarifies the principle of balancing responsibility and provides for a framework for more market compatible rules for the dispatch and curtailment of generation and demand response, including conditions for any exceptions thereof.   \n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Regulation describes the process to define bidding zones in a coordinated manner, in line with the review process created in Regulation 1222/2015 establishing a Guideline on Capacity Calculation and Congestion Management\n25\n. In order to address the persisting problem of significant national limitations to cross-border electricity flows, the conditions for such exceptional limitations are clarified, notably by rules that shall ensure that electricity imports and exports are not restricted by national actors for economic reasons. This Chapter further contains amendments to pre-existing principles for transmission and distribution network tariffs and sets a procedure for fostering the progressive convergence of transmission and distribution tariff methodologies. It also sets out amended rules for the usage of congestion rents.\n\n\nChapter IV of the proposed Regulation sets out new general principles for addressing resource adequacy concerns by Member States in a coordinated manner. It sets out principles and a procedure for the development of a European resource adequacy assessment to better determine the need for capacity mechanisms and, if appropriate, the setting of a reliability standard by Member States. It clarifies how and under which conditions capacity mechanisms can be introduced in a market-compatible manner. It also clarifies market compatible design principles for capacity mechanisms, including rules for the participation of capacity located in another Member State and for interconnection usage. It sets out how Regional Operational Centres, national TSOs, the ENTSO for electricity and national regulators via ACER will be involved in the development of technical parameters for the participation of capacities located in another Member State as well as the operational rules for their participation. \n\n\nChapter V of the proposed Regulation sets out the tasks and duties of the ENTSO for Electricity and the monitoring tasks of ACER in this regard whilst clarifying its duty to act independently and for the European good. It defines the mission of Regional Operational Centres and provides for criteria and a procedure for defining system operation regions covered by each Regional Operational Centre and the coordination functions that these centres perform. It also sets out working and organisational arrangements, consultation requirements, requirements and procedures for the adoption of decisions and recommendations and their revision, the composition and responsibilities of the management board and liability arrangements of Regional Operational Centres. The chapter also incorporates rules on the connection if cogeneration units, previously included in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency. The rules on a ten-year network development plan, inter-transmission system operator compensation, information exchange and certification remain largely unchanged. \n\n\nChapter VI of the proposed Regulation sets up a European entity for DSOs, defines a procedure for its establishment and its tasks including with regard to the consultation of stakeholders. It also provides detailed rules on the cooperation between DSOs and TSOs with regard to the planning and operation of their networks.\n\n\nChapter VII of the proposed Regulation sets out pre-existing powers and rules for the Commission to adopt delegated acts in the form of network codes or guidelines. It provides for clarifications as to the legal nature and the adoption of network codes and guidelines and enlarges their possible content to areas such as distribution tariff structures; rules for the provision of non-frequency ancillary services; demand response, energy storage and demand curtailment rules; cyber security rules; rules regarding to Regional Operational Centres; and, the curtailment of generation and redispatch of generation and demand. It simplifies and streamlines the procedure for the elaboration of electricity network codes and gives national regulators the possibility to decide within ACER on issues concerning the implementation of network codes and guidelines. It also includes the European entity for DSOs and other stakeholders more closely in the procedure of the development of proposals for electricity network codes. \n\n\nChapter VIII of the proposed Regulation sets out the final provisions of the proposed Regulation. It includes the pre-existing rules for the exemption of new direct current interconnectors from certain requirement of the Electricity Directive and Regulation whilst clarifying the procedure for subsequent amendments made by NRAs thereof. \n\n\nThe Annex to the proposed Regulation defines in more detail the functions attributed to the Regional Operational Centers created by the Regulation.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (recast)\n\n\nIn general, the rules concerning ACER are proposed to be adapted to the \"Common Approach\" EU on decentralised agencies agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission (Common Approach)\n26\n. Keeping limited deviations from the \"Common Approach\" is, however, warranted for ACER at the present stage.\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Regulation describes the role, objectives and tasks of ACER and the type of acts that it can adopt, and provides for rules on consultations and monitoring. The list of tasks has been updated to include ACER's duties in the field of wholesale market supervision and cross-border infrastructure which were attributed to ACER subsequent to the adoption of the Regulation. \n\n\nWith respect to the adoption of electricity network codes, ACER is given more responsibility in elaborating and submitting the final proposal for a network code to the Commission, while maintaining ENTSO-E's role as a technical expert. The proposal also includes a formal place for DSOs to be represented at EU level, notably in the development of network code proposals, in line with an increase in their responsibilities. The Agency is given the competence to decide on terms, methodologies and algorithms for the implementation of electricity network codes and guidelines. \n\n\nFor tasks in a regional context concerning only a limited number of national regulators, a regional decision-making process is introduced. Accordingly, the Director would have to give his opinion on whether the issue in question is primarily of regional relevance. If the Board of Regulators agrees that this is the case a regional sub-committee of the Board of Regulators should prepare the decision in question which would finally be taken or rejected by the Board of Regulators itself. Otherwise the Board of Regulators would decide without the intervention of a regional sub-committee.\n\n\nThe Chapter also defines a number of new tasks for ACER concerning the coordination of certain functions related to the Regional Operational Centres within the Agency, concerning the supervision of Nominated Electricity Market Operators and related to the approval of methods and proposal related to generation adequacy and risk preparedness. \n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Regulation contains organisational rules relating to the Administrative Board, the Board of Regulators, the Director, the Board of Appeal and, as a new provision, on the Agency's working groups. While adapting several individual provisions to the Common Approach EU on decentralised agencies or to the new Council voting rules, the main features of the existing governance structure, in particular the Board of Regulators, are preserved.\n\n\nThis deviation of ACER, from the Common Approach is justified as follows:\n\n\nThe main objectives of European Electricity Policy, security of supply, affordability of electricity and decarbonisation could be reached most cost effectively by an integrated European electricity market. Accordingly, the electricity transmission infrastructure is progressively interconnected, increasing volumes of electricity are traded cross border, generation capacities are shared at a European scale and the transmission system is operated taking regional, cross-border aspects into account. The present legislative packages further enhance these trends which are expected to result in efficiencies to the benefit of European customers.\n\n\n\n\nA precondition for the creation of an internal electricity market is the opening of the sector to competition. As in other sectors of economy as well, the opening of the electricity market required new regulations, in particular with regard to the transmission and distribution system, and regulatory oversight. To this effect, independent regulatory authorities were put in place. These entities remain with a particular responsibility when it comes to overseeing national and European rules applicable to the electricity sector.\n\n\nHowever, with the increasing cross-border trade and system operation which takes the regional and European context into account, NRAs were required to increasingly coordinate their action with NRAs from other Member States. ACER was designed to become the platform for this interaction and fulfils this duty since its creation in 2011. The body within the Agency where most opinions, recommendations and decisions of the Agency are prepared, together with ACER staff, is thus the Board of Regulators comprising senior representatives of the NRAs and a non-voting representative of the Commission. The first years of the existence of the Agency have shown that the Board of Regulators managed to contribute effectively to the fulfilment of the tasks of the Agency.\n\n\nSince energy markets are still largely regulated at national level, national regulators are actors with a key role for energy markets. The main role of ACER is not the execution of delegated regulatory Commission competencies, but the coordination of the regulatory decisions of independent national regulators. The present legislative proposal still largely preserves this distribution of roles. The current structure strikes a fine-tuned balance of powers between the different actors, having regard to the special features of the developing internal energy market. Changing the balance at this stage might risk jeopardising the implementation of the policy initiatives in the legislative proposals and thereby would pose obstacles to the further integration of the energy market which is the main purpose of the present proposal. It therefore appears as premature to transfer decision-making powers to a Management Board as provided for in the Common Approach. Instead it seems rather appropriate to keep the current structure which ensures that the national regulators act without any direct intervention of EU institutions or Member States in the specific matters. At the same time, the overall work of the regulators remains subject to the approval of the EU institutions via programming, budgetary and strategic documents. EU institutions are also involved in administrative matters. As a consequence, it is not proposed to change the set-up and operation of the existing Board of Regulators.\n\n\nLikewise, it is not proposed to adapt the concept of the Administrative Board to the model of the Common Approach Management Board. The Agency's Administrative Board in its existing composition proved to be particularly effective and efficient over the last years. Its operation is assured by representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\n\n\nEven though at this stage, the Commission does not find it appropriate to adapt the governance structure of the Agency fully to the Common Approach, it will continue to monitor if the described deviations from the Common Approach are still justified, with the next evaluation scheduled for 2021 which in addition to an assessment of the Agency's objectives, mandate and tasks will have a particular focus on the governance structure of the Agency.\n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Regulation contains financial provisions. Several individual provisions are proposed to be adapted to the Common Approach on decentralised agencies.\n\n\nChapter IV of the proposed Regulation updates several individual provisions in line with the Common Approach and contains otherwise largely unchanged provisions on staffand liability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted)\n\n\n2016/0380 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nconcerning\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on\u00a0\u00d5 common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC\n\n\n(recast)\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted) \n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 , and in particular Article 47(2) and Article 55 and 95\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0194(2)\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n27\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n28\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted) recital 1\n\n\n(1)The internal market in electricity, which has been progressively implemented throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 since 1999, aims, by organising competitive electricity markets across country borders, to deliver real choice for all consumers of the European Union, be they citizens or businesses, new business opportunities, competitive prices, efficient investment signals, higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted) recital 2 \n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(2)Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity\n29\n\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0has\u00a0have made a significant contribution towards the creation of such an internal market in electricity. \u00f0\u00a0However, Europe's energy system is in the middle of a profound change. The common goal to decarbonise the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants. At the same time, technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation. There is a need to adapt the Union market rules to a new market reality\u00a0\u00ef. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(3)The Energy Union Framework Strategy sets out the vision of an Energy Union with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(4)The Communication from the Commission of 15 July 2015 'Delivering a new deal for energy consumers\n30\n' put forward the Commission's vision for a retail market that better serves energy consumers, including by better linking wholesale and retail markets. Taking advantage of new technology, new and innovative energy service companies should enable all consumers to fully participate in the energy transition, managing their consumption to deliver energy efficient solutions which save them money and contribute to overall reduction of energy consumption. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(5)The Communication from the Commission of 15 July 2015 'Launching the public consultation process on a new energy market design'\n31\n highlighted that the move away from generation in large central power plants towards de-centralized production from renewable energy sources and decarbonized markets requires an adaptation of the current rules of electricity trading and changes to the existing market roles. It underlined needs to organise electricity markets in a more flexible manner and to fully integrate all market players \u2013 including renewable energy producers, new energy service providers, energy storage and flexible demand. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(6)Apart from the new challenges, the Directive seeks also to address the persisting obstacles to the completion of the internal market in electricity. Refined regulatory framework needs to contribute to overcoming the current problems of fragmented national markets which are still often determined by a high degree of regulatory interventions. Such interventions have led to obstacles to the sale of electricity on equal terms as well as higher costs in comparison to solutions based on cross-border cooperation and market-based principles.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(7)Consumers are essential to achieving the flexibility necessary to adapt the electricity system to variable, distributed renewable generation. Technological progress in grid management and renewable generation has unlocked many opportunities for consumers, and healthy competition on retail markets will be essential to ensuring the market-driven deployment of innovative new services that cater to the consumers' changing needs and abilities, while increasing system flexibility. By empowering consumers to participate in the energy market more, and participate in new ways, citizens should benefit from the internal market in electricity and the Union's renewable targets should be attained. \n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 3 \n\n\n(8)The freedoms which the Treaty guarantees the citizens of the Union \u2014 inter alia, the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services \u2014 are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 57 \n\n\n(9)Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers and fostering capacity for new electricity generation should be of the utmost importance for Member States in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in electricity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 8\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(10)In order to secure competition and the supply of electricity at the most competitive price, Member States and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross-border access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of power generation. \u00f0\u00a0,storage and demand response.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 60\n\n\n(11)Securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of electricity accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undistorted market prices would provide an incentive for cross-border interconnections and for investments in new power generation while leading, in the long term, to price convergence.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 56 \n\n\n(12)Market prices should give the right incentives for the development of the network and for investing in new electricity generation.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 22  (adapted)\n\n\n\n(13)Under this Directive\u00a0dDifferent types of market organisation will exist in the internal market in electricity. The measures that Member States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest. The Commission should be consulted on the compatibility of the measures with the Treaty and Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(14)Member States should maintain a wide discretion to impose public service obligations on electricity undertakings in pursuing objectives of general economic interest. Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable,\u00a0transparent and competitive prices. Nevertheless, public service obligations in the form of supply price regulation constitute a fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits, limitation of consumer choice, poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction, restriction of competition as well as fewer innovative products and services on the market. Consequently, Member States should apply other policy tools, and in particular targeted social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of electricity supply to their citizens. Interventions in price setting should only be applied in limited exceptional circumstances. A fully liberalised retail electricity market would stimulate price and non-price competition among existing suppliers and incentivise new market entries therefore improving consumers' choice and satisfaction.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 45 (adapted)\n\n\n(15)Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, and\u00a0transparent and reasonable prices. In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objective of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards. Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the Member States in question and may include specific measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, or more general measures taken in the social security system. Where universal service is also provided to small enterprises, measures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small enterprises.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 47\n\n\n(16)It should be possible for Member States to appoint a supplier of last resort. That supplier may be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking, which also performs the functions of distribution, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this Directive.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 48 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(17)It should be possible for measures implemented by Member States to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 tools. Such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 49  (adapted)\n\n\n(18)To the extent to which measures taken by Member States to fulfil public service obligations constitute State aid under Article\u00a087(1)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0107(1)\u00a0\u00d5 of the Treaty, there is an obligation under Article\u00a088(3)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0108(3)\u00a0\u00d5 of the Treaty to notify them to the Commission.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 52 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(19)Clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission should\u00a0establish\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0has established\u00a0\u00d5 , after consulting relevant stakeholders including Member States, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisations and electricity undertakings, an accessible, user-friendly energy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. That checklist should be \u00f0\u00a0maintained up to date\u00a0\u00ef provided to all consumers and should be made publicly available.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 52 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(20)Clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission should establish\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0has established\u00a0\u00d5, after consulting relevant stakeholders including Member States, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisations and electricity undertakings, an accessible, user-friendly energy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. That checklist should be \u00f0\u00a0maintained up to date,\u00a0\u00ef provided to all consumers and should be made publicly available.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(21)At present, several factors impede consumers from accessing, understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them. To that end, the comparability of offers should be improved and barriers to switching minimised to the greatest practicable extent without unduly limiting consumer choice. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(22)Customers are still being charged a broad range of fees directly or indirectly as a result of switching energy supplier. Such fees make calculating the best product or service more difficult and diminish the immediate financial advantage of switching. Although removing such fees may limit consumer choice by eliminating products based on rewarding consumer loyalty, restricting their use further should improve consumer welfare, consumer engagement and competition in the market.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n\n\n(23)Independent comparison tools including websites are an effective means for customers to assess the merits of different energy offers available on the market. Search costs are lower as they no longer need to collect information from individual suppliers and service providers. Such tools can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive. They should aim at including the broadest possible range of available offers, and at covering the market as completely as is feasible so as to give the customer a representative overview. They can also reduce search costs as customers will not need to collect information separately from individual suppliers and service providers. It is crucial that the information given on such tools be trustworthy, impartial and transparent.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 54\n\n\n(24)Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availability of effective means of dispute settlement for all consumers. Member States should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(25)All consumers should be able to benefit from directly participating in the market, in particular by adjusting their consumption according to market signals and in return benefit from lower electricity prices or other incentive payments. The benefits of this active participation are likely to increase over time when electric vehicles, heat pumps and other flexible loads become more competitive. Consumers should be enabled to participate in all forms of demand response and therefore should have the possibility to opt for having a smart metering system and a dynamic electricity pricing contract. This should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods, while Member States should ensure a reasonable exposure of consumers to the wholesale price risk. Member States should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised but instead their informed decision making on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suitable for domestic market conditions. \n\n\n(26)All customer groups (industrial, commercial and households) should have access to the energy markets to trade their flexibility and self-generated electricity. Customers should be allowed to make full use of the advantages of aggregation of production and supply over larger regions and benefit from cross-border competition. Aggregators are likely to play an important role as intermediaries between customer groups and the market. Transparent and fair rules should be established to also allow independent aggregators to fulfil this role. Products should be defined on all organised energy markets, including ancillary services and capacity markets so as to encourage the participation of demand response. \n\n\n(27)The 'European Strategy for Low Emission Mobility'\n32\n stresses the need for the decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of its emissions especially in urban areas and highlights the important role that electro-mobility can play in contributing to these objectives. Moreover, the deployment of electro-mobility constitutes an important element of the energy transition. Market rules set out in this Directive should therefore contribute to creating favourable conditions for electric vehicles of all kinds. In particular, they should safeguard the effective deployment of publicly accessible and private recharging points for electric vehicles and ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into system operation.\n\n\n(28)Demand response will be pivotal to enable smart charging of electric vehicles and thereby enable the efficient integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid which will be crucial for the decarbonisation of transport. \n\n\n(29)Consumers should be able to consume, store and/or sell self-generated electricity to the market. New technology developments will facilitate these activities in the future. However, existing legal and commercial barriers exist including for example disproportionate fees for internally consumed electricity, obligations to feed self- generated electricity to the energy system, administrative burdens such as for self- generators who sell electricity to the system to comply with the requirements for suppliers, etc. All these obstacles that prevent consumers from self-generating and from consuming, storing or selling self-generated electricity to the market should be removed while it should be ensured that self-generating consumers contribute adequately to system costs.\n\n\n(30)Distributed energy technologies and consumer empowerment have made community energy and energy cooperatives an effective and cost-efficient way to meet citizens' needs and expectations regarding energy sources, services and local participation. Community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have a direct stake in producing, consuming and or sharing energy between each other within a geographically confined community network that may operate in an isolated mode or be connected to the public distribution network. Community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of a specific kind such as renewable energy, for their members or shareholders rather than prioritising profit-making like a traditional energy company. By directly engaging with consumers community energy initiatives are demonstrating their potential in facilitating the up-take of new technologies and consumption patterns, including smart distribution grids and demand response, in an integrated manner. Community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs. Community energy also enables certain groups of household consumers to participate in the energy market who otherwise might not have been able to do so. Where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered economic, social and environmental value to the community that goes beyond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services. Local energy communities should be allowed to operate on the market on a level-playing field without distorting competition. Household consumers should be allowed to voluntarily participate in a community energy initiative as well as to leave, without losing access to the network operated by the community energy initiative or their rights as consumers. Access to a local energy community's network should be granted on fair and cost-reflective terms.\n\n\n(31)Energy bills and annual statements are an important means through which customers are informed. As well as data on consumption and costs, they can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare their current deal with other offers. However, considering that bill-related disputes are a very common source of consumer complaints, a factor which contributes to persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement in the energy sector, it is necessary to make bills and annual statements clearer and easier to understand, as well as to ensure that bills contain all the information necessary to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch suppliers.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 27 \n\n\n(32)Member States should encourage the modernisation of distribution networks, such as through the introduction of smart grids, which should be built in a way that encourages decentralised generation and energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(33)Engaging consumers requires appropriate incentives and technologies such as smart metering. Smart metering systems empower consumers as they allow them to receive accurate and near-real time feedback on their energy consumption or generation allowing them to manage it better, participate in and reap benefits from demand side response programmes and other services, and lower their electricity bill. Smart metering also enables distribution system operators to have better visibility of their networks, and consequently reduce their operation and maintenance costs and pass those savings to the distribution tariffs which are ultimately borne by consumers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 55 \n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(34)\u00f0\u00a0When it comes to deciding at national level on the smart metering deployment\u00a0\u00ef, Iit should be possible to base this on an economic assessment. Should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such metering systems is economically reasonable and cost-effective only for consumers with a certain amount of electricity consumption, Member States should be able to take that into account when proceeding with implementation.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(35)Member States that are not systematically rolling out smart metering should give the possibility to consumers to benefit, upon request and under fair and reasonable conditions, and by providing them with all the relevant information, from the installation of an electricity smart meter. Where consumers do not have smart meters, they should be entitled to meters that fulfil the minimum requirements necessary to provide them with the billing information specified in this Directive.\n\n\n(36)In order to assist consumers' active participation in the electricity market, the smart metering systems to be deployed by Member States in their territory should be interoperable, not represent a barrier to switching of supplier, and should be equipped with fit-for-purpose functionalities that allow consumers to have near-real time access to their consumption data, modulate their energy consumption and, to the extent that the supporting infrastructure permits, offer their flexibility to the network and to energy services companies, be rewarded for it, and achieve savings in their electricity bill. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 50 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(37)The public service requirements, including as regards the universal service, and the common minimum standards that follow from them need to be further strengthened to make sure that all consumers, especially vulnerable ones, are able to benefit from competition and fair prices. The public service requirements should be defined at national level, taking into account national circumstances; Community law should, however, be respected by the Member States. The citizens of the Union and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, should be able to enjoy public service obligations, in particular with regard to security of supply, and reasonable prices. A key aspect of supplying customers is access to objective and transparent consumption data. Thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption. Prepayments \u00f0\u00a0should not place a disproportionate disadvantage at their users, while\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0reflect the likely consumption of electricity and different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. In this respect, full implementation of Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services\n33\n will help consumer to reduce their energy costs. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(38)Currently different models for the management of data have been developed or are under development in the Member States following the deployment of smart metering systems. Independently of the data management model it is important that Member States put in place transparent rules under which data can be accessed under non-discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and data protection as well as the impartiality of the entities which handle data. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 45 (adapted)\n\n\n(39)Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and reasonable prices. In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objective of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards.\u00a0Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable and energy poor customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the Member States in question and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, investment in residential energy efficiency or consumer protection such as disconnection safeguards. Where universal service is also provided to small enterprises, measures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at customers or small enterprises.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(40)Energy services are fundamental to safeguard the well-being of the Union citizens. Adequate warmth, cooling, lighting and the energy to power appliances are essential services to guarantee a decent standard of living and citizens' health. Furthermore, access to these energy services empowers European citizens to fulfil their potential and it enhances social inclusion. Energy poor households are unable to afford these energy services due to a combination of low income, high energy expenditure and poor energy efficiency of their homes. Member States should collect the right information to monitor the number of households in energy poverty. Accurate measurement should assist Member States to identify those households affected by energy poverty in order to provide targeted support. The Commission should actively support the implementation of the provisions on energy poverty by facilitating the sharing of good practices between Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 53 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(41)Energy poverty is a growing problem in the\u00a0Community. Member States which are affected \u00f0\u00a0by energy poverty\u00a0\u00ef and which have not yet done so should therefore develop national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0this problem\u00a0\u00ef , aiming at decreasing the number of people suffering such situation. Low income, high energy expenditure, and poor energy efficiency of homes are relevant factors in designing indicators for the measurement of energy poverty. In any event, Member States should ensure the necessary energy supply for vulnerable \u00f0and energy poor \u00ef customers. In doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of \u00f0\u00a0energy and\u00a0\u00ef social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for housing. At the very least, this Directive should allow national policies in favour of vulnerable \u00f0\u00a0and energy poor\u00a0\u00ef customers.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(42)Distribution system operators have to cost-efficiently integrate new electricity generation especially generating installations using renewable energy sources and new loads such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. For this purpose distributions system operators should be enabled and incentivised to use services from distributed energy resources such as demand response and energy storage, based on market procedures, in order to efficiently operate their networks and avoid costly network expansions. Member States should put in place appropriate measures such as national network codes and market rules, and incentivise distribution system operators through network tariffs which do not create obstacles to flexibility or to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid. Member States should also introduce network development plans for distribution systems in order to support the integration of generating installations using renewable energy sources, facilitate the development of storage facilities and the electrification of the transport sector, and provide to system users adequate information regarding the foreseen expansions or upgrades of the network, as currently such procedure does not exist in the majority of Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 26\n\n\n\n(43)Non-discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. The scope for discrimination as regards third-party access and investment, however, is less significant at distribution level than at transmission level where congestion and the influence of generation or supply interests are generally greater than at distribution level. The rules on legal and functional unbundling currently in place can lead to effective unbundling provided they are more clearly defined, properly implemented and closely monitored. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particular in relation to household and small non-household customers.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 30\n\n\n(44)Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requiring specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribution system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the distribution system operator and the users of the system. Industrial, commercial or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities or chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specialised nature of their operations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 8 \n\n\n(45)In order to secure competition and the supply of electricity at the most competitive price, Member States and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross-border access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of power generation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 9 \n\n\n(46)Without effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 11\n\n\n(47)Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effective unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10\u00a0July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\n34\n referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool by which to promote investments in infrastructure in a non-discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a generation or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or transmission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. Within those limits, a generation or supply undertaking should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or transmission system.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 12\n\n\n(48)Any system for unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 14 \n\n\n(49)Since ownership unbundling requires, in some instances, the restructuring of undertakings, Member States that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. In view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 15\n\n\n(50)Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of the managing boards of both a transmission system operator or a transmission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply. For the same reason, the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 16 \n\n\n(51)The setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensuring effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or such independent transmission operator performs all the functions of a system operator and detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted) recital 17\n\n\n(52)Where, on 3\u00a0September 2009, an undertaking owning a transmission system \u00d6\u00a0was\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, Member States should therefore be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation interests.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 18 \n\n\n\n\n(53)To preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of vertically integrated undertakings, Member States should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestiture or by splitting the shares of the integrated undertaking into shares of the network undertaking and shares of the remaining supply and generation undertaking, provided that the requirements resulting from ownership unbundling are complied with.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 19\n\n\n(54)The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appropriate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and the integration of electricity markets. Effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission system operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional cooperation. The independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia, be ensured through certain \u2018cooling-off\u2019 periods during which no management or other relevant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exercised in the vertically integrated undertaking. The independent transmission operator model of effective unbundling is in line with the requirements laid down by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and\u00a09\u00a0March 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 21  \n\n\n(55)A Member State has the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in its territory. Where a Member State has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an independent transmission operator. Furthermore, an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 23\n\n\n(56)The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discrimination between the public and private sectors. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent system operator option, solely or jointly, over the composition, voting or decision of the bodies of both the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the generation or supply undertakings. With regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system operator solution, provided that the Member State in question is able to demonstrate that the requirement is complied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control generation and supply activities on the one hand and transmission activities on the other.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC (adapted) recital 24\n\n\n(57)Fully effective separation of network activities from supply and generation activities should apply throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0 Union\u00a0\u00d5 to both Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and non-Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 undertakings. To ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 remain independent from each other, regulatory authorities should be empowered to refuse certification to transmission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0 Union\u00a0\u00d5, the regulatory authorities should take utmost account of the Commission\u2019s opinion when the former take decisions on certification. To ensure, in addition, respect for the international obligations of the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, and solidarity and energy security within the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 31\n\n\n(58)Authorisation procedures should not lead to an administrative burden disproportionate to the size and potential impact of electricity producers. Unduly lengthy authorisation procedures may constitute a barrier to access for new market entrants. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 34 \n\n\n\n\n(59)Energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market in electricity is to function properly, and to be fully independent from any other public or private interests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary supervision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the Member States. In addition, approval of the budget of the regulator by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. The provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contributing to the independence of the national regulatory authority from any political or economic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for Member States to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 36 \n\n\n(60)National regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the calculation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system operator(s), or on the basis of a proposal agreed between those operator(s) and the users of the network. In carrying out those tasks, national regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand-side management measures.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 37\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02009/72/EC recital 38\n\n\n(61)Energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them.  \u00e81\u00a0To this end, regulatory authorities should be able to request relevant information from electricity undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investigations and settle disputes.\u00a0\u00e7 Energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ensuring customer benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. The establishment of virtual power plants \u2014 electricity release programmes whereby electricity undertakings are obliged to sell or to make available a certain volume of electricity or to grant access to part of their generation capacity to interested suppliers for a certain period of time \u2014 is one of the possible measures that can be used to promote effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the market. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission\u2019s powers concerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with a Community dimension, and the rules on the internal market such as the free movement of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator has a right to appeal could be a court or other tribunal empowered to conduct a judicial review.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 37 (adapted)\n\n\n(62)Energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ensuring customer benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity.\u00a0The establishment of virtual power plants \u2014 electricity release programmes whereby electricity undertakings are obliged to sell or to make available a certain volume of electricity or to grant access to part of their generation capacity to interested suppliers for a certain period of time \u2014 is one of the possible measures that can be used to promote effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the market. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission\u2019s powers concerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with a Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 dimension, and the rules on the internal market such as the free movement of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator has a right to appeal could be a court or other tribunal empowered to conduct a judicial review.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 63 \n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(63)Under [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2]Regulation (EC) No\u00a0714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13\u00a0July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity\n\n\u00a0(10)\n\n, the Commission may adopt Guidelines Guidelines \u00f0\u00a0or Network Codes\u00a0\u00ef to achieve the necessary degree of harmonisation. Such Guidelines \u00f0\u00a0or Network Codes\u00a0\u00ef, which constitute binding implementing measures, are, also with regard to certain provisions of this Directive, a useful tool which can be adapted quickly where necessary. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(64)Member States and the Energy Community Contracting Parties should closely cooperate on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or security of supply of Member States and Contracting Parties. \n\n\n(65)This Directive should be read together with [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2] which lays down key principles of the new market design for electricity which will enable better reward for flexibility, provide adequate price signals and ensure the development of functioning integrated short-term markets. [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2] also sets out new rules in various areas including capacity mechanisms and cooperation between transmission system operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 62 (adapted)\n\n\n(66)Since the objective of this Directive, namely the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level, the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the European Union\u00a0\u00d5. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC\u00a0recital 68\n\n\n(67)This Directive respects the fundamental rights, and observes the principles, recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(68)The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive. \n\n\n(69)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\u00a0\n35\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(70)This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limit for the transposition into national law and the date of application of the Directive set out in Annex X\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 67\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(71)Given the scope of the amendments made to \u00f0\u00a0Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n36\n\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Directive 2003/54/EC herein, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation, that the provisions in question should be recast by bringing them all together in a single text in a new Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 5\n\n\nA secure supply of electricity is of vital importance for the development of European society, the implementation of a sustainable climate change policy, and the fostering of competitiveness within the internal market. To that end, cross-border interconnections should be further developed in order to secure the supply of all energy sources at the most competitive prices to consumers and industry within the Community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 59\n\n\nThe development of a true internal market in electricity, through a network connected across the Community, should be one of the main goals of this Directive and regulatory issues on cross-border interconnections and regional markets should, therefore, be one of the main tasks of the regulatory authorities, in close cooperation with the Agency where relevant.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 7 \n\n\nThe Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electricity and of creating a level playing field for all electricity undertakings established in the Community. The Communications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and\u2018Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework for achieving the objective of a well-functioning internal market. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 4 \n\n\nHowever, at present, there are obstacles to the sale of electricity on equal terms and without discrimination or disadvantages in the Community. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 41 \n\n\nMember States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authority, should encourage the development of interruptible supply contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital \n\n\nA well-functioning internal market in electricity should provide producers with the appropriate incentives for investing in new power generation, including in electricity from renewable energy sources, paying special attention to the most isolated countries and regions in the Community \u2019s energy market. A well-functioning market should also provide consumers with adequate measures to promote the more efficient use of energy for which a secure supply of energy is a precondition.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 32\n\n\nFurther measures should be taken in order to ensure transparent and non-discriminatory tariffs for access to networks. Those tariffs should be applicable to all system users on a non-discriminatory basis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 20 \n\n\n\nIn order to develop competition in the internal market in electricity, large non-household customers should be able to choose their suppliers and enter into contracts with several suppliers to secure their electricity requirements. Such customers should be protected against exclusivity clauses the effect of which is to exclude competing or complementary offers.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 51\n\n\nConsumer interests should be at the heart of this Directive and quality of service should be a central responsibility of electricity undertakings. Existing rights of consumers need to be strengthened and guaranteed, and should include greater transparency. Consumer protection should ensure that all consumers in the wider remit of the Community benefit from a competitive market. Consumer rights should be enforced by Member States or, where a\u00a0Member\u00a0State has so provided, by the regulatory authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 29 \n\n\nTo avoid imposing a disproportionate financial and administrative burden on small distribution system operators, Member States should be able, where necessary, to exempt the undertakings concerned from the legal distribution unbundling requirements.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 28 \n\n\nIn the case of small systems it may be necessary that the provision of ancillary services is ensured by transmission system operators interconnected with small systems.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 10 \n\n\nThe rules on legal and functional unbundling as provided for in Directive 2003/54/EC   have not, however, led to effective unbundling of the transmission system operators. At its meeting on 8 and\u00a09\u00a0March 2007, the European Council therefore invited the Commission to develop legislative proposals for the \u2018effective separation of supply and generation activities from network operations\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 13 \n\n\nThe definition of the term \u2018control\u2019 is taken from Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0139/2004 of 20\u00a0January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation)\n37\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 43 \n\n\nNearly all Member States have chosen to ensure competition in the electricity generation market through a transparent authorisation procedure. However, Member States should ensure the possibility to contribute to security of supply through the launching of a tendering procedure or an equivalent procedure in the event that sufficient electricity generation capacity is not built on the basis of the authorisation procedure. Member States should have the possibility, in the interests of environmental protection and the promotion of new infant technologies, of tendering for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. Such new capacity includes, inter alia, electricity from renewable energy sources and combined heat and power.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 33\n\n\nDirective 2003/54/EC introduced a requirement for Member States to establish regulators with specific competences. However, experience shows that the effectiveness of regulation is frequently hampered through a lack of independence of regulators from government, and insufficient powers and discretion. For that reason, at its meeting on 8 and\u00a09\u00a0March 2007, the European Council invited the Commission to develop legislative proposals providing for further harmonisation of the powers and strengthening of the independence of national energy regulators. It should be possible for those national regulatory authorities to cover both the electricity and the gas sectors.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 38 \n\n\nAny harmonisation of the powers of national regulatory authorities should include the powers to provide incentives to electricity undertakings, and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties. Moreover, regulatory authorities should have the power to request relevant information from electricity undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investigations and settle disputes.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 61\n\n\nRegulatory authorities should also provide information on the market to permit the Commission to exercise its role of observing and monitoring the internal market in electricity and its short, medium and long-term evolution, including aspects such as generation capacity, different sources of electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, quality of service, cross-border trade, congestion management, investments, wholesale and consumer prices, market liquidity and environmental and efficiency improvements. National regulatory authorities should report to the competition authorities and the Commission those Member States in which prices impair competition and proper functioning of the market.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 42\n\n\nAll Community industry and commerce, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and all citizens of the Union that enjoy the economic benefits of the internal market should also be able to enjoy high levels of consumer protection, and in particular household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises should also be able to enjoy public service guarantees, in particular with regard to security of supply and reasonable tariffs, for reasons of fairness, competitiveness and, indirectly, to create employment. Those customers should also have access to choice, fairness, representation and dispute settlement mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 45 \n\n\nMember States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent prices. In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objective of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards. Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the Member States in question and may include specific measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, or more general measures taken in the social security system. Where universal service is also provided to small enterprises, measures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small enterprises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 46 \n\n\nRespect for the public service requirements is a fundamental requirement of this Directive, and it is important that common minimum standards, respected by all Member States, are specified in this Directive, which takes into account the objectives of consumer protection, security of supply, environmental protection and equivalent levels of competition in all Member States. It is important that the public service requirements can be interpreted on a national basis, taking into account national circumstances and subject to the respect of Community law.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 50 \n\n\nThe public service requirements, including as regards the universal service, and the common minimum standards that follow from them need to be further strengthened to make sure that all consumers, especially vulnerable ones, are able to benefit from competition and fair prices. The public service requirements should be defined at national level, taking into account national circumstances; Community law should, however, be respected by the Member States. The citizens of the Union and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, should be able to enjoy public service obligations, in particular with regard to security of supply, and reasonable prices. A key aspect of supplying customers is access to objective and transparent consumption data. Thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption. Prepayments should reflect the likely consumption of electricity and different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. In this respect, full implementation of Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services\n38\n will help consumers to reduce their energy costs.\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nIn order to provide the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of items referred to under Article 59 and 61. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of the delegated acts. \n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 64 and 65 \n\n\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\n\n\n\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the Guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Directive. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 66\n\n\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\n39\n Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 25\n\n\nThe security of energy supply is an essential element of public security and is therefore inherently connected to the efficient functioning of the internal market in electricity and the integration of the isolated electricity markets of Member States. Electricity can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning electricity markets and, in particular, the networks and other assets associated with electricity supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmission system operator only if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Community. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Community, the Community considers that the electricity transmission system sector is of high importance to the Community and therefore additional safeguards are necessary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Community to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Community and the welfare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Community requires, in particular, an assessment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Community\u2019s and individual Member States\u2019 dependence on energy supply from third countries, and the treatment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual circumstances of each case as well as the rights and obligations arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Community and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commission is encouraged to submit recommendations to negotiate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Community or to include the necessary\u00a0 issues in other negotiations with those third countries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 35 \n\n\nIn order to ensure effective market access for all market players, including new entrants, non-discriminatory and cost-reflective balancing mechanisms are necessary. As soon as the electricity market is sufficiently liquid, this should be achieved through the setting up of transparent market-based mechanisms for the supply and purchase of electricity, needed in the framework of balancing requirements. In the absence of such a liquid market, national regulatory authorities should play an active role to ensure that balancing tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective. At the same time, appropriate incentives should be provided to balance the in-put and off-take of electricity and not to endanger the system. Transmission system operators should facilitate participation of final customers and final customers\u2019 aggregators in reserve and balancing markets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 39 and 40 \n\n\nThe internal market in electricity suffers from a lack of liquidity and transparency hindering the efficient allocation of resources, risk hedging and new entry. There is a need for enhancement of competition and security of supply through facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity network in all Member States, in particular encouraging new market entrants. Trust in the market, its liquidity and the number of market participants needs to increase, and, therefore, regulatory oversight of undertakings active in the supply of electricity needs to be increased. Such requirements should be without prejudice to, and compatible with, existing Community law in relation to the financial markets. Energy regulators and financial market regulators need to cooperate in order to enable each other to have an overview over the markets concerned.\n\n\nPrior to the adoption by the Commission of Guidelines defining further the record-keeping requirements, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\n40\n) (the \u2018Agency\u2019), and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (the \u2018CESR\u2019), established by Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (\n41\n), should confer and advise the Commission in regard to their content. The Agency and the CESR should also cooperate to investigate further and advise on whether transactions in electricity supply contracts and electricity derivatives should be subject to pre-or post-trade transparency requirements and, if so, what the content of those requirements should be.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 44\n\n\nIn the interests of security of supply, the balance between supply and demand in individual Member States should be monitored, and such monitoring should be followed by a report on the situation at Community level, taking account of interconnection capacity between areas. Such monitoring should be carried out sufficiently early to enable appropriate measures to be taken if security of supply is compromised. The construction and maintenance of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnection capacity, should contribute to ensuring a stable electricity supply. The maintenance and construction of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnection capacity and decentralised electricity generation, are important\u00a0elements\u00a0 in ensuring a stable electricity supply.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC recital 58 \n\n\nWith a view to creating an internal market in electricity, Member States should foster the integration of their national markets and the cooperation of system operators at Community and regional level, also incorporating isolated systems forming electricity islands that persist in the Community.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC Article 1 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter and scope\n\n\n\nThis Directive establishes common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution \u00f0\u00a0, storage\u00a0\u00ef and supply of electricity, together with consumer protection provisions, with a view to improving and \u00a0\u00f0\u00a0creating truly integrated\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0integrating competitive \u00f0\u00a0, consumer-centered and flexible\u00a0\u00ef electricity markets in the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0 Union\u00a0\u00d5. \u00f0\u00a0Using the advantages of an integrated market, the Directive aims at ensuring affordable energy prices for consumers, a high degree of security of supply and a smooth transition towards a decarbonised energy system\u00a0\u00ef.

Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators act in accordance with Articles\u00a025, 26 and\u00a027.\n\n\nArticle 31\u00a025\n\nTasks of distribution system operators\n\n\n1.The distribution system operator shall be responsible for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity, for operating, maintaining and developing under economic conditions a secure, reliable and efficient electricity distribution system in its area with due regard for the environment and energy efficiency.\n\n\n2.In any event, it must not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings.\n\n\n3.The distribution system operator shall provide system users with the information they need for efficient access to, including use of, the system.\n\n\n4.A Member State may require the distribution system operator, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power, \u00f0\u00a0in accordance with Article 11 [recast of Regulation 714/2009 as proposed by COM(2016)861/2]\u00a0\u00ef.\n\n\n5.Each distribution system operator shall procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and reserve capacity\u00a0\u00f0the non-frequency ancillary services\u00a0\u00ef in its system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures, whenever it has such a function. That requirement shall be without prejudice to using electricity acquired under contracts concluded before 1\u00a0January 2002.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Unless justified by a cost-benefit analysis, the procurement of non-frequency ancillary services by a distribution system operator shall be transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based ensuring effective participation of all market participants including renewable energy sources, demand response, energy storage facilities and aggregators, in particular by requiring regulatory authorities or distribution system operators in close cooperation with all market participants, to define technical modalities for participation in these markets on the basis of the technical requirements of these markets and the capabilities of all market participants\u00a0\u00ef.\n\n\n6. Where a distribution system operator is responsible for balancing the distribution system, rules adopted by it for that purpose shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, including rules for the charging of system users of their networks for energy imbalance. Terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by distribution system operators shall be established in accordance with Article\u00a037(6) in a non-discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. \n\n\n7. When planning the development of the distribution network, energy efficiency/demand-side management measures or distributed generation that might supplant the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity shall be considered by the distribution system operator.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 32\n\nTasks of distribution system operators in the use of flexibility\n\n\n\n1.Member States shall provide the necessary regulatory framework to allow and incentivise distribution system operators to procure services in order to improve efficiencies in the operation and development of the distribution system, including local congestion management. In particular, regulatory frameworks shall enable distribution system operators to procure services from resources such as distributed generation, demand response or storage and consider energy efficiency measures, which may supplant the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity and which support the efficient and secure operation of the distribution system. Distribution system operators shall procure these services according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures.\n\n\nDistribution system operators shall define standardised market products for the services procured ensuring effective participation of all market participants including renewable energy sources, demand response, and aggregators. Distribution system operators shall exchange all necessary information and coordinate with transmission system operators in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of resources, ensure the secure and efficient operation of the system\u00a0and facilitate market development. Distribution system operators shall be adequately remunerated for the procurement of such services in order to recover at least the corresponding expenses, including the necessary information and communication technologies expenses, including expenses which correspond to the necessary information and communication infrastructure. \n\n\n\n\n2.The development of a distribution system shall be based on a transparent network development plan that distribution system operators shall submit every two years to the regulatory authority. The network development plan shall contain the planned investments for the next five to ten years, with particular emphasis on the main distribution infrastructure which is required in order to connect new generation capacity and new loads including re-charging points for electric vehicles. The network development plan shall also demonstrate the use of demand response, energy efficiency, energy storage facilities or other resources that distribution system operator is using as an alternative to system expansion.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The regulatory authority shall consult all current or potential system users on the network development plan. The regulatory authority shall publish the result of the consultation process on the proposed investments.    \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may decide not to apply this obligation to integrated undertakings serving less than 100 000 connected consumers, or serving isolated systems.  \n\n\n\nArticle 33\n\nIntegration of electro-mobility into the electricity network\n\n\n\n1.Member States shall provide the necessary regulatory framework to facilitate the connection of publicly accessible and private recharging points to the distribution networks. Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators cooperate on a non-discriminatory basis with any undertaking that owns, develops, operates or manages recharging points for electric vehicles, including with regard to connection to the grid.\n\n\n2.Member States may allow distribution system operators to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles only if the following conditions are fulfilled: \n\n\n(a)other parties, following an open and transparent tendering procedure, have not expressed their interest to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles; \n\n\n(b)the regulatory authority has granted its approval. \n\n\n3.Articles 35 and 56 shall apply to distribution system operators engaged in ownership, development, operation or management of recharging points.\n\n\n4.Member States shall perform at regular intervals or at least every five years a public consultation in order to re-assess the potential interest of market parties to own, develop, operate or manage recharging points for electric vehicles. In case the public consultation indicates that third parties are able to own, develop, operate or manage such points, Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators' activities in this regard are phased-out. \n\n\nArticle 34 \n\nTasks of distribution system operators in data management\n\n\nMember States shall ensure that all eligible parties have non-discriminatory access to data under clear and equal terms. In Member States where smart metering systems have been implemented according to Article 19 and distribution system operators are involved in data management, compliance programmes as set in Article 35(2)(d) shall include specific measures in order to exclude discriminatory access to data from eligible parties as provided for in Article 23. Where distribution system operators are not subject to Article 35(1), (2) and (3), Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the vertically integrated undertaking do not have privileged access to data for the conduct of its supply activity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/72/EC\n\n\nArticle\u00a035\u00a026\n\nUnbundling of distribution system operators\n\n\n\n1.Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activities not relating to distribution. Those rules shall not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distribution system operator from the vertically integrated undertaking.\n\n\n2.In addition to the requirements under paragraph\u00a01, where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent in terms of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities not related to distribution. In order to achieve this, the following minimum criteria shall apply:\n\n\n(a)those persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, transmission or supply of electricity;\n\n\n(b)appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the professional interests of the persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently;\n\n\n\n\n(c)the distribution system operator must have effective decision-making rights, independent from the integrated electricity undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. In order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its disposal the necessary resources including human, technical, physical and financial resources. This should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indirectly in accordance with Article\u00a03759(6), in a subsidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to individual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and\n\n\n(d)the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. An annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in Article\u00a03557(1) and shall be published.
