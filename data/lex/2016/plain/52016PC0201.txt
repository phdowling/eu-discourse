"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 13.4.2016\nCOM(2016) 201 final\n2016/0109(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive\u00a02003/48/EC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nFollowing the adoption of Council Directive\u00a02003/48/EC, the Savings Directive, and in order to preserve a level playing field for economic operators, the EU signed Agreements with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the Directive. The Member\u00a0States also signed agreements with the dependent territories of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\n\nMore recently, the importance of automatic exchange of information as a means of combating cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion by ensuring full tax transparency and cooperation between tax administrations worldwide has also been recognised at the international level. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to develop a single global standard for automatic exchange of financial account information (\u2018Global Standard\u2019). The Global Standard was published by the OECD Council in July 2014.\n\n\nFollowing the adoption of a proposal to update the Savings Directive, on 17\u00a0June\u00a02011 the Commission adopted a recommendation for a mandate to initiate negotiations with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, in order to upgrade the EU\u2019s agreements with those countries in line with international developments and to ensure that those countries continue to apply measures equivalent to those in the EU. On 14\u00a0May 2013, the Council reached an agreement on the negotiating mandate by concluding that negotiations should be aligned with the recent developments at global level where it was agreed to promote automatic exchange of information as an international standard.\n\n\nIn its communication of 6\u00a0December 2012 setting out an Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, the Commission highlighted the need to promote vigorously the automatic exchange of information as the future European and international standard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters.\n\n\nOn the basis of a proposal presented by the Commission in June 2013, on 9\u00a0December 2014 the Council adopted Directive\u00a02014/107/EU amending Directive\u00a02011/16/EU and extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between EU tax authorities to a full range of financial items in accordance with the Global Standard. The amendment ensures a coherent, consistent and comprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of financial account information in the internal market.\n\n\nAs Directive 2014/107/EU is generally broader in scope than Directive 2003/48/EC and provides that in cases of overlap of scope, Directive 2014/107/EU prevails, on 10\u00a0November 2015 the Council, on the basis of a Commission proposal of 18\u00a0March\u00a02015, adopted Directive\u00a0(EU)\u00a02015/2060 repealing Directive\u00a02003/48/EC.\n\n\nIn order to minimise costs and administrative burdens both for tax administrations and for economic operators, it is crucial to ensure that the amendment of the existing Savings Agreement with Monaco is in line with EU and international developments. This will increase tax transparency in Europe and will be the legal basis for implementing the OECD Global Standard on automatic exchange of information between Monaco and the EU. \n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe legal basis for this proposal is provided by Article\u00a0115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article\u00a0218(6)(b) and (8), second subparagraph. The substantive legal basis is provided by Article\u00a0115 TFEU. \n\n\nArticle\u00a01(1) of the Amending Protocol annexed to this Proposal for a Council Decision changes the title of the existing Agreement in order to better reflect the contents of the Agreement as amended by that Amending Protocol. \n\n\nArticle\u00a01(2) of the Amending Protocol replaces the existing articles and annexes of the existing Agreement with a new set of provisions comprising 10 articles, an Annex I that reflects the OECD Common Reporting Standard which is part of the Global Standard, an Annex II that reflects important parts of the OECD Commentaries on the Global Standard, an Annex III that reflects the additional data protection safeguards to be put in place as regards data collection and exchanges under the Agreement, and an Annex IV that lists the competent authorities of Monaco and of each Member State. The new articles reflect the articles of the OECD Model Competent Authority agreement for the implementation of the Global Standard, with minor adaptations to reflect the particular legal context of an EU Agreement. Article\u00a05 includes a full set of provisions on exchange of information upon request that follows the latest text of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Article\u00a06 includes a detailed set of provisions on data protection, also taking into account the absence of an adequacy decision concerning the level of data protection in Monaco when compared to the EU requirements. Article\u00a07 provides for an additional stage of consultation before any Member State or Monaco undertakes to suspend the Agreement. Article\u00a08 features provisions on amendments to the Agreement, including a quick mechanism for provisional application by one of the Contracting Parties of amendments to the Global Standard, subject to the consent of the other Party. Article\u00a010 defines the territorial scope.\n\n\nAnnex I follows both the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Annex I to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. Annex II implements key parts of the OECD Commentaries to the CRS (CRS Commentaries) and corresponds to Annex II to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. The minor deviations from Annex I or II to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation are justified by the re-alignment of the text on the CRS requested by Monaco's negotiators, and by the fact that Monaco, like Switzerland and Andorra, has undertaken at international level to implement the CRS one year later than nearly all the Member States (only Austria is allowed a similar delay, which is provided for in Section X of Annex\u00a0I to the Directive). Leaving aside matters relating to application dates, the differences concern the following points:\n\n\n1. In Section I(E) the reference to the reporting of place of birth is realigned on the CRS.\n\n\n2. Some relevant options provided for in the CRS Commentaries and in the Directive on Administrative Cooperation have been left to the discretion of each Member State and Monaco and are not included directly in the Agreement. Instead, the Member\u00a0States and Monaco are required to notify each other and the Commission of any option they choose to exercise. \n\n\n3. The definitions of \u2018international organisation\u2019 and \u2018central bank\u2019 in Section VIII(B)(3) and (4) have been realigned on the CRS so that they can also apply in the context of the exemption from the look-through approach for passive non-financial entities (NFEs) in Section VIII(D)(9)(c).\n\n\n4. In Annex II the definition of \u2018residence of a financial institution\u2019 is aligned on the CRS Commentaries in order to cover cases where the residence of another financial institution needs to be determined, e.g. for the look-through approach for passive NFEs.\n\n\n\n\nAnnex III was included to add data-protection safeguards to those provided for in Article\u00a06, in the absence of an adequacy decision concerning the level of data protection in Monaco compared to the EU requirements. \n\n\nArticle\u00a02 of the Amending Protocol contains provisions on entry into force and application. The Parties have agreed that Monaco will comply with its international commitments as regards the timing of automatic exchange of information under the Global Standard, since these commitments have been sent to the Global Forum, and that the first exchanges will take place in 2018 for information collected in 2017. Given the difficulty of ensuring that the procedure for formal entry into force set forth in Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of the Amending Protocol is put in place in a timely manner to ensure adherence to these commitments, the Parties agreed in Article\u00a02(3) on provisional application of the Amending Protocol from 1 January 2017, subject to notification by each Party that they have completed the respective internal procedures necessary for such provisional application, provided for, within the EU, in Article\u00a0218(5) TFEU. The next paragraph of Article\u00a02 of the Amending Protocol deals with issues on the transition from the existing Agreement to the amended Agreement as regards requests for information, credits available to beneficial owners for withholding tax, final payment of withholding tax by Monaco to Member States and final exchanges of information under the voluntary disclosure mechanism.\n\n\nArticle\u00a03 includes a Protocol on additional safeguards related to the exchange of information on request. The text specifies that exchanges on the basis of a group request are not ruled out. The Protocol on additional safeguards is in line with the Global Forum\u2019s Terms of Reference for the exchange of information on request.\n\n\nArticle\u00a04 lists the languages in which the Amending Protocol is signed.\n\n\nThe revised Agreement is supplemented by four Joint Declarations of the contracting parties.\n\n\nThe first Declaration reaffirms the compliance with the Global Standard of Directive\u00a02014/107/EU amending Directive\u00a02011/16/EU and of the revised Agreement between the EU and Monaco and the four other revised Agreements already signed between the EU and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra and Monaco.\n\n\nThe second and third Declarations make a link the Agreement with the Commentaries to the Global Standard and with Article\u00a026 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital respectively. \n\n\nThe fourth Declaration addresses practical aspects of the provisional application provided for in Article\u00a02(3) of the Amending Protocol.\n\n\nThe proposal does not go beyond what is necessary or appropriate to achieve the objectives.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Amending Protocol implements the Global Standard between EU Member States and Monaco. The different stakeholders were already consulted on various occasions during the development of the OECD Global Standard.\n\n\nEU Member States were also consulted and informed during the negotiations between the Commission and Monaco. The Commission reported to the European\u00a0Council at its meetings in March and December 2014 on the state of play of the negotiations with Monaco. \n\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted during the negotiations with San Marino and provided useful advice, in particular on the detailed content of Article\u00a06 of and Annex\u00a0III to the Agreement as amended by the Amending Protocol. Account was also taken of this advice when drawing up the corresponding parts of the revised Agreement with Monaco.\n\n\nThe Commission has also consulted the new Expert Group on automatic exchange of financial account information that provides advice to ensure that EU legislation on automatic exchange of information in direct taxation is effectively aligned and fully compatible with the OECD Global Standard. The Expert Group includes representatives from organisations representing the financial sector and organisations campaigning against tax evasion and tax avoidance.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal does not have any budgetary implications.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nNone\n\n\n2016/0109 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive\u00a02003/48/EC\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0115 in conjunction with Article\u00a0218(6)(b) and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a0218(8) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n1\n, \n\n\nAfter consultation of the European Data Protection Supervisor,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Decision 2016/XXX/EU\n2\n, the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC (\u2018the Amending Protocol\u2019) was signed on XX XXXX 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n\n\n(2) The text of the Amending Protocol which is the result of the negotiations, duly reflects the negotiating directives issued by the Council as it aligns the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC\n3\n (the\u00a0\u2018Agreement\u2019) with the latest developments at international level concerning automatic exchange of information, namely, with the Global Standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Union, its Member States and the Principality of Monaco have actively participated in the work of the Global Forum of the OECD to support the development and implementation of this Standard. The text of the Agreement, as amended by this Amending Protocol, is the legal basis for implementing the Global Standard in the relations between the European Union and the Principality of Monaco.\n\n\n(3)The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article\u00a028(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n4\n.\n\n\n(4)The Amending Protocol should be approved,\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council\u00a0Directive 2003/48/EC is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.\n\n\nThe text of the Amending Protocol is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to give, on behalf of the Union, the notification provided for in Article\u00a02(1) of the Amending Protocol, in order to express the consent of the European Union to be bound by it. \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nConsent of [date], OJ C [\u2026], [\u2026], p.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 13.4.2016\nCOM(2016) 201 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Amending Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive\u00a02003/48/EC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmending Protocol to the \n\n\n\u2018Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC\u2019\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION \n\n\nand \n\n\nTHE PRINCIPALITY OF MONACO, \n\n\nhereinafter referred to as \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 or, jointly, as \u2018Contracting Parties\u2019,\n\n\nWith a view to implementing the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information within a framework of cooperation which takes account of the legitimate interests of both Contracting Parties,\n\n\nWhereas the Contracting Parties have a long-standing and close cooperation in tax matters, in particular on the application of measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\n1\n, and desire to improve international tax compliance by further building on that relationship,\n\n\nWhereas the Contracting Parties desire to come to an agreement to improve international tax compliance based on reciprocal automatic exchange of information subject to the confidentiality and other protections referred to in this amending Protocol, including provisions limiting the use of the information exchanged, \n\n\nWhereas the Contracting Parties agree that the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol must comply with the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Global Standard\u2019, \n\n\nWhereas Article 12 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agreement\u2019), which in its current form\n2\n prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol limits the transmission of information to requests concerning acts constituting tax fraud, should be aligned on the OECD standard on transparency and exchange of information in tax matters in order to satisfy the objectives of this Standard as laid down in detail in Article 5(1) of the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol and in compliance with the guarantees of confidentiality and protection of personal data provided for in Article 6 of the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol and Annex III thereto,\u00a0\n\n\nWhereas, for EU Member States, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\n3\n lays down specific data protection rules in the European Union which also apply to the exchanges of information effected by the EU\u00a0Member States that are covered by the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol,\n\n\nWhereas the protection of personal data in the Principality of Monaco is governed by Law No\u00a01.165 of 23 December 1993 on the protection of personal data (as amended by Law No\u00a01.240 of 2 July 2001 and Law No\u00a01.353 of 4\u00a0December 2008, which entered into force on 1\u00a0April 2009, including the conditions of implementation as set out in Sovereign Order No\u00a02.230 of 19\u00a0June 2009\n4\n), \n\n\nWhereas on the date of signing of this Amending Protocol the European Commission has not yet adopted a decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC finding that the Principality of Monaco offers an adequate level of protection of personal data,\n\n\nWhereas both Contracting Parties undertake to implement and uphold the specific data protection safeguards set out in the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol, including Annex\u00a0III thereto, in such a way as to ensure that neither Contracting Party may use any justification to refuse to exchange information with the other,\n\n\nWhereas Reporting Financial Institutions, Sending Competent Authorities and Receiving Competent Authorities, as data controllers, should retain information processed in accordance with the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol for no longer than necessary to achieve the objectives thereof. Given the differences in the Member States' and the Principality of Monaco's legislation, the maximum retention period for each of the Contracting Parties should be set by reference to the statute of limitations provided by each data controller's domestic tax legislation,\u00a0\n\n\nWhereas the categories of Reporting Financial Institutions and Reportable Accounts covered by the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol are designed to limit the opportunities for taxpayers to avoid being reported by shifting assets to financial institutions or investing in financial products that are outside the scope of the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol. However, certain financial institutions and accounts that present a low risk of being used to evade tax should be excluded from the scope. Thresholds should not be generally included as it is easy to remain below them by splitting accounts among different financial institutions. The financial information which must be reported and exchanged should concern not only all relevant income (interests, dividends and similar types of income) but also account balances and sale proceeds from financial assets in order to address situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide capital that in itself represents income or assets with regard to which tax has been evaded. Therefore, the processing of information under the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol is necessary for and proportionate to the purpose of enabling Member States' and the Principality of Monaco's tax administrations to correctly and unequivocally identify the taxpayers concerned, administer and enforce their tax laws in cross-border situations, assess the likelihood of tax evasion being perpetrated and avoid unnecessary further investigations,\n\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nThe Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1) The title shall be replaced by:\n\n\n\u2018Agreement between the European Union and the Principality of Monaco on the exchange of financial account information to improve international tax compliance in accordance with the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2019\n\n\n(2) Articles 1 to 21 and the Annexes are replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n\u2018Article 1\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n1.

The Competent Authorities shall agree on one or more methods for data transmission, including encryption standards. \n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nCooperation on compliance and enforcement\n\n\nThe Competent Authority of a Member State must notify the Competent Authority of Monaco and the Competent Authority of Monaco must notify the Competent Authority of a Member\u00a0State when the first-mentioned (notifying) Competent Authority has reason to believe that an error may have led to incorrect or incomplete information-reporting under Article 2, or that a Reporting Financial Institution is not complying with the applicable reporting requirements and due diligence procedures consistent with Annexes I and II. The notified Competent Authority shall take all appropriate measures available under its domestic law to address the errors or non-compliance described in the notice.\n\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nExchange of information on request\n\n\n1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 and of any other agreement providing for information exchanges upon request between Monaco and any Member State, the Competent Authority of Monaco and the Competent Authority of any Member State shall exchange upon request such information as may be relevant for implementing this Agreement or for administering or enforcing domestic laws concerning taxes of any kind and description levied on behalf of Monaco and the Member States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, provided that the taxation under such domestic laws of the requesting State is not contrary to any applicable double taxation agreement between Monaco and the Member State concerned.\n\n\n2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article and of Article 6 be interpreted as requiring Monaco or a Member State:\n\n\n(a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of Monaco or the Member State respectively;\n\n\n(b) to supply information which is not obtainable by law or in the normal course of the administration of Monaco or the Member State respectively;\n\n\n(c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or commercial process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). \n\n\n3. If information is requested by a Member State or by Monaco acting as the requesting jurisdiction in accordance with this Article, Monaco or the Member State acting as the requested jurisdiction shall use its information gathering resources to obtain the requested information, even though that requested jurisdiction may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation laid down in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 2 but in no case shall such limitations be construed as authorising the requested jurisdiction to refuse to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.\n\n\n4. In no case shall paragraph 2 be construed as authorising Monaco or a Member State to refuse to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. \n\n\n5. The Competent Authorities shall agree on one or more methods for data transmission, including encryption standards, and on the standard forms to be used where applicable.  \n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nConfidentiality and personal data safeguards \n\n\n1. In addition to the confidentiality rules and other safeguards provided for in the Agreement, including Annex III, the collection and exchange of information under the Agreement shall be subject: (i) in the case of Member States, to the laws and regulations of Member\u00a0States implementing Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and (ii) in the case of Monaco, to Law No\u00a01.165 of 23\u00a0December 1993 on personal data protection (as amended by Law No 1.240 of 2\u00a0July 2001 and Law No\u00a01.353 of 4\u00a0December 2008, which entered into force on 1\u00a0April 2009, including the conditions of implementation set out in Sovereign Order No\u00a02.230 of 19\u00a0June 2009). \n\n\nMember States shall, for the purpose of the correct application of Article 5, restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 10, 11(1), 12 and 21 of Directive\u00a095/46/EC to the extent required to safeguard the interests referred to in Article 13(1)(e) of that Directive. Monaco shall take equivalent measures under its law.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, each Member State and Monaco shall ensure that each Reporting Financial Institution under their jurisdiction informs each individual Reportable Person concerned (whether a Monaco Person or a Member State Person) that the information referred to in Article 2 relating to them will be collected and transferred in accordance with this Agreement and shall ensure that the Reporting Financial Institution gives that person all the information that they are entitled to under its domestic data protection legislation, and at the least the following:\n\n\n(a) the purpose for which their personal data are processed;\n\n\n(b) the legal basis for the processing operation;\n\n\n(c) the recipients of the personal data;\n\n\n(d) the identity of the data controllers;\n\n\n(e) the time-limits for storing the data;\n\n\n(f) the right of a person to ask the controller for access to, and rectification and erasure of, their personal data;\n\n\n(g) the right to seek administrative and/or judicial redress; \n\n\n(g) the procedure for exercising the right to administrative and/or judicial redress;\n\n\n(i) the right to apply to the competent data protection supervisory authority or authorities and their contact details.\n\n\nThis information must be provided in sufficient time for an individual to exercise their data protection rights and, in any case, before the Reporting Financial Institution concerned reports the information referred to in Article 2 to the Competent Authority of its jurisdiction of residence (a Member State or Monaco).\n\n\nThe Member States and Monaco shall ensure that each individual Reportable Person (whether a Monaco Person or a Member State Person) is notified of a breach of security with regard to their data when that breach is likely to adversely affect the protection of their personal data or privacy.\n\n\n2. Information processed in accordance with this Agreement shall be kept for no longer than necessary to achieve the purposes of this Agreement and, in any case, in accordance with each data controller's domestic rules on the statute of limitations.\u00a0\n\n\nReporting Financial Institutions and the competent authorities of each Member State and Monaco shall be considered to be data controllers, each with respect to the personal data it processes under this Agreement. Data controllers are responsible for enforcing personal-data protection safeguards, in accordance with the provisions on such safeguards in this Agreement and with the rights of the persons concerned.\n\n\n3. Any information obtained by a jurisdiction (a Member State or Monaco) under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and protected in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that jurisdiction and, to the extent necessary for the protection of personal data, in accordance with the applicable domestic law, and with safeguards which may be specified by the jurisdiction supplying the information as required under its domestic law.\n\n\n4. Such information shall in any case be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative or supervisory bodies) concerned with the assessment, collection or recovery of taxes, the enforcement of decisions, prosecutions and decisions on appeals in relation to taxes of that jurisdiction (a Member State or Monaco), or the oversight of these tasks. Only the persons or authorities mentioned above may use the information, and then only for purposes spelled out in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding paragraph\u00a03, they may disclose it in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions relating to such taxes, on condition, specifically with regard to the recovery of taxes, of obtaining a prior authorisation issued by the Competent Authority providing the information (whether Monaco or a Member\u00a0State respectively). \n\n\n\n\n5. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, information received by a jurisdiction (a\u00a0Member State or Monaco) may be used for other purposes where such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws, including the law on the protection of personal data, of the supplying jurisdiction (Monaco or a Member State) and where the Competent Authority of that jurisdiction authorises such use. Information provided by a jurisdiction (a\u00a0Member State or Monaco) to another jurisdiction (Monaco or a Member State respectively) may be transmitted by the latter to a third jurisdiction (that is, another Member State), subject to the application of the safeguards provided for under this Article and to prior authorisation of the Competent Authority of the first-named jurisdiction from which the information originated, which authority must have received the necessary data for assessment of the application of the safeguards in question. Information provided by one Member State to another Member State under its law implementing Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation may be transmitted to Monaco, subject to prior authorisation by the Competent Authority of the Member State from which the information originated.\n\n\n6. Each Competent Authority of a Member State or of Monaco shall immediately notify the other Competent Authority, i.e. that of Monaco or of the Member State concerned, regarding any breach of confidentiality, failure of safeguards or any other breaches of data protection rules, and any sanctions and remedial measures consequently adopted.\n\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nConsultations and suspension of the Agreement\n\n\n1. If any difficulties in the implementation or interpretation of this Agreement arise, the Competent Authorities of Monaco or of a Member State may request consultations between the Competent Authority of Monaco and one or more of the Competent Authorities of Member States to draw up appropriate measures to ensure that this Agreement is fulfilled. Those Competent Authorities shall immediately notify the European Commission and the Competent Authorities of the other Member States of the results of their consultations. The European Commission may take part in consultations on issues of interpretation at the request of any of the Competent Authorities.\n\n\n2. If the consultations concern significant non-compliance with this Agreement, and the procedure set out in paragraph 1 does not provide for an adequate settlement, the Competent Authority of a Member State or Monaco may suspend the exchange of information under this Agreement with, respectively, Monaco or a specific Member State, by giving notice in writing to the other Competent Authority concerned. Such suspension shall have immediate effect. For the purposes of this paragraph, significant non-compliance includes, but is not limited to, non-compliance with the confidentiality and data safeguard provisions of this Agreement, including Annex III, of Directive 95/46/EC and of Law No\u00a01.165 of 23 December 1993 on personal data protection, as amended by Law No\u00a01.240 of 2\u00a0July 2001 and Law No\u00a01.353 of 4\u00a0December 2008, which entered into force on 1\u00a0April 2009, including the conditions of implementation set out in Sovereign Order No\u00a02.230 of 19\u00a0June 2009, depending on the context, and a failure by the Competent Authority of a Member State or Monaco to provide timely or adequate information as required under this Agreement, or the designation of Entities or accounts as Non-Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts in a manner that frustrates the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nAmendments\n\n\n1. The Contracting Parties shall consult each other on any occasion an important change to any of the elements of the Global Standard is adopted at OECD level or \u2013 if deemed necessary by the Contracting Parties \u2013 in order to improve the technical functioning of this Agreement or to assess and reflect other international developments. The consultations shall be held within one month of a request by either Contracting Party or as soon as possible in urgent cases.\n\n\n2. On the basis of such a contact the Contracting Parties may consult each other in order to examine whether changes to this Agreement are necessary.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of the consultations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, each Contracting Party shall inform the other Contracting Party of any developments which could affect the proper functioning of this Agreement. This includes any relevant agreement between one of the Contracting Parties and a third State.\n\n\n4. Following the consultations, this Agreement may be amended by means of a protocol or a new agreement between the Contracting Parties.\n\n\n5. Where a Contracting Party has implemented a change made by the OECD to the Global Standard and wishes to make a corresponding change in Annexes I and/or II to this Agreement, it shall notify the other Contracting Party thereof. A consultation procedure between the Contracting Parties shall take place within one month of this notification. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, if the Contracting Parties reach a consensus within this consultation procedure on the change that should be made to Annexes I and/or II to this Agreement, and for the period of time necessary for implementation of the change by a formal amendment of this Agreement, the Contracting Party that requested the change may provisionally apply the revised version of Annexes I and/or II to this Agreement, as approved during the consultation procedure, from 1\u00a0January of the year following that in which the aforementioned procedure was concluded. \n\n\nA Contracting Party is considered to have implemented a change to the Global Standard adopted by the OECD when:\n\n\n(a) in the case of Member States, the change has been incorporated in Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation;\n\n\n(b) in the case of Monaco, when the change has been incorporated in an agreement with a third State or into domestic legislation.\n\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\n\n\nTermination \n\n\nEither Contracting Party may terminate this Agreement by giving notice of termination in writing to the other Contracting Party. Such termination shall become effective on the first day of the month following a period of 12 months from the date of the notice of termination. In the event of termination, all information previously received under this Agreement shall remain confidential and subject (i) in the case of Member States, to the provisions of Member\u00a0States\u2019 laws and regulations implementing Directive 95/46/EC and (ii) in the case of Monaco, to the provisions of Law No\u00a01.165 of 23 December 1993 on personal data protection (as amended by Law No\u00a01.240 of 2\u00a0July 2001 and Law No\u00a01.353 of 4\u00a0December 2008, which entered into force on 1\u00a0April 2009, including the conditions of implementation set out in Sovereign Order No\u00a02.230 of 19\u00a0June 2009), and in both cases to the specific data protection safeguards provided for in this Agreement, including those in Annex III.\n\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\nTerritorial Scope\n\n\nThis Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories of the Member States in which the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are applied and under the conditions laid down in those Treaties and, on the other hand, to the territory of Monaco as defined in Article 1(1)(c).\u2019 \n\n\n\n(3) the Annexes are replaced by:\n\n\n\u2018ANNEX I \n\n\nCommon standard on reporting and due diligence for financial account information (hereinafter \u2018Common Reporting Standard\u2019)\n\n\n\nSECTION I \u2013 GENERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS \n\n\nA.\u00a0Subject to paragraphs C to E, each Reporting Financial Institution must report to the Competent Authority of its jurisdiction (a Member State or Monaco) the following information with respect to each Reportable Account of such Reporting Financial Institution: \n\n\n1. the name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence (a Member State or Monaco), TIN(s) and date and place of birth (in the case of an individual) of each Reportable Person that is an Account Holder of the account and, in the case of any Entity that is an Account Holder and that, after application of the due diligence procedures consistent with Sections V, VI and VII, is identified as having one or more Controlling Persons that are Reportable Persons, the name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence and TIN(s) of the Entity and the name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence (a Member State or Monaco), TIN(s) and date and place of birth of each Reportable Person; \n\n\n2. the account number (or functional equivalent in the absence of an account number); \n\n\n3.\u00a0the name and identifying number (if any) of the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n4. the account balance or value (including, in the case of a Cash-Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract, the Cash Value or surrender value) at the end of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period or, if the account was closed during this year or period, the closure of the account; \n\n\n5. in the case of any Custodial Account: \n\n\n(a) the total gross amount of interest, the total gross amount of dividends and the total gross amount of other income generated with respect to the assets held in the account, in each case paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period; and \n\n\n(b) the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of Financial Assets paid or credited to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period with respect to which the Reporting Financial Institution acted as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the Account Holder; \n\n\n6. in the case of any Depository Account, the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period; and \n\n\n\n\n7.\u00a0in the case of any account not described in subparagraph A(5) or (6), the total gross amount paid or credited to the Account Holder with respect to the account during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period with respect to which the Reporting Financial Institution is the obligor or debtor, including the aggregate amount of any redemption payments made to the Account Holder during the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. \n\n\nB.\u00a0The information reported must identify the currency in which each amount is denominated. \n\n\nC. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), with respect to each Reportable Account that is a Preexisting Account, the TIN(s) or date of birth is not required to be reported if such TIN(s) or date of birth are not in the records of the Reporting Financial Institution and is not otherwise required to be collected by such Reporting Financial Institution under domestic law or any European Union legal instrument (if applicable). However, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the TIN(s) and date of birth with respect to Pre-existing Accounts by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which Pre-existing Accounts were identified as Reportable Accounts. \n\n\nD. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the TIN does not have to be reported if the relevant Member State, Monaco or other jurisdiction of residence has not issued a TIN. \n\n\nE.\u00a0Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the place of birth is not required to be reported unless the Reporting Financial Institution is otherwise required to obtain and report it under domestic law and it is available in the electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution. \n\n\nSECTION II \u2013 GENERAL DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS \n\n\nA. An account is treated as a Reportable Account from the date on which it is identified as such pursuant to the due diligence procedures in Sections II through VII and, unless otherwise provided, information with respect to a Reportable Account must be reported annually in the calendar year following the year to which the information relates. \n\n\nB.\u00a0The balance or value of an account is the balance or value as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. \n\n\nC. Where a balance or value threshold must be determined as of the last day of a calendar year, the relevant balance or value must be determined as of the last day of the reporting period that ends with or within that calendar year. \n\n\nD.\u00a0Each Member State and Monaco may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use service providers to fulfil the reporting and due diligence obligations imposed on such Reporting Financial Institutions under domestic law, but those obligations shall remain the responsibility of the Reporting Financial Institutions. \n\n\nE.\u00a0Each Member State and Monaco may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to apply the due diligence procedures for New Accounts to Pre-existing Accounts, and the due diligence procedures for High Value Accounts to Lower Value Accounts. Where a Member State or Monaco allows the use of New Account due diligence procedures for Pre-existing Accounts, the rules otherwise applicable to Pre-existing Accounts shall continue to apply. \n\n\nSECTION III: DUE DILIGENCE FOR PRE-EXISTING INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS \n\n\nA. The following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among Pre-existing Individual Accounts.\n\n\nB.\u00a0Lower Value Accounts. The following procedures apply with respect to Lower Value\u00a0Accounts. \n\n\n1. Residence address. If the Reporting Financial Institution has in its records a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence, the Reporting Financial Institution may treat the individual Account Holder as being a resident for tax purposes of the Member State or Monaco or other jurisdiction in which the address is located for purposes of determining whether this individual Account Holder is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n2. Electronic record search. If the Reporting Financial Institution does not rely on a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence as set forth in subparagraph B(1), the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the following indicia and apply subparagraphs B(3) to (6): \n\n\n(a) identification of the Account Holder as a resident of a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(b) current mailing or residence address (including a post office box) in a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(c) one or more telephone numbers in a Reportable Jurisdiction and no telephone number in Monaco or the Member State of the Reporting Financial Institution, as the context requires; \n\n\n(d) standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Reportable Jurisdiction; \n\n\n\n\n(e) currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction; or \n\n\n(f) a \u2018hold mail\u2019 instruction or \u2018in-care-of\u2019 address in a Reportable Jurisdiction if the Reporting Financial Institution does not have any other address on file for the Account Holder. \n\n\n3.   If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account. \n\n\n4. If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) to (e) are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a resident for tax purposes of each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified, unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account. \n\n\n5. If a \u2018hold mail\u2019 instruction or \u2018in-care-of\u2019 address is discovered in the electronic search and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) to (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must, in the order most appropriate to the circumstances, apply the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2), or seek to obtain from the Account Holder a selfcertification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of such Account Holder. If the paper search fails to establish an indicium and the attempt to obtain the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is not successful, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the account to the Competent Authority of its Member State or Monaco, as the context requires, as an undocumented account. \n\n\n6. Notwithstanding a finding of indicia under subparagraph B(2), a Reporting Financial Institution is not required to treat an Account Holder as a resident of a Reportable Jurisdiction if: \n\n\n(a) the Account Holder information contains a current mailing or residence address in the Reportable Jurisdiction, one or more telephone numbers in that Reportable Jurisdiction (and no telephone number in Monaco or the Member State of the Reporting Financial Institution, as the context requires) or standing instructions (with respect to Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Reportable Jurisdiction, and the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: \n\n\n(i) a self-certification from the Account Holder's jurisdiction(s) of residence (a\u00a0Member State, Monaco or other jurisdiction) that does not include such Reportable Jurisdiction; and \n\n\n(ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder\u2019s non-reportable status; \n\n\n(b) the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in the Reportable Jurisdiction, and the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: \n\n\n(i) a self-certification from the Account Holder's jurisdiction(s) of residence (a\u00a0Member State, Monaco or other jurisdiction) that does not include such Reportable Jurisdiction; or \n\n\n(ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder\u2019s non-reportable status. \n\n\nC. Enhanced Review Procedures for High Value Accounts. The following enhanced review procedures apply with respect to High Value Accounts. \n\n\n1. Electronic record search. With respect to High Value Accounts, the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2). \n\n\n2. Paper record search. If the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph C(3), a further paper record search is not required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of that information, then with respect to a High Value Account the Reporting Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent this information is not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2): \n\n\n(a) the most recent Documentary Evidence collected with respect to the account; \n\n\n(b) the most recent account-opening contract or documentation; \n\n\n(c) the most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; \n\n\n(d) any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and \n\n\n(e) any standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds currently in effect. \n\n\n\n\n3. Exception applicable where databases contain sufficient information. A Reporting Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2) where the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s electronically searchable information includes the following: \n\n\n(a) the Account Holder\u2019s residence status; \n\n\n(b) the Account Holder\u2019s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n(c) the Account Holder's telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting Financial Institution; \n\n\n(d) in the case of Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts, whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds from the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting Financial Institution or another Financial Institution); \n\n\n(e) there is a current \u2018in-care-of\u2019 address or \u2018hold mail\u2019 instruction for the Account Holder; and \n\n\n(f) there is a power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. \n\n\n4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described in subparagraphs C(1) and (2), the Reporting Financial Institution must treat as a Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with that High Value Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n5. Effect of Finding Indicia. \n\n\n(a) If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and the account is not identified as held by a Reportable Person in subparagraph C(4), then further action is not required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account. \n\n\n(b) If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) to (e) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account.\n\n\n(c) If a \u2018hold mail\u2019 instruction or \u2018in-care-of\u2019 address is discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described in paragraph C, and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraphs B(2)(a) to (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain from such Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain such self-certification or Documentary Evidence, it must report the account to the Competent Authority of its Member\u00a0State or Monaco, as the context requires, as an undocumented account. \n\n\n6. If a Pre-existing Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of 31\u00a0December 2016, but becomes a High Value Account as of the last day of a subsequent calendar year, the Reporting Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C with respect to such account within the calendar year following the year in which the account becomes a High\u00a0Value Account. If, based on that review, such account is identified as a Reportable Account, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. \n\n\n7. Once a Reporting Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph C(4), to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year unless the account is undocumented where the Reporting Financial Institution should re-apply them annually until such account ceases to be undocumented. \n\n\n8. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more indicia described in subparagraph B(2) being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in that subparagraph applies with respect to that account. \n\n\n9. A Reporting Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(6), is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder. \n\n\nD. Review of Pre-existing High Value Individual Accounts must be completed by 31\u00a0December 2017. Review of Pre-existing Lower Value Individual Accounts must be completed by 31 December 2018. \n\n\nE.\u00a0Any Pre-existing Individual Account that has been identified as a Reportable Account under this Section must be treated as a Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. \n\n\nSECTION IV: DUE DILIGENCE FOR NEW INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New Individual Accounts. \n\n\n\n\nA.\u00a0With respect to New Individual Accounts, upon account opening, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. \n\n\nB.\u00a0If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident for tax purposes in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account and the self-certification must also include the Account Holder\u2019s TIN with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date of birth. \n\n\nC. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original selfcertification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. \n\n\nSECTION V: DUE DILIGENCE FOR PREEXISTING ENTITY ACCOUNTS \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Entity Accounts. \n\n\nA. Entity Accounts not required to be reviewed, identified or reported. Unless the Reporting Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Pre-existing Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, a Pre-existing Entity Account with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed, as of 31\u00a0December 2016, USD\u00a0250\u00a0000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a Reportable Account until the aggregate account balance or value exceeds that amount as of the last day of any subsequent calendar year. \n\n\nB.\u00a0Entity Accounts subject to review. A Pre-existing Entity Account that has an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds, as of 31 December 2016, USD\u00a0250\u00a0000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco, and a Pre-existing Entity Account that does not exceed, as of 31 December 2016, that amount but the aggregate account balance or value of which exceeds such amount as of the last day of any subsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D. \n\n\nC. Entity Accounts with respect to which reporting is required. With respect to Pre-existing Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons, shall be treated as Reportable Accounts. \n\n\nD. Review procedures for identifying Entity Accounts with respect to which reporting is required. For Pre-existing Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons: \n\n\n1. Determine whether the Entity is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n(a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction includes a place of incorporation or organisation, or an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\n(b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder, or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person. \n\n\n2. Determine whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In\u00a0making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraph\u00a0D(2)(a) to (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. \n\n\n(a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. \n\n\n(b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For the purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures. \n\n\n(c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person. For the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on: \n\n\n(i) information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Pre-existing Entity Account held by one or more NFEs with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco; or \n\n\n(ii) a self-certification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person of the jurisdiction(s) (a Member State, Monaco or other jurisdictions) in which the Controlling Person is resident for tax purposes. \n\n\nE.\u00a0Timing of review and additional procedures applicable to Pre-existing Entity Accounts. \n\n\n1. Review of Pre-existing Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds, as of 31\u00a0December 2016, USD\u00a0250\u00a0000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco, must be completed by 31 December 2018. \n\n\n\n\n2. Review of Pre-existing Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed, as of 31 December 2016, USD\u00a0250\u00a0000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco, but exceeds that amount as of 31 December of a subsequent year, must be completed within the calendar year following the year in which the aggregate account balance or value exceeds such amount. \n\n\n3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Pre-existing Entity Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must re-determine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D. \n\n\nSECTION VI: DUE DILIGENCE FOR NEW ENTITY ACCOUNTS \n\n\nThe following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New Entity Accounts. \n\n\nA. Review procedures for identifying Entity Accounts with respect to which reporting is required. For New Entity Accounts, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons: \n\n\n1. Determine whether the Entity is a Reportable Person. \n\n\n(a) Obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder\u2019s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures. If the Entity certifies that it has no residence for tax purposes, the Reporting Financial Institution may rely on the address of the principal office of the Entity to determine the residence of the Account Holder. \n\n\n(b) If the self-certification indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction. \n\n\n2. Determine whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a New Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs\u00a0A(2)(a) to (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. \n\n\n(a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must rely on a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. \n\n\n(b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures. \n\n\n(c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person. For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on a selfcertification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person. \n\n\nSECTION VII: SPECIAL DUE DILIGENCE RULES \n\n\nThe following additional rules apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described above:  \n\n\nA. Reliance on Self-Certifications and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting Financial Institution may not rely on a self-certification or Documentary Evidence if the Reporting Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is incorrect or unreliable. \n\n\nB.\u00a0Alternative procedures for Financial Accounts held by individual beneficiaries of a CashValue Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract and for a Group Cash-Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract. A Reporting Financial Institution may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash-Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Reportable Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a Reportable Account unless the Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person. A Reporting Financial Institution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a CashValue Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract is a Reportable Person if the information collected by the Reporting Financial Institution and associated with the beneficiary contains indicia as described in paragraph B of Section III. If a Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the procedures in paragraph B of Section III. \n\n\nA Member State or Monaco shall have the option to allow Reporting Financial Institutions to treat a Financial Account that is a member's interest in a Group Cash-Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract as a Financial Account that is not a Reportable Account until the date on which an amount is payable to the employee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the Financial Account that is a member's interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract meets the following requirements: \n\n\n(i) the Group Cash-Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract is issued to an employer and covers 25 or more employees/certificate holders; \n\n\n(ii) the employee/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value related to their interests and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the employee\u2019s death; and \n\n\n(iii) the aggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does not exceed USD 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco. \n\n\n\n\nThe term \u2018Group Cash-Value Insurance Contract\u2019 means a Cash-Value Insurance Contract that (i) provides coverage on individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group; and (ii) charges a premium for each member of the group (or member of a class within the group) that is determined without regard to the individual health characteristics other than age, gender, and smoking habits of the member (or class of members) of the group. \n\n\nThe term \u2018Group Annuity Contract\u2019 means an Annuity Contract under which the obligees are individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group. \n\n\nBefore 1\u00a0January 2017, Member States shall communicate to Monaco and Monaco shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have exercised the option provided for in this point. The European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from Member\u00a0States to Monaco and the European Commission shall transmit the communication from Monaco to all Member\u00a0States. All further changes to the exercise of that option by a Member\u00a0State or Monaco shall be communicated in the same manner. \n\n\nC. Account balance aggregation and currency rules\u00a0\n\n\n1. Aggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts managed by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution's computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n\n\n2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution\u2019s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and thus allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. \n\n\n3. Special aggregation rule applicable to relationship managers. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a Reporting Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. \n\n\n4. Amounts read to include equivalent in other currencies. All amounts denominated in the domestic currency of a Member State or Monaco shall be read to include equivalent amounts in other currencies, as determined by domestic law. \n\n\nSECTION VIII: DEFINED TERMS \n\n\nThe following terms have the meanings set forth below: \n\n\nA.

The term \u2018standardised industry coding system\u2019 means a coding system used to classify establishments by business type for purposes other than tax purposes. \n\n\nBefore 1\u00a0January 2017, Member States shall communicate to Monaco and Monaco shall communicate to the European Commission whether they have exercised the option provided for in this point. The European Commission may coordinate the transmission of the communication from Member States to Monaco and the European\u00a0Commission shall transmit the communication from Monaco to all Member States. All further changes to the exercise of that option by a Member State or Monaco shall be communicated in the same manner.\n\n\nSECTION IX: EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION \n\n\nEach Member State and Monaco must have rules and administrative procedures in place to ensure effective implementation of, and compliance with, the reporting and due diligence procedures set out above including:\u00a0\n\n\n1. rules to prevent any Financial Institutions, persons or intermediaries from adopting practices intended to circumvent the reporting and due diligence procedures; \n\n\n2. rules requiring Reporting Financial Institutions to keep records of the steps undertaken and any evidence relied upon for the performance of the above procedures and adequate measures to obtain those records; \n\n\n3. administrative procedures to verify Reporting Financial Institutions\u2019 compliance with the reporting and due diligence procedures; administrative procedures to follow up with a Reporting Financial Institution when undocumented accounts are reported; \n\n\n4. administrative procedures to ensure that the Entities and accounts defined in domestic law as Non-Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts continue to have a low risk of being used to evade tax; and \n\n\n\n\n5. effective enforcement provisions to address non-compliance.\n\n\nANNEX II \n\n\nComplementary reporting and due diligence rules for financial account information \n\n\n1. Change in circumstances \n\n\nA \u2018change in circumstances\u2019 includes any change that results in the addition of information relevant to a person's status or otherwise conflicts with such person's status. In addition, a change in circumstances includes any change or addition of information to the Account Holder's account (including the addition, substitution, or other change of an Account Holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such account (applying the account aggregation rules described in subparagraphs C(1) to (3) of Section VII of Annex I) if such change or addition of information affects the status of the Account Holder. \n\n\nIf a Reporting Financial Institution has relied on the residence address test described in subparagraph B(1) of Section III of Annex I and there is a change in circumstances that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know or have reason to know that the original Documentary Evidence (or other equivalent documentation ) is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must, by the latest on the last day of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period, or 90 calendar days following the notice or discovery of such change in circumstances, obtain a self-certification and new Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain the self-certification and new Documentary Evidence by such date, the Reporting Financial Institution must apply the electronic record search procedure described in subparagraphs B(2) to (6) of Section III of Annex I. \n\n\n2. Self-certification for New Entity Accounts \n\n\nWith respect to New Entity Accounts, for the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may only rely on a self-certification from either the Account Holder or the Controlling Person. \n\n\n3. Residence of a Financial Institution \n\n\nA\u00a0Financial Institution is \u2018resident\u2019 in a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction if it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction (i.e., the Participating Jurisdiction is able to enforce reporting by the Financial Institution). In general, where a Financial Institution is resident for tax purposes in a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction, it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member\u00a0State Financial Institution, Monaco Financial Institution or another Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. In the case of a trust that is a Financial Institution (irrespective of whether it is resident for tax purposes in a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction), the trust is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction if one or more of its trustees are resident in such Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction except if the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to this Agreement or another agreement implementing the Global Standard with respect to Reportable Accounts maintained by the trust to another Participating Jurisdiction (a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction), because it is resident for tax purposes in such other Participating Jurisdiction. However, where a Financial Institution (other than a trust) does not have a residence for tax purposes (e.g., because it is treated as fiscally transparent, or it is located in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), it is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction and it is, thus, a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution if: \n\n\n(a) it is incorporated under the laws of the Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction; \n\n\n(b) it has its place of management (including effective management) in the Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction; or \n\n\n(c) it is subject to financial supervision in the Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction. \n\n\nWhere a Financial Institution (other than a trust) is resident in two or more Participating Jurisdictions (a Member State, Monaco or another Participating Jurisdiction), such Financial Institution will be subject to the reporting and due diligence obligations of the Participating Jurisdiction in which it maintains the Financial Account(s). \n\n\n4. Accounts maintained by a Financial Institution\n\n\nIn general, an account would be considered to be maintained by a Financial Institution: \n\n\n(a) in the case of a Custodial Account, by the Financial Institution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a Financial Institution that holds assets in street name for an Account Holder in such institution); \n\n\n(b) in case of a Depository Account, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an agent of a Financial Institution regardless of whether such agent is a Financial Institution); \n\n\n(c) in the case of any equity or debt interest in a Financial Institution that constitutes a Financial Account, by such Financial Institution; \n\n\n(d) in the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract. \n\n\n\n\n5. Trusts that are Passive NFEs \n\n\nAn Entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes, according to subparagraph D(3) of Section VIII of Annex I, shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. For these purposes, a legal person or a legal arrangement is considered \u2018similar\u2019 to a partnership and a limited liability partnership where it is not treated as a taxable unit in a Reportable Jurisdiction under the tax laws of such Reportable Jurisdiction. However,\u00a0in order to avoid duplicate reporting (given the wide scope of the term \u2018Controlling Persons\u2019 in the case of trusts), a trust that is a Passive NFE may not be considered a similar legal arrangement.\u00a0\n\n\n6. Address of Entity\u2019s principal office \n\n\nOne of the requirements described in\u00a0subparagraph E(6)(c) of Section VIII of Annex I is that, with respect to an Entity, the official documentation includes either the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office in the Member State, Monaco or other jurisdiction in which it claims to be a resident or the Member State, Monaco or other jurisdiction in which the Entity was incorporated or organised. The address of the Entity\u2019s principal office is generally the place in which its place of effective management is situated. The address of a Financial Institution with which the Entity maintains an account, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office unless such address is the only address used by the Entity and appears as the Entity's registered address in the Entity's organisational documents. Further, an address that is provided subject to instructions to hold all mail to that address is not the address of the Entity\u2019s principal office. \n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX III\u00a0\n\n\nADDITIONAL DATA PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF THE DATA COLLECTED AND EXCHANGED UNDER THE AGREEMENT\n\n\n1.

The notified Competent Authority shall take all appropriate measures available under its domestic law to address the errors described in the notice.\n\n\n9.

This Amending Protocol is concluded subject to its ratification or approval by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their internal procedures. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of the completion of these procedures. This Amending Protocol shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the last notification.\n\n\n\n2. Subject to the fulfilment of the institutional procedures by the Principality of Monaco and those required by European Union law for the conclusion of international agreements, the Principality of Monaco and the European Union,as the context requires, will implement and effectively apply the Agreement resulting from this Amending Protocol from 1\u00a0January 2017 and notify each other accordingly.\n\n\n\n3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the Contracting Parties shall provisionally apply this Amending Protocol pending its entry into force. Such provisional application shall commence on 1 January 2017, subject to notification by each of the Contracting Parties to the other by 31\u00a0December 2016 of the completion of their respective internal procedures necessary for such provisional application.\n\n\n\n4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, the following obligations under the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol shall continue to apply, as follows:\n\n\n(i) the obligations of the Principality of Monaco and the underlying obligations of paying agents established therein under Articles 8 and 9 of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol shall continue to apply until 30\u00a0June 2017 or until those obligations have been fulfilled;\n\n\n(ii) the obligations of Member States under Article 10 of the Agreement in the form prior to its amendment by this Amending Protocol with regard to withholding tax levied during 2016 and previous years shall continue to apply until those obligations have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\nThe Agreement is supplemented by a Protocol with the following content: \n\n\n\n\u2018Protocol to the \u201cAgreement between the European Union and the Principality of Monaco on the exchange of financial account information to improve international tax compliance in accordance with the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u201d. \n\n\n\nOn the occasion of the signature of this Amending Protocol between the European Union and the Principality of Monaco the duly authorised undersigned have agreed the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the Agreement as amended by this Amending Protocol: \n\n\n\n\n\n1. It is understood that an exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement will be requested only once the requesting State (a Member State or Monaco) has exhausted all regular sources of information available under the internal taxation procedure. \n\n\n\n2. It is understood that the Competent Authority of the requesting State ( a Member State or Monaco) shall provide the following information to the Competent Authority of the requested State (respectively, Monaco or a Member State) when making a request for information under Article 5 of this Agreement: \n\n\n\n(i) the identity of the person under examination or investigation; \n\n\n\n(ii) the period of time for which the information is requested; \n\n\n\n(iii) a statement of the information sought, including its nature and the form in which the requesting State wishes to receive the information from the requested State; \n\n\n\n(iv) the tax purpose for which the information is sought; \n\n\n\n(v) to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession of the requested information. \n\n\n\n3. It is understood that the reference to the standard of \u2018foreseeable relevance\u2019 is intended to provide for an exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Member States and Monaco are not at liberty to engage in \u2018fishing expeditions\u2019 or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While paragraph 2 contains important procedural requirements that are intended to ensure that fishing expeditions do not occur, nevertheless clauses (i) to (v) of that paragraph are not to be interpreted in order to frustrate effective exchange of information. The standard of \u2018foreseeable relevance\u2019 can be met both in cases dealing with one taxpayer (whether identified by name or otherwise) or several taxpayers (whether identified by name or otherwise).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4. It is understood that this Agreement does not include the exchange of information on a spontaneous basis.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5. It is understood that in case of an exchange of information under Article 5 of this Agreement, the administrative procedural rules regarding taxpayers' rights provided for in the requested State (a Member State or Monaco) remain applicable. It is further understood that these provisions aim at guaranteeing the taxpayer a fair procedure and not at preventing or unduly delaying the exchange of information process.\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\n1.
