"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 10.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 133 final\n2016/0073(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee set up by the Convention on a common transit procedure as regards  amendments to that Convention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nAs of 1\u00a0May 2016 Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9\u00a0October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code and its Implementing and Delegated acts will apply (UCC legal package). The UCC legal package will replace the current Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12\u00a0October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2\u00a0July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of the above Council Regulation.\n\n\nThe common transit procedure is an extension of the Union transit procedure to the common transit countries. Therefore the Convention on a common transit procedure has to be amended in order to be aligned with the UCC legal package concerning the Union transit arrangements.\n\n\nThat amendment will allow for a uniform and harmonised application of the transit rules in the European Union and in the common transit countries, as far as possible.\n\n\nThe process to establish an EU common position on draft Decision concerning the amendment to the Convention on a common transit procedure should be relatively smooth as the content is based on EU rules that have been subject to agreement recently.\n\n\nTherefore, in order to be able to provide the legal basis for the use of the amended common transit procedure as soon as the new EU customs legislation is applicable, the draft Council Decision is proposed to provide the basis for the amendment to the Convention.\n\n\nThe Commission is invited to adopt the draft Decision and to transmit the Decision to the Council.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe amendment to the Convention is aimed at its alignment with the UCC legal package concerning the Union transit arrangements which will be applicable as of 1\u00a0May 2016.\n\n\nThat alignment is to improve the functioning of the common transit procedure among the Contracting Parties by enhancing the uniform application of the rules by the respective national customs services. The improvements should result in substantial and tangible benefits for traders and for customs administrations.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 15 of the Convention of 20\u00a0May 1987 on a common transit procedure\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union (common commercial policy)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\nThe form of proposed action is the only one possible.\n\n\nThe form of proposed action does not involve any financing cost.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nProposed instrument: Decision of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee.\n\n\nThere is no other adequate instrument.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nConsultation with approval on the draft Decision No X/2016 of the EU-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit amending the Convention were carried out with the Member States within the Customs Code Committee \u2013 Customs Status and Transit Section and with Contracting Parties to the Convention within the EU-EFTA working group on \"Common transit\".\n\n\nSummary of responses and how they have been taken into account:\n\n\nFavourable opinion\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe alignment of the Convention with the UCC legal package in the area of Union transit arrangements, which will be applicable as of 1\u00a0May 2016 is made due to the amendments to that Union legislation. A separate impact assessment concerning the alignment of the Convention is therefore redundant. \n\n\nThe alignment will nonetheless lead to further facilitation in transit, to the simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities and for economic operators, a possible reduction of cost and an increase in trade.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the UCC legal package, this proposal provides for better adequacy of legislation with business practices, supported by an optimal architecture and planning for IT developments, while encompassing the simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities and private parties. \n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU budget.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal includes amendments to the provisions of the Convention, its Appendices and the Annexes to those Appendices. The amendments are focused on the alignment of those provisions to the UCC legal package.\n\n\n\n2016/0073 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee set up by the Convention on a common transit procedure as regards  amendments to that Convention\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9), thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\n(1)Article 15 of the Convention between the European Economic Community, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Swiss Confederation on a common transit procedure\n1\n (\"the Convention\") empowers the Joint Committee set up by that Convention (\"the Joint Committee\") to recommend and adopt, by decisions, amendments to the Convention and the Appendices thereto.\n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code\n2\n  and its delegated and implementing acts apply from 1 May 2016, introducing a modernised framework for customs procedures, including transit procedures.\n\n\n(3)To ensure the smooth functioning of trade between the Union and the Contracting Parties to the Convention in order to have it more efficient and faster, the common transit procedure should be aligned with the Union transit procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and its delegated and implementing acts to the widest possible extent. For that purpose, amendments to the Convention and its Appendices both with respect to the substance and with respect to the terminology are indispensable.\n\n\n(4)In order to provide sufficient clarity, a terminological alignment with Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and its delegated and implementing acts is necessary. The proposed amendments were presented to and discussed within the EU-EFTA Working Group on \"common transit\" and \"simplification of formalities in trade in goods\" and the text received a preliminary approval by that Working Group.\n\n\n(5)The position of the Union concerning the proposed amendment should therefore be based on the attached draft Decision,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be taken on behalf of the Union within the Joint Committee set up by the Convention on a common transit procedure (\"the Joint Committee\") as regards amendments to that Convention shall be based on the draft Decision attached to this Decision.\n\n\nMinor changes to the draft Decision may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Joint Committee.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nAfter its adoption, the Decision of the Joint Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day after its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 226, 13.8.1987, p. 2.\n\n\n\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9\u00a0October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 10.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 133 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL DECISION\n\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee set up by the Convention on a common transit procedure as regards amendments to that Convention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nDECISION No X/2016 OF THE EU-EFTA JOINT COMMITTEE ON COMMON TRANSIT\n\nof Day\u00a0Month\u00a02016\n\namending the Convention of 20\u00a0May 1987 on a common transit procedure\n\n\n\nTHE JOINT COMMITTEE\n\n\nHaving regard to the Convention of 20\u00a0May 1987 on a common transit procedure\n1\n, and in particular Article 15(3)(a) and (c) thereof, \n\n\nWhereas: \n\n\n(1)Article 15 of the Convention between the European Economic Community, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Swiss Confederation on a common transit procedure  (\"the Convention\") empowers the Joint Committee set up by that Convention (\"the Joint Committee\") to recommend and adopt, by decisions, amendments to the Convention and the Appendices thereto.\n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code and its delegated and implementing acts apply from 1 May 2016, introducing a modernised framework for customs procedures, including transit procedures. \n\n\n(3)To ensure the smooth functioning of trade between the Union and the Contracting Parties to the Convention in order to have it more efficient and faster, the common transit procedure should be aligned with the Union transit procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and its delegated and implementing acts to the widest possible extent.

the debt arises occurred, in which case that time-limit is extended with a maximum of one month;\n\n\n(b)one month from the expiry of the time-limit referred to in Article\u00a049(4) for the reply by the holder of the procedure to a request for the information needed to discharge the procedure, where the customs authority of the country of departure has not been notified of the arrival of the

In this connection account should be taken of the volume of goods removed and the circumstances of their removal, particularly if these result from internationally organised criminal activities.\n\n\n2.Decision-making procedure for temporarily prohibiting use of the comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount or the comprehensive guarantee\n\n\n2.1The procedure for adopting Joint Committee decisions temporarily prohibiting use of the comprehensive guarantee or the comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount in application of Article 77(a) or (b) (hereinafter referred to as the \"decision\") shall be as follows:\n\n\n2.2A decision may be adopted at the request of one or more Contracting Parties.\n\n\n2.3Where such a request is made, the Contracting Parties shall inform each other of the facts they have established and shall consider whether the conditions of points 1.1 or 1.2 are fulfilled.\n\n\n2.4If the Contracting Parties consider that the conditions are fulfilled, they shall forward a draft decision to the Joint Committee for adoption by the written procedure described in point 2.5.\n\n\n2.5The Contracting Party holding the Presidency of the Joint Committee shall send the draft decision to the other Contracting Parties. \n\n\nIf the Contracting Party holding the Presidency of the Joint Committee has not received any written objections from the other Contracting Parties within thirty days of the date when it sent the draft, the decision shall be adopted. The Contracting Party holding the Presidency of the Joint Committee shall inform the other Contracting Parties of the adoption of the decision.\n\n\nIf the Contracting Party holding the Presidency of the Joint Committee receives any objections from one or more Contracting Parties within the time limit, it shall inform the other Contracting Parties.\n\n\n2.6Each Contracting Party shall ensure publication of the decision.\n\n\n2.7The decision shall remain in force for twelve months. Nevertheless the Joint Committee may decide to extend its period of validity or annul it following re-examination by the Contracting Parties.\n\n\n3.Measures to alleviate the financial consequences of prohibiting use of the comprehensive guarantee\n\n\nWhen the use of the comprehensive guarantee has been prohibited temporarily according to Article 77, holders of comprehensive guarantees may, upon request, use an individual guarantee. However, the following special conditions shall apply:\n\n\n\u2013the individual guarantee shall be put up in the form of a specific guarantee document which covers only the types of goods referred to in the decision;\n\n\n\u2013this individual guarantee may be used only at the customs office of departure identified in the guarantee document;\n\n\n\u2013it may be used to cover several simultaneous or successive operations provided that the sum of the amounts involved in current operations for which the procedure has not yet been discharged does not exceed the reference amount of the individual guarantee. In that case, the customs office of guarantee assigns one initial access code for the guarantee to the holder of the procedure. The holder of the procedure can assign one or more access codes to this guarantee to be used by himself or his representatives;\n\n\n\u2013each time the procedure is discharged for a common transit operation covered by this individual guarantee, the amount corresponding to that operation shall be released and may be re-used to cover another operation up to the maximum amount of the guarantee.\n\n\n4.Derogation from the decision temporarily prohibiting use of the comprehensive guarantee or the comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount\n\n\n4.1Holders of the procedure  may be authorised to use a comprehensive guarantee or a comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount to place under the common transit procedure goods to which the decision temporarily prohibiting such use applies if they can show that no debt has arisen in respect of the types of goods in question in the course of common transit operations which they have undertaken in the two years preceding the decision or, where debts have arisen during that period, if they can show that these were fully paid up by the debtor or the guarantor within the time limit prescribed.\n\n\nTo obtain authorisation to use a temporarily prohibited comprehensive guarantee, the holder of the procedure shall also meet the conditions set out in Article 77(2)(b).\n\n\n\n\n4.2Articles 59 to 72 shall apply mutatis mutandis to applications and authorisations for the derogations referred in point 4.1.\n\n\n4.3When the competent authorities grant a derogation they shall endorse box 8 of the comprehensive guarantee certificate, with the following phrase:\n\n\n\u2013UNRESTRICTED USE \u2013 99209\".\n\n\n\nANNEX II is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"ANNEX II\n\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY PROCEDURE FOR COMMON TRANSIT\n\n\nPART I\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\n1.This Annex lays down specific provisions for use of the business continuity procedure, under Article 26(1) of Appendix I, for the holders of the procedure, including authorised consignors, in the event of a temporary failure of:\n\n\n\u2013the electronic transit system;\n\n\n\u2013the computerised system used by the holders of the procedure for lodging the common transit declaration by means of electronic data-processing techniques, or\n\n\n\u2013the electronic connection between the computerised system used by the holders of the procedure for lodging the common transit declaration by means of electronic data-processing techniques and the electronic transit system.\n\n\n2.Transit declarations\n\n\n2.1The transit declaration used in a business continuity procedure shall be recognisable by all parties involved in the transit operation in order to avoid problems at the customs office of transit, at the customs office of destination and upon arrival at the authorised consignee.
