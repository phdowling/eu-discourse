In line with Article 25(2) of the Regulation, the Commission presented in October 2013 a comprehensive report to the European Parliament and the Council\n2\n on the implementation of the Regulation. The report concluded that the EU export control system provides solid legal and institutional foundations but cannot remain static and must be upgraded in order to face new challenges. In April 2014, the Commission adopted a Communication\n3\n\u00a0setting out concrete policy options for the review of the EU export control regime and its adaptation to rapidly changing technological, economic and political circumstances. In 2015, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of the review options outlined in that Communication to identify the most suitable regulatory and non-regulatory actions to bring them into effect. This proposal has been prepared in light of the conclusions of the impact assessment. \n\n\nThe export control policy review has been identified as an initiative under the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) in consideration of its potential regulatory simplification and burden reduction.\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 has been amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and readability.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe proposal aims at supporting the overall policy objectives of the Union, as laid out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, i.e. \"contribute to peace and security, as well as free and fair trade and the protection of human rights\". The proposal will contribute to the European Security Strategy\n4\n, and in particular responds to the 2013 Council Conclusions on the new challenges presented by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\n5\n. The proposal will also ensure that the EU and its Member States effectively comply with their international obligations, in particular with respect to WMD non-proliferation. Moreover, the proposal will enhance the EU's efforts to prevent non-state actors from gaining access to sensitive items and will thus contribute to the fight against terrorism\n6\n. Lastly, in light of the increasing blurring between the civilian and defence sectors, the proposal forms part of the EU's efforts to counter hybrid threats\n7\n.\n\n\nThe proposal is fully in line with EU trade policy's aim to foster competitiveness and reduce distortions to trade, and with the 2015 \"Trade for All\" Communication'\n8\n which announced \"an ambitious modernisation of the EU\u00b4s policy of export controls of dual-use goods, including the prevention of the misuse of digital surveillance and intrusion systems that results in human rights violations\u201d.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal \u2013 and in particular provisions relating to the control of cyber-surveillance technologies \u2013 will contribute to the protection of human rights globally, in line with the 2015\u00a0Human Rights Action Plan\n9\n and the EU Guidelines for Freedom of Expression\n10\n, which explicitly call for tightening controls on the export of such technologies.\u00a0\n\n\nThe proposal will also support the digital single market strategy, as the introduction of controls on cyber-surveillance technology aims at addressing risks associated with digital trade. Since the proposal aims, in particular, to reduce administrative burden by making EU law simpler and less costly, it also serves the objectives of the REFIT programme.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nDual-use export controls form an integral part of the Common Commercial Policy under Article 207 TFEU.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity \n\n\nTrade in dual use items must be based on common principles in compliance with Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), while respecting Member States' prerogatives in the area of security. Moreover, EU intervention is necessary as the security objectives pursued can only be achieved collectively, if competent authorities act in close collaboration and in accordance with the same principles. Action at EU level is also necessary to address distortions of competition within the Single Market and to promote the convergence of controls with third countries and a more level playing field globally. \n\n\nEU intervention is justified in light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, since a number of human rights have been identified as potentially affected by exports of certain dual-use items, in particular in relation to exports of cyber-surveillance technology. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe provisions in this proposal are limited to what is necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Regulation and therefore comply with the principles of proportionality.\n\n\nThe proposal consists mostly of amendments to existing provisions of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, where they are duly justified to enhance the effectiveness or the consistency of controls throughout the EU. Amendments are also proposed that aim at simplifying the administration of controls and reducing the burden for operators across the Single Market. \n\n\nThe proposal however also introduces new provisions to control the export of certain specific cyber-surveillance technology, in order to fill a regulatory gap identified during the export control policy review, i.e. the insufficient legal basis for control in this area.\n\n\nAs illustrated by the impact assessment, other instruments such as guidelines could usefully complement and support the implementation of legislative changes, but would not address the lack of legal clarity of some provisions of the Regulation or the lack of sufficient control of cyber-surveillance technology. Amendments to the Regulation are therefore necessary.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Results of ex-post evaluation\n\n\nIn 2011, the Commission issued a Green Paper\n11\n, inviting stakeholders to express their views about the EU export-control regime. The Commission reported on the outcome of this process in the Staff Working Document \"Strategic export controls: ensuring security and competitiveness in a changing world\"\n12\n. The Staff Working Document concluded that stakeholders called for various adjustments to the EU export control system in order to adapt it to rapidly changing technological, economic and political circumstances. The Staff Working Document formed the basis for the presentation of a Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the Regulation\n13\n which opened the way to the review of EU export control policy. \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe Commission conducted wide-ranging stakeholder consultations to support the preparation of this proposal. The \n\nconsultation\n\n strategy included\u00a0regular dedicated conferences and outreach to key stakeholders in order to develop a dialogue with dual use industry, civil society and Member States. \n\n\nThe Impact Assessment also involved dedicated stakeholder consultations. A 'data collection study' was commissioned in 2014-2015, which included targeted surveys of industry associations and companies, national administrations, academia and non-governmental organizations. Also as part of the impact assessment, the Commission conducted a public consultation in 2015 regarding review options and their impact\n14\n. Stakeholders generally agreed that a review of current rules would improve the export control system, in particular with regards to its capacity to address evolving security risks such as WMD proliferation and terrorism and to respond to rapid scientific and technological developments, and could also enhance the efficiency of export control administration and companies' competitiveness. On the other end, many stakeholders raised concerns regarding the potential economic impact of options to control exports that could be misused for human rights violation in third countries.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nIn the absence of official statistics on dual-use production or trade, the Commission has developed, since 2013, a statistical methodology to assess dual-use trade flows, and also makes use of licensing data shared by Member States. The data collection study commissioned as part of the impact assessment validated that methodology and provided further details e.g. on dual-use related trade flows and on specific sectors. \n\n\nData obtained from the private sector through interviews and surveys, as well as open sources and specialised research, provided additional insights on dual-use trade. \n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe impact assessment report was presented to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB) in March 2016 and received a positive opinion with comments. The RSB opinion is available on the Europa website at http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/impact/iab/iab_en.htm. \n\n\nBesides the baseline scenario (no policy change), the impacts of four other scenarios were assessed, including Option 2 \"Implementation and Enforcement Support\" (consisting in soft law and guidance), Option 3 \"EU System Upgrade\" (adjustments to the regulatory framework), Option 4 \"EU System Modernisation\" (focusing on cyber-surveillance technologies and human rights) and Option 5 \"EU System Overhaul\" (implying full centralisation of controls at EU level). \n\n\nAs a result, a combination of Option 3 and 4 was selected as the 'preferred option'. Option 3 \"EU System Upgrade\" appears as the most efficient and effective option to address problems identified and in light of economic and social (security and human rights) impact criteria. Option 4 \"EU System Modernisation\" was also retained in spite of concerns expressed by some stakeholders. It is recognised that option 4 could result in a higher administrative burden for operators and authorities, since a new category of goods and technology would be subject to control. It also involves a risk that distortions of competition be introduced at global level, as it cannot be assured that other key technology suppliers will introduce similar controls. However, option 4 is expected to have a significant positive impact on security and human rights: it appears as an indispensable condition to prevent human rights violations resulting from the export of EU items to third countries and to address security risks, to the EU and its citizens, associated with new cyber-surveillance technologies. In light of this assessment, the proposal sets out a two-fold approach, combining detailed controls of a few specific listed items with a \"targeted catch-all clause\" to act as an \"emergency brake\" in case where there is evidence of a risk of misuse. The precise design of those new controls would ensure that negative economic impact will be strictly limited and will only affect a very small trade volume.\n\n\nIn spite of its positive long term impact, Option 2 appeared relatively costly in the short to medium term and could only be achieved with additional resources both at national and EU level. Therefore, Option 2 was not retained, although a gradual implementation of some actions could be envisaged (e.g. development of electronic licensing systems, technical consultations with industry) on the basis of a clear prioritisation of tasks and provided the necessary resources can be allocated, including through joint commitments by relevant stakeholders such as Member States and industry.\n\n\nOption 5 would have implied radically changing the EU approach to export controls, including the centralisation of the implementation of controls and the establishment of a central licensing agency at EU level. Considerable the costs \u2013 administrative, financial as well as in terms of legal transition \u2013 and the lack of stakeholder support, this option was not retained.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\n\nAs a REFIT initiative, the proposal is expected to bring benefits in terms of reduction of administrative burden both for operators and public administrations, in particular due to positive impact on staff resources and processing times. Thus, thanks to the introduction of new EU General Export Authorisations (EUGEAs), controls would become four times less costly for companies, and up to 11 times less costly for licensing authorities. The proposal is also expected to enable a reduction of administrative burden within the Single Market, in particular as the number of products subject to control on transfers within the EU would be reduced by approximately 40%. \n\n\nThe proposal also contains amendments to certain key control provisions whose implementation experience has demonstrated to be unclear. The proposal is thus expected to enhance legal clarity and, thus, reduce compliance costs due to complex and unclear control provisions. \n\n\nThe proposal does not provide for exemptions in favour of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): due to overriding security reasons, it is imperative that SMEs comply with controls. However, the scope of certain provisions which may be particularly demanding in terms of human and IT resources has been limited to avoid excessive regulatory burden on SMEs. Thus, the requirement for companies to implement an effective Internal Compliance Programme (ICP) \u2013 a set of formal measures and procedures ensuring compliance with export controls \u2013 mainly applies in relation to global licences, while small companies that cannot afford to develop a formal ICP can export under most general authorisations and/or individual licences. Moreover, the proposal's simplification of licensing procedures and enhanced legal clarity will bring important benefits to SMEs.\n\n\nLastly, the proposal is expected to improve the international competitiveness of EU operators as certain provisions \u2013 e.g. on technology transfers, on the export of encryption \u2013 will facilitate controls in areas where third countries have already introduced more flexible control modalities. The proposal's new chapter on cooperation with third countries is also expected to promote the convergence of controls with key trade partners and a global level-playing field, and thus to have a positive impact on international trade. \n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nSurveillance activities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties must be laid down by law and constitute a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society with due regard for the legitimate interests of the individuals concerned. In recent years however, there have been numerous reports of cyber-surveillance technologies being exported to repressive regimes and/or into conflict areas and misused in violation of human rights. Cyber-surveillance technologies, which have legitimate and regulated law enforcement applications, have thus been misused for internal repression by authoritarian or repressive governments to infiltrate computer systems of dissidents and human rights activists, at times resulting in their imprisonment or even death. As evidenced by those reports, the export of cyber-surveillance technology under such conditions poses a risk to the security of those persons and to the protection of fundamental human rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, freedom of expression, freedom of association, as well as, indirectly, freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, or the right to life.\n\n\nBy subjecting exports of specific cyber-surveillance technologies to authorisation, the proposal provides for an effective response to threats for human rights resulting from their uncontrolled export, which was identified as a key issue in the impact assessment. While the measures will have some effects on the freedom to conduct a business for exporters, these measures will be appropriate to the overall objective of an effective response to threats to human rights resulting from the export of these technologies. The proposal is thus expected to have an overall significant positive impacts for the protection of fundamental rights. The Commission, in close consultations with the Member States and stakeholders, will develop guidelines to support the practical applications of the targeted catch-all controls. The Commission will endeavour to finalise the adoption of these guidelines in a synchronised manner with the entry into force of the Regulation.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nSome specific provisions in the proposal are expected to have implications on the resources of relevant services at EU or national levels. The implementation of the extended competence for the Commission to amend lists of dual-use items and general export authorisations by delegated acts is expected to require about 50% of a Full Time Expert (FTE), depending on the number of modifications to EUGEAs that could be expected each year. In addition, cyber-surveillance controls are expected to require some additional administrative costs (staff) for administrations, both at national and EU level (1 FTE).\n\n\nThe proposal also provides a legal basis to enable the realisation of certain actions \u2013 such as the development of electronic licensing systems \u2013 while the financing and budgetary implications remain to be assessed in detail before any decision is taken regarding their implementation.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nMonitoring of implementation will be carried out in cooperation with Member States in order to ensure that competent authorities and exporters implement effectively and consistently the requirements of the proposed regulation. Periodic (annual) reporting will allow for appropriate monitoring of the implementation of the proposed Regulation and to inform the European Parliament and the Council regularly.\n\n\nIn addition, as indicated in the impact assessment report, the Commission will undertake an evaluation of its new initiative five years after its entry into force in order to assess the actual economic, social, and environmental impacts and evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness and the extent to which its results are consistent with the objectives. The Commission will communicate the results of the evaluation to the European Parliament and the Council. \n\n\n6.DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Modernisation of existing control provisions\n\n\nThe proposal provides for amendments to various control provisions in order to clarify, simplify and improve the regulatory framework in light of \"lessons learnt\" and to tackle new developments:\n\n\n\uf0b7The proposal contains amendments to key export control notions in order to reflect new realities. The definition of dual-use items is thus revised to reflect the emergence of new types of dual-use items, such as cyber-surveillance technologies. The proposal also amends the definition of \"export\" and \"exporter\", as well as provisions relating to the determination of the competent authority, in order to clarify the application of controls to natural persons, who may be \"exporters\", especially when it comes to technology transfers (e.g. service providers, researchers, consultants and even a person downloading \"controlled technology\").\n\n\n\uf0b7Intangible technology transfers (ITT): The proposal clarifies ITT controls and facilitates low-risk technology transfers, as they only become subject to control when the dual-use technology is made available to a person in a third country, which is in particular expected to facilitate the use of cloud services; \n\n\n\uf0b7Technical assistance: With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the provision of technical assistance involving a cross-border movement has become EU competence and is subject to controls. The proposal therefore clarifies applicable controls and defines technical assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Strengthening of brokering controls: the proposal reduces the risk that controls are circumvented by extending the definition of the broker to subsidiaries of EU companies outside of the EU, as well as to brokering services supplied by third country nationals from within the EU territory. Moreover, in order to ensure their consistency and effectiveness, the proposal harmonises their application to non-listed items and military end-uses and extends their application to terrorism and human rights violations. \n\n\n\uf0b7Strengthening of transit controls: in order to ensure the consistency of control, and avoid distortions of competition and the risk of weak links in the chain of controls, the proposal harmonises the application of transit controls to non-listed items and military end-uses, and extends controls to the risk of misuse for terrorist acts and human rights violations. \n\n\n\uf0b7Tackling illicit trade: in order to counter illicit trafficking, and in line with other trade security instruments (restrictive measures), the proposal provides for certain controls \u2013 e.g. on brokering, technical assistance - to apply throughout the EU jurisdiction \u2013 including controls on the activities of EU persons located in third countries, and introduces an anti-circumvention clause, thus establishing an EU-wide legal basis for the prosecution of export control violations. \n\n\n\u2022Optimisation of EU licensing architecture\n\n\nThe proposal further harmonises licensing processes with a view to reducing the administrative burden associated with licences:\n\n\n\uf0b7Harmonisation of licensing processes: the proposal provides for a definition of authorisations and for common licensing parameters (e.g. validity period) and conditions for use of the EUGEAs (registration, reporting requirements...) and for global licences (requirement for an Internal Compliance Programme). A standard requirement for transparency on licensing timelines is proposed with a view to reducing divergences within the Single Market.\n\n\nA new authorisation for 'large-projects' is proposed for certain large multiannual projects e.g. construction of a nuclear power plant, providing the benefit of one single licence covering all related export operations, for the duration of the project and subject to certain conditions (e.g. reporting, auditing).\n\n\n\uf0b7Introduction of new EUGEAs: the proposal introduces new general authorisations to facilitate trade while ensuring a sufficient level of security through robust control modalities e.g. registration, notification and reporting, auditing:\n\n\n\u2013Encryption: this EUGEA could be especially useful given the commercial importance and wide circulation of these items and to ensure a level-playing field in light of license exceptions existing in certain non-EU countries;\n\n\n\u2013Low Value Shipments: this EUGEA aims at facilitating controls for shipments under a certain value provided the items and destinations are eligible and certain conditions are met;\n\n\n\u2013Intra-company transmission of software and technology: this EUGEA aims at facilitating transfers of dual-use technology within a company and its affiliates in non-sensitive countries, in particular for research and development purposes, as long as the technology remains under the ownership or control of the parent company; \n\n\n\u2013\"Other dual-use items\": in light of the experience of certain Member States, the proposal aims at equipping the EU with a capacity to facilitate controls of certain \"other dual-use items\" (e.g. frequency changers) when it is considered appropriate for certain items and destinations.\n\n\n\uf0b7Delegation of competence: the proposal expands the delegation of competence for the Commission to modify destinations or items on EUGEAs, with a view to ensuring that the EU export control regime becomes more flexible and capable of reacting to technological or economic developments.\n\n\n\u2022Convergence of catch-all controls \n\n\nThe proposal provides for a clarification and harmonisation of the definition and scope of catch-all controls to ensure their uniform application across the EU. The proposal also provides for a mandatory consultation procedure between competent authorities to ensure the EU-wide application and validity of catch-all decisions. It introduces regular exchange of information between the Commission and Member States to be supported by a \"catch-all database\" recording catch-all licensing requirements, end-users and items of concern. \n\n\n\u2022Re-evaluation of intra-EU transfers\n\n\nThe proposal revises the list of items subject to control within the EU in order to focus controls on an updated list of most sensitive items (in Section B of Annex IV), taking account of technological and commercial developments. It also introduces a general transfer authorisation in Section A of Annex IV for the updated list of sensitive items. It thus minimises administrative burden and disruptions to trade within the EU while ensuring the security of transfers of most sensitive items through robust control modalities (e.g. registration, notification, reporting, auditing, post-shipment verification).\n\n\n\u2022An initiative to control exports of cyber-surveillance technologies \n\n\nThe proposal responds to the need to protect national security and public morals, in consideration of the proliferation of cyber-surveillance technologies whose misuse poses a risk to international security as well as the security of the EU, its governments, companies and citizens, and to the protection of human rights and digital freedoms in a globally connected world, \n\n\nThe proposal sets out new provisions for an effective control focusing on specific and relevant cyber-surveillance technologies. It introduces an EU autonomous list of specific cyber-surveillance technologies of concern to be subject to controls (monitoring centres and data retention systems), with detailed technical parameters. This systematic control is complemented by a targeted catch-all control, which allows controlling the export of non-listed cyber-surveillance technologies in certain situations where there is evidence that they may be misused. The targeted catch-all control applies where there is evidence that the items may be misused by the proposed end-user\u00a0for directing or implementing serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict or internal repression in the country of final destination. \n\n\n\n\nControls of cyber-surveillance technology are supported by a revised definition of \"dual-use items\", reflecting the evolution towards a wider approach to security also taking into consideration the security of the EU, its citizens and companies. The revised definition of \"dual-use items\" is combined with a definition of \"cyber-surveillance technology\" and revised control criteria, explicitly providing for controls to prevent exports where there is a clear risk of human rights violations and terrorism. \n\n\n\u2022Enhanced cooperation on implementation and enforcement \n\n\nThe proposal provides for enhanced information exchange between competent authorities and the Commission with a view to support effective and consistent application of controls. It introduces a legal basis regarding the introduction of electronic licensing systems and their interconnection with the Dual-Use Electronic System (DUeS) with a view to supporting more effective licensing procedures for all competent authorities, and for the setting up of 'technical expert groups' bringing together key industry and Government experts into a dialogue on the technical parameters for controls. \n\n\nWith due respect to the competences of the Member States, the proposal introduces provisions to support information-exchange and cooperation on enforcement, in particular with the setting up of an enforcement coordination mechanism under the Dual-Use Coordination Group. \n\n\n\u2022Transparency and outreach \u2013 private sector partnership \n\n\nThe proposal sets out transparency measures and expands outreach and information-sharing with operators in order to develop a \"partnership with the private sector\", as the \"first line of defence\" against evolving security risks, and in light of stakeholders' observation that regulatory compliance and competitiveness are mutually reinforcing,. The proposal also provides a legal basis for the development of tools for operators as a key element of that partnership and e.g. supports the introduction of electronic licensing systems in all Member States, which will allow for more timely and efficient management of licensing processes and relations with economic operators. \n\n\nIn response to industry's call for a common interpretation and application of the Regulation, the proposal provides for the publication of guidance\u00a0for exporters on topical issues. Transparency, e.g. with the publication of annual reports, will also enable civil society organisations to fully contribute to the formulation and implementation of export control policy.\n\n\n\u2022Export control dialogue with third countries\n\n\nIn order to enhance regulatory convergence and a global level-playing field, the proposal provides a basis for the development of regular dialogues between the EU and key trade partners, and for the negotiation of mutually beneficial measures such as end-user verification programmes (whereby selected third-country companies could be granted special status of \"Verified end-user\" and obtain EU-wide recognition and facilitation of controls). The EU is also implementing an \"EU P2P Export Control Programme\" in order to assist third\u00a0countries to establish well-functioning export control systems, which offers a basis for updating third countries on developments with respect to EU legislation. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n2016/0295 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nsetting up aCommunity\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering\u00d6\u00a0, technical assistance\u00a0\u00d5 and transit of dual-use items (recast)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 , and in particular Article 133\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0207(2)\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 of 22 June 2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology\n15\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0428/2009\n16\n\u00a0\u00d5 has been significantly\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0substantially\u00a0\u00d5 amended on several occasions\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0times\u00a0\u00d5.

Related materials are materials, equipment and technology covered by relevant multilateral treaties and arrangements, or included on national control lists, which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Controls are also required under relevant international agreements, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, and in line with commitments agreed upon in multilateral export control regimes.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(3)An effective common system of export controls on dual-use items is \u00d6\u00a0therefore\u00a0\u00d5 necessary to ensure that the international commitments and responsibilities of the Member States \u00d6\u00a0and of the Union\u00a0\u00d5 , especially regarding non-proliferation, and of the European Union (EU), are complied with.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 14 (adapted)\n\n\n(4)The Heads of State or Government of the EU adopted in June 2003 an Action Plan on Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (Thessaloniki Action Plan). This Action Plan was complemented by\u00a0tThe EU Strategy against proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction adopted by the European Council on\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0of\u00a0\u00d5 12 December 2003 (EU WMD Strategy).\u00a0According to Chapter III of this Strategy, the European Union must make use of all its instruments to prevent, deter, halt, and if possible eliminate proliferation programmes that cause concern at global level. Subparagraph 30.A(4) of that Chapter specifically refers to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0, as updated by the Council Conclusions of 21 October 2013 on \"ensuring the continued pursuit of an effective EU policy on the new challenges presented by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\", calls for the\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0strengthening \u00d6\u00a0of the\u00a0\u00d5 export control policies and practices \u00d6\u00a0of the Union\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(5)Considering the emergence of new categories of dual-use items, and in response to calls from the European Parliament and indications that certain cyber-surveillance technologies exported from the Union have been misused by persons complicit in or responsible for directing or committing serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict or internal repression, it is appropriate to control the export of those technologies in order to protect public security as well as public morals. These measures should not go beyond what is proportionate. They should, in particular, not prevent the export of information and communication technology used for legitimate purposes, including law enforcement and internet security research. The Commission, in close consultations with the Member States and stakeholders, will develop guidelines to support the practical applications of those controls.\n\n\n\n\n(6)As a result, it is also appropriate to revise the definition of dual-use items, and to introduce a definition of cyber-surveillance technology. It should also be clarified that assessment criteria for the control of exports of dual-use items include considerations regarding their possible misuse in connection with acts of terrorism or human rights violations. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(7)Transmission of \u00d6\u00a0dual-use\u00a0\u00d5 software and technology by means of electronic media, fax or telephone to destinations outside the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 should also be controlled. \u00f0\u00a0In order to limit the administrative burden for exporters and the competent authorities of the Member States, the definition of export should however be revised to exclude transmissions which do not pose a grave risk of proliferation or other misuse covered by this Regulation.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(8)Considering that various categories of persons may be involved in the export of dual-use items, including natural persons such as service providers, researchers, consultants and persons transmitting dual-use items electronically, the definition of exporter, and its application to natural persons, should be clarified.\n\n\n(9)The scope of \"catch-all controls\", that apply to non-listed dual use items in specific circumstances, should be clarified and harmonised, and should address the risk of terrorism and human rights violations. Appropriate exchange of information and consultations on \"catch all controls\" should ensure the effective and consistent application of controls throughout the Union. Targeted catch-all controls should also apply, under certain conditions, to the export of cyber-surveillance technology.\n\n\n(10)The definition of broker should be revised to avoid the circumvention of controls on the provision of brokering services by persons falling within the jurisdiction of the Union. Controls on the provision of brokering services should be harmonised to ensure their effective and consistent application throughout the Union and should also apply in order to prevent acts of terrorism and human rights violations.\n\n\n(11)With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it has been clarified that the supply of technical assistance services involving a cross-border movement falls under Union competence. It is therefore appropriate to clarify the controls applicable to technical assistance services, and to introduce a definition of those services. For reasons of effectiveness and consistency, controls on the supply of technical assistance services should be harmonised and apply also in order to prevent acts of terrorism and human rights violations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(12)This Regulation \u00d6\u00a0(EC) No 428/2009 provides for\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0includes items which only pass through the territory of the Community, that is, those items which are not assigned a customs-approved treatment or use other than the external transit procedure or which are merely placed in a free zone or free warehouse and where no record of them has to be kept in an approved stock record.

For reasons of proportionality, this requirement should apply to specific control modalities in the form of global authorisations and certain general export authorisations.\n\n\n(15)Additional Union general export authorisations should be introduced in order to reduce administrative burden on companies and authorities while ensuring an appropriate level of control of the relevant items to the relevant destinations.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically should have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(19)National provisions and decisions affecting exports of dual-use items must\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be taken in the framework of the common commercial policy, and in particular Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports\n17\n\u00a0Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n. \u00f0\u00a0Appropriate exchange of information and consultations on national provisions and decisions should ensure the effective and consistent application of controls throughout the Union.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n(20)The existence of a common control system and harmonised policies for enforcement and monitoring in all Member States is a prerequisite for establishing the free movement of dual-use items inside the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 9\n\n\nParticular attention needs to be paid to issues of re-export and end-use.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(21)Pursuant to and within the limits of Article 30\u00a0\u00d6\u00a036\u00a0\u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 and pending a greater degree of harmonisation, Member States retain the right to carry out controls on transfers of certain dual-use items within the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 in order to safeguard public policy or public security. \u00f0\u00a0For reasons of proportionality, controls on the transfer of dual-use items within the Union should be revised in order to minimise the burden for companies and authorities.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Where these controls are linked to the effectiveness of controls on exports from the Community, they\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Moreover, the list of items subject to intra-Union transfer controls in Section B of Annex IV\u00a0\u00ef should be periodically reviewed by the Council\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0in light of technological and commercial developments and as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of transfers\u00a0\u00ef .\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(22)On 22 September 1998 representatives of the Member States and the European Commission signed Protocols additional to the respective safeguards agreements between the Member States, the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, among other measures, oblige the Member States to provide information on transfers of specified equipment and non-nuclear material. \u00f0\u00a0Intra-Union transfer controls should allow the Member States and the Union to fulfil their obligations under these agreements.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0428/2009 recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(23)It is desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the EU\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 in order to promote EU\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters.

While customs authorities share certain information with other customs authorities using risk management system in accordance with Union customs rules, it is also appropriate to ensure close cooperation between licensing and customs authorities\u00ef . Among the benefits of this approach would be, for example, an assurance that a Member State's essential security interests would not be threatened by an export from another Member State. Greater convergence of conditions implementing national controls on dual-use items not listed in this Regulation, and harmonisation of the conditions of use of the different types of authorisations that may be granted under this Regulation would bring about more uniform and consistent application of controls. Improving the definition of intangible transfers of technology, to include making available controlled technology to persons located outside the EU, would assist the effort to promote security as would further alignment of the modalities for exchanging sensitive information among Member States with those of the international export control regimes, in particular by providing for the possibility of establishing a secure electronic system for sharing information among Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(24)It is appropriate to clarify that, to the extent that it concerns personal data, processing and exchange of information should comply with the applicable rules on processing and exchange of personal data in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n.\n\n\n(25)Outreach to the private sector and transparency are essential elements for an effective export control regime.

Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or \"laser\" irradiation.\n\n\n\n\nN.B. 1CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.\n\n\nN.B. 2Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.\n\n\nN.B. 3The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.\n\n\nb.Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates.\n\n\nThe addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process.\n\n\nThe use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes.\n\n\nSpecific TE-PVD processes are as follows:\n\n\n1.Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;\n\n\n2.Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;\n\n\n3.\"Laser\" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave \"laser\" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;\n\n\n4.Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition.\n\n\nN.B.This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.\n\n\n5.Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.\n\n\nc.Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:\n\n\n1.The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);\n\n\n2.An activator (normally a halide salt); and\n\n\n3.An inert powder, most frequently alumina.\n\n\nThe substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1030 K (757 \u00b0C) and 1375 K (1,102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.\n\n\nd.Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.\n\n\nN.B. 1Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\n\n\n\nN.B. 2High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0,1 MPa.\n\n\ne.Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.\n\n\nf.Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.\n\n\nN.B. 1The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials.\n\n\nN.B. 2Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.\n\n\ng.Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.\n\n\nCATEGORY 3 \u2014ELECTRONICS\n\n\n3ASystems, Equipment and Components\n\n\nNote 1:The control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10., 3A001.a.12. or 3A001.a.13, which are specially designed for or which have the same functional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\n\n\nNote 2:The control status of integrated circuits described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9., 3A001.a.12. or 3A001.a.13 Which are unalterably programmed or designed for a specific function for another equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.\n\n\nN.B.:When the manufacturer or applicant cannot determine the control status of the other equipment, the control status of the integrated circuits is determined in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.9., 3A001.a.12 and 3A001.a.13.\n\n\n3A001\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electronic components and specially designed components therefor, as follows:\n\n\na.General purpose integrated circuits, as follows:\n\n\nNote 1:The control status of wafers (finished or unfinished), in which the function has been determined, is to be evaluated against the parameters of 3A001.a.\n\n\nNote 2:Integrated circuits include the following types:\n\n\n\u2013\"Monolithic integrated circuits\";\n\n\n\u2013\"Hybrid integrated circuits\";\n\n\n\u2013\"Multichip integrated circuits\";\n\n\n\u2013\"Film type integrated circuits\", including silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits;\n\n\n\u2013\"Optical integrated circuits\";\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\"Three dimensional integrated circuits\".\n\n\n1.Integrated circuits designed or rated as radiation hardened to withstand any of the following:\n\n\na.A total dose of 5 \u00d7 103 Gy (silicon) or higher;\n\n\nb.A dose rate upset of 5 \u00d7 106 Gy (silicon)/s or higher;
