The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle for the following reason. \u00a0\n\n\nThe objective of this proposal, namely to ensure the homogeneity of the Internal Market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the effects, be better achieved at Union level. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objective \u2013 to ensure the homogeneity of the Internal Market.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nIn conformity with Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the chosen instrument is the EEA Joint Committee decision. The EEA Joint Committee shall ensure the effective implementation and operation of the EEA Agreement. To this end, it shall take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. \n\n\n3.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe EEA EFTA States shall financially contribute to the Budget of the Union, Budget line 33 02 03 01: \u201cCompany law\u201d. The exact amount will be determined in conformity with the provisions of the EEA Agreement, once this draft Council Decision is adopted. \n\n\n2016/0165 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union,\nwithin the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms\n(Budget Line 33.02.03.01-Company Law)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area\n2\n, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Agreement on the European Economic Area\n3\n ('the EEA Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 1994.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement ('Protocol 31').\n\n\n(3)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement contains provisions on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms.\n\n\n(4)It is appropriate to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement in Union actions funded from the general budget of the European Union regarding company law.\n\n\n(5)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take place from 1 January 2016.\n\n\n(6)The position of the Union within the EEA Joint Committee should be based on the attached draft decision,\n\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be adopted, on the Union's behalf, within the EEA Joint Committee on the proposed amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA\u00a0Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms, shall be based on the draft decision of the EEA\u00a0Joint Committee attached to this\u00a0Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 305, 30.11.1994, p. 6\u20138\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 305, 30.11.1994, p. 6.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 3. \n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 2.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 362 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union,within the EEA Joint Committee concerning an amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms(Budget Line 33.02.03.01-Company Law)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nDECISION OF THE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE No .../2016\n\n\nof \namending Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement,\non cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms\n\n\nTHE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (\u201cthe EEA Agreement\u201d), and in particular Articles 86 and 98 thereof,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)It is appropriate to extend the cooperation of the Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement to include Union actions funded from the general budget of the European Union regarding company law.\n\n\n(2)Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take place from 1 January 2016,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe following paragraph is added in Article 7 of Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement:\n\n\n\u201813.The EFTA States shall, as from 1 January 2016, participate in the Union actions related to the following budget line, entered into the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2016:\n\n\n-Budget line 33 02 03 01: \u201cCompany law\u201d.\u2019\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following the last notification under Article 103(1) of the EEA Agreement\n1*.\n\n\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2016.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall be published in the EEA Section of, and in the EEA Supplement to, the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nDone at Brussels, .\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the EEA Joint Committee\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Secretaries\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to the EEA Joint Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n[No constitutional requirements indicated.] [Constitutional requirements indicated.]\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
