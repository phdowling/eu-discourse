The Services Directive, adopted in 2006, set general provisions facilitating the establishment of service providers and their ability to offer services cross-border in the single market. The Directive prompted a number of reforms across the EU Member States, adding an estimated 0.9% to the GDP of the EU over ten years.\n\n\nThere is nevertheless still a large potential for growth and jobs that remains to be captured. EU services markets would benefit from faster productivity growth and a more efficient allocation of resources. Cross-border trade and investment in services remain low. Tackling remaining obstacles to more cross-border activities in services will help to strengthen competition, resulting in more choice and better prices for consumers as well as increased innovation. Addressing these barriers under the framework already provided by the Services Directive offers a potential of generating an additional 1.7% to the GDP of the EU.\n1\n In addition, better functioning services markets will positively affect the competitiveness of industry as the EU manufacturing sector represents an important buyer and final user of services. In fact, services account for 40% in the value of a final manufacturing product in the EU. A competitive manufacturing sector is therefore conditional upon well-functioning services markets. \n\n\nFor these reasons the European Council underlined that \"delivering a deeper and fairer Single Market will be instrumental in creating new jobs, promoting productivity and ensuring an attractive climate for investment and innovation\".\n2\n A better functioning internal market is one of the ten priorities for the European Commission. In its Single Market Strategy adopted in October 2015, the Commission announced a series of actions to make the single market without borders for services a reality.\n3\n The objective is clear: reduce  hurdles to make it easier for service providers to pursue new business opportunities, while guaranteeing quality services for consumers. This proposal follows up on the Single Market Strategy. \n\n\nThe Services Directive provides a balanced legal framework to achieve these objectives. It ensures that national regulation is non-discriminatory, justified and proportionate to meet public interest objectives.  In addition, it requires Member States to reduce obstacles of administrative nature dissuading in practice service providers to operate cross-border. The Services Directive and the important principles it established will remain unaffected by this proposal.\n\n\nThese principles introduced by the Services Directive have enabled positive progress towards a better functioning of EU services markets. At the same time, obstacles to increased single market integration are still present in a number of key services sectors.  This is the case particularly in several business services and the construction sector where service providers can often not easily pursue business opportunities in other Member States. They are faced with administrative obstacles when expanding abroad. This was confirmed through extensive contacts with service providers.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nService providers face administrative complexity when going cross-border. This includes a lack of clarity on how to comply with existing rules dissuading companies, notably SMEs, from attempting to exploit business opportunities in other Member States. Service providers find it difficult to obtain information on applicable regulatory requirements and procedures that need to be completed to access another Member State's market. In addition, national rules often account only for national situations without clarifying how they should be applied to service providers from other EU Member States. As a result, service providers trying to establish a permanent presence in another Member State or to provide cross-border services on a temporary basis often find it difficult to understand which rules to apply and how. Administrative formalities in different Member States are often complicated and costly for service providers to complete. \n\n\nThe European services e-card therefore aims to reduce administrative complexity for service providers that want to expand their activities to other Member States. It will at the same time ensure that Member States can apply justified regulation. It would be offered to service providers on a voluntary basis as an alternative route to show compliance with the applicable national rules. It allows service providers to use a fully-electronic EU-level procedure to complete formalities when expanding abroad, hereby offering them increased legal certainty and significantly reducing administrative complexity. Through the e-card they will be able to avoid administrative obstacles such as uncertainty as to which requirements apply, filling-in disparate forms in foreign languages, translating, certifying or authenticating documents and non-electronic procedural steps. Cost savings related to the formalities covered by the e-card procedure would be significant compared to the existing situation, potentially going up to 50% or even more.\n5\n\n\n\nWhere a service provider plans to provide a service temporarily cross-border, the e-card would be issued by the home Member State. The host Member States would be able to object to issuance of the e-card where the Services Directive already allows them to do so under one of the overriding reasons of public interest listed in Article 16. Once issued, the e-card would allow the service provider to provide services on a temporary cross-border basis in the host Member State. Decision-making powers of host Member States to reject an application for a European services e-card remain accordingly unchanged, in line with Article 16 of the Services Directive.\n\n\nWhere a service provider plans to provide services through a branch, agency or office in another Member State, the e-card is issued by the host Member State. In this case the service provider would still request the e-card with his home country authorities, who would check that the service provider is established on its territory in line with its applicable rules. But in a second step, the home Member States authorities would initiate a process with the relevant host country administration to allow the latter to verify if the requesting service provider meets its host country regulatory requirements in compliance with the Services Directive. As a result, there would be no unequal treatment between domestic and foreign service providers. Once issued, the e-card would allow its holder to provide services through a secondary establishment (in the form of a branch, agency or office) in the host Member State concerned. \n\n\nThe idea of the European services e-card is similar to the European professional card (EPC), which Member States' authorities are already familiar with. The EPC was made available in January 2016 and there has been a significant take-up by the selected professionals covered, showing that this type of simplification tool provides practical benefits to its users. Both the European services e-card and the EPC are voluntary electronic procedures running at EU-level. The use of a European services e-card is voluntary for service providers. The home country authority of the applicant acts as the single contact point. In addition, the functioning of both systems relies on pre-defined and binding workflows of cooperation between home and host Member States implemented via the existing Internal Market Information System (IMI) established by the IMI Regulation\n6\n. \n\n\nAt the same time, both systems have different objectives. The EPC facilitates provision of services across borders through the recognition of professional qualifications for natural persons as workers or self-employed service providers in accordance with the Professional Qualifications Directive (PQD). \n\n\nThe European services e-card addresses a much wider range of requirements. It would be available for both natural persons who are self-employed but also for companies who want to provide services in another Member State. In contrast with the EPC, the European services e-card would also offer technical facilities to facilitate compliance with administrative formalities related to posting of staff into the territory of those Member States that have communicated to the Commission that they wish to make use of IMI for this purpose. This possibility to make use of IMI will in no way alter the substance of the applicable rules laid down in Directive 2014/67/EU. Rules to facilitate obtaining insurance coverage for services provided across borders are also included. \n\n\nThe e-card would cover requirements falling under the Services Directive and accordingly not areas such as tax, labour and social security. Nevertheless, authorities in Member States shall not require the e-card holder to provide any information which is already contained in the e-card for procedures or formalities imposed on a provider in relation to the award of a public contract, a design contest or a concession, formation of subsidiaries or registration of branches under company law and registration with mandatory social insurance schemes. \n\n\nThe European services e-card would apply \u2013 in a first stage \u2013 to business services and construction services \u2013 to the extent the related activities fall already under the Services Directive. Both sectors are of key importance for the EU economy.\n7\n Service providers of construction or business services often face high administrative complexity when expanding abroad. In addition, productivity growth over the last decade has been very low in both sectors and there is limited cross-border trade and investment. Increased cross-border competition would help preserve and improve the competitiveness of both sectors. \n\n\nThis proposal also includes review clauses for future consideration of the effectiveness of the European service e-card, including as regards compliance with the formalities necessary for the posting of workers and taking account of the experience of those Member States that may have opted for the possibility provided for in Article 6(3) of this draft Regulation to allow for the relevant formalities to be carried out through an electronic platform connected to IMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis Regulation is presented together with a Directive. The Regulation introduces the European services e-card without modifying the underlying EU rules. It sets up tools which are available for service providers throughout the EU. In addition, it facilitates the solution of issues related to insurance coverage of a service provider active cross border. The Directive sets out the legal and operational framework of the European services e-card, regulating inter alia the conditions of eligibility, the competences of the home and the host Member States, the validity of the European service e-card and the conditions for revoking or suspending it. \n\n\nThis Regulation fully preserves the existing EU provisions on social issues, employment conditions (in particular posting of workers, workers' rights and the social pillar), health and safety and protection of the environment. It does not change or put into question existing safeguards in this respect. The e-card would provide further information about the company. The Member State's power to carry out on-site inspections would be completely untouched. The rules on posting of workers under Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU will continue to apply in the context of the European services e-card but further facilities shall be provided in order to comply with these rules. Where Member States have set up procedures that allow for a declaration relating to the posting of workers pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2014/67/EU to be completed by electronic means, the European services e-card shall direct the card holder to the relevant national procedures. Providers who hold a European services e-card may also submit this declaration through an electronic platform connected to IMI where a host Member State has communicated to the Commission that this possibility should apply for the posting of workers in its territory.\n\n\nThe proposal for a European services e-card is complementary to other policy initiatives in the context of services announced in the Single Market Strategy to prevent the introduction of barriers to cross-border service provision at national level. In this respect, it is complementary to the Commission proposal [XX] for a Directive reforming the procedure by which Member States must notify authorisation schemes and requirements related to services. \n\n\nThis proposal will also be complemented by the initiative of the Single Digital Gateway, announced in the Single Market Strategy for 2017. The Gateway, on which a public consultation was conducted in autumn 2016, will address the current information gaps for businesses and citizens by integrating, completing and improving the relevant EU and national-level online information. It will also link up with assistance services. Moreover, it will aim to push the further digitalisation of national procedures relevant for citizens and businesses exercising their Single Market rights. The scope of the Single Digital Gateway is intended to go beyond the sectors covered by the present initiative.  \n\n\nIn comparison, the European services e-card should offer a fully harmonised and standardised instrument for cross-border provision of services, reducing compliance costs for specific services markets largely dominated by SMEs. It is serving the objective of administrative simplification with the involvement of the Member State where the service provider comes from but that (home) Member State has no say on what requirements a service provider has to satisfy in other Member States. Under the European services e-card, it is up to the latter to inform of and ensure compliance in the framework of a predefined and fully standardized workflow. The Single Digital Gateway will link up with this procedure and make it easy to find for its beneficiaries.\n\n\nThe implementation of the European services e-card will be fully aligned with the development of the Single Digital Gateway project and respect the principles outlined in the eGovernment action plan (in particular: digital, interoperable, cross-border, once-only and inclusive by default)\n8\n. \n\n\nFinally, this proposal is complementary to the enforcement policy of the Commission, which it pursues in parallel, to tackle unjustified or disproportionate national restrictions to the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services.\n\n\nThe implementation of this Regulation will be supported by the Internal Market Information System (IMI) established by the IMI Regulation.\n9\n IMI can be used by around 5000 authorities since 2011; it is subject to constant user surveys and has proven its potential with the European professional card introduced in January 2016. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal for a European services e-card under this regulation and the proposed directive are fully consistent with a number of other Union policies, in particular with those pursuing the same objectives of administrative simplification and reducing requirements to service providers. \n\n\nSimplification of formalities regarding documents would follow closely the solutions to be introduced under the Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 on the promotion of the free movement of citizens by simplifying the requirements for presenting certain public documents in the European Union\n10\n.\n\n\nIn the area of recognition of professional qualifications, a similar tool fostering administrative simplification - the above-mentioned European professional card - was introduced in 2013 and is available for a selected number of professions (nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, mountain guides and real estate agents) since January 2016. In order to avoid any risk of duplications, the present proposal ensures that professionals who can apply for a European professional card cannot obtain a European services e-card.   \n\n\nIn the context of the European services e-card procedure, coordinating authorities and competent authorities shall make use of all available interconnections of national registers including the interconnection of company registers (BRIS), as required by Directive 2009/101/EC, and of insolvency registers under Regulation (EU) 2015/848 before any other means of obtaining or verifying previously obtained information for the purposes of this procedure.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThis legislative action falls within the area of shared competence in accordance with article 4(2)(a) TFEU. It aims to facilitate establishment and the provisions of services by the adoption of measures on approximation of the provisions laid down by law which have as their object the functioning of the internal Market. This Regulation is based on Article 114 TFEU which is the general legal basis for adoption of such measures. \n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe overall objective of this legislative proposal is to ensure the smooth functioning of the EU single market for services, which is not limited to the territory of one Member State, but covers the entire territory of the EU. Given the transnational nature of the EU single market, and the necessity to address situations in cross-border contexts in the most coherent manner, making use of an existing IT tool running across the EU \u2013 the IMI \u2013, constitutes an efficient response which can only be provided by action at EU-level.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe measures introduced by this Regulation are proportionate to its objective of further integrating the services markets at EU level, by enabling increased market dynamics and cross-border competition. They are also proportionate to the objectives of increasing transparency, reducing costs and simplifying procedures that Member States impose to service providers in cross-border situations, in particular in the procedures for the posting of staff and regarding professional liability insurance. In addition, it builds on the IMI, an existing EU-level IT instrument funded by the EU budget and already used by national administrations. The EU-level procedure will only bring limited adjustments to IMI, resulting in limited costs at EU and national level. Such limited costs have been assessed with respect to existing similar procedures, such as the European professional card.\n\n\nThese measures do not extend beyond what is necessary to solve the identified problems and to achieve the identified objectives. Although the EU-level procedure requires an active role of Member State\u2019s administrations, the financial efforts to be expected by Member States will be limited through the use of the Internal Market Information system, a platform already existing and set in place with  EU funds. In addition, prospects brought by the use of the European services e-card of additional competition in services markets with more market players, and additional turnover, shall have a positive effect on Member States\u2019 economies.\n\n\nThe use of a European services e-card will be voluntary for service providers. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis Regulation is based on article 114 TFEU. It includes provisions to facilitate the exercise of secondary establishment and freedom to provide services and temporary cross-border situations. Building on this Treaty provision, the Regulation also introduces practical tools regarding professional liability insurance which service providers are seeking for their activities abroad.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nIn preparation of this proposal, the Commission has carried out an in-depth evaluation of the Services Directive. This evaluation showed that the implementation of the Services Directive has been only partially effective so far. The Services Directive has been able to generate additional growth through Member States' reforms. Nevertheless, service providers in key services sectors (such as business services and construction) still face an important number of barriers. In addition, the system of administrative cooperation between Member States is not delivering all its benefits. An in-depth analysis carried out on the functioning and usability of the PSCs concluded that most PSCs have not yet led to all the expected simplification in administration in terms for providing temporary cross-border services or setting up a business. \n\n\nIn addition, evaluation from the Commission revealed that Member States take a very heterogeneous approach as regards insurance obligations and access to insurance for provision of services, making it difficult and costly for service providers to contract insurance coverage for cross-border provision of services, in particular in business services and construction.\n\n\nAll these remaining obstacles are to the detriment of the development of more cross-border trade and investment in the field of services.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe Commission has carried out several analyses and consultations to gather evidence on the remaining obstacles to a fully functioning Single Market for services, with a greater focus on the practical effects of the provisions on the ground. Economic assessment has been conducted to evaluate the effects of national reform in services markets and access to insurance for service providers. In addition, stakeholder workshops have been organised as part of the Single Market Forum in 2014, 2015 and 2016. These looked into the challenges of small and medium-sized enterprises to develop in cross-border regional markets, or into specific challenges in services sectors (in particular business services and construction services) which are hampered by low cross-border trade and investment at the EU level. The contributions and input gathered revealed that despite some progress over the past years, service providers in several economically important sectors still face a range of obstacles when seeking to expand across Member States\u2019 borders. \n\n\nStakeholders have expressed different views on the possible ways to improve the framework to which the services markets are subject in the EU and at national level.  Stakeholders almost unanimously oppose reopening the Services Directive. This Regulation does not modify any substantive rules on cross-border service provision of services as laid down in the Services Directive, nor any rules related to posting of workers, health and safety or protection of the environment.\n\n\nAn online public consultation  ran from 3 May to 26 July 2016. The consultation gathered further views from stakeholders, as well as first-hand experiences on the remaining barriers in these services sectors in particular, to the cross-border provision of services in the EU.\n\n\nThe Commission also gathered views from stakeholders at several occasions on problems faced by service providers in obtaining insurance cover when providing services in another Member State on a temporary basis, in particular via two public consultations in 2013 and in 2015. \n\n\nThe results of all these exercises have confirmed that unjustified or disproportionate requirements still persist at national level, to the detriment of service providers and service recipients in the Single Market. In addition, they have given specific indications of what policy responses are expected from stakeholders. The majority of them supported the need to address the remaining barriers to cross-border provision of services, and to facilitate access to insurance coverage in these situations, while maintaining the EU acquis on social, employment, health and safety or the environment, and while pursuing an ambitious enforcement policy. In this respect, the Commission has adopted a comprehensive enforcement package in November 2016 to address disproportionate restrictions introduced in the field of services in nine Member States.\n\n\nThis initiative aimed to enhance the development of cross-border services markets was also supported by the Competitiveness Council in its Conclusions of 29 February 2016 on the Single Market Strategy\n11\n and by the European Council in its Conclusions of 28 June 2016\n12\n. It has also been supported by the European Parliament in its report on the Single Market Strategy adopted on 26 May 2016\n13\n.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe results of a mutual evaluation process with Member States in 2010-11, performance checks carried out in 2011-12 and peer review undertaken in 2012-2013 all contributed to the preparation of this proposal for a Regulation. In addition, the results of different public consultations, including the one conducted in summer 2016, have offered a solid basis of expertise. \n\n\nOn insurance aspects, the outcome of the public consultation launched in 2013 on difficulties faced by service providers in obtaining insurance coverage in cross-border contexts, and in December 2015 for a possible Green Paper on retail financial services, have also been taken into account. This last consultation also dealt with specific issues related to access to professional indemnity insurance in a cross-border context. In addition, regular discussions have been held with representatives of the insurance sector.\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has carried out multiple workshops with stakeholders, in particular social partners, gathering expertise on difficulties encountered due to important administrative requirements across Member States. Data has also been gathered through external studies and reports. Furthermore, the Commission relied on regular exchanges at technical level in the context of its Experts Group on the Implementation of the Services Directive.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nAn impact assessment was carried out in preparation of this initiative. The resubmitted report takes into account the recommendations made by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board in its initial negative opinion of 14 October 2016\n14\n as well as the additional points raised by the Board in its final positive opinion of 8 November 2016\n15\n. In particular, the problem description and the scope of the impact assessment have been clarified, the various policy options have been regrouped into clearly recognizable option packages and administrative cost reductions have been estimated with greater precision.\n\n\nIndividual policy options have been considered in the impact assessment and grouped into \"packages\" of policy options. The following packages of policy options have been examined:\n\n\n\uf0b7A first option package would allow the service provider to obtain a certificate regarding legal establishment in the home Member State and confirmation of existing insurance coverage for activities also in the home Member State; \n\n\n\uf0b7A second option package would allow the service provider to make use of an EU-level procedure to facilitate access to the market of another Member State, including an advanced electronic mechanism connected to IMI to facilitate compliance with formalities for posted staff which the host Member State can choose to make use of. In addition, it would address practical obstacles related to insurance in cross-border situations; \n\n\n\uf0b7A third option package would in addition to package 2 reduce regulatory disparity in a number of key business services (architectural, engineering and accounting services) through harmonisation of a limited number of requirements applicable to service providers in these three services (namely legal form restrictions, requirements laying down the percentage of shareholding that should be reserved for professionals and restrictions to the provision of multidisciplinary activities);\n\n\n\uf0b7A fourth option package would in addition to package 3 introduce specific solutions to address the regulatory disparities mentioned above in the case of secondary establishment (branches and agencies), exempting foreign service providers from certain requirements while allowing the host Member State to introduce alternative safeguards. \n\n\nThe first package would generate certain simplification effects which are however more limited compared to the other packages. While both packages 3 and 4 would have even stronger effects than package 2 given that they also address regulatory obstacles (in addition to administrative simplification), the Commission decided to go for package 2, based on the following reasoning:  The removal of the most restrictive requirements covered by packages 3 and 4 through targeted enforcement action, complemented by specific recommendations tackling the whole regulatory framework applicable to the profession providing the service, appears more proportionate than a legislative proposal introducing minimum harmonisation for a limited number of requirements in a limited number of services sectors. In addition, Package 4 is discarded also because it would give rise to perceptions of introducing a solution driven by a country of origin approach under which foreign service providers are subject to their home member States legislation only, leading to a reverse discrimination of domestic service providers. \n\n\nThe package chosen is expected to lead to increased legal certainty and cost savings for service providers going cross-border. It is liable to generate an increase in market dynamics and competition levels, hereby increasing choice and value added for consumers. \n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe proposal for a regulation introducing a European services e-card will contribute to regulatory fitness regarding market access for service providers and simplification by improving the modalities by which service providers are given access to another Member State\u2019s market.  This does not alter the prerogatives of host Member States under the Services Directive.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental rights\n\n\nThis proposal promotes rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. More specifically, protection of personal data shall be ensured in line with Article 8 of the Charter. In addition, the main objective of this initiative is to facilitate the rights of establishment and the right to provide services in any Member State, as prescribed by Article 15(2) of the Charter, ensuring no discrimination, even indirect, is in place on grounds of nationality (further implementing Article 21(2) of the Charter). Moreover, the EU-level procedure is envisaged to put in place an impartial, fair and reasonably speedy procedure, also in regards to Commission participation, as required by Article 41 of the Charter. Finally, prohibition of abuse of rights, namely of the freedom to provide service, shall be duly considered, as prescribed by Article 54 of the Charter. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget to the extent that the future European services e-card will use the Internal Market Information System (\"IMI\") as its operational backbone. The IMI will have to be adapted to support the European services e-card procedure and storage requirements and supplemented with some additional functions, namely a public interface for service providers, interconnections to other relevant systems, and a back-office functionality for national authorities. This is due to the fact that for the European services e-card purposes IMI will be offered as a tool for the effective exchange of information and mutual assistance between competent authorities within a certain Member State, without prejudice to other solutions put in place by Member States. The implications for the EU budget will be modest in view of the fact that using the IMI to underpin the European services e-card will provide important economies of scale and scope. In addition, the main existing IMI capabilities and those currently under development are to a large extent compliant with the requirements of the European services e-card. The adaptation and development costs will therefore be substantially reduced.\n\n\nAny necessary allocations will however be met through redeployment; no budgetary impact is expected on EU budget over and beyond the appropriations already foreseen in the official financial programming of the Commission.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nAn evaluation of this Regulation is foreseen for every five years after implementation of the European services e-card. This evaluation shall also include an assessment of the cooperation between coordinating authorities in Member States, and shall consider the need to adapt the procedures for the European services e-card in light of the latest developments in e-Government. Member States, service providers, social partners and other stakeholders would also be invited to evaluate the functioning of the initiative. Specific indicators allowing assessing the impacts of the Regulation such as the number of service providers using the European services e-card, their experience related to administrative burden, the speed of the procedures used or the number of information exchanges between Member States will be considered.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that a review of certain aspects of Directive 2014/67/EU is foreseen for June 2019, the potential of the facilities to be offered under Article 6 should be reassessed as part of that review. The review shall take account of the experience of those Member States that may have opted for the possibility foreseen in Article 6(3) of this draft Regulation to allow for formalities for the posting of workers to be carried out through the electronic platform connected to IMI.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nArticle 1 specifies the subject matter of the proposed Regulation, which introduces the European services e-card and related administrative facilities which can be used by providers to provide services across the borders. It also clarifies that the coordination of national provisions necessary to make available such an e-card is laid down in Directive (ESC) to be adopted at the same time.\n\n\nArticle 2 defines the scope of the activities for which the European service e-card is available, as well as the specific activities, fields and matters which are not covered by the e-card, following the pattern of Directive 2006/123/EC. \n\n\nIt also states that, similarly to Directive 2006/123/EC, this Regulation does not affect the definition or organisation of services of general economic interest or  the rules governed by competition law. It does also not affect cultural or linguistic diversity or media pluralism. Finally, the Regulation does not affect provisions of general criminal law, labour law, tax law or social security law.\n\n\nAs is the case for Directive 2006/123/EC, it is clarified that this Regulation shall not apply when it conflicts with other Union acts governing specific aspects of access to or exercise of a service activity in specific sectors or for specific sectors or specific professions.\n\n\nArticle 3 contains the relevant definitions for the Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 4 defines the essential elements of applications for the European services e-card, which should be the same throughout the EU, and confers implementing powers to the Commission to specify the standard form and technical details as well as delegated powers to further specify the type of supporting information and, under exceptional circumstances justifying their need, documents to be provided in the application.\n\n\nArticle 5 establishes an obligation imposed on insurance distributors and bodies appointed by a Member State to provide compulsory insurance, to deliver an insurance certificate upon request of their policyholders. It also defines the essential elements of such certificate and envisages the possibility for the Commission to define a standard form through implementing acts.\n\n\nArticles 6 allows holders of a European services e-card to fulfil the formalities for secondment of staff pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC through an electronic platform connected to IMI under the coordination of the coordinating authority in the home Member State. For posting of workers pursuant to Directive 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EC the same possibility applies in relation to those Member States that communicate to the Commission that this possibility should apply for the posting of workers in their territories. In addition, where Member States have set up procedures that allow for the declaration relating to the posting of workers pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2014/67/EU to be completed by electronic means, the electronic platform connected to IMI shall direct the card holder to the relevant national procedures. \n\n\nArticle 7 allows applicants of a European services e-card to fulfil the formalities necessary for the free movement of self-employed pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC, through an electronic platform connected to IMI, under the coordination of the coordinating authority in the home Member State. It also allows for replacing the attestations on professional qualifications required pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC with a completed application form for a European services e-card. \n\n\nArticle 8 establishes that the procedures for applications, issuance, update, suspension, revocation and cancellation of European services e-cards shall be fully electronic and available through an electronic platform connected to IMI, without prejudice to the internal procedural workflow between the coordinating authorities and the competent authorities in the Member States. It also confers implementing powers to the Commission to adopt technical specifications for the abovementioned electronic procedures.\n\n\nArticle 9 provides for common rules concerning the form and language of documents to be submitted in the context of the procedure for the European service e-card. It also confers implementing powers to the Commission to adopt technical rules for translation of information and of documents used in the context of the procedure for the European service e-card. . \n\n\nArticle 10 defines principles clarifying which fees may be charged by home and host Member State, which shall not exceed the costs which Member States directly incur. It also confers on the Commission implementing powers to lay down technical rules on the payment modalities and procedures.\n\n\nArticle 11 establishes an obligation on insurance distributors to issue upon request of a policyholder a statement relating to third party liability claims concerning the activities of the policyholder. It also empowers the Commission to adopt implementing rules on a standard format of the statement. \n\n\nArticle 12 requires insurance distributers and bodies appointed by a Member State to provide compulsory insurance, to take duly into account in a non-discriminatory manner the statement of claims presented by a provider in their acceptance policy and calculation of premiums. \n\n\nArticle 13 requires professional organisations offering group cover related to professional indemnity insurance to their members or other specific service providers to grant access to it on non-discriminatory terms to providers from other Member States who express an interest, including to holders of a European services e-card.\n\n\nArticle 14 provides for a mutual obligation of exchange of information among coordinating authorities involved. Implementing powers are also conferred to the Commission to define technical details for processing such exchange of information.\n\n\nArticle 15 regulates the exercise of delegation by the Commission as provided for in Article 4.\n\n\nArticle 16 defines the Committee assisting the Commission in the adoption of implementing acts and the applicable procedure in accordance with Regulation (EU) 182/2011. \n\n\n\n\nArticle 17 provides for an obligation on Member States to designate the coordinating authority empowered to perform the tasks foreseen in the Regulation and the Directive setting out an operational framework for a European services e-card, communicate it to the Commission and register it in IMI.\n\n\nArticles 18 and 19 impose on the Commission monitoring and review obligations on the impact of this Regulation on the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services across Member States. It also refers to the review of the facilities offered under Article 6 as part of the review under Directive 2014/67/EU. \n\n\nArticle 20 provides for the amendment to Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on IMI in order to include the European services e-card into the scope of that Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 21 deals with entry into force and application. The relevant dates are adapted to the dates proposed for the Directive. \n\n\n2016/0403 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nintroducing a European services e-card and related administrative facilities\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n16\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n17\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guarantees service providers the freedom of establishment in Member States and the freedom to provide services across Member States.\n\n\n(2)Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n establishes general provisions facilitating the exercise of the freedom of establishment of service providers and the free movement of services. It provides inter alia that Member States should provide for administrative simplification, such as making use of Points of Single Contact, as well as accepting equivalent professional indemnity insurance that service providers already hold in their home Member State.\n\n\n(3)Directive 2006/123/EC requires Member States to put in place and keep constantly updated Points of Single Contacts where a service provider wishing to establish or to provide services can find all relevant information about requirements to be complied with and e-procedures in respect of all formalities, authorisations and notifications to go through. However, costly information challenges and difficulties complying with national procedures at a distance remain to date for service providers, namely for sector-related requirements. Cooperation between the administrations of different Member States should in principle take place via the Internal Market Information System (IMI), an IT-platform offered for cross-border exchange of information and mutual assistance between authorities in different Member States under that Directive. Despite the fact that authorities sometimes have doubts with regard to the legal establishment of a provider in another Member State, the possibilities for cooperation currently provided in IMI are not exploited to their full potential. \n\n\n\n\n(4)Requirements remain in place which make expansion of service providers' operations across the internal market burdensome and unappealing, such as multiple and disparate authorisation schemes before different authorities and, which, regarding establishment, fail to achieve mutual recognition of conditions previously  complied with in other Member States or, regarding temporary cross-border provision of services apply disproportionate or unjustified restrictions. As a consequence, service providers face multiple and disproportionate compliance costs when going cross-border.\n\n\n(5)Formalities associated with authorisations and notifications often require paper forms to be filled in and paper documents to be submitted, to be translated at significant cost, which must even comply with particular form requirements such as certification or authentication. Information regarding these obstacles is either not available online or is scarce, incomplete, dispersed and difficult to interpret in relation to the particular circumstances of a provider expanding across borders, as they often target purely domestic situations. Service providers often risk resubmitting information and documents and undergoing duplication of controls with different authorities in the same Member State. Significant translation costs work also as an important disincentive for companies to take the first steps when going cross-border. \n\n\n(6)Cross-border trade and cross-border investment in certain business and construction services are particularly low showing a potential for better integration of services markets with significant negative repercussions for the remaining part of the economy. This underperformance leads to situations where the potential for more growth and jobs in the Single Market has not been fully exploited. \n\n\n(7)Addressing remaining obstacles to more cross-border activities in services will help to strengthen competition, resulting in more choice and better prices for consumers as well as more competitive services sectors creating new jobs, promoting productivity and ensuring a more attractive climate for investment and innovation.\n\n\n(8)This Regulation aims to facilitate the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services within the single market in areas already covered by Directive 2006/123/EC through the adoption of further measures on approximation of provisions which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It should be based on Article 114 of the TFUE.\n\n\n(9)In view of this, the present Regulation introduces a European services e-card which should facilitate certain service providers to expand service provision across internal market borders, either in the form of temporary provision of services or via secondary establishment through branches, agencies or offices. \n\n\n(10)In so doing, this Regulation specifically targets business and construction service sectors included in scope of Directive \u2026[ESC Directive]\u2026 which face some of the most stringent regulatory and administrative barriers to cross-border expansion and consequently have an unexploited potential for internal market integration. \n\n\n(11)All matters, activities and fields excluded from the scope of Directive 2006/123/EC should remain excluded from the scope of this Regulation. In particular, this Regulation does not affect matters, activities and fields such as those deriving from taxation, social security and labour law, including any legal or contractual provision concerning employment conditions, working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. Equally this Regulation does not affect the social security legislation of the Member States. This Regulation is also without prejudice to any provision stemming from competition law as well as any rule on the applicable law or jurisdiction pursuant to private international law.\n\n\n(12)For reasons of coherence, possible conflicts between the present Regulation and other EU acts governing specific aspects of access or exercise of a service activity in a specific sector should be solved as provided for in Article 3 of Directive 2006/123/EC for conflicts between that Directive and such acts, with the application of those other acts. As a result, the provisions in the present Regulation cannot be relied upon in order to justify prior authorisation schemes, prior notification schemes or establishment requirements which are prohibited by other EU acts governing specific aspects of access or exercise of a service activity in a specific sector such as Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000\n19\n. As a further result, this Regulation does in no way affect the obligations service providers should respect in accordance with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n and Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n21\n.\n\n\n(13)A European services e-card should be introduced as a voluntary alternative to service providers. Service providers should continue to enjoy the possibility of demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements when expanding operations across borders in the context of other authorisations and notifications introduced under the national law of the Member States concerned. A service provider should always be able to choose not to apply for a European services e-card.\n\n\n(14)The European services e-card should be fully electronic, rely almost exclusively on data provided by reliable sources, limit the use of documents to the minimum necessary and allow for multilingual processing to avoid translation costs. In order to make the procedure fully electronic and allow for administrative cooperation between home and host Member States. The Internal Market Information system set up by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n should be used under this Regulation. A specific electronic platform should be developed for the purpose of issuing, updating, suspending, revoking or cancelling European services e-cards, as well as to make valid European services e-cards electronically available to their holders and to competent authorities.\n\n\n(15)In order to submit an application for a European services e-card, a harmonised multilingual form should be made available ensuring that the elements necessary for identification of the provider and of the services for which the e-card is requested, as well as for the assessment of specific requirements applicable to the services at stake, such as those regarding proof of its establishment in the home Member State, good repute or insurance coverage, are included and thus made available to coordinating authorities in both home and host Member States.\n\n\n(16)The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to specify the details of the information to be contained in the standard application form and the documents to be included in the application as supporting evidence. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. \n\n\n(17)During the implementation of this Regulation, Member States should inform and update the Commission of procedures imposed under national law on incoming cross-border providers wishing to provide services temporarily or through a branch, agency or office, including the information and documents to which those procedures pertain, to allow for the preparation of application forms. In order to ensure uniform implementation concerning the necessary information to be provided for the application of the European service e-card, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n23\n. \n\n\n(18)Description of the terms of coverage of a mandatory or voluntary insurance included in written contracts might be difficult to find. Insurance distributers, as well as bodies appointed by a Member State to provide compulsory insurance, should therefore provide a description of the core elements of coverage to their client in the format of an insurance certificate. This certificate should be annexed to the application form. In order to ensure uniform implementation of this part of the Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt a harmonised format for the certificates. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n\n(19)Holders of a European services e-card may want to second staff into the territory of the host Member State. When doing so, service providers may be subject to requirements, such as prior declarations addressed to the host Member State, necessary for the protection of posted workers. The European Services e-card will in no way affect the content of such declarations and the responsibilities by the host Member State in that regard.\n\n\n(20)An electronic platform connected to IMI, to be developed by the Commission, should be made available to European services e-card holders to facilitate compliance with those formalities which, as the case may be, need to be completed with the host Member State. These formalities concern in particular the possible obligation of declarations in advance of professional qualifications of workers that should be carried out in accordance with Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \n24\n. \n\n\n(21)As regards the prior declaration that may be required under Article 9 of Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n25\n, the electronic platform connected to IMI should direct holders of a European services e-card to electronic national procedures put in place in the host Member State where the workers will be posted, wherever such national procedures allow for the electronic submission of the above-mentioned prior declaration. \n\n\n(22)The electronic platform connected to IMI should be made available by the Commission to those Member States that have previously communicated to the Commission their intention to make use of this possibility. Where Member States decide to allow for the use of IMI for the sending of the prior declaration in relation to workers posted in their territory, holders of a European services e-card shall be able to submit a declaration as referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2014/67/EU directly to the competent authority in the host Member State as defined in Article 2(a) of Directive 2014/67/EU, through the electronic platform connected to IMI.  To that end, a host Member State should provide all the elements required in accordance with point a) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Article 9 of Directive 2014/67/EU as the basis for a multi-lingual form to be submitted for the declaration of posted workers on its territory. The Commission should publish this form in the Official Journal and make it available in the electronic platform connected to IMI. The relevant information with regard to the elements required should be available for the host Member State concerned in full compliance with the language requirements set out in Article 9(1)(a) of Directive 2014/67/EU. The experience of these Member States with the use of the electronic platform connected to IMI should be part of the assessment foreseen in the second subparagraph of Article 19 of this Regulation. \n\n\n(23)In order to ensure uniform implementation of this Regulation in relation to procedures to issue and update of a European services e-card, as well for formalities regarding secondment of staff and movement of self-employed other than the one referred to in the preceding recital, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt rules on electronic processing of those procedures. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. \n\n\n\n\n(24)Domestic administrative procedures supporting the procedures governed by this Regulation should be electronic if the Member States in question so decide. Member States could however make use of the Internal Market Information system set up by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 for domestic purposes of administrative cooperation.\n\n\n(25)Procedures for issuing, updating, suspending or revoking a European services e-card should make use of documents only in exceptional circumstances, when more detailed information is absolutely essential. In any case, all of such documents should be used and accepted in simple form.\n\n\n(26)EU law may allow, in the context of formalities for secondment of staff as regulated professionals or movement of self-employed in relation to control of professional qualifications, for documents to be submitted in special form, for example as certified or authenticated documents. Such certification and authentication, once performed in the Member State of original issue of the document in question, should be accepted throughout the EU. \n\n\n(27)Certified translation of documents should not be required under this Regulation. The electronic platforms dealing with procedures should provide for a technical solution to translate their content. In order to ensure uniform implementation of this part of the Regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Rules on translation of documents in the context of posting of workers and application for attestations regarding their social security contributions should not be covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n(28)Member States are entitled to charge fees only to the extent of the specific costs borne to carry out the procedure. Costs borne already by the budget of the Union should not give rise to fees charged by Member States. Member States should communicate their fees charged to the Commission through IMI and publish such information. Given that IMI is in essence offering all necessary facilities, Member States should, inter alia, not charge fees to update, suspend, revoke or cancel a European services e-card.  In order to ensure uniform implementation of  the provisions on the payment of fees, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt rules on payment modalities and processing. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n\n(29)This Regulation builds on enhanced administrative cooperation between home and host Member States, which should include exchanges of information and use of interconnected national registers to obtain or verify previously obtained information such as registers required under Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \n26\n or under Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n27\n. In order to ensure uniform implementation of the handling and processing of exchanges of information and mutual assistance implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n\n(30)Service providers obliged to acquire professional liability insurance in Member States where they have not been active often have difficulty demonstrating their claims history regarding cover obtained elsewhere. Claims histories are an essential element to insurance distributers in ascertaining and assessing the risk profile of a potential client. Demonstration is difficult due to poor communication between insurance distributers across internal market borders but also to disparities in describing the track-record of an insured party, even within the same Member State. Insurance distributers and bodies appointed by a Member State to provide compulsory insurance cover should therefore be obliged to issue a statement relating to the third party liability claims which can then be used across borders and even domestically, should a service provider change insurance distributer.\n\n\n(31)In order to ensure uniform implementation of this Regulation in relation to the presentation of the description of liabilities, implementing powers to adopt rules on the standardised presentation format of that statement should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n\n(32)A statement relating to claims history should be instrumental in allowing insurance distributers and bodies appointed by a Member State to provide compulsory indemnity insurance to ban discriminatory practices towards cross-border providers of which information is more scarce and difficult to obtain. The same non-discrimination principle should apply to professional organisations who offer group cover to their members or other service providers.\n\n\n(33)A single coordinating authority should be designated by each Member State to carry out the tasks provided for in this Regulation, without prejudice to the competences set out in applicable national legislation. Such authorities should be registered as a competent authority in the Internal Market Information system for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 1024/2012 and communicated to the Commission.\n\n\n(34)The application of this Regulation should be monitored and assessed in order to determine its impact on the costs of expanding operations cross-border, increased transparency about cross-border providers, competition, prices and quality of the services provided. The effects of this Regulation and the practical functioning of the cooperation between coordinating authorities should be evaluated regularly. This monitoring will happen in cooperation with Member States, social partners and other relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n(35)In order to adapt the functioning of IMI to the tasks conferred by this Regulation, Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 should be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(36)Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in view of the risk of complexity and inconsistency of regulatory approaches of certain services across Member States but can rather, by reason of enhanced administrative coordination and harmonisation across the Union, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n(37)This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Regulation, through the introduction of the European services e-card and related administrative facilities and procedures, seeks to promote the rights of establishment and the right to provide services in any Member State, preventing any discrimination on grounds of nationality and ensuring impartial, fair and reasonably speed procedure, in accordance with Articles 15, 21 and 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, while ensuring full respect of the protection of personal data, including in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n28\n, and giving due consideration to the risk of abuse of rights provided for respectively in Articles 8 and 54 of that Charter.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation introduces a European services e-card and related administrative facilities, which shall be made

apply for a European services e-card.\n\n\nAny applications for a European services e-card shall be submitted in an electronic platform connected to IMI using a multilingual standard form. \n\n\nThe standard form shall consist of the following elements:\n\n\n(a) identification of the provider, including, where applicable, registration numbers in central, commercial or company registers and for tax and social security purposes;\n\n\n(b) identification of the service activity, the host Member State, the type of European services e-card envisaged;\n\n\n(c) indication whether provision of information society services are envisaged;\n\n\n(d) information pertaining to establishment of the provider in the home Member State in relation to the service activity identified in accordance with (b), including the date of initial establishment and identification of other Member States of establishment;\n\n\n(e) requirements to which the applicant is subject for the provision of the service in its home Member State, such as qualifications or certifications;\n\n\n(f) information on the good repute of the provider;\n\n\n(g) information on any existing professional indemnity insurance of the provider in relation to professional liability in the territory of the home Member State, including information on the cover for activities carried out in the territory of other Member States, as appropriate;\n\n\n(h) a reference to previously issued European services e-cards for the same provider and service activity as identified in accordance with (a) and (b).\n\n\n2.The Commission shall specify how the information referred to in points (a) to (h) above is to be presented in the standard form and lay down the technical details of the standard form throughout the European Union, by way of implementing acts.  Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).\n\n\nThe application shall include all the necessary supporting documents, uploaded by the applicant into the electronic platform where the standard form for application is made available.\n\n\n3.The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 15 in order to further specify:\n\n\na) details of the information elements of the standard form listed to in letters paragraph 1, points (a) to (h), which shall be contained in the standard form;\n\n\nb) further documents or categories of documents that are exceptionally required to be included as supporting evidence.;\n\n\n4.Member States shall provide to the Commission with all information on the procedural steps related to requirements imposed on providers for the provision of services through a branch, agency or office and for temporary cross-border provision of service activities falling under Directive \u2026[ESC Directive]\u2026\u2026\u2026.., necessary for the development of the standard application forms, describing the information and documents the presentation of which is required under national law of the provider in relation to all applicable requirements, through IMI by [9 months after entry into force of this Regulation] to the extent that the information was not contained in the notification of the requirement itself already submitted under Articles 15(7) and 39(5) of Directive 2006/123/EC.\n\n\n5.Member States shall communicate via IMI to the Commission

In its Communication on Single Market Strategy \"Upgrading the Single Market: more opportunities for people and business\" (COM(2015) 550 final), the Commission announced legislative initiatives aimed at removing barriers in the services market. \n\n\nIn that context, the Single Market Strategy proposed the launch of a European services e-card (\"services passport\") to increase certainty and reduce barriers for service providers who want to access other EU markets in order to expand their activities. This announcement has been welcomed by the European Council in its June 2016 conclusions. \n\n\nThe general objectives of this initiative are to enhance market integration in business services and construction and improve productivity growth in both sectors. \n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objectives\n\n\nSpecific objectives of this proposal are to: \n\n\n - make it easier and less costly for companies to provide services in other Member States, \n\n\n - enable more confidence in the market towards foreign service providers by increasing transparency and available information; \n\n\n - enable increased market dynamics and competition leading to more choice and value added for consumers.\n\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, we envisage the following activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. reduce the administrative burden through an EU-level procedure with a public interface allowing service providers to complete formalities online;\n\n\n2. connect  the home Member State and the host Member State via an IT-platform at the European level. To this end,  the IMI system will serve as a back-office functionality for national authorities. It should be further developed to support the functioning of the European Services e-card.\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nChapter 02 03: Internal market for goods and services\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe proposal building on the directive having introduced the European Services e-card will provide for:\n\n\n1. A reduction in administrative burden for service providers that want to provide services in other Member States given that they would be able to use a simplified electronic procedure to complete formalities and enjoy transparency with respect to the processing of requests. This will allow them to save time and costs when going providing services cross-border or setting up a secondary establishment;\n\n\n2. Reduction of the administrative burden for national authorities, including facilitating increased cooperation between different Member States;\n\n\n3. Cost savings by building on an existing IT tool (the Internal Market Information system \u2013 called IMI thereafter) in new areas so as to benefit from economies of scale and of scope (instead of developing a new single-purpose tool). Competent authorities are already registered with IMI. \n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe proposal will contribute to a more effective implementation of the Services Directive, notably for business and construction services. \n\n\nIts direct impact could be measured using the following indicators:\n\n\n- The number of service providers that would use the European services e-card (and accompanying formalities for secondment of staff or movement of self-employed); \n\n\n- Experience of service providers on ease of completing the electronic procedures offered;\n\n\n- The average speed of the procedures offered;\n\n\n- Number of information exchanges between Member States; \n\n\n- Experience of those Member States that shall make use of the possibility granted by Article 6(3) of the Regulation with regard to the above criteria\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThe proposal will reduce administrative burden and increase legal certainty for service providers that want to start provision of services in another Member State both on a temporary basis and in the case of secondary establishment. In addition, it will inspire more confidence in the market towards service providers by increasing transparency and available information. \n\n\nThe European services e-card would also present certain benefits to Member States' authorities. Firstly, it would facilitate the workload of the competent authorities in both the host and the home Member State by replacing conventional paperwork with an electronic workflow. This workflow would be highly standardised and automatic translation facilities will be offered. Secondly, formalities will be streamlined under one electronic application instead of several parallel workflows that exist today. \n\n\nThis will be achieved by setting up a single EU-level procedure based on a common pan-European IT platform (the IMI system). This system is developed, managed and funded by the Commission already for years. Member States already have the experience with the system, as more than 5,000 competent authorities are already registered with IMI since 2011. \n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nPotential national or regional solutions for administrative simplification would differ across Member States in terms of costs savings and in terms of effectiveness. EU action would ensure that service providers can benefit from a less divergent approach across Member States when expanding across borders.\n\n\nGiven the nature of IMI as a centralised communication tool developed and hosted by the Commission, it will facilitate the introduction and the smooth running of the issuance of European services e-card as well as an efficient system of cooperation between Member States. The European services e-card (on the basis of the IMI system) would also allow to overcome certain obstacles such as translation costs for companies. The Commission will offer IMI as a free IT platform to Member States that wish to make use of it for the electronic submission of prior declarations of workers that are posted in their territory. It will also make IMI available for domestic exchanges related to the European services e-card where Member States so wish. \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe IMI system itself has proved an effective and reliable tool in other areas. The European Professional Card (EPC) procedure for the recognition of professional qualifications \u2013 introduced in 2013 by amending Directive 2005/36/EC \u2013  is a good example.\n\n\nThe EPC facilitates the recognition of professional qualifications for selected professionals. It is a centrally provided EU-level procedure with a clearly defined procedure run within the IMI system. The obligations of Member States in the procedural workflow are set out in detail, thus overcoming the ambiguity of more general rules. It provides a targeted solution underpinned by specific rules on practical issues such as documents, deadlines for treating applications and tacit approval in case host country authorities do not take a final decision within deadline. In this way, the EPC provides an easier, quicker and more transparent way to have qualifications recognised.\n\n\nSince the EPC was made available in January 2016, more than 560 EPCs have already been issued (as of 20 October 2016). The take-up of the EPC has been significant, reflecting a high demand among professionals who can currently benefit thereof (nurses, physiotherapists, mountain guides, real estate agents and pharmacists). \n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThere are a number of forthcoming initiatives of the Commission which also aim at introducing electronic procedures or facilities, for which synergies are foreseen to the extent possible. These include initiatives on the interconnection of company registers (BRIS), interconnection of insolvency registers, and the extension of the Mini One Stop Shop for VAT. BRIS will be operational as of mid-2017 and offer wider access to company data. It will be complemented by an interconnection of the Insolvency Registers as from 2019. VAT MOSS will reduce costs for foreign service providers in the area of VAT formalities as of 2021 onwards.   \n\n\nThese initiatives are all complementary to the European services e-card. In addition, synergies will be sought. For example, information available via BRIS (and also the interconnection of insolvency registers) should be used if technically feasible by coordinating authorities to complete the application for a ESC or cross-check information.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\nImplementation with a start-up period from 2018 to 2021,\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by full-scale operation. The hosting, operational and maintenance costs are included in the relevant costs for the operation of the IMI system.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Commission is reporting on the development and performance of IMI via the on-line Single Market Scoreboard.  The use of IMI for European services e-card requests will be adequately reported in that context. In addition, a report on IMI data protection issues, including security, will be submitted to the European Data Protection Supervisor periodically.\n\n\nAfter the European services e-card has been introduced, the future legal instruments will also foresee a review after 5 years. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThe general risk that can be identified is the non-adoption by service providers of the European Services e-card facility. I.e. the risk that the European Services e-card is fully developed and operational but meets with little or no demand. Another risk is that competent authorities might find adaptation difficult and might not provide adequate resources to process requests properly and in a timely fashion. \n\n\nOne of the main characteristics of the proposal is that the European Services e-card will be based on IMI functionalities. The general risk framework of IMI, including operational risks, have been identified in the context of the Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (\"IMI Regulation\"). The Commission is the \u2018system owner\u2019 of IMI, and is responsible for its daily operation, maintenance and development. The system is developed and hosted by an internal supplier which ensures a high level of business continuity. In the context of the introduction of the European Services e-card, there are also risks related to data protection issues.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nAddressing the general risks as identified under section 2.2.1 above, the Commission will provide assistance (e.g., workshops, etc.) to all stakeholders (e.g., Member States authorities, professional bodies etc.) and actively promote the introduction and use of the new system. Member States will also be required to promote the benefits of the proposed tool. \n\n\nRegarding the operational aspects of the European services e-card, in particular the public interface, the back office as well as the notification facility, these are linked to the operation of IMI and have to be considered in the context of overall IMI internal control setup, as foreseen under IMI Regulation. The IMI Steering committee is responsible for high-level monitoring and control. Regular meetings and reporting instruments facilitate close monitoring of the IT development and maintenance work.\n\n\nIn addition, pursuant to Article 21 of the IMI Regulation from 2012, the European Data Protection Supervisor ensures that personal data processing by the Commission in IMI is carried out in accordance with the applicable rules. The national data protection authorities will monitor the processing of personal data by the competent authorities at Member State level.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nThe general risks will be addressed by the relevant measures, including providing assistance and information to the stakeholders concerned.\n\n\nThe operation of the European Services e-card will be based on IMI functionalities and will be covered by the existing system of management and control for IMI. It is considered that the proposal will not lead to an increased risk of error.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions normally applicable to the activities of the Commission, including Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), will apply in the context of IMI
