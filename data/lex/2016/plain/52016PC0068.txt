The EU signed the Convention on 15 June 2011. The Republic of Moldova requested to accede to the Convention on 17 July 2013 and with its Decision No 2 of 21 May 2014\n2\n, the Joint Committee of the Convention decided that the Republic of Moldova should be invited to accede to the Convention.\n\n\nThe EU and the Republic of Moldova deposited their instrument of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 31 July 2015 respectively. As a consequence, in application of its Article 10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and the Republic of Moldova on 1\u00a0May\u00a02012 and on 1 September 2015 respectively.\n\n\nArticle 6 of the Convention provides that each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the Convention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Customs Sub-Committee established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part\n3\n, should adopt a Decision replacing Protocol II concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation by a new Protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the Convention.
