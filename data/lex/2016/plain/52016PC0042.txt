"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 2.2.2016\nCOM(2016) 42 final\n2016/0021(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Minamata Convention on Mercury\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n\nThe Minamata Convention on Mercury (hereafter \"the Minamata Convention\" or \"the Convention\") concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to control and limit the use and anthropogenic emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land. \n\n\n\nMercury is recognised as a global threat to human health and the environment. Exposure to high levels of mercury, including through the consumption of contaminated fish and seafood, can cause harm to the brain, lungs, kidneys and to the immune system. Mercury is characterised by its transboundary nature, as emissions can travel for thousands of kilometers through air and water from the place where they occur. In the EU, it is estimated that between 40% and 80% of the total mercury deposition originates from third countries, including for a large part from East and South-East Asia. \n\n\n\nThe Convention was adopted and opened for signature at a Conference of the Plenipotentiaries in Kumamoto, Japan, in October 2013. The European Union and twenty-one Member States signed the Convention on 10 October 2013 while Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia and Poland did so on 24 September 2014 and Malta on 8 October 2014.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Convention addresses the whole life-cycle of mercury with the objective to protect human health and the environment. It sets restrictions on primary mining and international trade of mercury, prohibits the manufacture, import and export of a wide range of mercury-added products, foresees prohibitions or operating conditions for several manufacturing processes using mercury and calls for discouraging new uses of mercury in products and industrial processes. In addition, the Convention provides for measures to be taken to reduce mercury emissions from Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (hereafter, \"ASGM\") and major industrial activities, including through the use of best available techniques. It requires also interim storage of mercury and management of mercury waste to occur in an environmentally sound manner.\n\n\n\nThe EU has made significant progress for the last 10 years in addressing mercury domestically as a follow-up to the adoption in 2005 of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury (hereafter, \"the Strategy\"),\n2\n as supported by the Council of the European Union\n3\n and the European Parliament.\n4\n The Strategy consists of 20 actions aiming at reducing mercury emissions and at cutting mercury supply and demand. It highlights the transboundary character of mercury emissions and the necessity for action at global level with seven of its actions focused on the need to support and promote international activities. The review of the Strategy in 2010\n5\n recalls that the exposure of the environment and individuals in the EU cannot be reduced to an acceptable level via domestic policies alone and that co-ordinated international action is thus necessary to address effectively the mercury problem. Alike the initial 2005 Strategy, this review was also supported by the Council of the European Union\n6\n that reaffirmed the need to minimise and, where feasible, eliminate global anthropogenic mercury emissions to air, water and land and, for that purpose, for the EU to intensify its international efforts to reduce mercury emissions and exposure on a global scale.  \n\n\n\nWhereas the UNEP Governing Council launched in 2009 the international process for the development of a global legally-binding instrument, Council Decision of 6 December 2010 authorised the Union to take part to this process.\n7\n Not only has the EU been instrumental in promoting such negotiations, but also in influencing their outcome throughout the six sessions of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (2010-2014). \n\n\n\nIn parallel to this proposed Decision, the Commission has put forward a proposal for a Regulation by the European Parliament and the Council to transpose the limited number of provisions of the Convention that are not yet implemented into EU legislation, which are identified in the impact assessment report accompanying that proposal.\n8\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with its Article 30, the Minamata Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by States and by regional economic integration organisations.\n\n\n\nThe deposit of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval of the Minamata Convention by the European Union and its Member States should take place collectively and in a co-ordinated fashion so as to make sure, as far as possible, that the Convention enters into force for both the EU and its Members States at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the light of the above, it is appropriate for the European Union to approve the Convention. \n\n\n\nThe text of the Minamata Convention is attached to this Decision.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n2016/0021 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Minamata Convention on Mercury\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Council Decision of 23 September 2013\n9\n, the Minamata Convention on Mercury ('the Convention') was signed on 10 October 2013 by the Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date. \n\n\n(2)The Convention on Mercury was adopted in Geneva on 19 January 2013. The Convention provides a framework for the control and limitation of the use and of anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land with a view to protecting human health and the environment. \n\n\n(3)Mercury is a substance characterised by its transboundary nature. Global action is therefore necessary to ensure the protection of the individuals and of the environment within the Union as a complement to domestic measures.\n\n\n(4)The Seventh Environmental Action programme\n10\n establishes the long-term objective of a non-toxic environment and states, for that purpose, that action is needed to ensure the minimisation of significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020.\n\n\n(5)The 2005 Community Strategy Concerning Mercury\n11\n, as reviewed in 2010\n12\n, seeks to reduce mercury emissions, to cut mercury supply and demand, to protect against mercury exposure and to promote international action on mercury.\n\n\n(6)The Council reaffirms its commitment to the overall objective of protecting human health and the environment from releases of mercury and its compounds by minimising and, where feasible, ultimately eliminating global anthropogenic mercury releases to air, water and land\n13\n. The Convention contributes to the achievement of these objectives. \n\n\n\n\n(7)The Convention should therefore be approved on behalf of the Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\nThe Minamata Convention on Mercury ('the Convention'), is  approved on behalf of the Union.\n\n\n\nThe text of the Convention is attached to this Decision.\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the Union, to the deposit of the instrument of approval provided for in Article 30(1) of the Convention, in order to express the consent of the  Union to be bound by the Convention.\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption. \n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nWhile Estonia and Portugal have not signed the Convention, they have expressed their commitment to ratify it. \n\n\n\n(2)\nCommunication of 28 January 2005 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament \"Community Strategy Concerning Mercury\", COM(2005) 20 final.

\n\n\nMinamata Convention on Mercury\n\n\nThe Parties to this Convention, \n\n\nRecognizing that mercury is a chemical of global concern owing to its long-range atmospheric transport, its persistence in the environment once anthropogenically introduced, its ability to bioaccumulate in ecosystems and its significant negative effects on human health and the environment, \n\n\nRecalling decision 25/5 of 20 February 2009 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme to initiate international action to manage mercury in an efficient, effective and coherent manner, \n\n\nRecalling paragraph 221 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \u201cThe future we want\u201d, which called for a successful outcome of the negotiations on a global legally binding instrument on mercury to address the risks to human health and the environment,\n\n\nRecalling the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development\u2019s reaffirmation of the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, including, inter alia, common but differentiated responsibilities, and acknowledging States\u2019 respective circumstances and capabilities and the need for global action,\n\n\nAware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from exposure to mercury of vulnerable populations, especially women, children, and, through them, future generations,\n\n\nNoting the particular vulnerabilities of Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities because of the biomagnification of mercury and contamination of traditional foods, and concerned about indigenous communities more generally with respect to the effects of mercury, \n\n\nRecognizing the substantial lessons of Minamata Disease, in particular the serious health and environmental effects resulting from the mercury pollution, and the need to ensure proper management of mercury and the prevention of such events in the future, \n\n\nStressing the importance of financial, technical, technological, and capacity-building support, particularly for developing countries, and countries with economies in transition, in order to strengthen national capabilities for the management of mercury and to promote the effective implementation of the Convention,\n\n\nRecognizing also the activities of the World Health Organization in the protection of human health related to mercury and the roles of relevant multilateral environmental agreements, especially the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, \n\n\nRecognizing that this Convention and other international agreements in the field of the environment and trade are mutually supportive,\n\n\nEmphasizing that nothing in this Convention is intended to affect the rights and obligations of any Party deriving from any existing international agreement,\n\n\nUnderstanding that the above recital is not intended to create a hierarchy between this Convention and other international instruments,\n\n\nNoting that nothing in this Convention prevents a Party from taking additional domestic measures consistent with the provisions of this Convention in an effort to protect human health and the environment from exposure to mercury in accordance with that Party\u2019s other obligations under applicable international law,\n\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\n\n\nArticle

Each Party shall take measures to restrict the use of mercury or mercury compounds in the processes listed in Part II of Annex \u0412 in accordance with the provisions set out therein.\n\n\n\n4. The Secretariat shall, on the basis of information provided by Parties, collect and maintain information on processes that use mercury or mercury compounds and their alternatives, and shall make such information publicly available. Other relevant information may also be submitted by Parties and shall be made publicly available by the Secretariat.\n\n\n\n5. Each Party with one or more facilities that use mercury or mercury compounds in the manufacturing processes listed in Annex \u0412 shall:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take measures to address emissions and releases of mercury or mercury compounds from those facilities;\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Include in its reports submitted pursuant to Article 21 information on the measures taken pursuant to this paragraph; and\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Endeavour to identify facilities within its territory that use mercury or mercury compounds for processes listed in Annex \u0412 and submit to the Secretariat, no later than three years after the date of entry into force of the Convention for it, information on the number and types of such facilities and the estimated annual amount of mercury or mercury compounds used in those facilities. The Secretariat shall make such information publicly available.\n\n\n\n6. Each Party shall not allow the use of mercury or mercury compounds in a facility that did not exist prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for it using the manufacturing processes listed in Annex B. No exemptions shall apply to such facilities.\n\n\n\n7. Each Party shall discourage the development of any facility using any other manufacturing process in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used that did not exist prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention, except where the Party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Conference of the Parties that the manufacturing process provides significant\n\n\nenvironmental and health benefits and that there are no technically and economically feasible mercury-free alternatives available providing such benefits.\n\n\n\n8. Parties are encouraged to exchange information on relevant new technological developments, economically and technically feasible mercuryfree alternatives, and possible measures and techniques to reduce and where feasible to eliminate the use of mercury and mercury compounds in, and emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds from, the manufacturing processes listed in Annex B.\n\n\n\n9. Any Party may submit a proposal to amend Annex \u0412 in order to list a manufacturing process in which mercury or mercury compounds are used.
