"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 1.12.2016\nCOM(2016) 750 final\n2016/0392(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, the use of the names of spirit drinks in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs and the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe aim of this Commission proposal is to align Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It mainly divides the provisions adopted by the Commission under that Regulation into delegated acts and implementing acts.\n\n\nThe existing EU legal framework for spirit drinks enables the free circulation of goods in the single market by setting up product definitions, labelling rules and provisions related to the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. Therefore, it should not be changed.\n\n\nFor this reason, besides alignment with the TFEU, the proposal introduces only a few minor technical amendments, in order to address shortcomings in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 and to make the legislation consistent with new EU legal instruments. Structure and wording changes have been made with the exclusive aim of simplifying the regulations and improving readability, in line with the Commission\u2019s \u2018better regulation\u2019 agenda.\n\n\nThese wording and structure changes, and the few technical adaptations, do not affect the substance of the law, which remains the same as in Regulation (EC) No \u00a0110/2008. For this reason, no impact assessment was considered necessary.\n\n\nThe associations of spirit drinks producers have been consulted. Their main concerns have been taken into account.\n\n\nThis initiative is not included in the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT) agenda. However, the proposal has been drafted taking into account the Member States\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 expectations of regulatory simplification and keeping in mind the guiding principles of better regulation.\n\n\nGiven the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to keep the spirit drinks Regulation for specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks which go beyond the general rules provided in Regulation (EU) No\u00a01169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0October 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers,\n1\n while remaining consistent with those general rules. The spirit drinks Regulation should continue to focus on definitions of spirit drinks, classified into categories and to contribute to the highest level of consumer protection and the prevention of deceptive practices.\n\n\nIt should also be noted that Regulation (EU) No\u00a01151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs\n2\n has updated and harmonised the rules on the protection of protected designations of origin (PDOs), protected geographical indications (PGIs) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs). Procedures for the management of PDOs, PGIs, and TSGs (application, amendment, registration, opposition, cancellation) have been completely revised and streamlined. In order to make the procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector more homogenous with those in place for foodstuffs, the draft proposal replacing Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 includes the modification of Chapter III on geographical indications.\u00a0\n\n\nThe proposal keeps unchanged the specificity of the geographical indications scheme for spirit drinks.\n\n\nAs regards procedures, the proposal also includes provisions concerning joint applications and oppositions mirroring those set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 664/2014\n3\n and in Commission Regulation (EU) No 668/2014\n4\n. The inclusion of these provisions makes the proposal consistent and complete. Should Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 be revised, the same approach would be followed.  \n\n\nFinally, some of the elements currently included in the Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0716/2013\n5\n that concern definitions and rules related to compound terms and allusions, are considered essential and have therefore been introduced in the proposal as part of the basic act.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Articles 43(2) and Article 114(1) of the TFEU, unlike Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 that is only based on Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) (currently Article 114 of the TFEU). The addition of Article 43(2) of the TFEU reflects the fact that the ethyl alcohol used for the production of spirits drinks and other alcoholic beverages must be of agricultural origin, which ensures an outlet for basic agricultural products. This strong link to the agricultural sector is emphasised in the new regulatory framework.\n\n\nThis proposal aligns EU legislation on spirit drinks with the TFEU. In addition, it contains minor technical adjustments of such legislation and it replaces the existing procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector, with new procedures modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs.\n\n\nThe objectives of such a proposal cannot be achieved by actions carried out by Member States on their own.\n\n\nHowever, Member States, in accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU, are responsible for implementing the scheme defined by the legislator. It is necessary to ensure that the rules on spirit drinks are applied uniformly in all Member States in order to: \n\n\n\uf0b7prevent deceptive practices; \n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7ensure protection of consumers; and \n\n\n\uf0b7avoid unfair competition. \n\n\nThe legislator therefore grants the Commission the power to implement measures, in accordance with Article 291(2) of the TFEU, specifically on: \n\n\n\uf0b7the uniform application of the rules on spirit drinks; \n\n\n\uf0b7procedural rules concerning protection of geographical indications; \n\n\n\uf0b7checks and verifications to be carried out by Member States; and \n\n\n\uf0b7the necessary exchange of information between the Commission and the Member States for the implementation of this Regulation.\n\n\n\nThis proposal targets the objectives set in the most efficient and satisfactory way while leaving as much scope for national decision as possible.\n\n\n\n3.EVALUATION, CONSULTATION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n\nA consensus exists among the producers of spirit drinks to keep the existing legal framework on spirits.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, the proposal only lays down the Commission empowerments to adopt delegated and implementing acts, besides introducing few technical adjustments and some structure and wording changes that simplify and clarify the drafting of those provisions without changing its substance. The representatives of the spirits sector have been consulted in the context of the Civil Dialogue Group meetings, during which the Commission has gathered information, opinions and recommendations from the spirit drinks experts.\n\n\n\nAs regards the section on geographical indications, it only brings the registration procedures more in line with the ones applicable to other foodstuffs but does not affect the specificity of the geographical indications regime for spirit drinks.\n\n\nTherefore, the purpose and scope of the existing regulation will remain unchanged.\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, an impact assessment to accompany this proposal has not been considered necessary.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis proposal has no financial implications for the EU budget.\n\n\n2016/0392 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, the use of the names of spirit drinks in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs and the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks\n\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43(2) and 114(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n6\n\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\n7\n\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n8\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n9\n has proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience and technological innovation it is necessary to update the rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks and to review the ways geographical indications for spirit drinks are registered.\n\n\n(2)In order to align the powers conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018the Treaty\u2019), further amendments to that Regulation are needed.\n\n\n(3)The measures applicable to spirit drinks should contribute to attaining a high level of consumer protection, preventing deceptive practices and attaining market transparency and fair competition. They should safeguard the reputation which the Union\u2019s spirit drinks have achieved in the Union and on the world market by continuing to take into account the traditional practices used in the production of spirit drinks as well as increased demand for consumer protection and information. Technological innovation should also be taken into account in respect of spirit drinks, where such innovation serves to improve quality, without affecting the traditional character of the spirit drinks concerned. The production of spirit drinks is strongly linked to the agricultural sector. Besides representing a major outlet for the agriculture of the Union, this link is determinant for the quality and reputation of the spirit drinks produced in the Union. This strong link to the agricultural sector should therefore be emphasised by the regulatory framework.\n\n\n(4)To ensure a more uniform approach in the legislation on spirit drinks, this Regulation should set out clear criteria for the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks as well as for the protection of geographical indications. It should also set out rules on the use of ethyl alcohol or distillates of agricultural origin in the production of alcoholic beverages\u00a0and on the use of the sales denominations of spirit drinks in the presentation and labelling of foodstuffs.\n\n\n(5)In the interests of consumers, this Regulation should apply to all spirit drinks placed on the Union market, whether produced in the Member States or in third countries. In order to maintain and improve the reputation of the spirit drinks produced in the Union on the world market, this Regulation should also apply to spirit drinks produced in the Union for export.\u00a0\n\n\n(6)In order\u00a0to meet consumer expectations and to conform to traditional practices, ethyl alcohol used for the production of spirit drinks and other alcoholic beverages should be exclusively of agricultural origin. This should also ensure an outlet for basic agricultural products.\n\n\n(7)This Regulation should continue to focus on definitions of spirit drinks classified into categories by taking into account the traditional quality practices. This Regulation should also lay down specific rules for certain spirit drinks that are not included in the list of categories. \n\n\n(8)It should be clarified that a new category may only be added if a spirit drink has a significant market share in at least one Member State. Moreover, the name chosen for the new category shall either be a widely used name or, where this is not possible, be of a descriptive nature, in particular, by referring to the raw material used for the production of the spirit drink. \n\n\n(9)Regulation (EC) No\u00a01334/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council\n10\n also applies to spirit drinks. However, it is necessary to lay down additional rules concerning flavourings which will only apply to spirit drinks.\n\n\n(10)Given the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to lay down specific rules on the presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, in particular for the use of sales denominations, geographical indications, compound terms and allusions.\n\n\n(11)Regulation (EU) No\u00a01169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n11\n should apply to the presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n\n\n(12)In order to ensure the uniform use of compound terms and allusions in Member States, it is necessary to lay down provisions concerning their use for the purpose of presentation of spirit drinks and other foodstuffs.\n\n\n(13)In order to provide consumers with the adequate information, provisions on the presentation and labelling of spirit drinks which qualify for mixtures of spirit drinks should be laid down.\n\n\n\n\n(14)While it is important to ensure that in general the maturation period or age specifies only the youngest alcoholic component, it should be possible to provide, by means of delegated acts, for a derogation, to take account of traditional ageing processes in the Member States.\n\n\n(15)In some cases, food business operators may be required or may want to indicate the origin of spirit drinks to draw consumers\u2019 attention to the qualities of their product. Such origin indications should comply with harmonised criteria. Therefore, specific provisions on the indication of the country of origin or place of provenance in the presentation and labelling of spirit drinks should be laid down.\n\n\n(16)The use of lead-based capsules to cover the closing devices of containers holding spirit drinks should be banned, in order to avoid any risk of contamination, in particular by accidental contact with such capsules, and of environmental pollution from waste containing lead from such capsules.\n\n\n(17)Concerning the protection of geographical indications, it is important to have due regard to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\u2018TRIPS Agreement\u2019), and in particular Articles 22 and 23 thereof, and to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\u2018GATT Agreement\u2019) which were approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n(18)Regulation (EU) No\u00a01151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n does not apply to spirit drinks. Rules on protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks should therefore be laid down. Geographical indications identifying spirit drinks as originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the spirit drink are essentially attributable to its geographical origin should be registered by the Commission.\n\n\n(19)Procedures for the registration, modification and possible cancellation of Union or third country geographical indications in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement should be laid down whilst automatically recognising the status of existing protected geographical indications of the Union. In view of making procedural rules on geographical indications consistent through all the sectors concerned, such procedures for spirit drinks should be modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EU) No\u00a01151/2012 while taking into account specificities of spirit drinks. In order to simplify the registration procedures and to ensure that information for food business operators and consumers is electronically available an electronic register of geographical indications should be established.\n\n\n(20)Member State authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with this Regulation, and the Commission should be able to monitor and verify such compliance. Therefore the Commission and the Member States should be required to share relevant information with each other.\n\n\n(21)In applying a quality policy and in order to allow for a high level of quality of spirit drinks and diversity in the spirit drinks sector, Member States should be allowed to adopt rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks produced in their territory that are stricter than those laid down in this Regulation.\n\n\n(22)In order to take into account evolving consumer demands, technological progress, developments in the relevant international standards and the need to improve the economic conditions of production and marketing, the traditional ageing processes and, in exceptional cases, the law of the importing third countries, and in order to ensure the protection of geographical indications, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of or derogations from the technical definitions and requirements of the categories of spirit drinks and the specific rules concerning some of them referred to under Chapter I of this Regulation, the labelling and presentation referred to under Chapter II of this Regulation, the geographical indications referred to under Chapter III of this Regulation and the checks and exchange of information referred under Chapter IV of this Regulation.\n\n\n(23)In order to react rapidly to economic and technological developments regarding spirit drinks covered by this Regulation for which no category and technical specifications exist so as to protect consumers and the economic interests of producers and unify the given production and quality requirements for those spirit drinks, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission as regard the addition, subject to certain conditions, of new categories of spirit drinks to those listed respectively in Part I and II of Annex II to this Regulation and the technical specifications thereof.\n\n\n(24)It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13\u00a0April\u00a02016.\n14\n In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(25)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\n\n\n(26)The implementing powers relating to the labelling and presentation referred to under Chapter II of this Regulation, the geographical indications referred to under Chapter III of this Regulation and the checks and exchange of information referred to under Chapter IV of this Regulation should be exercised in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council.\n15\n\n\n\n(27)The transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 to those laid down in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. To take the necessary measures in that respect, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission.\n\n\n(28)In order to protect the legitimate interests of producers or stakeholders concerned to benefit from the publicity given to single documents under the new legal framework, it should be made possible that single documents concerning geographical indications registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 are published upon request of the Member States concerned.\u00a0\n\n\n(29)To facilitate a smooth transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0110/2008 to the rules laid down in this Regulation, this Regulation should start to apply two years after its entry into force. The marketing of existing stocks should be allowed after the date of application of this Regulation, until those stocks are exhausted,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nSCOPE, DEFINITIONS, AGRICULTURAL ORIGIN OF ETHYL ALCOHOL AND DISTILLATES AND CLASSIFICATION OF SPIRIT DRINKS \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nSubject matter and scope\n\n\n1.This Regulation lays down rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, as well as on the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks.

It shall not be interrupted by any textual or pictorial element which does not form part of it and shall not appear in a larger font size than that of the sales denomination.\n\n\n5.The allusion to any spirit drink category or geographical indication, for the presentation of a foodstuff, shall not be in the same line as the sales denomination. Without prejudice to the second subparagraph of Article 10(3), for the presentation of alcoholic beverages, the allusion shall appear in a font size smaller than those used for the sales denomination and compound term.\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\nPresentation and labelling of mixtures\n\n\n1.A mixture shall bear the sales denomination \u2018spirit drink\u2019.\n\n\nA mixture may show, in its presentation or labelling, the names listed in Part I of Annex II or geographical indications corresponding to the spirit drinks that were used in the mixture under the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)those names or geographical indications appear exclusively in a list of all the alcoholic ingredients contained in the mixture, preceded by the term \u2018mixed spirit drink\u2019; and\n\n\n(b)the term \u2018mixed spirit drink\u2019 appears in the same visual field as the sales denomination, in uniform characters of the same font and colour as those used for the sales denomination and in characters which are no larger than half the size of those used for the sales denomination.\n\n\n2.By way of derogation from paragraph 1, if a mixture meets the requirements of one of the categories of Annex II, the mixture shall bear the sales denomination provided for under the relevant category.\n\n\nIn the case referred to in the first subparagraph, the presentation or labelling of the mixture may show the names listed in Part I of Annex II or geographical indications corresponding to the spirits drinks that were mixed, provided that these names appear:\n\n\n(a)exclusively in a list of all the alcoholic ingredients contained in the mixture; and\n\n\n(b)in the same visual field as the sales denomination at least once.\n\n\n3.The list of alcoholic ingredients referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall indicate, at least once, the percentage by volume of pure alcohol that each alcoholic ingredient represents in the total pure alcohol content by volume of the mixture. The alcoholic ingredients shall be listed in descending order of that percentage.\n\n\n\n\nThe list of alcoholic ingredients shall appear in uniform characters of the same font and colour as those used for the sales denomination and in characters which are no larger than half the size of the characters used for the sales denomination.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nAdditional rules on labelling and presentation\n\n\n1.Where the presentation or labelling of a spirit drink indicates the raw material used to produce the ethyl alcohol, each type of ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin shall be mentioned in descending order of quantity used.\n\n\n2.The presentation or labelling of a spirit drink may be supplemented by the term \u2018blend\u2019, \u2018blending\u2019 or \u2018blended\u2019 only where the spirit drink has undergone blending, as defined in point (6) of Annex I.\n\n\n3.A maturation period or age may only be specified in the presentation or labelling of a spirit drink where it refers to the youngest alcoholic component and provided that the spirit drink was aged under supervision of the tax authorities of a Member State or a supervision affording equivalent guarantees.\n\n\nArticle 12\n\n\nIndication of origin\n\n\n1.Where the origin of a spirit drink is indicated, it shall correspond to the country or territory of origin in accordance with Article 60 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n.\n\n\n2.The indication of the country or territory of origin of the ingredients shall not be required for spirit drinks.\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nLanguage used for the names of spirit drinks\n\n\nThe terms in italics in Annex II and the geographical indications shall neither be translated on the label nor in the presentation of the spirit drink.\n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nUse of a Union symbol for protected geographical indications\n\n\nThe Union symbol for the protected geographical indication may be used for the labelling and presentation of spirit drinks.\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nProhibition of lead-based capsules or foil\n\n\nSpirit drinks shall not be held with a view to sale or be placed on the market in containers fitted with closing devices covered by lead-based capsules or foil.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\n\n\nDelegated powers\n\n\n1.In order to take into account evolving consumer demands, technological progress, developments in the relevant international standards and the need to improve the economic conditions of production and marketing, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 43 concerning:\n\n\n(a)amendments to the rules on indications on the label of spirits drinks concerning compound terms or allusions;\n\n\n(b)amendments to the rules on the presentation and labelling of mixtures; and\n\n\n(c)updating and completing Union reference methods for the analysis of spirit drinks.\n\n\n2.In order to take into account traditional ageing processes in the Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 43 concerning derogations from Article 11(3) concerning the specification of a maturation period or age in the presentation or labelling of a spirit drink.\n\n\n3. In exceptional cases where the law of the importing third country so requires, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 43 concerning derogations from the provisions on presentation and labelling contained in this Chapter. \n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nImplementing powers\n\n\nThe Commission may, by means of implementing acts, adopt:\n\n\n(a)rules on the modalities for the use of the Union symbol referred to in Article 14 in the presentation and labelling of spirit drinks;\n\n\n(b)rules on the modalities for indicating, when used, the country or territory of origin on the label of spirit drinks.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2).\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nProtection of geographical indications\n\n\n1.

Applications for registration of names as geographical indications under the scheme provided for by this Regulation may only be submitted by groups who work with the spirit drink name to be registered.\n\n\nIn the case of a geographical indication name that designates a cross-border geographical area, several groups from different Member States or third countries may lodge a joint application for registration. \n\n\nA joint application shall be submitted to the Commission by a Member State concerned, or by an applicant group in a third country concerned, directly or through the authorities of that third country. It shall include the declaration referred to in point (c) of Article 20(2) from all the Member States concerned. The requirements laid down in Article 20 shall be fulfilled in all Member States and third countries concerned. \n\n\nIn case of joint applications, the related national opposition procedures shall be carried out in all the Member States concerned.\n\n\n2. Where the application relates to a geographical area in a Member State the application shall be addressed to the authorities of that Member State.\n\n\n\n\nThe Member State shall scrutinise the application by appropriate means in order to check that it is justified and meets the conditions of this Chapter.\n\n\n3. As part of the scrutiny referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2, the Member State shall initiate a national opposition procedure that ensures adequate publication of the application and that provides for a reasonable period within which any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest and established or resident on its territory may lodge an opposition to the application.\n\n\nThe Member State shall examine the admissibility of oppositions received in the light of the criteria referred to in Article 25.\n\n\n4. If, after assessment of any opposition received, the Member State considers that the requirements of this Chapter are met, it may take a favourable decision and lodge an application dossier with the Commission. It shall in such case inform the Commission of admissible oppositions received from a natural or legal person that have legally marketed the products in question, using the names concerned continuously for at least five years preceding the date of the publication referred to in paragraph 3.\u00a0Member States shall also keep the Commission informed of the national judicial proceedings possibly affecting the registration procedure.\n\n\nThe Member State shall ensure that its favourable decision is made public and that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest has an opportunity to appeal.\n\n\nThe Member State shall ensure that the version of the product specification on which its favourable decision is based, is published, and shall provide electronic access to the product specification.\n\n\nThe Member State shall also ensure adequate publication of the version of the product specification on which the Commission takes its decision pursuant to Article 23(2).\n\n\n5. Where the application relates to a geographical area in a third country the application shall be lodged with the Commission, either directly or via the authorities of the third country concerned.\n\n\n6. The documents referred to in this Article which are sent to the Commission shall be in one of the official languages of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nTransitional national protection\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Member State may, on a transitional basis only, grant protection to a name under this Regulation at national level, with effect from the date on which an application is lodged with the Commission.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such national protection shall cease on the date on which either a decision on registration under this Regulation is taken or the application is withdrawn.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a name is not registered under this Chapter, the consequences of such national protection shall be the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures taken by Member States under paragraph 1 shall produce effects at national level only, and they shall have no effect on intra-Union or international trade.\n\n\nArticle 23\n\n\nScrutiny by the Commission and publication for opposition\n\n\n1. The Commission shall scrutinise by appropriate means any application that it receives pursuant to Article 21, in order to check that it is justified and that it meets the conditions of this Chapter. This scrutiny should not exceed a period of 12 months. Where this period is exceeded, the Commission shall indicate in writing to the applicant the reasons for the delay.\n\n\nThe Commission shall, at least each month, make public the list of names for which registration applications have been submitted to it, as well as their date of submission.\n\n\n2. Where, based on the scrutiny carried out pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in this Chapter are fulfilled, it shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union the single document referred to in point (c) of Article 20(1) and the reference to the publication of the product specification. \n\n\n\n\nArticle 24\n\n\nOpposition procedure\n\n\n1.Within three months from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, the authorities of a Member State or of a third country, or a natural or legal person having a legitimate interest and established in a third country may lodge a notice of opposition with the Commission.\n\n\nAny natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, established or resident in a Member State other than that from which the application was submitted, may lodge a notice of opposition with the Member State in which it is established within a time limit permitting an opposition to be lodged pursuant to the first subparagraph.\n\n\nA notice of opposition shall contain a declaration that the application might infringe the conditions laid down in this Chapter. \n\n\nA notice of opposition that does not contain this declaration is void. \n\n\nThe Commission shall forward the notice of opposition to the authority or body that lodged the application without delay.\n\n\n2. If a notice of opposition is lodged with the Commission and is followed within two months by a reasoned statement of opposition, the Commission shall check the admissibility of this reasoned statement of opposition.\n\n\n3. Within two months after the receipt of an admissible reasoned statement of opposition, the Commission shall invite the authority or person that lodged the opposition and the authority or body that lodged the application to engage in appropriate consultations for a period that shall not exceed three months. This deadline shall start on the date when the invitation to the interested parties is delivered by electronic means. \n\n\nThe authority or person that lodged the opposition and the authority or body that lodged the application shall start such appropriate consultations without undue delay. They shall provide each other with the relevant information to assess whether the application for registration complies with the conditions of this Chapter. If no agreement is reached, this information shall also be provided to the Commission. \n\n\nWhen the interested parties reach an agreement, the authorities of the Member State or of the third country from which the application was lodged shall notify the Commission of all the factors which enabled that agreement to be reached, including the opinions of the applicant and of the authorities of a Member State or of a third country or other natural and legal persons having lodged an opposition. \n\n\nWhether an agreement has been reached or not, the notification to the Commission shall be made within one month from the end of the consultations.\n\n\nAt any time during these three months, the Commission may, at the request of the applicant extend the deadline for the consultations by a maximum of three months.\n\n\n4. Where, following the appropriate consultations referred to in paragraph 3, the details published in accordance with Article 23(2) have been substantially amended, the Commission shall repeat the scrutiny referred to in Article 23.\n\n\n5.The notice of opposition, the reasoned statement of opposition and the related documents which are sent to the Commission in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be in one of the official languages of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 25\n\n\nGrounds for opposition\n\n\n1. A reasoned statement of opposition as referred to in Article 24(2) shall be admissible only if it is received by the Commission within the time limit set out in that provision and if it shows that:\n\n\n(a) the conditions referred to in point (6) of Article 2(1) and Article 19 are not complied with;\n\n\n(b) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the registration of the name proposed would be contrary to Article 31 or 32; or\n\n\n\n\n(c) the registration of the name proposed would jeopardise the existence of an entirely or partly identical name or of a trade mark or the existence of products which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 23(2).\n\n\n2. The grounds for opposition shall be assessed in relation to the territory of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 26\n\n\nTransitional periods for use of geographical indications\n\n\n1. Without prejudice to Article 18, the Commission may adopt implementing acts granting a transitional period of up to five years to enable spirit drinks originating in a Member State or a third country the name of which contravenes Article 18(2) to continue to use the designation under which it was marketed on condition that an admissible statement of opposition under Article 21(3) or Article 24 shows that the registration of the name would jeopardise the existence of:\n\n\n(a) an entirely identical name or of a compound name, one term of which is identical to the name to be registered; or\n\n\n(b) other names similar to the name to be registered which refer to spirit drinks which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 23(2).\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2). \n\n\n2. Without prejudice to Article 33, the Commission may adopt implementing acts extending the transitional period mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article or allowing continued use in duly justified cases where it is shown that:\n\n\n(a) the designation referred to in paragraph 1 has been in legal use consistently and fairly for at least 25 years before the application for protection was submitted to the Commission;\n\n\n(b) the purpose of using the designation referred to in paragraph 1 has not, at any time, been to profit from the reputation of the registered name and it is shown that the consumer has not been nor could have been misled as to the true origin of the product.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2).\n\n\n3. When using a designation referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the indication of country of origin shall clearly and visibly appear on the labelling.\n\n\nArticle 27\n\n\nDecision on registration\n\n\n1. Where, on the basis of the information available to the Commission from the scrutiny carried out pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 23(1), the Commission considers that the conditions for registration are not fulfilled, it shall adopt implementing acts rejecting the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2).\n\n\n2. If the Commission receives no notice of opposition or no admissible reasoned statement of opposition under Article 24, it shall adopt implementing acts, without applying the procedure referred to in Article 44(2), registering the name.\n\n\n3. If the Commission receives an admissible reasoned statement of opposition, it shall, following the appropriate consultations referred to in Article 24(3), and taking into account the results thereof, either:\n\n\n(a) if an agreement has been reached, register the name by means of implementing acts adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 44(2), and, if necessary, amend the information published pursuant to Article 23(2) provided such amendments are not substantial; or\n\n\n(b) if an agreement has not been reached, adopt implementing acts deciding on the registration. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2).\n\n\n\n\n4. Acts of registration and decisions on rejection shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n\n\nThe act of registration shall grant the protection referred to in Article 18 to the geographical indication.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\n\nAmendment to a product specification\n\n\n1. A group having a legitimate interest may apply for approval of an amendment to a product specification.\n\n\nApplications shall describe and give reasons for the amendments requested.\n\n\n2. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amendments shall be approved by the Member State in whose territory the geographical area of the product concerned is located.\n\n\nHowever, where the amendment applications involve one or more amendments to the product  specification that relate to the essential characteristics of the product, alter the link referred to in point (f) of Article 19, include a change to the name, or to any part of the name of the spirit drink, affect the defined geographical area or represent an increase in restrictions on trade in the product or its raw materials, the Member State shall submit the amendment application to the Commission for approval and the application shall follow the procedure laid down in Articles 21 to 27. \n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scrutiny of the application shall focus on the proposed amendment.\n\n\nArticle 29\n\n\nCancellation\n\n\nThe Commission may, on its own initiative or at the request of any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, adopt implementing acts to cancel the registration of a geographical indication in the following cases:\n\n\n(a) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where compliance with the conditions of the product specification is not ensured;\n\n\n(b) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where no product is placed on the market under the geographical indication for at least seven years.\n\n\nThe Commission may, at the request of the producers of the product marketed under the registered name, cancel the corresponding registration. Articles 21, 23, 24 and 27 shall apply to the cancellation procedure.\n\n\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(2).\n\n\n\nArticle 30\n\n\nRegister of geographical indications of spirit drinks\n\n\nThe Commission shall adopt implementing acts, without applying the procedure referred to in Article 44(2), establishing and maintaining a publicly accessible updated electronic register of geographical indications of spirit drinks recognised under this scheme (\u2018the Register\u2019).\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules on the form and content of the Register.
