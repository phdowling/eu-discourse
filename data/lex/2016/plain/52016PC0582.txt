"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 14.9.2016\nCOM(2016) 582 final \n2016/0274(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe present proposal forms part of the ambitious External Investment Plan (\"EIP\") announced in the Commission communication of 7 June 2016 on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration\n1\n. The EIP initiative was subsequently endorsed by the European Council on 28 June 2016 and aims to address root causes of migration, while contributing to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The present proposal introduces two amendments to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 of 25 May 2009. Together with a separate legislative proposal to amend Decision No 466/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (\"EIB\") against losses under financing operations supporting investment projects outside the Union, the proposal will enable the EIB to contribute to the EIP by expanding both quantitatively and qualitatively the EIB External Lending Mandate (\"ELM\"). This will enable the EIB to rapidly contribute to the EIP's objectives, in particular by providing additional financing to private-sector beneficiaries. \n\n\nAs part of the Commission's efforts to address root causes of migration, it is proposed to give a new private sector lending mandate to the EIB. Under that private sector lending mandate, the Union will be entitled to the risk premium revenues generated under EIB financing operations. Those revenues should be transferred to the Guarantee Fund for external actions regulated by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 of 25 May 2009.\n\n\nThe amount of the Guarantee Fund in surplus exceeding 10% of the total outstanding of loans will be paid back to the budget. This adjustment aims at better protecting the budget against potential additional risk of default of the EIB operations related to migration crisis.\n\n\nUntil now, the assets of the Guarantee Fund have been managed by the EIB. The Commission has a strong experience managing similar financial operations. It is well prepared to manage the Guarantee Fund independently which would represent an effort to streamline and consolidate the asset management activities of the Commission, building on existing structures and a good track record. The Commission is already entrusted to manage the Guarantee Fund for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (\"EFSI\"). Thus, the management of the assets of the Guarantee Fund should be transferred to the European Commission.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThis proposal forms an integral part of the EIP, a key policy in initiative of the Union. It contains ancillary provisions necessary for the functioning of the EIP, in particular the new private sector lending mandate to the EIB.\n\n\nThe Commission is proposing in parallel a revision of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council (the 'Financial Regulation'), where it proposes a new section on budgetary guarantees that will provide a common regulatory framework for Union's guarantees bearing a contingent liability, as well as a common provisioning fund managed by the Commission. The provisions foreseen in this proposal are consistent with those included in the proposal for the revision of the Financial Regulation.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal contains ancillary provisions and is thus necessary for the functioning of the EIP, in particular the new private sector lending mandate to the EIB.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 TEU, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the EU. By reason of the disparities in the capacity to act of Member States' financial institutions, action at Union level can better achieve the objectives pursued, by reason of its scale and effects.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nAn external study by a consultant has been undertaken in 2016 with the main purpose of assessing the main parameters governing the Guarantee Fund. The Report concluded that the 9% Target Rate set out in Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 is still deemed appropriate for the current risk level of the loans portfolio. A further external review of the target rate will take place most likely in 2019. Moreover, the Guarantee Fund mechanisms have proven effective at protecting the EU budget and at enabling the achievement of the EU external interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nUnder the new private sector lending mandate set up by a separate legislative act, the Union will be entitled to the risk premium revenues generated under EIB financing operations. The risk premium revenues will remunerate the higher risk and contribute over the lifetime of the instrument to the funding of the additional provisioning needs for the Guarantee Fund. The proposal is not expected to have any net budgetary implication because the risk premiums constitute inflows to the Guarantee Fund. They will be charged to the EIB in return for risks born by the Union budget. \n\n\nIn order to better protect the budget against potential additional risk of default of the EIB financing operations related to migration crisis, the amount of the Guarantee Fund in surplus which will exceed 10% instead of 9% of the outstanding of loans will be paid back to the budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nAccording to the Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, the Commission shall by 31 May of each year report to European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors on the situation of the guarantee fund and the management thereof. It is now proposed that the Commission reports by 31 March on the situation of the guarantee fund in the context of the financial statements of the Commission. The report on the management of the guarantee fund shall be sent to European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors by 31 of May of each year.\n\n\n EIB financing operations under EU guarantee are managed and monitored by the EIB in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, including appropriate audit, control and monitoring measures. Furthermore, the EIB Board of Directors, where the Commission is represented by a Director and an alternate Director, approves each EIB financing operation and monitors that the EIB is managed in accordance with its Statute and with the general directives laid down by the Board of Governors.\n\n\n\nThe Tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the EIB sets out the rules under which the Court of Auditors is to carry out its audits of the EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee.\n\n\nRegular reports are prepared under Decision 466/2014/EU. The Commission annually reports on the implementation of the mandate by the EIB to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\nReporting on results will be based on an appropriate aggregation of indicators across the entire portfolio where it is possible, or across a given sector. In the context of the Results Measurement Framework, those indicators will be measured throughout the project cycle at appraisal level and during monitoring until the project is fully implemented. The indicators are to be measured as soon as the first development outcomes are available - typically up to three years after project completion. They will, to the extent possible, also be used for final report under Decision 466/2014/EU. \n\n\nFurthermore, the EIB provides the Commission with statistical, financial and accounting data on each of the financing operations covered by the EU guarantee as necessary to fulfil its reporting duties or requests by the Court of Auditors as well as with an auditor\u2019s certificate on the outstanding of the financing operations covered.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nCurrently, the Guarantee Fund is endowed by the following: (1) one annual payment from the general budget of the Union, (2) interest on Guarantee Fund resources invested, and (3) amounts recovered from defaulting debtors. The risk premium revenues generated under the new private sector lending mandate of the EIB will represent a fourth source of income for the Guarantee Fund. It is proposed to modify Article 2 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 accordingly. \n\n\nUntil now, the assets of the Guarantee Fund have been managed by the EIB. The Commission has a strong experience managing similar financial operations. It is well prepared to manage the Guarantee Fund independently which would represent an effort to streamline and consolidate the asset management activities of the Commission, building on existing structures and a good track record. The Commission is already entrusted to manage the Guarantee Fund for the EFSI. Thus, the management of the assets of the Guarantee Fund should be transferred to the European Commission.\n\n\nIt is proposed to modify Article 7 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 accordingly.\n\n\n2016/0274 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, \n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Guarantee Fund for external actions is regulated by Council Regulation (EC,\u00a0Euratom) No 480/2009\n2\n.\n\n\n(2)The Guarantee Fund is endowed by one annual payment from the general budget of the Union, by interest on Guarantee Fund resources invested and by amounts recovered from defaulting debtors.\n\n\n(3)Risk premium revenues generated under the financing operations of the European Investment Bank (EIB) that benefit from a Union budgetary guarantee should be paid to the Guarantee Fund.\n\n\n(4)The amount of the Guarantee Fund in surplus exceeding 10% of the Union's total outstanding capital liabilities should be paid back to the general budget of the Union in order to better protect the budget against potential additional risk of default of the EIB financing operations addressing root causes of migration.\n\n\n(5)The financial management of the Guarantee Fund should be transferred from the EIB to the Commission, which has an established practice of managing similar investments. By taking over the asset management of the Guarantee Fund, the Commission should be able to streamline and consolidate its asset management activities, building on existing structures and a good track record.\n\n\n(6)Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in Article 2, the following fourth indent is added:\n\n\n\u2018\u2014 risk premium revenues generated under the financing operations of the EIB for which the Union provides a guarantee.\u2019;\n\n\n\n(2) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in Article 3, the third paragraph is replaced by the following: \n\n\n\u2018If the amount of the Guarantee Fund exceeds 10% of the Union's total outstanding capital liabilities, the surplus shall be paid back to the general budget of the European Union. That surplus shall be paid in one transaction to a special heading in the statement of revenue in the general budget of the European Union of the year n + 1 on the basis of the year-end n\u20131 difference between 10% of the total outstanding capital liabilities amount and the value of the Fund\u2019s net assets, calculated at the beginning of the year n.\u2019;\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u2018Article 7\n\n\nThe Commission shall ensure the financial management of the Fund. The Commission shall manage and invest the resources of the Guarantee Fund in accordance with the principle of sound financial management and shall follow appropriate prudential rules.\u2019;\n\n\n\n(4) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u2018Article 8\n\n\nBy\u00a031\u00a0March of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Court of Auditors, in the context of the financial statements of the Commission, the required information on the situation of the Guarantee Fund. \n\n\nIn addition, it shall, by\u00a031\u00a0May of each year, submit to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Court of Auditors an annual report on the management of the Guarantee Fund in the previous calendar year.

Article 9 of the Regulation stipulates that the revenue and expenditure account and the balance sheet relating to the Guarantee Fund shall be attached to the Communities\u2019 revenue and expenditure account and balance sheet.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nIn accordance with Article (1) of Regulation 480/2009, the resources of the Guarantee Fund are to be invested. Those investments will bear an investment risk (e.g. market and credit risk) and some operational risk.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe Commission will manage the assets of the Guarantee Fund in accordance with the Regulation 480/2009 and under its internal rules and procedures in force. Regular external audits will be carried out.\n\n\nThe revenues will be handled in accordance with the Financial Regulation\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nThe overall cost effectiveness of controls of asset management activities in 2015, as measured by the proportion of overall cost of control (based on FTE involved over total treasury assets under management) leads the Commission to consider that the controls are sufficiently efficient and cost effective. The same control systems will be applied for the additional assets under management.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe EIB has the main responsibility for the adoption of fraud prevention measures, notably through the application to the financing operations of the \"EIB\u2019s Policy on preventing and deterring Corruption, Fraud, Collusion, Coercion, Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism in European Investment Bank activities\". The EIB has adopted a policy towards weakly regulated, non-transparent and non-cooperative jurisdictions. \n\n\nThe EIB is committed to maintaining a stringent policy against tax fraud, tax evasion and harmful tax practices in all of its activities, including when lending through financial intermediaries. It is constantly monitoring progress in international standards in order to maintain its leading role amongst IFIs in the fight against these harmful tax practices and to ensure that its Policy toward weakly regulated, non-transparent and uncooperative jurisdictions keeps abreast of any material developments.\n\n\nThe EIB Group AML-CFT Framework, updated in 2014 and published on EIB website, establishes the key principles regulating AML-CFT and related integrity aspects in EIB Group activities and aims to prevent the EIB Group, its governing bodies, staff and counterparties from being associated with or used for money laundering, financing of terrorism or other criminal activities.\n\n\nConcerning the take-over of the management of the Guarantee Fund, the Commission's internal rules apply including the specific procedures established for the management of financial assets.\n\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the
