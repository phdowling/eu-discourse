These d\u00e9marches consisted inter alia of actions providing reasons of these d\u00e9marches, its actions, opportunity for the countries to respond and refute, right to ask for and provide additional information, proposed actions plans to remedy the situation as well as adequate time to answer and reasonable time to remedy the situation. \n\n\nOn 26 November 2013 the Commission, by Commission Implementing Decision, identified the Republic of Guinea (hereinafter Guinea) as a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to the IUU Regulation.\n\n\nOn 24 March 2014 the Council, by Council Implementing Decision, adopted the list of non-cooperating third countries, which included Guinea, in fighting IUU fishing.\u00a0\n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council Implementing Decision is based on the findings which have confirmed that Guinea has\u00a0demonstrated that the situation that warranted its listing has been rectified and that Guinea has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the situation. \n\n\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Decision.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe pre-identification by the Commission of Guinea as a non-cooperating country in Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 (OJ C 354 17.11.2012, p.1-47) on notifying the third countries that the Commission considers as possible of being identified as non-cooperating countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\nThe identification by the Commission of Guinea as a non-cooperating country in Commission Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013 (OJ C 346 27.11.2013, p. 2-25) on identifying a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\nThe Council placing Guinea on the list of non-cooperating countries in Council Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014 (OJ L 91 27.3.2014, p. 43-47) establishing a list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 on establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle does therefore not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\nThe form of action is described in the IUU Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\n\n\nIndication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instruments: decision.\n\n\nOther means would not be adequate because the IUU Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nInterested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interest during the investigation and dialogue procedures, in line with the provisions of the IUU Regulation. \n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThis proposal is a result of the implementation of the IUU Regulation.\n\n\nThe IUU Regulation does not contain provisions for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that must be assessed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the Union budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nNot applicable as proposal enters into force the day after its publication. \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal amends the list established by the Council of non-cooperating third countries in the fight against IUU as set out in the Annex to Council Decision 2014/170/EU.\n\n\n\n2016/0219 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending implementing Decision 2014/170/EU to remove the Republic of Guinea from the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999\n2\n, and in particular Article 34(1) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 ('the IUU Regulation') establishes a Union system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\n\n(2)Chapter VI of the IUU Regulation lays down the procedure with respect to the identification of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing and provides for the establishment of a list of such non-cooperating countries.\n\n\n(3) By Decision of 15 November 2012\n3\n, the Commission included the information concerning the essential facts and considerations underlying such possible identification and notified eight third countries, including the Republic of Guinea (hereinafter 'Guinea') of the possibility of being identified as third countries that it considers as non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing.\n\n\n(4)By Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013\n4\n, the Commission identified Guinea as a non-cooperating third country in fighting IUU fishing. In that Decision, the Commission provided the reasons for which it considered that this country failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State to take action, to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU\u00a0fishing.\n\n\n(5)By Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU\n5\n, the Council adopted the list of non-cooperating third countries which included Guinea.\n\n\n(6)The list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing is set out in the Annex to Council Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU. \n\n\n(7)Following the inclusion of Guinea in that list, Guinea endeavoured to to rectify the situation that warranted its listing, and to take concrete measures capable of remedying the identified failures.\n\n\n(8)On the basis of the information obtained by the Commission, it appears that Guinea has implemented its international law obligations and adopted an adequate legal framework for fighting IUU fishing. It has created a deterrent sanctioning system. It has also established an adequate and efficient monitoring, control and inspection scheme by developing a National Plan of Inspection and introducing aerial surveillance and equipping its Fishing Monitoring Centre (FMC) with a fully functional Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Guinea has also reviewed its registration and licensing systems and introduced technical, conservation and management measures to ensure a reasonable balance between the fishing licences delivered, resources available and its control and enforcement capacities. Guinea has furthermore reconsidered its participation within Regional Fisheries Management Organisations' (RFMOs), has improved its compliance with its international obligations stemming from recommendations and resolutions of those Organisations and has taken appropriate measures against Guinean IUU vessels on the RFMOs IUU lists.\n\n\n(9)It also appears that with the actions undertaken Guinea no longer fails to ensure compliance with its duties incumbent upon it under international law and in particular in the light of the provisions of Articles\u00a061, 62, 94,\u00a0117 and\u00a0118\u00a0of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and\u00a0Articles 18, 19 and\u00a020\u00a0of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). \n\n\n(10)It may therefore be concluded that the situation that warranted the listing of Guinea has been rectified and that Guinea has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the situation. \n\n\n(11)As a consequence, Council Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU should be amended in order to remove Guinea from the list of non-cooperating countries in fighting IUU fishing. \n\n\n(12)This decision taken by the Council does not preclude any future steps, which may be taken by the Union, in accordance with the IUU Regulation, in case factual elements were to reveal that Guinea fails to fulfil the duties incumbent upon it under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State, to take action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n\n\n(13)In the light of the adverse consequences caused by a listing as non-cooperating third country, it is appropriate to give immediate effect to the delisting of Guinea as a non-cooperating third country, \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Annex to Council Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(3)\nCommission Decision of 15 November 2012 on notifying the third countries that the Commission considers as possible of being identified as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\n\n(OJ C 354, 17.11.2012, p. 1).\n\n\n\n(4)\nCommission Implementing Decision of 26 November 2013 identifying the third countries that the Commission considers as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (OJ C 346 27.11.2013, p. 2-25).\n\n\n\n(5)\nCouncil Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014 2014/170/EU establishing a list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (OJ L 91 27.3.2014, p. 43).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 13.7.2016\nCOM(2016) 459 final\nANNEX\n\nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending implementing Decision 2014/170/EU to remove the Republic of Guinea from the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing\n\nList of non-cooperating third countries in fighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of non-cooperating third countries in fighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKingdom of Cambodia\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
