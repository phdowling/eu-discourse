Consequently, the European Union was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. Such adjustment is due if the adoption of the EU\u2019s external tariff regime results in an increase in tariff beyond the level for which the acceding country has bound itself at the WTO.\n\n\nOn 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. \n\n\nNegotiations with the Federative Republic of Brazil resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 12 July 2016 in Geneva (the Agreement). Consequently, this proposal asks the Council to adopt a decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the Federative Republic of Brazil. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with EU practice followed in previous EU enlargements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal follows EU practice which is consistent with the EU external action, industrial and agricultural policies.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjuction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the TFEU for the conclusion of international agreements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under exclusive competence of the Union, Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe Federative Republic of Brazil was affected by the withdrawal of Croatia's concessions. The compensatory adjustments do not exceed Brazil's rights in this respect. The proposal complies with the proportionality treatment.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nA Decision of the Council to conclude the Agreement is required under Article 218(6)(a) TFEU.\n\n\n\n\n3.STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThe Council (Trade Policy Committee) has been regularly consulted on the content and advancement of the negotiations. The European Parliament (INTA Committee) has been informed.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nSee Financial Statement.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans \n\n\n\nThis proposal asks the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the Federative Republic of Brazil.
