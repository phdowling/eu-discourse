Article 2(2) of the Convention provides that, for the purposes of the Convention, \u2018third party\u2019 means any neighbouring country or territory which is not a Contracting Party.\n\n\nGeorgia submitted its written request for accession to the Convention to the depositary of the Convention (the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU) on 23 September 2015.\n\n\nGeorgian authorities confirm that Georgia has a free trade agreement with Contracting Parties, namely the EU and Turkey. As a consequence, Georgia complies with the condition set out in Article 5(1) of the Convention to become a Contracting Party. \n\n\nThe request should therefore be submitted to the Joint Committee of the Convention in application of its Article 4(3)(b) for adoption of a Decision inviting Georgia to accede to the Convention. The position to be taken by the EU within the Joint Committee should be established by the Council.\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the accession of Georgia does not require any transitional measures as referred to in Article 4(3)(c) of the Convention.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is the first subparagraph of Article\u00a0207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe Contracting Parties to the Convention and the Member States were informed of the request at the meeting of the Joint Committee of the Convention of 25 November 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nNo recourse to external expertise has been necessary. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\nFurthermore, it has not been necessary to conduct an impact assessment, since the accession of a third party to the Convention is only subject to the condition that it has a free trade agreement in force with at least one of the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\n\n\n2016/0147 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be taken, on behalf of the

that the candidate country or territory has a free trade agreement in force, providing for preferential rules of origin, with at least one of the Contracting Parties.\n\n\n(3)Georgia submitted a written request for accession to the Convention to the depositary of the Convention on 23 September 2015.\n\n\n(4)Georgia has a free trade agreement in force with two Contracting Parties to the Convention, namely Turkey and the EU, and complies with the condition set out in Article 5(1) of the Convention to become a Contracting Party.\n\n\n(5)Pursuant to Article 4(3)(b) of the Convention the Joint Committee shall adopt by decision invitations to third parties to accede to the Convention.\n\n\n(6)The position of the Union within the Joint Committee should be to vote in favour of a decision inviting Georgia to accede to the Convention, \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nThe position to be taken by the European Union within the Joint Committee of the Regional
