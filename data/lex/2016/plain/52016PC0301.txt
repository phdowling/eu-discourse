"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 26.5.2016\nCOM(2016) 301 final\n2016/0154(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nIn order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods inadequate or non-existent in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, some autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties have been partially or totally suspended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013. \n\n\nThe regulation is updated every semester with the objective of accommodating the needs of the EU industry. The Commission, assisted by the Economic Tariff Questions Group (ETQG), has reviewed all requests for temporary suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties forwarded by the Member States.\n\n\nFollowing this review, the Commission considers that the suspension of duties is justified for some new products, currently not listed in the Annex of the Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013. In relation to some other products the wording of their description has to be changed or new CN or TARIC codes should be assigned. Products for which a tariff suspension is no longer in the Union's economic interest are proposed to be withdrawn. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading agreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and potential candidates).\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal is in line with the agricultural, trade, enterprise, development and external relations policies.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the principle of proportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out to simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in accordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6). This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on qualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal; therefore a regulation is the appropriate instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nThe whole scheme of autonomous suspensions was subject to an evaluation study which was carried out in 2013. The evaluation concluded that the core rationale for the scheme remains valid. The cost savings for EU businesses that import goods under the scheme can be significant. In turn, these savings can lead to wider benefits (such as higher competitive abilities, more efficient production methods, creation or maintenance of EU jobs etc.), depending on the product, company and sector in question.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe assessment of this proposal has been carried out with the assistance of the ETQG which consists of delegations from all Member States plus Turkey. It met three times before the changes laid down in this proposal have been agreed.\n\n\nEach request (new or amendment) has been assessed carefully by the group. In particular, preventing any harm for EU producers and the strengthening and consolidation of the competiveness of EU production are part of the examination of each case. This assessment has been carried out by discussions within the ETQG and consultation by Member States of the concerned industries, associations, chambers of commerce and other stakeholders involved.\n\n\n\nAll listed suspensions correspond to agreements or compromises reached in the discussion of the ETQG. There was no mention of potentially serious risks with irreversible consequences.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe proposed amendment is a technical one concerning only the coverage of suspensions listed in the Annex. The Regulation remains otherwise identical to the existing Council Regulation.  Thus no impact assessment was carried out for this proposal.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no consequences on fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue. Uncollected customs duties of a total amount of approximately 88\u00a0Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own resources of the budget is 66\u00a0Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 88\u00a0Mio \u20ac/year). Legislative financial statement contains more details of the budgetary implications of the proposal. \n\n\nThe loss of revenue in Traditional Own Resources shall be compensated by Member States contributions based on the GNI.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe measures proposed are treated within the framework of TARIC (Tarif int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne/Integrated Tariff of the European Union) and applied by customs administrations of the Member States.\n\n\n\nChecks on the end-use of some of the products covered by this Council Regulation will be carried out in accordance with Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n2016/0154 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)It is in the interest of the Union to suspend totally the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on 140 products that are not currently listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013\n1\n.\n\n\n(2)It is no longer in the interest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on 6 of the products that are currently listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013.\n\n\n(3)It is necessary to modify the conditions of 46 suspensions, currently listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 in order to take into account technical product developments, economic trends on the market, further scrutiny of classification or to carry out linguistic adaptations. The modified conditions refer to changes of the product description, classification, duty rates or end-use requirement. The suspensions in respect of which modifications are necessary should be deleted from the list of suspensions in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013, and the modified suspensions should be inserted into that list. \n\n\n(4)In the interest of clarity, the footnote indicating a newly introduced measure or a measure with amended conditions listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 should be deleted and the entries modified by this Regulation should be marked with an asterisk.\n\n\n(5)Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n(6)As the changes regarding the suspensions for the products concerned provided for in this Regulation have to apply from 1 July 2016, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1) the rows for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted\u00a0following the order of the CN codes indicated in the first column of the table in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013;\n\n\n(2) the rows for the products for which the CN and TARIC codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation are deleted; \n\n\n(3) the footnote seven (7) \"A newly introduced measure or a measure with amended conditions\", currently appearing in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 is deleted. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2016.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\n\nCouncil Regulation amending Regulation\u00a0(EU)\u00a0No\u00a01387/2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products\n\n\n2.BUDGET LINES:\n\n\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article 120 \n\n\nAmount budgeted for the year 2016: \u20ac 18 465 300 000 \u20ac (B 2016) \n\n\n\n\n3.FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n\n\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial implications\n\n\nX \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue \u2013 the effect is as follows:\n\n\n(EUR million to one decimal place\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget line\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 month period, starting dd/mm/yyyy\n\n\n\n\n[Year: 2/2016]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 120 \n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on own resources\n\n\n\n\n      01/07/2016\n\n\n\n\n           -33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation following action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[2017\u00a0\u2013\u00a02020]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\u00a0120\n\n\n\n\n- 66/\u00a0year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES\n\n\nChecks on the end-use of some of the products covered by this Council Regulation will be carried out in accordance with Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code.\n\n\n5.OTHER REMARKS\n\n\nThis proposal contains the amendments which must be made to the Annex to the existing Regulation in order to take into account the following: \n\n\n1. new requests for suspension which have been presented and accepted; \n\n\n2. technical product developments and economic trends on the market resulting in the lifting of certain existing suspensions. \n\n\nAddition \n\n\nThis Annex, in addition to the amendments resulting from description or code changes, contains 140 new products. The uncollected duties corresponding to these suspensions, calculated on the basis of requesting Member State projections for the period 2015 to 2019, amount to 55,8\u00a0Mio \u20ac/year. \n\n\nOn the basis of the existing statistics for preceding years, it would appear, however, necessary to increase this amount by an average factor, estimated at 1,8, to take account of imports into other Member States using the same suspensions. This means uncollected duties loss of revenue of some 100,4 Mio \u20ac\u00a0/year. \n\n\nWithdrawal: \n\n\n6 products have been withdrawn from this Annex reflecting the reintroduction of customs duties. This represents an increase of 12,4 Mio \u20ac in resources, as estimated on the basis of 2015 statistics. \n\n\nEstimated cost of this operation \n\n\n\n\nOn the basis of the above, the impact on the loss of revenue resulting from this Regulation may be estimated at 100,4 \u2013 12,4\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a088\u00a0Mio \u20ac\u00a0(gross amount, including collection costs) x 0,75\u00a0=\u00a066\u00a0Mio \u20ac/year for the period 01.07.2016\u00a0-\u00a031.12.2020. \n\n\nThe loss of revenue in Traditional Own Resources shall be compensated by Member States contributions based on the GNI. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 1387/2013 of 17 December 2013 suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural and industrial products and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 201).\n\n\n\n(2)\nThe amounts per year need to be an estimation based on the formula under section\u00a05 with a footnote indicating it, e.g. \"indicative amount based on the agreed formula\". For the starting year, the yearly amount is normally paid without a reduction or prorata.\n\n\n\n(3)\nIn the case of traditional own resources (agricultural duties, sugar levies, customs duties), the amounts indicated must be net amounts, i.e. gross amounts after deduction of 25\u00a0% for collection costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 26.5.2016\nCOM(2016) 301
