"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 16.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 403 final\n2016/0188(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Association Committee established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, as regards an amendment to Protocol 3 to that Agreement concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe framework for bilateral trade relations between the European Union (\"EU\") and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\"Jordan\") is provided by the EU-Jordan Association Agreement (\"the Association Agreement\"), which entered into force on 1 May 2002. The Association Agreement establishes a free trade area under which Jordan enjoys very extensive preferential access to the EU, with only a very limited number of products not entitled to enter the EU market on a duty and quota free basis. Jordanian exports to the EU have however not responded to the opportunity this preferential access represents and remain at a persistent low level. EU imports from Jordan averaged EUR323 million in the period 2012-15. This represented only 0.02% of total EU imports of goods. The EU represented the 5th most important destination for Jordan's exports in 2014 (4.1% of its total exports).\n\n\nThe protracted civil conflict in Syria has created a complex and serious humanitarian challenge in the region since it is estimated that over half of the Syrian population has now been forcibly displaced, with several million having fled across the borders into neighbouring states. The scale of displacement and the increasingly protracted nature of the Syrian conflict have had a dramatic impact on neighbouring host states, including Jordan. \n\n\nJordan is currently hosting 1.265 million Syrians, including 639,000 UNHCR-registered refugees which overall represents around 20 percent of its pre-crisis population. This represents a significant challenge and burden for the country. This influx of refugees has constituted a major economic shock, and represents a potential source of fragility. Regional tensions have led to disruptions in Jordan's traditional trade patterns, fewer tourism arrivals and a hesitant investor sentiment. Economic growth has been downgraded to 2.5 percent in 2015 due to regional developments; a level that is insufficient to make a dent in the very high unemployment rates.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the Syrian crisis the EU, together with other donors, has offered significant amounts of humanitarian and other developmental aid to Jordan. The continued willingness of the EU to extend support to Jordan in these areas was reiterated at the International Conference on \"Supporting Syria and the Region\", which was held in London on 4 February 2016. The EU has declared its intention to consolidate its support for Jordan in a Compact that is presently in preparation.\n\n\n\nIt is in this context that Jordan has presented to the EU proposals for a holistic approach to turn the Syrian refugee crisis into a development opportunity, with mutual benefits for Jordan and for Syrian refugees. These proposals are based on the idea of creating additional employment and other economic opportunities for Syrian refugees presently in Jordan, alongside steps by Jordan to promote investment and facilitate refugee participation in the formal economy. These are expected to create spill-over benefits for the wider Jordanian economy as well as the future post-conflict Syrian economy. Jordan's proposals consist of a set of practical measures to attract investment and generate economic activity in selected development zones within Jordan. \n\n\nIn the framework of the London Conference, Jordan declared its intention to permit Syrian refugees to participate in the formal labour market and set out a number of steps it would take towards a target of creating around 200,000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees over the coming years. Given that the World Bank estimated the labour force in Jordan to be around 1.78 million in 2014, this number of jobs would represent around 11% of the current labour force.\n\n\n\nJordan looks to the international community - and in particular to the EU - to support its efforts in this direction. One important element of Jordan's proposals that is intended to contribute to achieving this target is a request directed to the EU for a relaxation of the preferential rules of origin applicable in bilateral trade in order to attract more investment to the country for productive activities aiming at the EU market. Jordan considers that the preferential rules of origin provided for in the Association Agreement act in practice as an obstacle to the development of its trade with the EU. \n\n\nThe Commission has considered Jordan's request and proposes in response a time-limited and targeted initiative to support Jordan through facilitated access to the EU market. This will take the form of a temporary relaxation of the rules of origin laid down in Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement. \n\n\nThis relaxation will cover a selected number of products of interest for Jordan and will be made available to producers in Jordan as an alternative to the existing rules. The relaxation would in a first stage be subject to certain conditions which aim at ensuring that the benefit of the relaxation is available only to exporters which are directly contributing to the goal of ensuring additional employment of Syrian refugees. These conditions concern the place of production (in a number of development zones and industrial areas specified by Jordan) and the use of a proportion of Syrian refugee labour in the relevant production facilities (at least 15% at the outset, rising to 25% from year three). \n\n\nThe alternative rules of origin made available under this proposal are those applied by the EU for imports from least-developed countries under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. For industrial products this implies that the threshold for non-originating materials that may be used by Jordan exporters in order to benefit from preferential treatment in the EU would be substantially increased (in general up to 70% rather than 40%). For clothing these relaxed rules are based on the principle of single transformation rather than the principle of double transformation.\n\n\nAt a second stage, once Jordan achieves the target of creating around 200,000 jobs for Syrian refugees established in the framework of the London Conference, it is proposed that the EU and Jordan further simplify this support measure by eliminating the conditions concerning the place of production and the use of Syrian labour in the relevant production facilities. This would effectively extend the possibility to use the alternative rules of origin to all producers in Jordan in recognition of the significant effort that Jordan would have made to ensure the integration of such a sizeable proportion of Syrian refugees into the formal labour market across the whole economy. This change would need to be the object of a fresh decision of the Association Committee.\n\n\nThis initiative is not covered by REFIT.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposed relaxation of the rules of origin represents a time-limited derogation from the current rules of origin applicable in bilateral trade under the Association Agreement. These rules are comparable to the rules of origin applicable to preferential trade between Contracting Parties in the Pan-European Mediterranean zone (PEM). The initiative is designed in such a way as to ensure a clear linkage with efforts to support Jordan during the present refugee crisis and to generate additional employment opportunities for Syrian refugees present in the country. As a result, potential implications for ongoing negotiations to update the preferential origin rules applied in the PEM context or for other countries that might seek a comparable derogation on a bilateral basis are limited. \n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis and choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to Article 39 of Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation, as amended by decision n\u00b01/2006 of the EU-Jordan Association Council of 15 June 2006, the parties may amend the provisions of this protocol through a joint decision of the EU-Jordan Association Committee.\n\n\nThe legal basis for the Council Decision is the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) \n\n\n\nAccording to 218(9) TFEU \"The Council, on a proposal from the Commission or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, shall adopt a decision [...] establishing the positions to be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending the institutional framework of the agreement.\"\n\n\nThe procedure foreseen in Article 218(9) TFEU should be followed whenever the conditions set out in that Article are fulfilled. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe objective of the proposed measure is to provide support to Jordan in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis by providing a stimulus for additional investment, economic activity and employment creation, notably for Syrian refugees, in specific development zones within the country. As Jordan already enjoys preferential access to the EU market under the Association Agreement, a temporary relaxation of the applicable rules of origin represents the most suitable way to stimulate economic activity linked to the production of goods for export to the EU and to increased employment of Syrian refugees.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder Consultations\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nNo impact assessment has been carried out. The EU has a strong interest in supporting Jordan in the present refugee crisis. The proposed measure represents a time-limited and focused initiative \u2013 alongside humanitarian and development assistance \u2013 that will assist Jordan by helping create an incentive for greater investment and employment in a manner to directly benefit Syrian refugees currently present in Jordan while the conflict in Syria continues. \n\n\nJordan is a very marginal supplier to the EU market (representing 0.02% of total EU imports) and the structure of its exports is concentrated in a limited number of sectors, such as clothing (which it exports mainly to the US), phosphates and phosphate-based fertilizers, chemicals, machinery and transport equipment. The only sectors where Jordan\u2019s share of EU imports exceeds even 0.1% are fertilisers (chapter 31 - 1.28%), chemicals (chapter 28 - 0.33%) and aircraft, spacecraft, and parts (chapter 88 - 0.17%). Given this very low trade volume, any increased imports under this initiative are unlikely to have a detrimental effect on EU production while potentially resulting in a significant increase in relation to Jordan's own exports. \n\n\n\n4.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThis initiative, once incorporated in the Association Agreement and applied, will be implemented and monitored both in Jordan and at the EU borders according to Article 1 of ANNEX II(a) to Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement, contained in ANNEX I of the draft Joint Decision of the EU-Jordan Association Committee.\n\n\n\nLocal checks and controls as well as obligations of regular reporting by Jordan are established. Further discussions with Jordan on the modalities of regular reporting will take place in parallel to the consideration of the present draft Joint Decision and the outcome of such discussions should be reflected in the final version of the Joint Decision agreed by the Association Committee. The EU and Jordan should also consider how relevant international organisations with expertise in the matters covered by the Joint Decision might be involved in strengthening national capacities and in the future monitoring process. This will particularly be the case for the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has gained extensive expertise in Jordan in connection with the \"Better Work Jordan\" project, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is also involved in the \"Better Work Jordan\" project, and the World Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, 4 years after the application of ANNEX II(a) to Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement, the EU and Jordan will carry out a mid-term review pursuant to Article 1(d) of ANNEX II(a) to Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement, and may amend ANNEX II(a) through a decision of the EU-Jordan Association Committee. Annex II(a) would also need to be amended in case Jordan meets the target of creating 200,000 jobs for Syrian refugees and it is therefore decided to extend the scheme on a country-wide basis.\n\n\nThe application of ANNEX II(a) to Protocol 3 of the Association Agreement may be suspended if the conditions for its application are no longer fulfilled or if the conditions for safeguard measures as specified in Articles 24 and 26 of the Association Agreement are met.\n\n\n\n2016/0188 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Association Committee established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, as regards an amendment to Protocol 3 to that Agreement concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part\n1\n (\"the Agreement\") entered into force on 1 May 2002. Pursuant to Article 89 of the Agreement, an Association Council is established to examine any major issues arising within the framework of this Agreement and any other bilateral and international issues of mutual interest.\n\n\n(2)Pursuant to Article 92 of the Agreement, an Association Committee is established which shall be responsible for the implementation of the Agreement and to which the Association Council may delegate, in full or in part, any of its powers.\n\n\n(3)Pursuant to Article 94(1) of the Agreement, the Association Committee shall have the power to take decisions for the management of the Agreement as well as in the areas where the Association Council has delegated its powers to it.\n\n\n(4)Pursuant to Article 2 of the Council and Commission decision of 26 March 2002 on the Conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part\n2\n, the position to be taken by the European Union (\"EU\") within the Association Committee shall be laid down by the Council on a proposal by the Commission.\n\n\n(5)Pursuant to Article 39 of Protocol 3 of the Agreement, as amended by Decision n\u00b0 1/2006 of the EU Jordan Association Council of 15 June 2006\n3\n, the Association Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\n\n\n(6)The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\"Jordan\") submitted proposals to the international community for a Holistic Approach for an economic response to the Syrian refugee crisis. \n\n\n(7)In the framework of the International Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region, held in London on 4 February 2016, Jordan declared its intention to permit Syrian refugees to participate in the formal labour market in Jordan and set out a number of steps it would take towards this end, notably with a view to creating around 200,000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees.\n\n\n(8)In relation to this initiative Jordan made a specific request on 12 December 2015 for a temporary relaxation of the rules of origin to be made available under the Agreement so as to enhance Jordan's exports to the EU and create additional employment opportunities, especially for Syrian refugees.\n\n\n(9)As a result of the examination of Jordan's request, the Council, on behalf of the EU, considers it justified to agree to additional rules of origin that, under the conditions specified in Annex 1 to the draft Joint Decision of the Association Committee attached to this Decision, notably as concerns relevant products, production zones and the creation of additional employment for Syrian refugees, should be made available as an alternative to those laid down in Annex II to Protocol 3 of the Agreement for exports from Jordan and should be those applied by the EU for imports from least-developed countries under the GSP/ EBA initiative.\n\n\n(10)Annex 1 of the draft Joint Decision of the Association Committee attached to this Decision should apply until 31 December 2026 and a mid-term review should be undertaken allowing the parties to make adjustments through a decision of the Association Committee. \n\n\n\n\n(11)The achievement by Jordan of its objective of creating around 200,000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees should be considered as a significant milestone also in respect of the implementation of the draft Joint Decision of the Association Committee attached to this Decision. Accordingly, once this objective is achieved, the EU and Jordan will consider extending the coverage of the Joint Decision to include all products covered by the Joint Decision that are produced in Jordan, without the need to satisfy the specific conditions set out in Article 1(1) of Annex I of the draft Joint Decision.\n\n\n(12)The application of Annex 1 of the draft Joint Decision of the Association Committee attached to this Decision should be accompanied by appropriate monitoring and reporting obligations and may be suspended if the conditions for its application are no longer fulfilled or if the conditions for safeguard measures are met,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position to be taken by the European Union in the EU-Jordan Association Committee established by virtue of Article 92 of the Agreement, as regards an amendment to Protocol 3 to that Agreement concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation, shall be based on the draft Decision of that Association Committee, attached to this Decision. \n\n\nMinor changes to the draft Decision may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Association Committee without further decision of the Council.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nAfter its adoption, the Decision of the Association Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on [\u2026]. \n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 129, 15.5.2002, p. 166.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 129, 15.5.2002, p 1.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 209, 31.7.2006, p .31.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 16.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 403 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union in the Association Committee established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, as regards an amendment to Protocol 3 to that Agreement concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\n\n\nDRAFT\n\n\nJOINT DECISION N\u00b0 [1]/2016 OF THE EU-JORDAN ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE\n\n\nof [x/x/]2016\n\n\nAmending the provisions of Protocol 3 to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, concerning the definition of originating products and the list of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for certain categories of products, manufactured in dedicated development zones and industrial areas, and connected with generating employment for Syrian refugees and Jordanians, to obtain originating status. \n\n\nThe EU-Jordan Association Committee, \n\n\nHaving regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, (\"the Agreement\") and in particular Article 94 of the Agreement and Article 39 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement.\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\"Jordan\") submitted proposals to the international community for a Holistic Approach for an economic response to the Syrian refugee crisis and as part of this initiative made a specific request on 12 December 2015 for a relaxation of the rules of origin applied under the Agreement so as to enhance Jordan's exports to the European Union (\"EU\") and create additional employment opportunities, especially for Syrian refugees as well as Jordanians. \n\n\n(2)In the framework of the International Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region, held in London on 4 February 2016, Jordan declared its intention to promote the participation of Syrian refugees in the formal labour market in Jordan and in this context to provide 50,000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees within one year of the Conference and the overall objective to increase this level to around 200,000 job opportunities over the next years.\n\n\n(3)A temporary relaxation of applicable rules of origin would allow for certain goods produced in Jordan to be subject to less stringent rules of origin for the purpose of determining preferential treatment on import into the EU than would otherwise apply. This temporary relaxation of applicable rules of origin would be part of the European Union's support to Jordan in the context of the Syrian crisis and with the aim of mitigating the costs imposed by hosting a large number of Syrian refugees.\n\n\n(4)The EU considers that the requested relaxation of the rules of origin would contribute to the overall objective of creating around 200.000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees. \n\n\n(5)The relaxation of the rules of origin would be subject to certain conditions in view of ensuring that the benefit goes to exporters that contribute to the Jordanian effort of employing Syrian refugees.\n\n\n(6)Annex 1 of this Decision applies to goods produced in production facilities located in dedicated development zones and industrial areas within Jordan and contributing to the generation of employment of Syrian refugees along the Jordanian population. \n\n\n(7)The objective of this initiative is to stimulate trade and investment in these development zones and industrial areas and thereby contribute to improved economic and employment opportunities for Syrian refugees along the Jordanian population. \n\n\n(8)Protocol 3 and its Annex II of the Agreement should therefore be complemented in order to specify the list of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for such products to obtain such preferential originating status. This complementary list of working or processing should be based on the origin rules applied by the EU for imports from least-developed countries under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative.\n\n\n(9)There should be a possibility to suspend temporarily the application of Annex 1 of this Decision establishing a complementary list of working and processing in relation to a specific production facility if the conditions laid out in Article 1.1 of Annex 1 of this Decision are not met by that facility.\u00a0\n\n\n(10)There should also be a possibility to suspend temporarily the application of Annex 1 of this Decision with respect to any of the products listed in Article 2 of Annex 1 of this Decision imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injuries to EU producers of like or directly competing products in all or part of the territory of the EU or serious disturbances in any sector of the EU economy in accordance to Articles 24 and 26 of the Agreement.\n\n\n(11)This Decision should be valid for a limited period sufficient to provide incentive for additional investment and employment generation and should therefore expire on 31 December 2026. The EU and Jordan will carry out a mid-term review pursuant to Article 1.7 of Annex 1 of this Decision, and may amend Annex 1 of this Decision through a decision of the Association Committee in the light of experience of the implementation of this Decision. \n\n\n\n\n(12)The achievement by Jordan of its objective set in the framework of the International Conference of 4 February 2016 of creating around 200,000 job opportunities for Syrian refugees would represent a significant milestone also in respect of the implementation of this Decision, whereupon the EU and Jordan will consider further simplifying this support measure by eliminating the conditions concerning the place of production and the use of Syrian refugees in the relevant production facilities. This would require an amendment of Annex I of this Decision through a decision of the Association Committee,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nAnnex II of Protocol 3 of the Agreement, containing the list of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for the product manufactured to obtain originating status, is amended and complemented by Annex II(a) of Protocol 3 of the Agreement, contained in Annex 1 of this Joint Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2 \n\n\nAnnex II(a) of Protocol 3 of the Agreement, contained in Annex 1 of this Decision, specifies the conditions for application and the list of working or processing required to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for the product manufactured in specific geographic areas connected with the additional employment of Syrian refugees to obtain originating status.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nAnnex 1 shall form an integral part of this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption by the Association Committee.\n\n\nIt shall apply until 31 December 2026.\n\n\nDone in [Brussels], [x/x/]2016\n\n\nFor the EU-Jordan Association Committee\n\n\nANNEX I\n\n\nANNEX II(a) \n\n\nADDENDUM TO THE LIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\n\n\nArticle 1. Common provisions\n\n\na. Definition of origin\n\n\n1.For the products listed in Article 2, the following rules may also apply instead of the rules set out in Annex II of Protocol 3 provided that such products respect the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)the required working or processing to be carried out on non-originating materials in order for such products to obtain originating status takes place in production facilities located in one of the following Development Zones and Industrial Areas: Alhussein Bin Abdullah II Industrial City- Alkarak, Aljeeza Industrial Area- Amman, Alqastal Industrial Area- Amman, Al Tajamuat Industrial City- Sahab, Dulail Industrial City- Zarqa, Irbid Development Zone and Irbid Alhassan Industrial City, King Abdullah II Bin Alhussein City- Sahab, King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone- Mafraq (including Mafraq Industrial City), Ma\u2019an Development Zone- Ma\u2019an, Marka Industrial Area- Amman, Muwaqqar Industrial City- Amman; and\n\n\n\n\n(b)the total work force of each production facility located in these Development Zones and Industrial Areas in which such products are worked or processed contains a proportion of Syrian refugees equivalent to at least 15% during the first and second years after the entry into force of this Annex and to at least 25% from the beginning of the third year after the entry into force of this Annex. The relevant proportion shall be calculated at any point after the entry into force of this Annex and on an annual basis thereafter taking into account the number of Syrian refugees that are employed in formal and decent jobs and on a Full-Time Equivalent basis, and that have received a work permit valid for a minimum period of twelve months under the applicable legislation of Jordan.\n\n\n2.The competent authorities of Jordan shall monitor the respect of the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1, shall grant to an exporter of products fulfilling such conditions an authorisation number and shall promptly withdraw such authorisation number when such conditions are no longer fulfilled.\n\n\nb. Proof of origin \n\n\n3.A proof of origin made out pursuant to this Annex shall contain the following statement in English: \u2018Derogation \u2013 Annex II(a) of Protocol 3 \u2013 name of the Development Zone or industrial area and authorisation number granted by the competent authorities of Jordan\u2019.\n\n\nc. Administrative cooperation\n\n\n4.When in accordance with Article 33(5) of this Protocol, as amended by decision No 1/2006 of the EU-Jordan Association Council of 15 June 2006, the customs authorities of Jordan inform the European Commission or the requesting customs authorities of the Member States of the European Union (\"EU\") of the results of the verification, they shall specify that the products listed in Article 2 fulfil the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1.\n\n\n5.Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1 are not fulfilled, Jordan shall, on its own initiative or at the request of the European Commission or the customs authorities of the Member States of the EU, carry out appropriate inquiries or arrange for such inquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions. For this purpose, the European Commission or the customs authorities of the Member States of the EU may participate in the inquiries.\n\n\nd. Report, monitoring and revision\n\n\n6.Each year after the entry into force of this Annex, Jordan shall submit a report to the European Commission on the operation and effects of this Annex, including production and export statistics at 8 digit level or the highest level of detail available, and a list identifying the companies producing in the Development Zones and Industrial Areas and specifying the percentage of Syrian refugees they each employed on a year-by-year basis. The Parties shall jointly review such reports and any issues relating to the implementation and monitoring of this Annex in the framework of the existing bodies created under the Association Agreement and in particular in the Sub-Committee on Industry, Trade and Services. The Parties shall also consider the involvement of relevant international organisations such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the World Bank in the monitoring process. \n\n\n7.Four years after the entry into force of this Annex, the Parties shall carry out a mid-term review to determine if any modifications should be made in light of experience of the implementation of this Annex and based on this mid-term review, the Association Committee may consider possible amendments to this Annex. \n\n\n8.Once Jordan achieves its target of facilitating a greater participation of Syrian refugees in the formal labour market by issuing a total number of around 200,000 work permits to Syrian refugees, the Parties shall consider to further simplify the provisions of this Annex by eliminating the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1 concerning the place of production and the use of Syrian refugees in the relevant production facilities. The Association Committee may amend this Annex to this effect.\n\n\ne. Temporary suspension \n\n\n9.(a)The EU may refer the matter to the Association Committee where the EU considers that there is insufficient evidence of Jordan or any specific production facility complying with the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1. The referral shall identify whether the failure to comply with the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1 is attributable to Jordan or any specific production facility. \n\n\n(b)If within 90 days of the matter being referred to it the Association Committee fails to declare that the respect of the conditions laid out in subparagraph 1 is ensured or fails to amend this Annex, the application of this Annex shall be suspended. The extent of the suspension shall be that identified in the referral of the EU to the Association Committee. \n\n\n(c)The Association Committee may also decide to extend the 90-day period in which case the suspension shall take effect where the Association Council has failed to take any of the actions identified in (b) within the extended period of time.\n\n\n(d)The application of this Annex may resume if the Association Committee so decides.\n\n\n(e)In the event of a suspension, this Annex shall continue to apply for a period of 4 months in relation to goods which are either in transit, or in temporary storage in customs warehouses or in free zones in the EU, on the date of temporary suspension of the Annex and for which a proof of origin was properly made out in accordance with the provisions of this Annex prior to the date of temporary suspension.\n\n\nf.
