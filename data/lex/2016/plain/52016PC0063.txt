"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 11.2.2016\nCOM(2016) 63 final\n2016/0037(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing and provisional application of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the East African Community Partner States, of the one part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the signing and provisional application of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the East African Community (EAC) Partner States, of the one part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part (EAC EPA). The EAC Partner States are Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\nThe negotiations were completed at the level of the Chief Negotiators in Brussels on 14 October 2014. The Agreement was initialled on 16 October 2014 in Brussels. \n\n\nKenya currently benefits from the scheme contained in the Market Access Regulation (MAR). The other countries of the region currently benefit from the 'Everything But Arms' initiative, since they are classified among the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). \n\n\nThe Agreement will provide a uniform access regime for the EAC Partner States as soon as it enters into force. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part\n1\n\u00a0(\u2018ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\u2019), which calls for the conclusion of WTO-compatible Economic Partnership Agreements.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe EAC EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement. It offers asymmetric market access to the EAC Partner States, which allows them to shield senstive sectors from liberalisation; it provides a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection; it contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate exports; and it eliminates the use of export subsidies in trade between the Parties. These provisions contribute to the objective of Policy Coherence for Development\u00a0and are consistent with Article 208(2) TFEU.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0this Council decision is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular its Articles 207(3) and (4) and 209(2), in conjunction with Article 218(5), thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments, as set out in the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(5) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions on international agreements. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\n\nA Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) of the EU-ACP Economic Partnership Agreements was carried out between 2003 and 2007. The terms of reference for this project were published by the European Commission in 2002 under a competitive call for tender. As a result of this call for tender a five-year framework contract was awarded to PwC France in August 2002. A draft version of the SIA\u2019s final report was presented to stakeholders in Europe during the EU Civil Society Dialogue meeting organised by the European Commission on 23 March 2007 in Brussels, Belgium. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe EAC EPA is not subject to REFIT procedures; it does not imply any costs for the Union SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights in the Union. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFour out of five EAC Partner States are LDCs benefitting from the 'Everything But Arms' initiative which offers them duty-free quota-free market access into the EU. Kenya benefits from the Market Access regulation which also offers duty-free quota-free market access into the EU. Therefore, there will be no budgetary implications given that the Agreement will continue their market access into the EU on the same terms.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe institutional provisions of the EAC EPA foresee the establishment of an EPA Council, responsible for supervising the implementation of the EPA. The EPA Council shall be composed of the representatives of the Parties at ministerial level and will be assisted by a Committee of Senior Officials. \n\n\nA Consultative Committee will assist the Committee of Senior Officials with a view to promoting dialogue and co-operation between representatives of civil society, the private sector and social and economic partners. Finally, the EAC EPA shall be reviewed after every five years from the date of its entry into force. \n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe EAC EPA contains provisions on trade in goods, customs and trade facilitation, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and agriculture and fisheries. \n\n\nThe provisions concerning cooperation for the implementation of the development dimension lay down the priority areas of action for the implementation of the EAC EPA, which are set out in the Regional Indicative Programme for 2014-2020. \n\n\nThe EAC EPA contains commitments relating to regional integration, which will support the implementation of the EAC custom union. \n\n\n\nThe EAC EPA also provides for negotiations to be continued at the regional level on services, competition policy, investment and private sector development, environment and sustainable development, intellectual property rights, and transparency in public procurement.\n\n\n2016/0037 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL

The Committee of Senior Officials shall make the arbitration panel rulings publicly available.\n\n\n3.The arbitration panel ruling shall be final and binding on Parties. \n\n\nARTICLE 125\n\n\n\n\nList of Arbitrators\n\n\n1.The Committee of Senior Officials shall, not later than six (6) months after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of at least fifteen (15) individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators. The list shall be composed of three sub-lists: one sub-list for each Party to serve as arbitrators; and one sub-list of individuals that are not nationals of either Party and who shall act as Chairperson to the arbitration panel. Each sub-list shall include at least five (5) individuals. The Committee of Senior Officials shall ensure that the list is always maintained at this level in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.\n\n\n2.Should any of the sub-lists not be established or not contain sufficient names of individuals at the time a notice is made pursuant to Article 113(2), the arbitrators shall be drawn by lot from the individuals who have been formally proposed for the respective sub-list by one or both of the parties. If only one Party has proposed names, the three arbitrators shall be drawn by lot from among these names.\n\n\n3.In case there is no list of arbitrators established under paragraph 1 above or names of arbitrators proposed under paragraph 2, the Party initiating the process of arbitration shall request the Secretary General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to act as the appointing authority.\n\n\n4.Arbitrators shall have specialised knowledge of and experience in law and international trade.

However, where a Party has, with regard to a particular measure, initiated a dispute settlement proceeding, either under this Title or under the WTO Agreement, it may not institute a dispute settlement proceeding regarding the same measure in the other forum until the first proceeding has ended. In addition, a Party shall not seek redress for the breach of an obligation which is identical under the Agreement and under the WTO Agreement in the two fora. In such case, once a dispute settlement proceeding has been initiated, the Party shall not bring a claim seeking redress for the breach of the identical obligation under the other agreement to the other forum, unless the forum selected fails for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress of that obligation.\n\n\n3.A Party may with regard to a particular measure, institute a dispute settlement proceeding, either under this Part or under the WTO Agreement:\n\n\n(a)dispute settlement proceedings under this Part are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article 112 and are deemed to be ended when the arbitration panel notifies its ruling to the Parties and to the Committee of Senior Officials under Article 115 or where a mutually agreed solution has been reached under Article 119.\n\n\n(b)dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party\u2019s request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes of the WTO and are deemed to be ended when the Dispute Settlement Body adopts the Panel's report, and the Appellate Body's report as the case may be, under Articles 16 and 17(14) of the DSU.\n\n\n4.Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. The WTO Agreement shall not preclude a Party from suspending obligations under this Agreement.\n\n\nARTICLE 127\n\n\nTime limits\n\n\n1.Any time limits laid down in this Part, including the limits for the arbitration panels to notify their rulings, shall be counted in calendar days from the day following the act or fact to which they refer.\n\n\n2.Any time limit referred to in this Part may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.\n\n\nPART VIII: GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n\nARTICLE 128\n\n\nGeneral exception clause\n\n\n\n\nSubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by the EU or the EAC Partner States of measures:\n\n\n(a)necessary to protect public security and morals or to maintain public order;\n\n\n(b)necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; \n\n\n(c)relating to the importation or exportation of gold or silver;\n\n\n(d)necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including those relating to customs enforcement, the enforcement of monopolies operated under paragraph 4 of Article II and Article XVII of GATT, the protection of patents, trade marks and copyrights, and the prevention of deceptive practices;\n\n\n(e)relating to the products of prison labour; \n\n\n(f)imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value;\n\n\n(g)relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption; \n\n\n(h)undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any intergovernmental commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the GATT Contracting Parties and not disapproved by them or which is itself so submitted and not so disapproved\n4\n;\n\n\n(i)involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilisation plan. However, such measures shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this Agreement relating to nondiscrimination;\n\n\n(j)essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short supply, provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that the EU or the EAC Partner States are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be eliminated as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist.\n\n\nARTICLE 129\n\n\nSecurity exceptions\n\n\n1.Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:\n\n\n(a)to require the EU or the EAC Partner States to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or\n\n\n(b)to prevent the EU or the EAC Partner States from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:\n\n\n(i)relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;\n\n\n(ii)the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; \n\n\n(iii)relating to government procurement indispensable for national security or for national defence purposes; \n\n\n(iv)taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or\n\n\n\n\n(c)to prevent the EU or the EAC Partner States from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. \n\n\n2.The Committee of Senior Officials shall be informed to the fullest extent possible of measures taken under paragraphs 1(b) and (c) above and of their termination.\n\n\nARTICLE 130\n\n\nTaxation\n\n\n1.Nothing in this Agreement, or in any arrangement adopted under this Agreement, shall be construed to prevent a Party from distinguishing, in the application of the relevant provisions of its fiscal legislation, between taxpayers who are not in the same situation, in particular with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where their capital is invested.\n\n\n2.Nothing in this Agreement, or in any arrangement adopted under this Agreement, shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of agreements to avoid double taxation or other tax arrangements or domestic fiscal legislation.\n\n\n3.Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n\nPART IX: GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nARTICLE 131\n\n\nBalance of Payments Difficulties\n\n\n1.Where a Party is in serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties, or under threat thereof, it may adopt or maintain restrictive measures with regard to trade in goods.\n\n\n2.The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the application of the restrictive measures referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n3.Any restrictive measure adopted or maintained under this Article shall be non-discriminatory and of limited duration and shall not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments and external financial situation. They shall be in accordance with the conditions established in the WTO Agreements and consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as applicable.\n\n\n4.A Party maintaining or having adopted restrictive measures, or any changes thereto, shall promptly notify them to the other Party and to the EPA Council and present as soon as possible, a time schedule for their removal.\n\n\n5.Consultations shall be held promptly within the EPA Council and such consultations shall assess the balance of payments situation of the concerned Party and the restrictions adopted or maintained under this Article, taking into account, inter alia, such factors as:\n\n\n(a)the nature and extent of the balance of payments and the external financial difficulties;\n\n\n(b)the external economic and trading environment;\n\n\n(c)alternative corrective measures which may be available. \n\n\n6.The consultations shall address the compliance of any restrictive measures with paragraphs 3 and 4. All findings of statistical and other facts presented by the International Monetary Fund relating to foreign exchange, monetary reserves and balance of payments shall be accepted and conclusions shall be based on the assessment by the Fund of the balance of payments and the external financial situation of the concerned Party adopting or maintaining the measure. \n\n\nARTICLE 132\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of the Parties and fulfilment of obligations\n\n\n1.Contracting Parties of this Agreement are the Contracting Parties to The Treaty establishing the East African Community, herein referred to as the \u2018EAC Partner States\u2019, on the one part, and the European Union or its Member States or the European Union and its Member States, within their respective areas of competence as derived from the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, herein referred to as the \u2018EU\u2019, of the other part.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \u2018Party\u2019 shall refer to the EAC Partner States acting collectively or the EU as the case may be.

The European Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) the date on which the cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied with those countries and territories listed in this Article which have fulfilled the necessary requirements.\n\n\nARTICLE 7\n\n\nWholly obtained products\n\n\n1.The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in an EAC Partner State or in the EU: \n\n\n(a)mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed; \n\n\n(b)plants and vegetable products grown, harvested or gathered there; \n\n\n(c)live animals born and raised there; \n\n\n\n\n(d)products from live animals raised there; \n\n\n(e)products from slaughtered animals born and raised there;\n\n\n(f)(i)products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there; \n\n\n(ii)products of aquaculture, including mariculture, where the fish are born and raised there;\n\n\n(g)products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside any territorial sea of the EAC partners states or of the EU by their vessels\n\n\n(h)products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f); \n\n\n(i)used articles collected there provided that such goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials;\n\n\n(j) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n\n\n(k)products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;\n\n\n(l)goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j). \n\n\n2.The terms \"their vessels\" and \"their factory ships\" in paragraph 1(g) and (h) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships: \n\n\n(a)which are registered in an EU Member State, in an EAC Partner State or in an OCT; \n\n\n(b)which sail under the flag of an EU Member State, of an EAC Partner State or of an OCT;\n\n\n(c)which meet one of the following conditions: \n\n\n(i)they are at least 50 percent owned by nationals of an EU Member State, of an EAC\u00a0Partner State or of an OCT;\n\n\nor\n\n\n(ii)they are owned by companies\n\n\n\u2013which have their office and their main place of business in an EU Member State, in an EAC Partner State or in an OCT; and \n\n\n\u2013which are at least 50 percent owned by an EU Member State, by an EAC Partner State or by an OCT, public entities or nationals of that State.\n\n\n3.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the EU shall recognise, upon request of an EAC Partner State, that vessels chartered or leased by the EAC Partner State be treated as \"their vessels\" to undertake fisheries activities under the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n(a)they operate under the flag of the EAC Partner State; and\n\n\n(b)the EAC Partner State offered the EU the opportunity to negotiate a fishery agreement and the EU did not accept this offer; and\n\n\n(c)at least 50% of crew, master and officers included are nationals of States party to the Agreement, or of an OCT; and\n\n\n(d)the fish is landed and processed in the EAC Partner State; and\n\n\n(e)the activities undertaken under this paragraph target a surplus identified by means of scientific advice made available in the context of the IOTC by relevant international, regional or national authorities; and\n\n\n(f)the charter or lease contract has been accepted by the Committee as providing adequate opportunities for developing the capacity of the EAC Partner State to fish in its own account and in particular as conferring on the EAC Partner State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel placed at its disposal for a significant period of time. \n\n\n4.The conditions of paragraph 2 may each be fulfilled in the EU, in different EAC Partner States, in the OCTs or States belonging to other EPAs insofar as the countries involved benefit from cumulation in accordance with Articles 4 and 5. In this case, the products shall be deemed to have the origin of the country under which flag the vessel or factory ship sails in accordance with paragraph 2(b). \n\n\nThese conditions shall only apply with regard to the OCTs and States belonging to other EPAs provided that the provisions of Article 4(3) have been fulfilled.\n\n\nARTICLE 8\n\n\nSufficiently worked or processed products\n\n\n1.For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed, when the conditions set out in Annex II are fulfilled. \n\n\n2.The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in Annex II is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. \n\n\n3.Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in Annex II should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed: \n\n\n(a)15 % of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;\n\n\n(b)15 % of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Part I of Annex II, shall apply.\n\n\n4.Paragraph 3 shall not allow exceeding any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Annex II.\n\n\n5.Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 7. However, without prejudice to Article 9 and 10(1), the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Annex II for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.\n\n\nARTICLE 9\n\n\nInsufficient working or processing\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 8 are satisfied:\n\n\n\n\n(a)preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n\n\n(b)breaking-up and assembly of packages;\n\n\n(c)washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n\n\n(d)ironing or pressing of textiles;\n\n\n(e)simple painting and polishing operations;\n\n\n(f)husking, partial or total milling of rice, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;\n\n\n(g)operations to colour and flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of crystal sugar;\n\n\n(h)peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n\n\n(i)sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n\n\n(j)sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n\n\n(k)simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n\n\n(l)affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n\n\n(m)simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;\n\n\n(n) simple addition of water or dilution or dehydration or denaturation of products;\n\n\n(o)simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n\n\n(p)a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);\n\n\n(q)slaughter of animals.\n\n\n2.All operations carried out either in the European Union or in the EAC Partner States on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\n\n\nARTICLE 10\n\n\nUnit of qualification\n\n\n\n\n1.The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System. Accordingly, it follows that: \n\n\n(a)when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; \n\n\n(b)when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol. \n\n\n2.Where, under General Rule 5 for the interpretation of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. \n\n\nARTICLE 11\n\n\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\n\n\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\n\n\nARTICLE 12\n\n\nSets\n\n\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 for the interpretation of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.\n\n\nARTICLE 13\n\n\nNeutral elements\n\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is originating, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture: \n\n\n(a)energy and fuel; \n\n\n(b)plant and equipment; \n\n\n(c)machines and tools; \n\n\n(d)goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product. \n\n\nTITLE III\n\n\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n\nARTICLE 14\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of territoriality\n\n\n1.Except as provided for in Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the EAC Partner States or in the EU.\n\n\n2.Except as provided for in Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6, where originating goods exported from an EAC\u00a0Partner State or from the EU to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: \n\n\n(a)the returning goods are the same goods as those exported; and \n\n\n(b)they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. \n\n\nARTICLE 15\n\n\nNon alteration\n\n\n1.The products declared for home use in a Party shall be the same products as exported from the other Party in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than to preserve them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party, prior to being declared for home use.\n\n\n2.Storage of products or consignments may take place provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.\n\n\n3.Without prejudice to the provisions of Title IV, the splitting of consignments may take place where carried out by the exporter or under his responsibility, provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of splitting.\n\n\n4.Compliance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs authorities have reason to believe the contrary. In such cases, the customs authorities may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves.\n\n\nARTICLE 16\n\n\nExhibitions\n\n\n1.Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country or territory other than those referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6 with which cumulation is applicable and sold after the exhibition for importation in the EU or in an EAC Partner State shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: \n\n\n(a)an exporter has consigned these products from an EAC Partner State or from the EU to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there; \n\n\n(b)the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in an EAC Partner State or in the EU; \n\n\n(c)the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and\n\n\n(d)the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition. \n\n\n2.A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title IV and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required. \n\n\n3.Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control. \n\n\n\n\nTITLE IV\n\n\nPROOF OF ORIGIN\n\n\nARTICLE 17\n\n\nGeneral requirements\n\n\n1.Products originating in an EAC Partner State, on importation into the EU and products originating in the EU, on importation into an EAC Partner State shall benefit from the provisions of this Agreement upon submission of either: \n\n\n(a)a movement certificate EUR 1, a specimen of which appears in Annex III; or \n\n\n(b)in the cases specified in Article 22 (1), a declaration, subsequently referred to as the \"origin declaration\", given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the origin declaration appears in Annex IV.\n\n\n2.Upon notification in the Committee from the EU to the EAC Partner States, products originating in the EU shall on importation into an EAC Partner State benefit from, preferential tariff treatment of this Agreement upon submission of an origin declaration made out as provided for in Article 22 by an exporter registered in accordance with the relevant legislation of the EU. Such notification may stipulate that paragraph 2, (a) and (b) shall cease to apply to the EU.\n\n\n3.Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above. \n\n\n4.For the purpose of applying the provisions of this Title, the exporters shall endeavour to use a language common to both the EAC Partner States and the EU.\n\n\nARTICLE 18\n\n\nProcedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR 1\n\n\n1.A movement certificate EUR 1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative. \n\n\n2.For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR 1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III. These forms shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol. If they are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through. \n\n\n3.The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR 1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR 1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n4.A movement certificate EUR 1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of an EU Member State or of an EAC Partner State if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the EU or in an EAC Partner State or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4 and 5 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n5.The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions. \n\n\n6.The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR 1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate. \n\n\n7.A movement certificate EUR 1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured. \n\n\nARTICLE 19\n\n\n\n\nMovement certificates EUR 1 issued retrospectively\n\n\n1.Notwithstanding Article 18(7), a movement certificate EUR 1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if: \n\n\n(a)it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or \n\n\n(b)it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR 1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons. \n\n\n2.For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR 1 relates, and state the reasons for his request. \n\n\n3.The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR 1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file. \n\n\n4.Movement certificates EUR 1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with the following phrase in English: \n\n\n\"ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY\"\n\n\n5.The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the movement certificate EUR 1. \n\n\nARTICLE 20\n\n\nIssue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR 1\n\n\n1.In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR 1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession. \n\n\n2.The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in English: \n\n\n\"DUPLICATE\"\n\n\n3.The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR 1. \n\n\n4.The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR 1, shall take effect as from that date. \n\n\nARTICLE 21\n\n\nIssue of movement certificates EUR 1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously\n\n\nWhen originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in an EAC Partner State or in the EU, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR 1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the EAC Partner States or within the EU. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR 1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed and endorsed by the customs authority under whose control the products are placed. \n\n\nARTICLE 22\n\n\n\n\nConditions for making out an origin declaration\n\n\n1.An origin declaration as referred to in Article 17(1)(b) may be made out: \n\n\n(a)by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23, or \n\n\n(b)by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed EUR 6 000. \n\n\n2.An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in an EAC Partner State or in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4 and 5 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n3.The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n4.An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV to this Protocol, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters. \n\n\n5.Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him. \n\n\n6.An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates. \n\n\nARTICLE 23\n\n\nApproved exporter\n\n\n1.The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter who makes frequent shipments of products under the trade cooperation provisions of this Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n2.The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate. \n\n\n3.The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration. \n\n\n4.The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter. \n\n\n5.The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, does not fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorization. \n\n\nARTICLE 24\n\n\nValidity of proof of origin\n\n\n1.A proof of origin shall be valid for ten (10) months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country. \n\n\n2.Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. \n\n\n\n\n3.In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date. \n\n\nARTICLE 25\n\n\nSubmission of proof of origin\n\n\nProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.\n\n\nARTICLE 26\n\n\nImportation by instalments\n\n\nWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule\u00a02(a) for the interpretation of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\n\n\nARTICLE 27\n\n\nExemptions from proof of origin\n\n\n1.Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.\n\n\n2.Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\n\n\n3.Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\n\n\nARTICLE 28\n\n\nInformation procedure for cumulation purposes\n\n\n1.When Articles 4(1) and 5(1) are applied, the evidence of originating status within the meaning of this Protocol of the materials coming from an EAC Partner State, from the EU, from another ACP State or from an OCT shall be given by a movement certificate EUR 1 or by the supplier's declaration, a specimen of which appears in Annex V (A) to this Protocol, given by the exporter in the State, OCT or in the EU from which the materials came. \n\n\n2.When Articles 4(2) and 5(2) are applied, the evidence of the working or processing carried out in an EAC Partner State, in the EU, in another ACP State or in an OCT shall be given by the supplier's declaration a specimen of which appears in Annex V (B) to this Protocol, given by the exporter in the State, OCT or in the EU from which the materials came. \n\n\n3.When Article 6(1) is applied, the documentary proofs of origin applicable shall be determined in accordance with the rules which apply to GSP countries and which are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93\n9\n of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code.\n\n\n4.When Article 6(2) is applied, the documentary proofs of origin applicable shall be determined in accordance with the rules laid down in the relevant arrangements or agreements. \n\n\n5.A separate supplier's declaration shall be made up by the supplier for each consignment of goods on the commercial invoice related to that shipment or in an annex to that invoice, or on a delivery note or other commercial document related to that shipment which describes the materials concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.\n\n\n6.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5 and when Article 4 is applied, when an EAC supplier regularly supplies a particular EAC Partner States customer with goods whose status in respect of the rules of preferential origin is expected to remain constant for considerable periods of time, he may provide a single declaration to cover subsequent shipments of those goods, hereinafter referred to as \u201ca Long Term Supplier\u2019s Declaration\u201d. A Long Term Supplier\u2019s Declaration may be issued for a period of up to one (1) year from the date of issue of the Declaration. The supplier shall inform the buyer immediately when the long-term supplier\u2019s declaration is no longer valid in relation to the goods supplied.\n\n\n\n\n7.When paragraph 6 is applied the evidence of originating status within the meaning of this Protocol of the materials coming from an EAC Partner State shall be given by the long term supplier\u2019s declaration, a specimen of which appears in Annex V(C). The evidence of the working or processing carried in an EAC Partner State shall be given by the long term supplier\u2019s declaration, a specimen of which appears in Annex V(D). \n\n\n8.The supplier's declaration or the Long Term Supplier\u2019s Declaration as referred to in paragraph 6 may be made out on a pre-printed form. \n\n\n9.The suppliers' declarations or the Long Term Supplier\u2019s Declaration as referred to in paragraph 6 shall bear the original signature of the supplier in manuscript. However, where the origin and the supplier's declaration are established using electronic dataprocessing methods, the supplier's declaration need not be signed in manuscript provided the responsible official in the supplying company is identified to the satisfaction of the customs authorities in the State where the suppliers' declarations are established. The said customs authorities may lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph. \n\n\n10.The supplier's declarations or the Long Term Supplier\u2019s Declaration as referred to in paragraph 6 shall be submitted to the customs authorities in the exporting country requested to issue the movement certificate EUR 1. \n\n\n11.The supplier or long term supplier making out a declaration must be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the country where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on this declaration is correct.\n\n\nARTICLE 29\n\n\nSupporting documents\n\n\nThe documents referred to in Articles 18(3) and 22(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR 1 or an origin declaration can be considered as products originating in an EAC Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6(2) and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist inter alia of the following: \n\n\n(a)direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping; \n\n\n(b)documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in an EAC\u00a0Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6(2) where these documents are used in accordance with national law; \n\n\n(c)documents proving the working or processing of materials in an EAC Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4 and 5, issued or made out in an EAC Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4 and 5 where these documents are used in accordance with national law; \n\n\n(d)movement certificates EUR 1 or origin declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in an EAC Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6(2) and in accordance with this Protocol. \n\n\nARTICLE 30\n\n\nPreservation of proof of origin and supporting documents\n\n\n1.The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR 1 shall keep the documents referred to in Article 18(3), for five (5) years in EAC Partner States and at least three (3) years in the EU. \n\n\n2.The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep for at least three (3) years a copy of this origin declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 22(3). \n\n\n3.The supplier making out a supplier's declaration shall keep copies of the declaration and of the invoice, delivery notes or other commercial document to which this declaration is annexed as well as the documents referred to in Article 29 for five (5) years in EAC Partners States and at least three (3) years in the EU.\n\n\n4.The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR 1 shall keep the application form referred to in Article 18(2) for five (5) years in EAC Partner States and at least three (3) years in the EU. \n\n\n5.The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep the movement certificates EUR 1 and the origin declarations submitted to them for five (5) years in EAC Partner States and at least three (3) years in the EU. \n\n\nARTICLE 31\n\n\n\n\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n\n\n1.The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. \n\n\n2.Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. \n\n\nARTICLE 32\n\n\nAmounts expressed in euro for goods referred to in Articles 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3)\n\n\n1.For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of an EAC\u00a0Partner State, of the Member States of the European Union and of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually according to paragraphs 2 to 4. The fixed exchange rate shall not be applicable for tax purposes.\n\n\n2.A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.\n\n\n3.The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n\n\n4.A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n\n\n5.The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Committee at the request of the EU or of the EAC Partner States. When carrying out this review, the Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.\n\n\nTITLE V\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\n\n\nARTICLE 33\n\n\nAdministrative conditions for products to benefit from this Agreement\n\n\n1.Products originating within the meaning of this Protocol in the EAC Partner States or in the EU shall benefit, at the time of the customs import declaration, from the preferences resulting from this Agreement only on condition that they were exported on or after the date on which the exporting country complies with the provisions laid down in paragraph 2.\n\n\n2.The Parties shall undertake to put in place:\n\n\n(a)the necessary national and regional arrangements required for the implementation and enforcement of the rules and procedures laid down in this Protocol, including where appropriate the arrangements necessary for the application of Articles 4, 5 and 6;\n\n\n(b)the administrative structures and systems necessary for an appropriate management and control of the origin of products and compliance with the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.\n\n\n3.The Parties shall make the notifications referred to in Article 34.\n\n\nARTICLE 34\n\n\n\n\nNotification of customs authorities\n\n\n1.The EAC Partner States and the Member States of the European Union shall provide each other, through the EAC Secretariat and the European Commission, with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for issuing and verifying of movement certificates EUR 1 and origin declarations or supplier's declarations, and with specimen impressions of the stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of these certificates.\n\n\nMovement certificates EUR 1 and origin declarations or supplier's declarations shall be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment from the date the information is received by the EAC Secretariat and the European Commission.\n\n\n2.The EAC Partner States and the Member States of the European Union shall inform each other immediately whenever there are any changes to the information referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n3.The authorities referred to in paragraph 1 shall act under the authority of the government of the country concerned. The authorities in charge of control and verification shall be part of the governmental authorities of the country concerned.\n\n\nARTICLE 35\n\n\nMethods of administrative cooperation \n\n\n1.In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the EU, the EAC Partner States and the other countries and territories referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR\u00a01, the origin declarations or the supplier's declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents. \n\n\n2.The authorities consulted shall furnish the relevant information concerning the conditions under which the product has been made, indicating especially the conditions in which the rules of origin have been respected in the various EAC Partner States, in the EU and the other countries and territories referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6 concerned. \n\n\nARTICLE 36\n\n\nVerification of proofs of origin\n\n\n1.Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out based on risk analysis and at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. \n\n\n2.For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR 1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification. \n\n\n3.The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's or manufacturer's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. \n\n\n4.If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. \n\n\n5.The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in an EAC\u00a0Partner State, in the EU or in one of the other countries and territories referred to in Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.\n\n\n6.If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten (10) months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.\n\n\n7.The parties will refer to Article 7 of Protocol II on Mutual Administrative Assistance in customs matters for joint enquiries related to proofs of origin. \n\n\nARTICLE 37\n\n\nVerification of suppliers' declarations\n\n\n\n\n1.Verification of suppliers' declarations shall be carried out based on risk analysis and at random or whenever the customs authorities of the country where such declarations have been taken into account to issue a movement certificate EUR 1 or to make out an origin declaration, have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the correctness of the information given in this document. \n\n\n2.The customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made to issue an information certificate, a specimen of which appears in Annex VI to this Protocol. Alternatively, the certifying authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the exporter to produce an information certificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made. \n\n\nA copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for five (5) years in the case of EAC Partner States and at least three (3) years in the case of EU.\n\n\n3.The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof within ten (10) months. The results must indicate clearly whether the information given in the supplier's declaration is correct and make it possible for them to determine whether and to what extent this supplier's declaration could be taken into account for issuing a movement certificate EUR 1 or for making out an origin declaration. \n\n\n4.The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the country where the supplier's declaration was made out. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence or to carry out any inspection of the supplier's account or any other check which they consider appropriate in order to verify the correctness of any supplier's declaration. \n\n\n5.Any movement certificate EUR 1 or origin declaration issued or made out on the basis of an incorrect supplier's declaration shall be considered null and void. \n\n\nARTICLE 38\n\n\nDispute settlement\n\n\nWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Articles 36 and 37 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Committee. \n\n\nIn all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall take place under the legislation of that country. \n\n\nARTICLE 39\n\n\nPenalties\n\n\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products. \n\n\nARTICLE 40\n\n\nDerogations\n\n\n1.Derogations from this Protocol may be adopted by the Committee, where the development of existing industries or the creation of new industries in the EAC Partner States justify them.\n\n\nAn EAC Partner State or States concerned shall, either before or when submitting the matter to the Committee, notify the EU of its request for derogation together with the reasons for the request in accordance with paragraph 2.\n\n\nThe EU shall respond positively to all the EAC Partner States' requests which are duly justified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established EU industry.\n\n\n2.In order to facilitate the examination by the Committee of request for derogation, the EAC Partner State or States making the request shall, by means of the form given in Annex VII to this Protocol, furnish in support of its request the fullest possible information covering in particular the points listed below:\n\n\n(a)description of the finished product;\n\n\n\n\n(b)nature and quantity of materials originating in a third country;\n\n\n(c)nature and quantity of materials originating in the EAC Partner States or the countries or territories referred to in Articles 4 and 5 or the materials which have been processed there;\n\n\n(d)manufacturing processes;\n\n\n(e)value added;\n\n\n(f)number of employees in the enterprise concerned;\n\n\n(g)anticipated volume of exports to the EU;\n\n\n(h)other possible sources of supply for raw materials;\n\n\n(i)reasons for the duration requested in the light of efforts made to find new sources of supply;\n\n\n(j)other observations.\n\n\nThe same rules shall apply to any requests for extension.\n\n\nThe Committee may modify the form.\n\n\n3.The examination of requests shall in particular take into account:\n\n\n(a)the level of development or the geographical situation of the EAC Partner State or States concerned;\n\n\n(b)cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of an existing industry in an EAC Partner State to continue its exports to the EU, with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;\n\n\n(c)specific cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that significant investment in an industry could be deterred by the rules of origin and where a derogation favouring the realization of the investment program would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages.\n\n\n4.In every case an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation of origin do not provide a solution to the problem.\n\n\n5.In the examination of requests, special account shall be taken, case by case, of the possibility of conferring originating status on products which include in their composition materials originating in neighbouring developing countries, least-developed countries or developing countries with which one or more EAC Partner States have special relations, provided that satisfactory administrative cooperation can be established.\n\n\n6.Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 5, the derogation shall be granted provided that the derogation is not such as to cause serious injury to an economic sector of the EU or of one or more Member States.\n\n\n7.Without prejudice to and in addition to paragraphs 1 to 6, derogations concerning tuna loins of heading\u00a01604 made from non-originating tuna of headings 0302 or 0303 shall be granted within an annual quota of 5,000 tonnes. Applications for such derogations shall be submitted by the EAC Partner\u00a0States in accordance with the abovementioned quota to the Committee, which shall grant them automatically and put them into force by means of a decision.\n\n\n8.The Committee shall take steps necessary to ensure that a decision is reached as soon as possible and in any case not later than seventy-five (75) working days after the request is received by the EU Co-chairman of the Committee. If the EU does not inform an EAC Partner State of its position on the request within this period, the request shall be deemed to have been accepted. \n\n\n\n\n9.(a)The derogation shall be valid for a period, generally of five (5) years, to be determined by the Committee.\n\n\n(b)The derogation decision may provide for renewals without a new decision of the Committee being necessary, provided that the EAC Partner State concerned submits, three (3) months before the end of each period, a proof that it is still unable to meet the conditions of this Protocol which have been derogated from.\n\n\nIf any objection is made to the extension, the Committee shall examine it as soon as possible and decide whether to prolong the derogation. The Committee shall proceed as provided for in paragraph 8. All necessary measures shall be taken to avoid interruptions in the application of the derogation.\n\n\n(c)In the periods referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Committee may review the terms for implementing the derogation should a significant change be found to have taken place in the substantive factors governing the decision to grant the derogation. On conclusion of its review the Committee may decide to amend the terms of its decision as regards the scope of derogation or any other condition previously laid down.\n\n\nTITLE VI\n\n\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\n\n\nARTICLE 41\n\n\nSpecial conditions\n\n\n1.The term \"EU\" used in this Protocol does not cover Ceuta and Melilla. The term \"products originating in the EU\" does not cover products originating in Ceuta and Melilla. \n\n\n2.The provisions of this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis in determining whether products may be deemed as originating in an EAC Partner State when imported into Ceuta and Melilla. \n\n\n3.Where products wholly obtained in Ceuta, Melilla or in the EU undergo working and processing in an EAC Partner State, they shall be considered as having been wholly obtained in an EAC Partner State. \n\n\n4.Working or processing carried out in Ceuta, Melilla or in the EU shall be considered as having been carried out in an EAC Partner State, when materials undergo further working or processing in an EAC Partner State. \n\n\n5.For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 3 and 4, the insufficient operations listed in Article 9 of this Protocol shall not be considered as working or processing. \n\n\n6.Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory. \n\n\nTITLE VII\n\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nARTICLE 42\n\n\nRevision and application of rules of origin\n\n\n1.In accordance with Articles 9 and 142 of this Agreement, this Protocol including its Annexes shall be reviewed every five (5) years after entry into force of this Agreement, or whenever the EAC Partner States or the EU so request, with a view to making any necessary amendments or adaptations, in particular having regard to the principle that wherever possible and upon agreement by both Parties, for each product specific rule of Annex II the same rule of origin applies to the exports of both Parties. In such review, the Parties shall also take into account the development needs of the EAC Partner States such as development of technologies, production processes and all other factors.\u00a0\n\n\nThe decisions taken shall be implemented as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n2.In accordance with Article 29 of this Agreement, the Committee shall, inter alia:\n\n\n(a)take decisions on cumulation under the conditions laid down in Article 6;\n\n\n(b)take decisions on derogations from this Protocol, under the conditions laid down in Article 40.\n\n\n(c)recommend amendments of this Protocol to the EPA Council.\n\n\nARTICLE 43\n\n\nAmendment of the Protocol\n\n\nThe EPA Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.\n\n\nARTICLE 44\n\n\nAnnexes\n\n\nThe Annexes to this Protocol shall form an integral part thereof. \n\n\nARTICLE 45\n\n\nImplementation of the Protocol\n\n\nThe EU and the EAC Partner States shall each take the steps necessary to implement this Protocol.\n\n\nANNEX I\n\n\nProtocol 1\n\n\nIntroductory notes to the list in Annex II\n\n\nNote 1:\n\n\nThe list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 8 of the Protocol.\n\n\nNote 2:\n\n\n1.The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n\n\n\n\n2.Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column\u00a02 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns\u00a03 or 4 and 5 or 6 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column\u00a01.\n\n\n3.Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 and 5 or 6.\n\n\n4.Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns\u00a03 or 4 and 5 or 6, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column\u00a03 or that set out in column\u00a04 or the rule set out in column 5 or that set out in column 6. If no origin rule is given in column\u00a04 or 6, the rule set out in column\u00a03or 5 has to be applied.\n\n\nNote 3:\n\n\n1.The provisions of Article 8 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the European Union or in the EAC Partner States.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nAn engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the nonoriginating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40\u00a0per cent of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading No ex 7224.\n\n\nIf this forging has been forged in the EU from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the nonoriginating materials used.\n\n\n2.The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n\n\n3.Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No \u2026\" means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column\u00a02 of the list may be used.\n\n\n4.When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nThe rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.\n\n\n5.Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nThe rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\n\n\nHowever, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIn the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter\u00a062 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2013\u00a0even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2013 that is the fibre stage.\n\n\n6.Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of nonoriginating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.\n\n\n\n\nNote 4:\n\n\n1.The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.\n\n\n2.The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos\u00a05002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos\u00a05101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos\u00a05201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos\u00a05301 to 5305.\n\n\n3.The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters\u00a050 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n\n\n4.The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos\u00a05501 to 5507.\n\n\nNote 5:\n\n\n1.Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).\n\n\n2.However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\n\n\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n\n\n\u2013silk,\n\n\n\u2013wool,\n\n\n\u2013coarse animal hair,\n\n\n\u2013fine animal hair,\n\n\n\u2013horsehair,\n\n\n\u2013cotton,\n\n\n\u2013paper-making materials and paper,\n\n\n\u2013flax,\n\n\n\u2013true hemp,\n\n\n\u2013jute and other textile bast fibres,\n\n\n\u2013sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,\n\n\n\n\n\u2013coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made filaments,\n\n\n\u2013artificial man-made filaments,\n\n\n\u2013current conducting filaments,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,\n\n\n\u2013synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,\n\n\n\u2013other synthetic man-made staple fibres,\n\n\n\u2013artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,\n\n\n\u2013other artificial man-made staple fibres,\n\n\n\u2013yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,\n\n\n\u2013yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,\n\n\n\u2013products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,\n\n\n\u2013other products of heading No 5605.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nA yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, nonoriginating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nA woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nTufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No\u00a05205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No\u00a05205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.\n\n\n3.In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.\n\n\n4.In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.\n\n\nNote 6:\n\n\n1.In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10\u00a0% of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.\n\n\nTextile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.\n\n\n2.Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.\n\n\n3.In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.\n\n\nFor example\n10\n, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.\n\n\n4.Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\n\n\nNote 7:\n\n\n1.For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex\u00a03403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:\n\n\n(a)vacuum distillation;\n\n\n(b)redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process\n11\n;\n\n\n\n\n(c)cracking;\n\n\n(d)reforming;\n\n\n(e)extraction by means of selective solvents;\n\n\n(f)the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n\n\n(g)polymerization;\n\n\n(h)alkylation;\n\n\n(i)isomerization.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:\n\n\n(a)vacuum distillation;\n\n\n(b)redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process\n12\n; \n\n\n(c)cracking;\n\n\n(d)reforming;\n\n\n(e)extraction by means of selective solvents;\n\n\n(f)the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolourization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n\n\n(g)polymerization;\n\n\n(h)alkylation;\n\n\n(i)isomerization;\n\n\n(j)in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n\n\n(k)in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n\n\n(l)in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250\u00b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex\u00a02710 (e.g.\u00a0hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n\n\n\n\n(m)in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No\u00a0ex\u00a02710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300\u00b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;\n\n\n(n)in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No\u00a0ex\u00a02710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brushdischarge.\n\n\n3.For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex\u00a03403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.\n\n\nNote 8\n\n\nGeneral Provisions concerning certain agricultural goods\n\n\n1.All goods falling agricultural goods within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in the territory of the beneficiary country shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.\n\n\n2.In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non \u2013originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for calculation of such limitations.\n\n\nANNEX II\n\n\nLIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUS\n\n\nThe products mentioned in the list may not all be covered by this Agreement.

Nor shall it cover information obtained under powers exercised at the request of a judicial authority, except where communication of such information has the prior authorisation of that authority.\n\n\n3.Assistance in recovery proceedings regarding duties, taxes or fines is not covered by this Protocol.\n\n\nARTICLE 3\n\n\n\n\nAssistance on Request\n\n\n1.At the request of the Applicant Authority, the Requested Authority shall provide it with all relevant information which may enable it to ensure that customs legislation is correctly applied, including information regarding activities noted or planned which are or could be operations in breach of customs legislation.\n\n\n2.At the request of the Applicant Authority, the Requested Authority shall inform it:\n\n\n(a)whether goods exported from the territory of a Party have been lawfully imported into the territory of the other Party, specifying, where appropriate, the customs procedure applied to the goods;\n\n\n(b)whether goods imported into the territory of a Party have been lawfully exported from the territory of the other Party, specifying, where appropriate, the customs procedure applied to the goods.\n\n\n3.At the request of the Applicant Authority, the Requested Authority shall, within the framework of its legal or regulatory provisions, take the necessary steps to ensure special surveillance of:\n\n\n(a)natural or legal persons in respect of whom there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are or have been involved in operations in breach of customs legislation;\n\n\n(b)places where stocks of goods have been or may be assembled in such a way that there are reasonable grounds for believing that these goods are intended to be used in operations in breach of customs legislation;\n\n\n(c)goods that are or may be transported in such a way that there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are intended to be used in operations in breach of customs legislation; and\n\n\n(d)means of transport that are or may be used in such a way that there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are intended to be used in operations in breach of customs legislation.\n\n\nARTICLE 4\n\n\nSpontaneous assistance\n\n\nThe Parties shall assist each other, at their own initiative and in accordance with their legal or regulatory provisions, if they consider that to be necessary for the correct application of customs legislation, particularly by providing information obtained pertaining to:\n\n\n(a)operations which are or appear to be in breach of customs legislation and which may be of interest to the other Party;\n\n\n(b)new means or methods employed in carrying out operations in breach of customs legislation;\n\n\n(c)goods known to be subject to operations in breach of customs legislation;\n\n\n(d)natural or legal persons in respect of whom there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are or have been involved in operations in breach of customs legislation; and\n\n\n(e)means of transport in respect of which there are reasonable grounds for believing that they have been, are, or may be used in operations in breach of customs legislation.\n\n\nARTICLE 5\n\n\nDelivery and notification\n\n\n\n\n1.At the request of the Applicant Authority, the Requested Authority shall, in accordance with legal or regulatory provisions applicable to the latter, take all necessary measures in order:\n\n\n(a)to deliver any documents emanating from the Applicant Authority and falling within the scope of this Protocol, to an addressee residing or established in the territory of the Requested Authority, and, where appropriate;\n\n\n(b)to notify any decisions emanating from the Applicant Authority and falling within the scope of this Protocol, to an addressee residing or established in the territory of the Requested Authority.\n\n\n2.Requests for delivery of documents or notification of decisions shall be made in writing in an official language of the Requested Authority or in a language acceptable to that authority.\n\n\nARTICLE 6\n\n\nForm and substance of requests for assistance\n\n\n1.Requests pursuant to this Protocol shall be made in writing. They shall be accompanied by the documents necessary to enable compliance with the request. When required because of the urgency of the situation, oral requests may be accepted, but must be confirmed in writing immediately. Requests may also be communicated in electronic form.\n\n\n2.Requests pursuant to paragraph 1 shall include the following information:\n\n\n(a)the name of the Applicant Authority;\n\n\n(b)the measure requested;\n\n\n(c)the object of and the reason for the request;\n\n\n(d)the legal or regulatory provisions and other legal elements involved;\n\n\n(e)indications as exact and comprehensive as possible on the natural or legal persons who are the target of the investigations; and\n\n\n(f)a summary of the relevant facts and of the enquiries already carried out.\n\n\n3.Requests shall be submitted in an official language of the Requested Authority or in a language acceptable to that authority. This requirement shall not apply to any documents that accompany the request under paragraph 1.\n\n\n4.If a request does not meet the formal requirements set out above, its correction or completion may be requested; in the meantime precautionary measures may be ordered.\n\n\nARTICLE 7\n\n\nExecution of requests\n\n\n1.In order to comply with a request for assistance, the Requested Authority shall proceed, within the limits of its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out. This provision shall also apply to any other authority to which the request has been addressed by the Requested Authority when the latter cannot act on its own.\n\n\n2.Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the legal or regulatory provisions of the requested Party.\n\n\n\n\n3.Duly authorised officials of a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party involved and subject to the conditions laid down by the latter:\n\n\n(a)be present to obtain in the offices of the Requested Authority or any other concerned authority in accordance with paragraph 1, information relating to activities that are or may be operations in breach of customs legislation which the Applicant Authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol;\n\n\n(b)be present at enquiries carried out in the latter's territory.\n\n\nARTICLE 8\n\n\nForm in which information is to be communicated\n\n\n1.The Requested Authority shall communicate results of enquiries to the Applicant Authority in writing together with relevant documents, certified copies or other items.\n\n\n2.If requested, the information provided for in paragraph 1 may be in electronic form.\n\n\n3.Original documents shall be transmitted only upon request in cases where certified copies would be insufficient. These originals shall be returned at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\nARTICLE 9\n\n\nExceptions to the obligation to provide assistance\n\n\n1.Assistance may be refused or may be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions or requirements, in cases where a Party concerned is of the opinion that assistance under this Protocol would:\n\n\n(a)be likely to prejudice the sovereignty of an EAC Partner State or that of a Member State of the European Union which has been requested to provide assistance under this Protocol; or\n\n\n(b)be likely to prejudice public policy, security or other essential interests, in particular in the cases referred to under Article 10(2); or\n\n\n(c)violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.\n\n\n2.Assistance may be postponed by the Requested Authority on the ground that it will interfere with an ongoing investigation, prosecution or proceeding. In such a case, the Requested Authority shall consult with the Applicant Authority to determine if assistance can be given subject to such terms or conditions as the Requested Authority may require.\n\n\n3.Where the Applicant Authority seeks assistance which it would itself be unable to provide if so requested, it shall draw attention to that fact in its request. It shall then be for the Requested Authority to decide how to respond to such a request.\n\n\n4.For the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the decision of the Requested Authority and the reasons must be communicated to the Applicant Authority without delay.\n\n\nARTICLE 10\n\n\nInformation exchange and confidentiality\n\n\n1.Any information communicated in whatsoever form pursuant to this Protocol shall be of a confidential or restricted nature, depending on the rules applicable in each of the Parties. Such information shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to similar information under the relevant laws of the Party that received it, and in the case of the EU the corresponding provisions applying to the authorities of the European Union\n106\n. \n\n\n\n\n2.Personal data may be exchanged only where the Party which may receive them agrees to ensure an adequate level of protection of such data in at least an equivalent way to the one applicable to that particular case in the Party that may supply them. To that end, the Parties shall communicate to each other information on their applicable rules and legal provisions.\n\n\n3.The use, in judicial or administrative proceedings instituted in respect of operations in breach of customs legislation, of information obtained under this Protocol, is considered to be for the purposes of this Protocol. Therefore, the Parties may, in their records of evidence, reports and testimonies and in proceedings and charges brought before the courts, use as evidence information obtained and documents consulted in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol. The competent authority which supplied that information or gave access to those documents shall be notified of such use.\n\n\n4.Information obtained shall be used solely for the purposes of this Protocol. Where one of the Parties wishes to use such information for other purposes, it shall obtain the prior written consent of the authority which provided the information.
