These d\u00e9marches consisted inter alia of actions providing reasons of these d\u00e9marches, its actions, opportunity for the countries to respond and refute, right to ask for and provide additional information, proposed actions plans to remedy the situation as well as adequate time to answer and reasonable time to remedy the situation. \n\n\nOn 14 October 2014 the Commission, by Commission Implementing Decision, identified the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter Sri Lanka) as a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to the IUU Regulation.\n\n\nOn 26 January 2015 the Council, by Council Implementing Decision, amended the existing list of non-cooperating third countries, by including Sri Lanka, in fighting IUU fishing. \n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council Implementing Decision is based on the findings which have confirmed that Sri Lanka has\u00a0demonstrated that the situation that warranted its listing has been rectified and that Sri Lanka has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the situation. \n\n\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Decision.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe pre-identification by the Commission of Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating country in Commission Decision of 15 November 2012 (OJ C 354 17.11.2012, p.1-47) on notifying the third countries that the Commission considers as possible of being identified as non-cooperating countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\nThe identification by the Commission of Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating country in Commission Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014 (OJ L 297 15.10.2014, p. 13-22) on identifying a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\nThe Council placing Sri Lanka on the list of non-cooperating countries in Council Implementing Decision of 26 January 2015 (OJ L 33 10.2.2015, p. 15-18) amending Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU establishing a list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as regards Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 on establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle does therefore not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\nThe form of action is described in the IUU Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\n\n\nIndication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instruments: decision.\n\n\nOther means would not be adequate because the IUU Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nInterested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interest during the investigation and dialogue procedures, in line with the provisions of the IUU Regulation. \n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThis proposal is a result of the implementation of the IUU Regulation.\n\n\nThe IUU Regulation does not contain provisions for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that must be assessed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the Union budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nNot applicable as proposal enters into force the day after its publication. \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal amends the list established by the Council of non-cooperating third countries in the fight against IUU as set out in the Annex to Council Decision 2014/170/EU.\n\n\n\n2016/0117 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999\n2\n, and in particular Article 34(1) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (the IUU Regulation) establishes a Union system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\n\n(2)Chapter VI of the IUU Regulation lays down the procedure with respect to the identification of non-cooperating third countries, d\u00e9marches in respect of countries identified as non-cooperating third countries, the establishment of a list of non-cooperating countries, removal from the list of non-cooperating countries, publicity of the list of non-cooperating countries and any emergency measures.\n\n\n(3)In accordance with Article 32 of the IUU Regulation, the  European Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) notified by  Decision of 15 November 2012\n3\n (\"Decision of 15 November 2012\") eight third countries of the possibility of their being identified as third countries that it considers as non-cooperating third countries. Among these countries there was the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter Sri Lanka).\n\n\n(4)In the Decision of 15 November 2012 the Commission included the information concerning the essential facts and considerations underlying such possible identification. \n\n\n(5)Also on 15 November 2012 the Commission notified the eight third countries, among which there was Sri Lanka, with separate letters of the fact that it was considering the possibility of identifying them as non-cooperating third countries. \n\n\n(6)By Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014\n4\n (\"Commission Implementing Decision of\u00a014 October 2014\"), the Commission identified Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating third country in fighting IUU fishing. In accordance with the IUU Regulation, the Commission provided the reasons for which it considered that this country failed to discharge its duties under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State to take action, to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU\u00a0fishing.\n\n\n(7)In accordance with Article 33 of the IUU Regulation, the Council, by Implementing Decision 2015/200 of 26 January 2015\n5\n, (\"Council Implementing Decision of 26 January 2015\") amended, by adding Sri Lanka, the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing in accordance with the IUU Regulation.\n\n\n(8)Following  the amendment of the Council Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014 of the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing, the Commission offered to Sri Lanka the opportunity to continue the dialogue  in line with the substantive and procedural requirements laid out in the IUU Regulation. The Commission continued to seek and verify all information deemed necessary, including oral and writen comments, aiming at giving any identified country the opportunity to rectify the situation that warrented its listing, and to take concrete measures capable of remedying the identified failures. This process resulted in the acknowledgement that Sri Lanka has rectified the situation and taken remedial action.\n\n\n(9)Pursuant to Article 34 (1) of the IUU Regulation the Council should therefore amend the Implementing Decision of 24 March 2014 by removing Sri Lanka from the list of noncooperating third countries.\n\n\n(10)Upon the adoption of this Council Implementing Decision removing Sri Lanka from the list of non-cooperating third countries in accordance with Article 34(1) of the IUU Regulation, the Commission Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014 identifying Sri Lanka as a non-cooperating third country is without object.\n\n\nREMOVAL OF SRI LANKA FROM THE LIST OF NON-COOPERATING THIRD COUNTRIES\n\n\n(11)Following  the adoption of the Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014 and the Council Implementing Decision 2015/200 of 26 January 2015 the Commission continued the dialogue with Sri Lanka. In particular, Sri Lanka appears to have implemented the international law obligations and adopted an adequate legal framework for fighting against IUU fishing; it has introduced an adequate and efficient monitoring, control and inspection scheme by introducing logbooks to record catch data, plus radio call signs for fishing vessels and equipping the entire high seas fleet with Vessel Monitoring System (VMS); it has created a deterrent sanctioning system, revised its fisheries legal framework and assured for the proper implementation of the catch certification scheme. Sri Lanka has furthermore continuously improved its compliance with its international obligations, including those stemming from Regional Fisheries Management Organisations' (RFMOs) recommendations and resolutions such as Port State Control measures and transposition of RFMO rules into Sri Lankan law and has adopted its own National Plan Of Action against IUU, in line with the International Plan of Action against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing of the United Nations (IPOA-UN).\n\n\n(12)The Commission reviewed the current compliance of Sri Lanka with its international obligations as flag, port, coastal or market State in line with the findings in the Decision of 15 November 2012, Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014 and Council Implementing Decision of 26 January 2015 and with relevant information provided thereon by Sri Lanka.  It also considered the measures taken to rectify the situation as well as the guarantees provided by the competent authorities of Sri Lanka. \n\n\n(13)The Commission concluded, on the basis of all of the above, that with the actions undertaken Sri Lanka no longer fails to discharge its duties incumbent upon it under international law as flag State in particular in the light of the provisions of Articles\u00a094,\u00a0117 and\u00a0118\u00a0of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and\u00a0Articles 18, 19,\u00a020\u00a0and 23\u00a0of United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). The\u00a0Commission therefore concluded that the elements put forward by Sri Lanka demonstrate that the situation that warranted the listing of Sri Lanka has been rectified and that Sri Lanka has taken concrete measures capable of achieving a lasting improvement of the situation. \n\n\n(14)In the light of all the above mentioned circumstances and pursuant to Article 34(1) of the IUU Regulation, the Council concludes that Sri Lanka should be removed from the list of non-cooperating countries. \n\n\n(15)The decision taken by the Council does not preclude any subsequent step taken by the Commission or the Council in the future, in line with Chapter VI of the IUU Regulation, in case factual elements were to reveal that Sri Lanka fails to discharge the duties incumbent upon it under international law as flag, port, coastal or market State, to take action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.\n\n\n(16)In the light of the adverse consequences provoked by a listing as non-cooperating third country, it is appropriate to give immediate effect to the delisting of Sri Lanka as non-cooperating third country. \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Annex to Council Decision 2014/170/EU is replaced by the Annex in this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(3)\nCommission Decision of 15 November 2012 on notifying the third countries that the Commission considers as possible of being identified as non-cooperating third countries pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\n\n(OJ C 354, 17.11.2012, p. 1).\n\n\n\n(4)\nCommission Implementing Decision of 14 October 2014 identifying a third country that the Commission considers as a non-cooperating third country pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (OJ L 297, 15.10.2014, p. 13).\n\n\n\n(5)\nCouncil Implementing Decision 2015.200 of 26 January 2015 (OJ L 33, 10.2.2015, p. 15-18) amending Implementing Decision 2014/170/EU establishing a list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 21.4.2016\nCOM(2016) 225 final\nANNEX\n\nList of non-cooperating third countries in fighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing \nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\n\nList of non-cooperating third countries in fighting Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing \n\n\nto the\n\n\nProposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending the list of non-cooperating third countries in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKingdom of Cambodia\n\n\nRepublic of Guinea\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
