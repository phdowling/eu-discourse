"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 4.5.2016\nCOM(2016) 271 final \n2016/0131(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Union Agency for Asylum and repealing Regulation (EU) No 439/2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nOn 6 April 2016, the Commission adopted a Communication entitled \"Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe\",\n1\n in which it set out its priorities for improving the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The Commission announced, in response to calls by the European Council,\n2\n that it would progressively work towards reforming the existing Union framework by establishing a sustainable and fair system for determining the Member States responsible for asylum seekers, by reinforcing the Eurodac system, by achieving greater convergence in the asylum system thereby preventing secondary movements, and by developing an enhanced mandate for the European Asylum Support Office (EASO).\u00a0This proposal is being presented as part of a first package of reform of the CEAS together with two other proposals, namely a proposal to reform the Dublin system and another proposal amending the Eurodac system.\n\n\nThe aim of this proposal is it to strengthen the role of EASO and develop it into an agency which facilitates the implementation and improves the functioning of the CEAS. Since taking up its responsibilities in 2011, EASO has continuously supported Member States to apply the current rules and to improve the functioning of existing tools. The Agency has gained experience and earned credibility for its work as regards practical cooperation among Member States and in supporting them to implement their obligations under the CEAS. In time, the tasks undertaken by EASO progressively evolved so as to meet the growing needs of Member States and of the CEAS as a whole. The Member States increasingly rely on the operational and technical support of the Agency. The Agency increased its knowledge and experience in the field of asylum and it is time to transform it into a centre of expertise in its own right and not one that still significantly relies on information and expertise provided by Member States.\n\n\nIn the Commission's view, the Agency is one of the tools that can be used to effectively address the structural weaknesses in the CEAS which have been further exacerbated by large scale and uncontrolled arrival of migrants and asylum seekers to the European Union particularly during the past year. It would not be plausible to reform the CEAS without providing the Agency with a mandate that corresponds to the demands that the reform will entail. It is essential to equip the Agency with the means necessary to assist Member States in crisis situations, but it is all the more necessary to build a solid legal, operational and practical framework for the Agency to be able to reinforce and complement the asylum and reception systems of Member States. \n\n\nTo reflect this development, the proposal renames EASO as the European Union Agency for Asylum. An enhanced mandate, as set out in this proposal transforms EASO into a fully-fledged Agency which is capable of providing the necessary operational and technical assistance to Member States, increasing practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States, supporting a sustainable and fair distribution of applications for international protection, monitoring and assessing the implementation of the CEAS and the capacity of asylum and reception systems in Member States, and enabling convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection across the Union.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nOn 19 February 2016, the European Council considered that progress must be made towards reforming the EU's existing framework so as to ensure a humane and efficient asylum policy. In its Communication of 6 April 2016, the Commission maintained that the overall objective of Union migration and asylum policy is to move away from a system which by poor design or poor implementation places a disproportionate responsibility on certain Member States and encourages uncontrolled movements towards other Member States. The aim is for the Union to have a robust and effective system for sustainable migration management grounded on the principles of responsibility and solidarity. \n\n\nIn the European Agenda on Migration,\n3\n the Commission had recognised the significance of EASO's role in developing and maintaining a strong common asylum policy. The Commission considered that EASO could step up practical cooperation, develop a role as the clearing house of national country of origin information to encourage more uniform decisions, take key measures as regards training and set up dedicated networks of national authorities to enhance operational cooperation on asylum-related matters. In its Communication of 6 April 2016, the Commission announced that it would be proposing a stronger mandate for EASO so that it can play a new policy-implementing role and a strengthened operational role. This would be achieved by means of a monitoring mechanism to assess compliance with the CEAS and other key tasks such as the provision and analysis of country of origin information, operating the distribution key of the Dublin system and intervening in support of Member States in emergency situations or where the necessary remedial action would not have been taken.\n\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to provide the European Union Agency for Asylum with the necessary tools for it to develop into an agency which facilitates the implementation and improves the functioning of the CEAS. In this respect, it complements the legal and policy instruments in the field of asylum, in particular as regards asylum procedures, standards for the qualification for individuals for international protection, the Dublin system, relocation and resettlement. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with the comprehensive long-term policy on better migration management as set out by the Commission in the European Agenda on Migration, which developed President Juncker's Political Guidelines into a set of coherent and mutually reinforcing initiatives based on four pillars. Those pillars consist of reducing the incentive for irregular migration, securing external borders and saving lives, a strong asylum policy and a new policy on legal migration. This proposal further implements the European Agenda on Migration, more specifically as regards the objective of strengthening the Union's asylum policy since the European Union Agency for Asylum will ensure a full and coherent implementation of the CEAS. \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on Article 78(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\nThe objectives of this proposal are to facilitate the implementation and improve the functioning of the CEAS, to strengthen practical cooperation and information exchange among Member\u00a0States on asylum-related matters, to promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards asylum procedures, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, to monitor the operational and technical application of Union law and standards as regards asylum and to provide increased operational and technical support to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular to Member States subject to disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems. \n\n\nSince it is a common and shared interest to ensure the proper application of the legal framework on asylum, through concerted action among Member States with the support of the European Union Agency for Asylum, so as to consolidate stability and order in the functioning of the CEAS, the objectives of this proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at the level of the Union and the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal is intended to respond to the political realities and challenges faced by the Union in the area of migration and asylum by providing the European Union Agency for Asylum with the necessary tools to address both the disproportionate pressure on Member State's asylum and reception systems, and the inherent weaknesses in these systems for the longer term. \n\n\nThe proposal seeks to ensure that the legislation and operational standards on asylum are fully and correctly applied by Member States, that practical cooperation and information among Member States as well as with third countries is enhanced, that appropriate action is taken to maintain the orderly functioning of the CEAS and to address disproportionate pressure in an effective manner with the assistance of and in cooperation with the Agency. The Agency may assist Member States with the examination of applications for international protection upon the request of the Member States and within a framework set out clearly in the operational plan. The Agency may be required to intervene and provide assistance to a Member State only in those cases where, following up on a monitoring exercise or in case of disproportionate pressure on the asylum and reception systems no action or insufficient measures are taken by the Member State concerned, thereby jeopardizing the functioning of the CEAS. In view of its objective and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nIt is only a regulation that can provide the necessary degree of efficiency and uniformity needed in the application of Union law on asylum. Moreover, having regard to the fact that EASO, renamed European Union Agency for Asylum, was established by means of a regulation, the same legal instrument is also appropriate for this proposal.\n\n\n3.CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES\n\n\nIn preparation of this proposal, the Commission has relied upon discussions that took place regularly in the European Council and the Council of Ministers, as well as the European Parliament, concerning the development of the Union's migration and asylum policy and the use of Union agencies in better migration management. The role of EASO in providing operational and technical support to Member States including at the external borders in cooperation with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, has been invoked on several occasions. Member States have generally considered that EASO has a significant role in assisting them with relocation and resettlement. \n\n\nSince EASO has taken up its responsibilities on 1 February 2011, there have been continued discussions with relevant stakeholders at European and national level. In particular, there have been regular discussions in the context of reporting by the Agency in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Agency continuously reports on its activities at the Management Board meetings and through various reports it issues during the year. There have also been regular information exchanges with other Union agencies in particular the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Several discussions have also been organised with civil society and academia.\n\n\nAn evaluation of EASO was carried out on the basis of Article 46 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0439/2010 which provides for an independent external evaluation which covers EASO's impact on practical cooperation on asylum and on the CEAS. The Commission carried out an internal evaluation of EASO in 2013. In 2014, EASO underwent an external evaluation by an external independent contractor and which covered the period from February 2011 to June 2014. The temporal scope of the external evaluation was subsequently extended to cover the entire period since the Agency took up its responsibilities. The evaluation was conducted between October 2014 and July 2015, and it covered all the activities carried out by EASO across all Member States. This proposal takes into account the recommendations resulting from that evaluation and the views of EASO as regards the future of the Agency.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThis proposal respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. All activities of the European Union Agency for Asylum shall be carried out in full respect of fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter, including the right to asylum (Article 18 of the\u00a0Charter), the protection from refoulement (Article 19 of the Charter), the right to respect for private and family life (Article 7 of the Charter), the right to protection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter) and the right to an effective remedy (Article 47 of the Charter). The proposal fully takes into account the rights of the child and the special needs of vulnerable persons.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe European Union Agency for Asylum, which is to be built on the existing EASO, is tasked with facilitating the implementation and improving the functioning of the CEAS. \n\n\nThe total financial resources necessary to enable the Agency to fulfil its mission under the proposed expanded mandate amount to EUR\u00a0363.963\u00a0million for the period 2017-2020. For the Agency to carry out its new tasks effectively, 275 temporary agent posts and 82 contract agents for a total of 357 staff members over the period 2017-2020 will be needed in addition to the current number of temporary and contractual agent posts authorised under the 2016 budget to bring the staff of the Agency to a total of 500 by 2020. \n\n\nThe financial needs are compatible with the current multiannual financial framework and may entail the use of special instruments as defined in the Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\u00a01311/2013.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe European Union Agency for Asylum must draw up an annual activity report on the situation of asylum, in which it needs to evaluate the results of the activities it carries out throughout the year. The report must contain a comparative analysis of the Agency's activities so that the Agency may improve the quality, consistency and effectiveness of the CEAS. That annual activity report must be transmitted by the Agency to the Management Board, the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\nThe Commission must commission an evaluation within three years of entry into force of this Regulation, and then every five years thereafter, to assess particularly the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency and its working practices. That evaluation must cover the Agency's impact on practical cooperation on asylum-related matters and on the CEAS. The Commission must send the evaluation report together with its conclusions on the report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board. The findings of the evaluation must be made public.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 439/2010 establishes the European Support Asylum Office (EASO) and it defines the role of EASO as being intended to strengthen practical cooperation among Member States and to provide or coordinate the provision of operational support to Member States. EASO could achieve these objectives by enabling information exchange and pooling of best practices, providing support for training and for relocation, coordinating activities related to the country of origin information, providing support as regards the implementation and the external dimension of the CEAS, setting out technical documents on the implementation of Union asylum instruments and by providing operational support to Member States subject to particular pressure.\n\n\nThis proposal builds upon the current mandate of EASO and expands it so as to transform EASO into a fully-fledged Agency equipped with the necessary tools to: (1) enhance practical cooperation and information exchange on asylum; (2) promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniform application of the legal framework on asylum; (3) ensure greater convergence in the assessment of protection needs across the Union; (4) monitor and assess the implementation of the CEAS; (5) provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular in cases of disproportionate pressure. The proposal renames EASO as the European Union Agency for Asylum to reflect the stronger mandate of the Agency.\n\n\n(1)Enhance practical cooperation and information exchange on asylum\n\n\nThis aspect is covered by Chapter 2 of the proposal concerning practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States and with the Agency. The proposal sets out how the Agency will perform its tasks of facilitating, coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States on various aspects of asylum. Those tasks are not entirely new to the Agency since EASO is already responsible for enabling information exchange and facilitating practical cooperation. However, EASO needed to rely on the voluntary provision of information by Member States. With this proposal, the Agency and the Member States will have a duty to cooperate and an obligation to exchange information. \n\n\nTo be a centre of expertise, the Agency will need to build its own capacity of gathering and analysing information on the situation of asylum in the Union and third countries insofar as this may have an impact on the Union, as well as on the implementation of the CEAS. The information analysis on the situation of asylum should enable the Agency to assist Member States in better understanding the factors for asylum-related migration towards and within the Union, as well as for the purpose of early warning and preparedness of Member States. In this respect, the Agency should work closely not only with Member States but also with other relevant Union agencies, the European External Action Service and with international organisations such as UNHCR.\n\n\nIn the context of a reform of the Dublin system, the Agency will have additional tasks and obligations that will derive from that reform. The Agency is the natural choice to provide Member States with the support they need to operate and manage the corrective mechanism.\n\n\nThe Agency will continue to play an important role in developing and providing training to members of national administrations, courts, tribunals and national services responsible for asylum matters in Member States. With greater involvement of the Agency's own staff in providing operational and technical assistance to Member States, the Agency also will need to ensure appropriate training for its own staff. Furthermore, the Agency must ensure that all those experts who participate in the asylum support teams and the asylum intervention pool receive specialist training relevant to their duties and functions prior to their participation in the operational activities.\n\n\n(2)Ensure greater convergence in the assessment of protection needs across the Union\n\n\nIn its conclusions of 21 April 2016 on convergence in asylum decision practices,\n5\n the Council noted that notwithstanding progress on the CEAS, there are still significant disparities between the Member States in the recognition rates, the nature and quality of the international protection granted and generally, in the outcome of procedures. The Council recognised the need to create a more structured and streamlined EASO COI production process that covers all main countries of origin and thematic issues by strengthening the resources available for EASO COI production, and it invited EASO to assist with the EU-level process of policy development on the basis of joint COI.\n\n\nTo ensure greater convergence and address disparities in the assessment of applications for international protection, the proposal gives the Agency the task of coordinating efforts among Member States to engage and develop a common analysis providing guidance on the situation in third countries of origin as set out in Chapter 3 of the proposal. Until now, the Agency has been required to organise, promote and coordinate activities relating to information on countries of origin, including providing an analysis of that information. This is a task that the Agency will continue to perform and it shall also ensure the coordination of national initiatives producing country of origin information by establishing networks on country of origin information. These networks are to be used to exchange and update national reports, as well as a query system whereby specific questions of fact that may arise from applications for international protection could be sent to the Agency.\n\n\nAnother new task for the Agency is to assist the Commission in regularly reviewing the situation in third countries which are included in the common EU list of safe countries of origin. When considering adding another third country to that EU list of safe countries, the Commission could request the Agency to provide it with information on that particular third country. \n\n\n(3)Promote Union law and operational standards on asylum\n\n\nChapter 4 of the proposal deals with operational standards, guidelines and best practices. Under the current mandate of EASO, the Agency could adopt technical documents on the implementation of the asylum instruments. The proposal distinguishes among the various types of technical documents that may be adopted by the Agency. The Agency will, on its own initiative or at the request of the Commission, develop operational standards on the implementation of the instruments of Union law on asylum and indicators for monitoring compliance with those standards. The Agency will also be able to develop guidelines and best practices related to the implementation of the instruments of Union law on asylum. In cases where Member States would require assistance to apply those operational standards, guidelines and best practices they may request the Agency to provide them with the necessary expertise or operational and technical assistance.\n\n\n(4)Monitor and assess the implementation of the CEAS\n\n\nChapter 5 of the proposal provides for a new task of the Agency, which is to monitor and assess all aspects of the CEAS, in particular asylum procedures, the Dublin system, recognition rates and quality and nature of international protection granted, to monitor compliance with the operational standards and guidelines as well as to verify the asylum and reception systems and the capacity of Member State to manage those systems effectively particularly in times when they would face disproportionate pressure. The aim of the monitoring exercise is, on the one hand, to ensure that any shortcomings in the functioning of the CEAS are addressed as early as possible so as to ensure an orderly management of the asylum and reception systems and on the other, it is to ensure that Member States have the necessary tools in place to be able to address situations of disproportionate pressure adequately. \n\n\nArticle 13 establishes the scope of the monitoring and assessment mechanism and Article 14 sets out the procedure for that exercise. The Agency may base its assessment on information provided by Member States, information analysis on the situation of asylum developed by the Agency, on-site visits and case sampling. The monitoring exercise may be programmed by Member State or on the basis of thematic or specific aspects of the asylum systems. The Agency will set up teams of experts, composed of experts from the Agency and the Commission, to carry out the monitoring exercise and draft a report setting out their findings. The Management Board adopts the report after taking into account comments from the Member State concerned and transmits it to the Commission. In parallel, the Executive Director submits draft recommendations to the Member State concerned for its comments, following consultation of the Commission. The draft recommendations should outline the necessary measures to address shortcomings in the monitoring report. The Management Board adopts the recommendations and invites the Member State to submit an action plan for the implementation of those recommendations within a maximum of nine months. \n\n\nArticle 15 deals with those situations where after that period, the Member State concerned is still non-compliant and the seriousness of the shortcomings is such that it jeopardizes the functioning of the CEAS. At that stage, the Commission makes its own assessment of the action plan and the seriousness of the shortcomings. The Commission then adopts recommendations and it may, where necessary, identify measures to be taken by the Agency in support of the Member State concerned. That Member State will need to report to the Commission on the state of implementation of the recommendations. If after a time-limit set in the Commission's recommendations the Member State remains non-compliant, the Commission may take further action requiring the Agency to intervene in support of the Member State.\n\n\n(5)Provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States\n\n\nOne important task of EASO has been to provide technical assistance to Member States in particular in relation to interpreting services, information on countries of origin and knowledge of handling and management of asylum cases by deploying asylum support teams. Member States retained autonomy on the selection of the number and profiles of experts as well as on the duration of their deployment.\n\n\nChapter 6 of the proposal significantly expands the role and functions of the Agency insofar as operational and technical assistance is concerned similarly to what was proposed by the Commission for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n6\n The proposal sets out clearly the operational and technical measures that may be organised and coordinated by the Agency upon the request of Member States. These measures could include also the possibility for the Agency to facilitate the examination of applications for international protection that are under examination by the competent national authorities. In that case detailed arrangements and a clear description of tasks and a reference to applicable legislation would need to be foreseen in the operational plan. \n\n\n\n\nThe Agency will deploy asylum support teams to provide operational and technical assistance to Member States. Those asylum support teams shall be composed of experts from Member States or experts seconded by Member States to the Agency and experts from the Agency's own staff. In cases where the asylum and reception systems are subject to disproportionate pressure that places exceptionally heavy and urgent demands, the Agency will organise and coordinate a comprehensive set of operational and technical measures. This can be done at the request of a Member State or on a proposal from the Agency. In those instances where despite the disproportionate pressure there is no request for assistance, or the offer of the Agency is not accepted or insufficient action is taken by the Member State concerned to the extent of jeopardising the functioning of the CEAS, the Commission may adopt a decision by means of implementing act identifying one or more of the operational and technical measures that the Agency should take to support the Member State concerned. For those purposes, the Agency will set up an asylum intervention pool which will constitute a reserve of not less than 500 experts from the Member States. \n\n\nThe number and profiles of experts in the asylum support teams are decided by the Management Board on a proposal of the Executive Director. Given the increasing number of children and unaccompanied children among the migrants and asylum seekers, it is important that there would be those teams include experts with child protection profiles. The duration of deployment is determined by the home Member State but to ensure continuity in the deployment it is necessary to establish a minimum duration which is set at 30 days in the proposal. As for the experts of the asylum intervention pool, the Management Board will decide, on a proposal of the Executive Director, on the profiles of the experts and on the share that each Member State will contribute to constitute the reserve of a minimum 500 experts. The deployment of experts from the asylum intervention pool is mandatory on Member States without the possibility of invoking an exceptional situation that could substantially affect the discharge of national tasks. The Agency may also deploy experts from its own staff to enhance the deployment of experts from the asylum intervention pool.\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No\u00a0XXX/XXX provides for setting up migration management support teams at hotspot areas characterised by mixed migratory flows. Those migration management support teams are composed of experts and officials deployed by and through different Union Agencies including the European Union Agency for Asylum. The operational and technical reinforcement that may be provided by the asylum support teams or by experts deployed from the asylum intervention pool may include the screening of third-country nationals, the registration of application for international protection, and where requested by Member States, the examination of such applications, as well as the provision of information and specific assistance to applicants or potential applicants that could be subject to relocation.\n\n\nExperts forming part of the asylum support teams or deployed from the asylum intervention should be able to consult national and European databases to be able to perform their tasks effectively and assist Member States. For this purpose, the proposal establishes an obligation on Member States to allow those experts to consult European databases and provides for the possibility for them to allow consultation of national databases subject to Union and national law on access and consultation of those databases.\n\n\nIn order to ensure adequate and efficient coordination on the ground, the proposal transforms what until now has been called a 'Union contact point' into a coordinating officer of the Agency, similar to the coordinating officer used in operations coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union. The role of the coordinating officer is to foster cooperation and coordination between the host Member State and the participating Member States. The coordinating officer takes instructions only from the Agency and is to report to the Executive Director where the operational plan is not adequately implemented.\n\n\nIn view of the fact that the Agency will be deploying experts from its own staff to form part of the asylum support teams and in addition to the asylum intervention pool, the proposal also foresees the possibility for the Agency to acquire or lease its own technical equipment. This does not affect the obligation of the Member States to supply the necessary facilities and equipment for the Agency to be able to provide operational and technical assistance, and it should complement equipment provided by other Union agencies.  \n\n\n(6)Other aspects\n\n\nIn Chapter 7, the proposal sets out provisions on the protection of personal data and provides the Agency with a mandate to process personal data. The processing of personal data by the Agency is limited to the purpose of performing its tasks when providing operational and technical assistance, facilitating information exchange with Member States and other Union Agencies in particular within the context of the migration management support teams, and analysing information on the situation of asylum. The Agency will, in cooperation with the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA), also develop and operate an information system capable of exchanging classified information.\n\n\nAs regards cooperation by the Agency, Chapter 8 covers cooperation by the Agency with Denmark and with associate countries, cooperation with third countries, cooperation with other Union bodies and with international organisations, in particular UNHCR. These aspects are not entirely new when compared to the current mandate of EASO where cooperation with stakeholders featured as important aspect. \n\n\nThe main change in this Chapter concerns Article 35 on cooperation with third countries which is now more structured and provides more clearly for possibilities of cooperation by the Agency with third countries. It establishes that the Agency shall coordinate not only the information exchange but also operational cooperation between Member States and third countries, and that officials from third countries may be invited to act as observers in the operational activities carried out by the Agency. As regards resettlement, the Agency will continue to coordinate the exchange of information and other actions taken by Member States including schemes which are carried out at the level of the European Union. The Agency will also be able to participate in the implementation of international agreements concluded by the Union with third countries.\n\n\nChapter 9 deals with the organisation of the Agency. This Chapter reflects the existing organisation of EASO and follows the common approach on decentralised agencies agreed upon by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The difference compared to the existing structure is that the proposal provides for the post of a Deputy Executive Director considering that the Agency's tasks have been significantly enhanced and there will be a corresponding large increase in staff until 2020. Another difference compared to current organisation concerns the Consultative Forum. That forum should be independent of the Agency and for that purpose it will no longer be chaired by the Executive Director and it should assist the Executive Director and the Management Board in matters related to asylum.\n\n\nChapter 10 covers the financial provisions and Chapter 11 consists of general provisions. Under the financial provisions, the Agency has been provided with the possibility of awarding grants. The general provisions reflect the same provisions as in the existing regulation. Chapter 12 covers the final provisions. New under this chapter is the article on the committee procedure which is intended to cover the possibility for the Commission to adopt implementing acts under this proposal. This last chapter covers the obligation of the Agency to report annually on its activities as well as the evaluation and review of the Agency.\n\n\n2016/0131 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the European Union Agency for Asylum and repealing Regulation (EU) No 439/2010\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 78(1) and (2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The objective of the Union's policy on asylum is to develop and establish a Common European Asylum System (CEAS), consistent with the values and humanitarian tradition of the European Union and governed by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility.\n\n\n(2)The CEAS is based on common minimum standards for asylum procedures, recognition and protection offered at Union level, reception conditions and a system for determining the Member State responsible for asylum seekers. Notwithstanding progress on the CEAS, there are still significant disparities between the Member States in the granting of international protection and in the form that such international protection takes. Those disparities should be addressed by ensuring greater convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection and by guaranteeing a high and uniform level of application of Union law across the Union.\n\n\n(3)In its Communication of 6 April 2016, the Commission set out its options for improving the CEAS, namely to establish a sustainable and fair system for determining the Member States responsible for asylum seekers, to reinforce the Eurodac system, to achieve greater convergence in the asylum system and to prevent secondary movements, and develop an enhanced mandate for the European Asylum Support Office.\u00a0That Communication is in line with calls by the European Council on 18 February 2016 to make progress towards reforming the EU's existing framework so as to ensure a humane and efficient asylum policy. It also proposes a way forward in line with the holistic approach to migration set out by the European Parliament in its own initiative report of 12 April 2016. \n\n\n(4)The European Asylum Support Office was established by Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n7\n and it took up its responsibilities on 1 February 2011. The European Asylum Support Office has enhanced practical cooperation among Member States on asylum-related matters and in assisting Member States in implementing their obligations under the CEAS. The European Asylum Support Office also provides support to Member States whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure. However, its role and function need to be further strengthened so as to not only support Member States in their practical cooperation but to reinforce and complement the asylum and reception systems of Member States. \n\n\n(5)Having regard to structural weaknesses of the CEAS brought to the fore by large-scale and uncontrolled arrival of migrants and asylum seekers to the Union and the need for an efficient, high and uniform level of the application of Union asylum law in Member States, it is necessary to improve the implementation and functioning of the CEAS by building on the work of the European Asylum Support Office and further develop it into a fully-fledged agency which should be responsible for facilitating and improving the functioning of the CEAS, for enabling a sustainable and fair distribution of applications for international protection for ensuring convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection across the Union, and for monitoring the operational and technical application of Union law. \n\n\n(6)The tasks of the European Asylum Support Office should be expanded, and to reflect those changes, it should be renamed European Union Agency for Asylum. The Agency should be a centre of expertise and its main role should be to strengthen practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States on asylum, promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards asylum procedures, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, monitor the operational and technical application of Union law and standards as regards asylum, support the Dublin system and provide increased operational and technical support to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular those whose systems are subject to disproportionate pressure.\n\n\n(7)The European Union Agency for Asylum should work in close cooperation with Member\u00a0States' asylum authorities, with national immigration and asylum services and other services, drawing on the capacity and expertise of those services, and with the Commission. Member States should cooperate with the Agency to ensure that it is able to fulfil its mandate. It is important that the Agency and the Member States act in good faith and have a timely and accurate exchange of information.\u00a0Any provision of statistical data should respect the technical and methodological specifications of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007.\n8\n\n\n\n(8)The European Union Agency for Asylum should gather and analyse information on the situation of asylum in the Union and in third countries insofar as this may have an impact on the Union. That should enable the Agency to assist Member States in better understanding the factors for asylum-related migration towards and within the Union, as well as for the purpose of early warning and preparedness of Member States.\n\n\n(9)Having regard to the reform of the Dublin system, the European Union Agency for Asylum should provide the necessary support to the Member States, in particular by operating and managing the corrective mechanism.\n\n\n(10)The European Union Agency for Asylum should assist Member States with training of experts from all national administrations, courts and tribunals, and national services responsible for asylum matters, including the development of a common core curriculum. In addition, the Agency should ensure that all experts participating in asylum support teams or forming part of the asylum intervention pool receive specialist training before their participation in operational activities organised by the Agency.\n\n\n(11)The European Union Agency for Asylum should ensure a more structured and streamlined production of information on countries of origin at the level of the European Union. It is necessary for the Agency to gather information and draw up reports providing for country of origin information by making use of European networks on country of origin information so as to avoid duplication and create synergies with national reports. Furthermore, to ensure convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection and the nature and quality of protection granted, the Agency should, together with Member States, engage in and develop a common analysis providing guidance on the situation in specific countries of origin.\n\n\n(12)The common EU list of safe countries of origin established by Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX\u00a0\n9\n should be regularly reviewed by the Commission. Having regard to the Agency's expertise, it should assist the Commission in reviewing that list. The Agency should also, at the request of the Commission, provide it with information on specific third countries which could be included in the common EU list of safe countries of origin, and on third countries designated as safe countries of origin or safe third countries or to which the concepts of safe third country,\u00a0first country of asylum or European safe third country by Member States apply. \n\n\n(13)To ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards asylum procedures, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, the Agency should organise and coordinate activities promoting Union law. For that purpose, the Agency should assist Member States by developing operational standards and indicators for monitoring compliance with those standards. The Agency should also develop guidelines on asylum-related matters and should enable the exchange of best practices among Member States. \n\n\n(14)The European Union Agency for Asylum, in close cooperation with the Commission and without prejudice to the Commission's responsibility as guardian of the Treaties, should establish a mechanism to monitor and assess the implementation of the CEAS, the compliance by Member States with operational standards, guidelines and best practices on asylum and to verify the functioning of the asylum and reception systems of Member States. The monitoring and assessment should be comprehensive and  should be based, in particular, on information provided by Member States, information analysis on the situation of asylum developed by the Agency, on-site visits and case sampling. The Agency should report its findings to the Management Board which in turn should adopt the report. The Executive Director should, after consultation with the Commission, make draft recommendations to the Member State concerned outlining the necessary measures to address serious shortcomings, which in turn shall be adopted by the Management Board as recommendations.\n\n\n(15)The recommendations should be followed\u00a0up on the basis of an action plan prepared by the Member State concerned. If, within the set period of time, the Member State concerned does not take the necessary measures to address the recommendations, and the shortcomings in the asylum and reception systems are so serious that they jeopardize the functioning of the CEAS, the Commission should, based on its own assessment of the implementation of the action plan and the seriousness of the shortcomings, adopt recommendations addressed to that Member State outlining the measures needed to remedy the serious shortcomings. The Commission may need to organise on-site visits to the Member State concerned to verify the implementation of the action plan. Where necessary, the Commission should also identify the measures that should be taken by the Agency in support of that Member State. If the Member State should remain non-compliant for a certain period of time, the Commission may take further action requiring the Agency to intervene in support of that Member State.\n\n\n(16)To facilitate and improve the proper functioning of the CEAS and to assist Member States in implementing their obligations within the framework of CEAS, the European Union Agency for Asylum should provide Member States with operational and technical assistance, in particular when their asylum and receptions systems are subject to disproportionate pressure. The Agency should provide the necessary operational and technical assistance through the deployment of asylum support teams consisting of experts from the Agency's own staff, experts from Member States or experts seconded by Member States to the Agency, and based on an operational plan. Those teams should support Member States with operational and technical measures, including by providing expertise relating to identification and registration of third countries nationals, interpreting services, information on countries of origin and knowledge of the handling and management of asylum cases, as well as by assisting national authorities competent\u00a0for the examination of applications for international protection and by assisting with relocation. The arrangements for the asylum support teams should be governed by this Regulation in order to ensure their effective deployment.\n\n\n(17)In cases where a Member State's asylum and reception systems are subject to disproportionate pressure that places exceptionally heavy and urgent demands on their asylum or reception systems, the European Union Agency for Asylum should assist that Member State upon request or on the Agency's own initiative, by means of a comprehensive set of measures, including the deployment of experts from the asylum intervention pool. To ensure the availability of those experts and their immediate deployment, the asylum intervention pool should constitute a reserve of experts from Member States amounting to a minimum of 500 persons. The Agency should itself be able to intervene in support of a Member State where despite the disproportionate pressure, the Member State concerned does not request for sufficient assistance from the Agency or the Member State does not take sufficient action to address that pressure with the consequence that the asylum and reception systems would be ineffective to the extent of jeopardising the functioning of the CEAS. A disproportionate number of applications for international protection for which a Member States is responsible may be an indication of disproportionate pressure.\n\n\n(18)To ensure that the asylum support teams or the experts deployed from the asylum intervention pool are able to perform their tasks effectively with the means necessary, the European Union Agency for Asylum should be able to acquire or lease its own technical equipment. This should, however, not affect the obligation of Member States to supply the necessary facilities and equipment for the Agency to be able to provide the required operational and technical assistance. Any acquisition or leasing of equipment should be subject to a thorough needs and cost/benefit analysis by the Agency.\n\n\n\n\n(19)For Member States that are faced with specific and disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems due, in particular, to their geographical or demographic situation, the European Union Agency for Asylum should support the development of solidarity within the Union and assist in the better relocation of beneficiaries of international protection among Member\u00a0States, while ensuring that asylum and reception systems are not abused.\n\n\n(20)At particular areas of the external borders where Member States face disproportionate migratory pressures characterised by large influxes of mixed migratory flows, referred to as hotspot areas, the Member States should be able to rely on increased operational and technical reinforcement by migration management support teams composed of teams of experts from Member States deployed through the European Union Agency for Asylum, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and Europol or other relevant Union agencies, as well as experts from the staff of the European Union Agency for Asylum and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union. The Agency should ensure coordination of its activities in the migration management support teams with the Commission and the other relevant Union agencies.\n\n\n(21)For the purpose of fulfilling its mission, and to the extent required for the accomplishment of its tasks, the European Union Agency for Asylum should cooperate with Union bodies, agencies and offices, in particular with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in matters covered by this Regulation in the framework of working arrangements concluded in accordance with Union law and policy. Those working arrangements should receive the Commission's prior approval. \n\n\n(22)The European Union Agency for Asylum should cooperate with the European Migration Network, established by Council Decision 2008/381/EC\n10\n, to ensure synergies and avoid duplication of activities. \n\n\n(23)The European Union Agency for Asylum should cooperate with international organisations, in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in matters covered by this Regulation in the framework of working arrangements so as to benefit from their expertise and support. To that end, the roles of UNHCR and the other relevant international organisations should be fully recognised and those organisations should be involved in the work of the Agency. The working arrangements should receive the Commission's prior approval.\n\n\n(24)The European Union Agency for Asylum should facilitate operational cooperation between Member States in matters covered by this Regulation. It should also cooperate with authorities of third-countries in the framework of working arrangements which should receive the Commission's prior approval. The Agency should act in accordance with the Union's external relations policy and under no circumstances should it formulate any independent external policy. In their cooperation with third countries, the Agency and the Member States should comply with norms and standards at least equivalent to those set by Union legislation also when the cooperation with third countries takes place on the territory of those countries.\n\n\n(25)The European Union Agency for Asylum should maintain a close dialogue with civil society with a view to exchanging information and pooling knowledge in the field of\u00a0asylum. The Agency should set up a Consultative Forum which should constitute a mechanism for the exchange of information and the sharing of knowledge. The Consultative Forum should assist the Executive Director and the Management Board in matters covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n(26)This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. All activities of the European Union Agency for Asylum shall be carried out in full respect of these fundamental rights and principles, including the right to asylum, the protection from refoulement, the right to respect for private and family life, the right to protection of personal data and the right to an effective remedy. The rights of the child and the special needs of vulnerable persons shall always being taken into account.\u00a0\n\n\n(27)The Commission and the Member States should be represented on the Management Board of the European Union Agency for Asylum in order to exercise a policy and political oversight over its workings. The Management Board should, where possible, consist of the operational heads of the Member States' asylum administrations or their representatives. It should be given the necessary powers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Agency, and appoint an Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director. The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Common Approach on Union decentralised agencies adopted on 19 July 2012 by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.\n\n\n(28)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular as regards situations requiring urgent action at the external borders, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n11\n\n\n\n(29)The European Union Agency for Asylum should be independent as regards operational and technical matters and it should enjoy legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary and appropriate that the Agency should be a body of the Union having legal personality and exercising the implementing powers conferred upon it by this Regulation.\n\n\n(30)In order to guarantee the autonomy of the European Union Agency for Asylum, it should have its own budget, most of which comes essentially from a contribution from the Union. The financing of the Agency should be subject to an agreement by the budgetary authority as set out in point\u00a031 of the Inter-institutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European\u00a0Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.\n12\n The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable to the Union's contribution and to any grant chargeable to the general budget of the European\u00a0Union. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of\u00a0Auditors.\n\n\n(31)Any financial resources made available by the Agency under the form of grants, delegated agreements or form of contract in accordance with this Regulation should not result in double financing with other national, European or international sources. \n\n\n(32)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 of 30 September 2013 on the framework financial regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 208 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 7.12.2013, p. 42) should apply to the European Union Agency for Asylum. \n\n\n(33)Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n13\n should apply without restriction to the European Union Agency for Asylum, which should accede to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office.\n14\n\n\n\n(34)Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30\u00a0May\u00a02001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents\n15\n should apply to the European Union Agency for Asylum.\n\n\n(35)Any processing of personal data by the European Union Agency for Asylum within the framework of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and should respect the principles of necessity and proportionality.\n16\n The Agency may process personal data to perform its tasks of providing operational and technical assistance to Member States, to facilitate the exchange of information with Member States, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States, Europol or Eurojust, to analysing information on the situation of asylum and for administrative purposes. Any further processing of retained personal data for purposes other than those set out in this Regulation should be prohibited.\u00a0\n\n\n(36)Regulation (EU) No\u00a0XXX/2016 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n17\n on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States carried out in application of this Regulation unless such processing is carried out by the designated or verifying competent authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\n\n\n(37)Directive 2016/XXX/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n18\n on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data applies to the processing of personal data by competent authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, investigation detection or prosecution of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n\n(38)The rules set out in Regulation (EU) No XXX/2016 regarding the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to the protection of personal data concerning them, with regard to the processing of personal data should be specified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of the data, of safeguarding the rights of data subjects and of the supervision of data protection, in particular as far as certain sectors are concerned.\n\n\n\n\n(39)The Agency should process personal data only for the purposes of performing its tasks of providing operational and technical assistance, when carrying out case sampling for the purposes of the monitoring exercise, possibly handling applications for international protection from children or vulnerable persons, facilitating the exchange of information with Member States, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States, Europol or Eurojust and in the framework of information obtained when performing its tasks in the migration management support teams at hotspots, and for analysing information on the situation of asylum. Any processing of personal data should respect the principle of proportionality and be strictly limited to personal data necessary for these purposes.\n\n\n(40)Any personal data that the Agency processes, except those processed for administrative purposes, should be deleted after 30 days. A longer storage period is not necessary for the purposes for which the Agency processes personal data within the framework of this Regulation; \n\n\n(41)The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on [\u2026].\n19\n\n\n\n(42)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the need to facilitate the implementation and improve the functioning of the CEAS, to strengthen practical cooperation and information exchange among Member\u00a0States on asylum-related matters, to promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards asylum procedures, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, to monitor the operational and technical application of Union law and standards as regards asylum and to provide increased operational and technical support to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular to Member States subject to disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those\u00a0objectives.\n\n\n(43)[In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation]\u00a0\n\n\nOR\n\n\n[In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.] \n\n\nOR\n\n\n[(XX) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. \n\n\n(XX) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland has notified (, by letter of ...,) its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.] \n\n\nOR\n\n\n[(XX) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom has notified (, by letter of ...,) its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation. \n\n\n(XX) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.]\u00a0\n\n\n(44)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the Position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaties, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it nor is it subject to its application.\n\n\n(45)Taking into account that Denmark has until now contributed to the practical cooperation between Member States within the area of asylum, the Agency should facilitate operational cooperation with Denmark. To that end, a Danish representative should be invited to participate in all the meetings of the Management Board, without the right to vote.\n\n\n(46)The competence to take decisions by Member States' asylum authorities on individual applications for international\u00a0protection remains with Member States.\n\n\n(47)This Regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Since the amendments to be made are of a substantial nature, that act should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced and repealed. References to the repealed regulation should be construed as references to this Regulation.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR ASYLUM \n\n\n\n\nArticle 1 \n\n\nSubject-matter and scope\n\n\n1. The European Union Agency for Asylum (the Agency) shall ensure the efficient and uniform application of Union asylum law in Member States. It shall facilitate the implementation and improve the functioning of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), and it shall be responsible for enabling convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection across the Union. \n\n\n2. The Agency shall be a centre of expertise by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of the assistance it provides and the information it disseminates, the transparency of its operating procedures and methods, its diligence in performing the duties assigned to it, and the information technology support needed to fulfil its mandate.\n\n\n3. The European Union Agency for Asylum shall be the new name for the European Asylum Support Office established by Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The activities of the Agency shall henceforth be based on this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 2 \n\n\nTasks\n\n\n1.

For those purposes, the Agency and the Member States' asylum authorities, national immigration and asylum services and other national services shall share, in a timely and accurate manner, all necessary information.\n\n\nArticle 4 \n\n\nInformation analysis on the situation of asylum\n\n\n1. The Agency shall gather and analyse information on the situation of asylum in the Union and third countries insofar as this may have an impact on the Union, including up-to-date information on root causes, migratory and refugee flows as well as on any sudden arrivals of large numbers of third-country nationals which may cause disproportionate pressure on asylum and reception systems, with a view to foster quick and reliable mutual information to the Member States and to identify possible risks to the Member States' asylum systems. \n\n\n2.The Agency shall base its analysis on information provided, in particular, by Member States, relevant Union institutions and agencies, the European External Action Service as well as UNHCR and other international organisations.  \n\n\nFor this purpose, the Agency shall work in close collaboration with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States, and shall, in particular, rely on the risk analysis carried out by that Agency so as to ensure the highest level of consistency and convergence in the information provided by both Agencies.\n\n\n3.The Agency shall ensure the rapid exchange of relevant information amongst Member States and with the Commission. It shall also submit, in a timely and accurate manner, the results of its analysis to the Management Board. \n\n\nArticle 5 \n\n\nInformation on the implementation of the CEAS\n\n\n1. The Agency shall organise, coordinate and promote the exchange of information among Member States and between the Commission and the Member States concerning the implementation of all instruments of Union law on asylum. \n\n\n2. The Agency shall create factual, legal and case law databases on the application and interpretation of Union, national\u00a0and international asylum instruments making use, in particular, of existing arrangements. No personal data shall be stored in such databases, unless such data has been obtained by the Agency from documents that are publicly accessible.\n\n\n\n\n3. In particular, the Agency shall gather information on the following:\n\n\n(a)the processing of applications for international protection by national administrations and authorities;\n\n\n(b)national law and legal developments in the field of asylum, including case law;\n\n\n(c)relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nSupport to the Dublin system\n\n\nThe Agency shall perform its tasks and obligations as set out in Regulation (EU) No\u00a0XXX/XXX.\n20\n\n\n\nArticle 7 \n\n\nTraining\n\n\n1. The Agency shall establish and develop training for members of its own staff, members of all national administrations, courts and tribunals, and national services responsible for asylum matters in the Member States. \n\n\n2. The Agency shall develop such training in close cooperation with Member States and, in cooperation with appropriate training entities in the Member States, including academic institutions and other relevant organisations.\n\n\n3. The Agency shall develop general, specific or thematic training tools, which may include \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 methodology and e-learning.\n\n\n4. The Agency shall establish and develop a European asylum curriculum taking into account the Union's existing cooperation in that field. Member States shall integrate the common core curriculum in the training of staff of national services and authorities responsible for asylum matters pursuant to their obligation under Article 4(3) of Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n21\n to ensure proper training of their staff. \n\n\n5.

The training offered shall be of high quality and shall identify key principles and best practices with a view to greater convergence of administrative methods, decisions and legal practice, in full respect of the independence of national courts and tribunals.\n\n\n7. The Agency shall take the necessary initiatives to ensure that the experts who participate in the asylum support teams and the asylum intervention pool, have received specialist training relevant to their duties and functions prior to their participation in the operational activities organised by the Agency. The Agency shall conduct regular exercises with those experts in accordance with the specialist training and exercise schedule referred to in its annual work programme.\n\n\n8. The Agency may organise training activities in cooperation with Member States or third countries on their\u00a0territory.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN INFORMATION \n\n\nArticle 8 \n\n\nInformation on countries of origin at Union level\n\n\n1. The Agency shall be a centre for gathering relevant, reliable, accurate and up-to date information on countries of origin of persons applying for international protection,\u00a0including child-specific information and targeted information on persons belonging to vulnerable groups. It shall draw up and regularly update reports and other products providing for information on countries of origin at the level of the Union including on thematic issues specific to countries of origin. \n\n\n2.

To foster convergence in applying the assessment criteria established in Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council,\n22\n the Agency shall coordinate efforts among Member States to engage in and develop a common analysis providing guidance on the situation in specific countries of origin. \n\n\n2. The Executive Director shall, after consulting the Commission, submit that common analysis to the Management Board for endorsement. Member States shall be required to take that common analysis into account when examining applications for international protection, without prejudice to their competence for deciding on individual applications.\n\n\n3. The Agency shall ensure that the common analysis is kept constantly under review and updated to the extent necessary. Any such revision shall likewise require prior consultation of the Commission and endorsement by the Management Board.\n\n\n4. The Member States shall, on a monthly basis, submit to the Agency relevant information on the decisions taken in relation to applicants for international protection originating from third countries subject to the common analysis. That information shall, in particular, include:\n\n\n(a)statistics on the number of decisions granting international protection to applicants from each country of origin which is the subject of the common analysis and specifying the type of protection;\n\n\n(b)statistics on the number of decisions refusing international protection to applicants from each country of origin which is the subject of the common analysis;\n\n\n(c)statistics on the number of decisions taken in relation to applicants from each country of origin which is the subject of the common analysis but where that common analysis was not followed and the reasons for not following it.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nDesignation of safe countries of origin and safe third countries\n\n\n1. The Agency shall assist the Commission in regularly reviewing the situation in third countries which are included in the common EU list of safe countries of origin established by Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX, including those that have been suspended by the Commission and those that have been removed from that list. \n\n\n2.The Agency shall, at the request of the Commission, provide it with information on specific third countries which could be considered for inclusion in the common EU list of safe countries of origin in accordance with Regulation (EU) No XXX/XXX. \n\n\n3.When notifying the Commission in accordance with Articles 37(4), 38(5) and 39(7) of Directive 2013/32/EU, Member States shall also inform the Agency of the third countries which are designated as safe countries of origin or safe third countries or to which the concepts of first country of asylum, safe third country, or European safe third country is applied\u00a0pursuant to Articles 35, 38 and 39 of Directive 2013/32/EU, respectively. \n\n\nThe Commission may request the Agency to carry out a review of the situation in any such third country with a view to assess whether the relevant conditions and criteria set out in that Directive are respected.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nOPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES\n\n\nArticle 12 \n\n\nOperational standards, guidelines and best practices\n\n\n1. The Agency shall organise and coordinate activities promoting a correct and effective implementation of Union law, including through the development of operational standards, indicators, guidelines or best practices on asylum-related matters, and the exchange of best practices in asylum-related matters among Member States. \n\n\n2.The Agency shall, on its own initiative or at the request of the Commission, and in consultation with the Commission, develop operational standards on the implementation of the instruments of Union law on asylum and indicators for monitoring compliance with those operational standards as well as guidelines and best practices related to the implementation of the instruments of Union law on asylum. The Agency shall, following consultation with the Commission and after adoption by the Management Board, communicate those standards, indicators, guidelines or best practices to the Member States.\n\n\n\n\n3. The Agency shall, at the request of Member States, assist them to apply the operational standards, guidelines and best practices to their asylum and reception systems by providing the necessary expertise or operational and technical assistance. \n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nMONITORING AND ASSESSMENT\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nMechanism for monitoring and assessing the asylum and reception systems\n\n\n1. The Agency, in close cooperation with the Commission, shall establish a mechanism to: \n\n\n(a)monitor the implementation and assess all aspects of the CEAS in Member States, in particular the Dublin system, reception conditions, asylum procedures, the application of criteria determining protection needs and the nature and quality of protection afforded to persons in need of international protection by Member States, including as regards the respect of fundamental rights, child protection safeguards and the needs of vulnerable persons;\n\n\n(b)monitor compliance by Member States with operational standards, indicators guidelines and best practices on asylum;\n\n\n(c)verify the asylum and reception systems, capabilities, infrastructure, equipment, staff available, including for translation and interpretation in Member States, financial resources and the capacity of Member States' asylum authorities, including the judicial system, to handle and manage asylum cases efficiently and correctly.\n\n\n2. The Agency may, in particular, base its assessment on information provided by Member States, information analysis on the situation of asylum developed by the Agency, on-site visits and case sampling.\n\n\nFor that purpose, Member States shall, at the request of the Agency, provide it with the necessary information as regards asylum procedures, equipment, infrastructure, reception conditions, recognition rates and quality of protection as well as staff and financial resources at national level to ensure an efficient management of the asylum and reception system. The Member States shall also cooperate with the Agency and shall facilitate any on-site visit that the Agency shall carry out for the purposes of the monitoring exercise.\n\n\n3. The Agency shall assess the readiness of Member States to meet challenges from possible disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems. The Agency may request Member States to provide it with their contingency planning for measures to be taken to deal with such possible disproportionate pressure and shall assist Member States to prepare and review their contingency planning, where necessary. \n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nProcedure for monitoring and assessment by the Agency\n\n\n1. The Management Board shall, in consultation with the Commission, set the programme for monitoring and assessing the asylum and reception systems in each Member State, or of all Member States on the basis of thematic or specific aspects of the asylum systems. That programme shall form part of the multi-annual and annual programming referred to in Article 41. \n\n\nThe multi-annual programming shall list the Member States whose asylum and reception systems shall be monitored each year, ensuring that each Member State shall be monitored at least once in every five-year period. \n\n\nThe annual work programme shall list the Member States to be monitored the following year in accordance with the multi-annual programming and the thematic assessments. It shall include an indication of what the monitoring shall consist of and a schedule for any on-site visits.\n\n\nThe annual work programme may be adapted if necessary in accordance with Article 41. \n\n\nThe Agency may initiate a monitoring exercise for the assessment of the asylum or reception systems of a Member State on its own initiative or at the request of the Commission whenever there are serious concerns regarding the functioning of any aspect of that Member State's asylum or reception systems.\n\n\n2. The Agency shall set up teams of experts for each monitoring exercise, including for the on-site visits as necessary. The teams of experts shall be composed of experts from the Agency's own staff and Commission representatives. The team of experts shall be responsible for drawing up a report based on the findings of on-site visits and information provided by Member States.\n\n\n\n\n3. The Executive Director shall transmit the draft report of the team of experts to the Member State concerned, which shall provide its comments on that draft report. The Executive Director shall then submit the draft report, taking into account the comments of the Member State concerned, to the Management Board. The Management Board shall adopt the monitoring report and transmit it to the Commission.\n\n\n4. The Executive Director, after consultation with the Commission, shall submit draft recommendations to the Member State concerned outlining the necessary measures to address shortcomings identified in the monitoring report. The Member State concerned shall be given one month to comment on the draft recommendations. After giving consideration to those comments, the Management Board shall adopt the recommendations and it shall invite the Member State concerned to draw up an action plan outlining the measures to remedy any shortcomings.  \n\n\n5.The Member State concerned shall provide the Agency with an action plan within one month from adoption of the recommendations referred to in paragraph 4. That Member State shall report to the Agency on the implementation of the action plan within three months from the adoption of the recommendations and shall thereafter continue to report every month for a maximum of six months.\n\n\n6.The Agency shall inform the Commission on a regular basis of the implementation of the action plan.\n\n\nArticle 15 \n\n\nFollow-up and monitoring\n\n\n1. Where, after the period referred to in Article 14(5), the Member State concerned has not fully implemented the action plan and the shortcomings in the asylum and reception systems are so serious that they jeopardize the functioning of the CEAS, the Commission shall, based on its own assessment of the implementation of the action plan and the seriousness of the shortcomings, adopt recommendations addressed to that Member State outlining the measures needed to remedy the serious shortcomings, and where necessary setting out the measures to be taken by the Agency to support that Member State.\n\n\n2.The Commission may, taking into account the seriousness of the shortcomings identified, organise on-site visits to the Member State concerned to verify the implementation of the action plan.\n\n\n3. The Member State concerned shall report to the Commission on the implementation of the recommendations referred to in paragraph 1 within the time-limit set in those recommendations. If after that time-limit, the Commission is not satisfied that the Member State has fully complied with those recommendations, it may take further action in accordance with Article 22(3).\n\n\n4.The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council on a regular basis about the progress made by the Member State concerned.\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nOPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n\nArticle 16 \n\n\nOperational and technical assistance by the Agency\n\n\n1. Member States may request the Agency for assistance in implementing their obligations with regard to asylum, in particular when their asylum and reception systems are subject to disproportionate pressure.\n\n\n2. Member States shall submit a request for assistance to the Executive Director describing the situation and the purpose of the request. The request shall be accompanied by a detailed assessment of needs. The Executive Director shall evaluate, approve and coordinate requests for assistance.\u00a0Each shall be subject to a thorough and reliable assessment enabling the Agency to identify and propose a set of measures as referred to in paragraph 3 that can meet the needs of the Member State concerned.\n\n\n3.

The Agency shall deploy asylum support teams to Member States to provide operational and technical assistance in accordance with Article 16.\n\n\n2. The asylum support teams shall consist of experts from the Agency's own staff, experts from Member States or experts seconded by Member States to the Agency.\n\n\n3. On a proposal by the Executive Director, the Management Board shall decide by an absolute majority of its members with a right to vote on the profiles and the overall number of experts to be made available for the asylum support teams. The same procedure shall apply to any subsequent changes in the profiles and the overall number of experts.\n\n\n4. Member States shall contribute to the asylum support teams through a national expert pool on the basis of the various defined profiles and by nominating experts corresponding to the required profiles.\n\n\n5. As part of the asylum support teams, the Agency shall set up a list of interpreters. Member States shall assist the Agency in identifying interpreters for the list of\u00a0interpreters. Member States may choose either to deploy the interpreters or to make them available by video-conferencing.\n\n\n6. The contribution by Member States as regards their own experts or experts seconded to the Agency for the following year shall be planned on the basis of annual bilateral negotiations and agreements between the Agency and the Member States. In accordance with those agreements, Member States shall make the experts immediately available for deployment unless they are faced with an exceptional situation substantially affecting the discharge of national tasks.\n\n\n7. Member States shall ensure that the experts that they contribute match the profiles and numbers decided upon by the Management Board. The duration of deployment shall be determined by the home Member State but it shall not be less than 30 days.\n\n\n8. The Agency shall contribute to the asylum support teams with experts from its own staff employed specifically for field work and interpreters. \n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\n\n\nAsylum intervention pool\n\n\n1.

For that purpose, Member States shall, on a yearly basis, make available to the Agency a number of experts of not less than 500 persons.\n\n\n2. The Management Board shall, on a proposal of the Executive Director, decide by a three-fourths majority of members with a right to vote on the profiles of experts and on the share that each Member State shall contribute to constitute the asylum intervention pool. The same procedure shall apply to any subsequent changes in the profiles and the overall number of experts. \n\n\n3.Member States shall contribute to the asylum intervention pool through a national expert pool on the basis of the various defined profiles and by nominating experts corresponding to the required profiles. The duration of deployment shall be determined by the home Member State but it shall not be less than 30 days.\n\n\nArticle 19 \n\n\nOperational plan\n\n\n1. The Executive Director and the host Member State shall agree on an operational plan. The operational plan shall be binding on the Agency, the host and participating Member States. \n\n\n2.The operational plan shall set out in detail the conditions for the provision of the operational and technical assistance and the deployment of the asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool, including the following:\n\n\n(a)a description of the situation, with the modus operandi and objectives of the deployment, including the operational objective;\n\n\n(b)the foreseeable duration of the deployment;\n\n\n(c)the location in the host Member State where the asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool shall be deployed;\n\n\n(d)logistical arrangements including information on working conditions and the environment at the location where the asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool shall be deployed;\n\n\n(e)a detailed and clear description of the tasks and special instructions for the asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool, including the national and European databases that they are authorised to consult and the equipment that they may use or carry in the host Member State;\n\n\n(f)the composition of the asylum support teams or the experts to be deployed from the asylum intervention pool;\n\n\n(g)the technical equipment deployed, including specific provisions such as conditions of use, transport and other logistics and financial provisions;\n\n\n(h)regarding assistance with applications for international protection, including as regards the examination of such applications, specific information on the tasks that the asylum support teams or the experts from the asylum intervention pool may perform as well as reference to applicable national and Union law;\n\n\n(i)a reporting and evaluation scheme containing benchmarks for the evaluation report and final date of submission of the final evaluation report;\n\n\n(j)modalities of cooperation with third countries, other Union agencies, bodies, offices or international organisations;\n\n\n(k)procedures whereby persons in need of international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and persons in a vulnerable situation are directed to the competent national authorities for appropriate assistance.\n\n\n3. Having regard to point (e) of paragraph 2, the host Member State shall authorise experts from the asylum support teams or the asylum intervention pool to consult European databases and it may authorise them to consult its national databases in compliance with Union and national law on access and consultation of those databases, and as necessary to achieve the objectives and perform the tasks outlined in the operational plan.\n\n\n\n\n4. Any amendments to or adaptations of the operational plan shall require the agreement of the Executive Director and the host Member State. The Agency shall immediately send a copy of the amended or adapted operational plan to the participating Member\u00a0States.\n\n\nArticle 20 \n\n\nProcedure for deploying asylum support teams\n\n\n1. If necessary, the Executive Director may send experts from the Agency to assess the situation in the Member State requesting assistance. The Executive Director shall immediately notify the Management Board of any request for deployment of asylum support teams.\n\n\n2. The Executive Director shall take a decision on the request for deployment of asylum support teams within three working days from the date of receipt of the request. The Executive Director shall at the same time notify the Member State requesting assistance and the Management Board of the decision in writing stating the main reasons\u00a0for his or her decision.\n\n\n3. When determining the composition of each asylum support team, the Executive Director shall take into account the particular circumstances of the Member\u00a0State requesting assistance and its assessment of needs. The asylum support team shall be constituted in accordance with the operational plan. \n\n\n4. The Executive Director and the host Member State shall draw up an operational plan within three working days from the day on which the decision to deploy the asylum support teams is taken.\n\n\n5. As soon as the operational plan is agreed, the Executive Director shall request the Member States to deploy the experts within no more than seven working days. The Executive Director shall indicate the number and profiles required from the Member States. That information shall be provided, in writing, to the national contact points and shall specify the scheduled date of deployment. A copy of the operational plan shall also be sent to the national contact points.\n\n\n6.The Executive Director shall, after informing the host Member State, suspend or terminate the deployment of the asylum support teams if the conditions to carry out the operational and technical measures are no longer fulfilled or if the operational plan is not respected by the host Member State.\n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\nMigration management support teams\n\n\n1. Where a Member State requests operational and technical reinforcement by migration management support teams as referred to in Article 17 of Regulation No XXX/XXX or where migration management support teams are deployed at hotspot areas as referred to in Article 18 of Regulation No XXX/XXX, the Executive Director shall ensure coordination of the Agency's activities in the migration management support teams with the Commission and with other relevant Union agencies, in particular, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States.\n\n\n2. The Executive Director shall, as appropriate, launch the procedure for deployment of asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool in accordance with Articles 17 and 18. The operational and technical reinforcement provided by the asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool in the framework of the migration management support teams may include:\n\n\n(a)the screening of third-country nationals, including their identification, registration, and where requested by Member States, their fingerprinting; \n\n\n(b)the registration of applications for international protection and, where requested by Member States, the examination of such applications;\n\n\n(c)the provision of information on asylum procedures, including relocation and specific assistance to applicants or potential applicants that could be subject to relocation.\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nDisproportionate pressure on the asylum and reception system\n\n\n1. Where the asylum and reception systems of a Member State are subject to disproportionate pressure that places exceptionally heavy and urgent demands on those systems, the Agency shall, at the request of the Member State concerned or on its own initiative, organise and coordinate a comprehensive set of operational and technical measures as referred to in Article 16 and deploy experts from the asylum intervention pool referred to in Article 18 and experts from its own staff to reinforce the asylum and reception systems within a short period of time.\n\n\n2. The experts of the asylum intervention pool shall be deployed in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 20 provided however that experts shall be deployed from each Member State within three working days from the date on which the operational plan is agreed upon by the Executive Director and the Member State requesting assistance. The Member States may not invoke the exception provided for in Article 17(6).\n\n\n\n\n3. Where in the event of disproportionate pressure on the asylum or reception systems a Member State does not request the Agency for operational and technical assistance or does not accept an offer by the Agency for such assistance or does not take sufficient action to address that pressure, or where it does not comply with the Commission's recommendations referred to in Article 15(3), thereby rendering the asylum or reception systems ineffective to the extent of jeopardising the functioning of the CEAS, the Commission may adopt a decision by means of an implementing act, identifying one or more of the measures set out in Article 16(3)\u00a0to be taken by the Agency to support the Member State concerned. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 64.\n\n\n4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the Executive Director shall, within two working days from the date of adoption of the Commission decision, determine the actions needed to be taken for the practical execution of the measures identified in the Commission decision.

The Member State concerned shall immediately cooperate with the Agency and take the necessary action to facilitate the implementation of that decision and the practical execution of the measures set out in that decision and in the operational plan.\n\n\n7. The Member States shall make available the experts from the asylum intervention pool as determined by the Executive Director.\n\n\nArticle 23\n\n\nTechnical equipment\n\n\n1. Without prejudice to the obligation of Member States to supply the necessary facilities and equipment for the Agency to be able to provide the required operational and technical assistance, the Agency may deploy its own equipment to Member States to the extent that this may be needed by the asylum support teams or the experts from the asylum intervention pool and insofar as this may complement equipment already made available by the Member States or other Union agencies.\n\n\n2. The Agency may acquire or lease technical equipment by decision of the Executive Director, in consultation with the Management Board. Any acquisition or leasing of equipment shall be preceded by a thorough needs and cost/benefit analysis. Any such expenditure shall be provided for in the Agency's budget as adopted by the Management Board and in accordance with the financial rules applicable to the Agency.\n\n\nArticle 24 \n\n\nNational contact point\n\n\nEach Member State shall appoint a national contact point for communication with the Agency on all matters relating to the operational and technical assistance referred to in Articles 16 and 22.\n\n\nArticle 25 \n\n\nCoordinating officer of the Agency\n\n\n1.

The Executive Director may authorise the coordinating officer to assist in resolving any disputes concerning the implementation of the operational plan and the deployment of asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool.\n\n\n5. In discharging his or her duties, the coordinating officer shall take instructions only from the Executive Director.\n\n\nArticle 26 \n\n\nCivil liability\n\n\n1. Where experts of an asylum support team or from the asylum intervention pool are operating in a host Member State, that Member State shall be liable in accordance with its national law for any damage caused by them during their operations.\n\n\n2. Where such damage is caused by gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the host Member\u00a0State may address the home Member State or the Agency to obtain any sums it has paid to the victims or persons entitled on their behalf from the home Member State or the Agency.\n\n\n3. Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-\u00e0-vis third parties, each Member State shall waive all its claims against the host Member State or any other Member State for any damage it has sustained, except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\n\n\n4. Any dispute between Member States or with the Agency relating to the application of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article which cannot be resolved by negotiations between them shall be submitted by them to the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with Article 273 of the Treaty.\n\n\n5. Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-\u00e0-vis third parties, the Agency shall meet costs relating to damage caused to the Agency's equipment during deployment, except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\n\n\nArticle 27 \n\n\nCriminal liability\n\n\nDuring the deployment of an asylum support team or experts from the asylum intervention pool, those experts shall be treated in the same way as officials of the host Member State with regard to any criminal offences that might be committed against them or by them.\n\n\nArticle 28 \n\n\nCosts\n\n\n1. The Agency shall meet the costs incurred by Member States when they make their experts available for deployment to asylum support teams or as part of the asylum intervention pool, in particular:\n\n\n(a)travel from the home Member State to the host Member State and from the host Member\u00a0State to the home Member State;\n\n\n(a)vaccinations;\n\n\n(b)special insurance cover required;\n\n\n(c)health care;\n\n\n\n\n(d)daily subsistence allowances, including accommodation;\n\n\n(e)the Agency's technical equipment;\n\n\n(f)experts' fees.\n\n\n2.

(2) promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniform application of the legal framework on asylum; (3) ensure greater convergence in the assessment of protection needs across the Union; (4) monitor and assess the implementation of the CEAS; (5) provide increased operational and technical assistance to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular in cases of disproportionate pressure.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this proposal are to facilitate the implementation and improve the functioning of the CEAS, to strengthen practical cooperation and information exchange among Member States on asylum-related matters, to promote Union law and operational standards to ensure a high degree of uniformity as regards asylum procedures, reception conditions and the assessment of protection needs across the Union, to monitor the operational and technical application of Union law and standards as regards asylum and to provide increased operational and technical support to Member States for the management of the asylum and reception systems, in particular to Member States subject to disproportionate pressure on their asylum and reception systems. \n\n\nSince it is a common and shared interest to ensure the proper application of the legal framework on asylum, through concerted action among Member States with the support of the European Union Agency for Asylum, so as to consolidate stability and order in the functioning of the CEAS, the objectives of this proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at the level of the Union.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nSince taking up its responsibilities in 2011, EASO has continuously supported Member States to apply the current rules and to improve the functioning of existing tools. The Agency has gained experience and earned credibility for its work as regards practical cooperation among Member States and in supporting them to implement their obligations under the CEAS. In time, the tasks undertaken by EASO progressively evolved so as to meet the growing needs of Member States and of the CEAS as a whole. The Member States increasingly rely on the operational and technical support of the Agency. The Agency has gained significant knowledge and experience in the field of asylum and it is time to transform it into a centre of expertise in its own right and not one that still significantly relies on information and expertise provided by Member States.\n\n\nIn the Commission's view, the Agency is one of the tools that can be used to effectively address the structural weaknesses in the CEAS which have been further exacerbated by large scale and uncontrolled arrival of migrants and asylum seekers to the European Union particularly during the past year. It would not be plausible to reform the CEAS without providing the Agency with a mandate that corresponds to the demands that the reform will entail. It is essential to equip the Agency with the means necessary to assist Member States in crisis situations, but it is all the more necessary to build a solid legal, operational and practical framework for the Agency to be able to reinforce and complement the asylum and reception systems of Member States.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with the comprehensive long-term policy on better migration management as set out by the Commission in the European Agenda on Migration, which developed President Juncker's Political Guidelines into a set of coherent and mutually reinforcing initiatives based on four pillars. Those pillars consist of reducing the incentive for irregular migration, securing external borders and saving lives, a strong asylum policy and a new policy on legal migration. This proposal further implements the European Agenda on Migration, more specifically as regards the objective of strengthening the Union's asylum policy since the European Union Agency for Asylum will ensure a full and coherent implementation of the CEAS.\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposal of unlimited duration\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode planned\n40\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2611 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe European Union Agency for Asylum has a duty to report on its activities. The Agency must draw up an annual activity report on the situation of asylum, in which it needs to evaluate the results of the activities it carries out throughout the year. The report must contain a comparative analysis of the Agency's activities so that the Agency may improve the quality, consistency and effectiveness of the CEAS. That annual activity report must be transmitted by the Agency to the Management Board, the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\nThe Commission must commission an evaluation within three years of entry into force of this Regulation, and then every five years thereafter, to assess particularly the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency and its working practices. That evaluation must cover the Agency's impact on practical cooperation on asylum-related matters and on the CEAS. The Commission must send the evaluation report together with its conclusions on the report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board. The findings of the evaluation must be made public.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risks identified \n\n\n\n- An extension of the Agency's existing competences is necessary to ensure the implementation of the CEAS and that of the reformed Dublin system. Reinforcement of the Agency's staffing and resources is necessary to ensure the fulfilment of its mission.\u00a0Without these changes, the CEAS is put at risk.\n\n\n- Large and uncontrolled migratory flows which continue to put asylum and reception systems under pressure thereby delaying the transition from emergency mode to orderly management the migration and asylum systems.\n\n\n- Staff recruitment: the rhythm of staff recruitment may pose a risk given that the Agency's current capacity is still reduced, recruitment is relatively slow and the increasing volume of emerging tasks. The Commission seeks to mitigate this aspect by providing continuous support and monitoring.\n\n\n- Delay in the adoption of the legal basis for the amended Dublin system and related IT developments that should be operated and managed by the Agency could impede the fulfilment of the Agency's new tasks in this respect.\n\n\n- Continued heavy reliance on Member State knowledge and delay for the Agency in developing its own knowledge base and becoming a true centre of expertise in its own right.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Control methods envisaged\n\n\n\nThe Agency's accounts will be submitted for approval of the Court of Auditors and subject to the discharge procedure. The Commission's Internal Audit Service will carry out audits in cooperation with the Agency's internal auditor.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\n- The Agency: The Executive Directive will implement the Agency\u2019s budget. Each year the Executive Director will submit to the Commission, the Management Board and the Court of Auditors the detailed accounts of all revenue and expenditure from the previous financial year. In addition, the Commission\u2019s Internal Audit Service will assist in the management of the Agency\u2019s financial operations by controlling risks, monitoring compliance by providing an independent opinion on the quality of management and control systems and making recommendations in order to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of operations and to ensure economy in the use of the Agency\u2019s resources.\n\n\nThe Agency will adopt its Financial Regulation following the Delegation Regulation No 1271/2013, after having received the agreement of the Commission and the Court of Auditors. The Agency will put in place an internal audit system similar to that introduced by the Commission in the framework of its own restructuring.\n\n\n- Cooperation with OLAF: the staff subject to the Commission\u2019s Staff Regulations will cooperate with OLAF to combat fraud.\n\n\n- Court of Auditors: the Court of Auditors will examine the accounts in accordance with Article 248 of the Treaty and publish an annual report on the Agency\u2019s activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL \n\n\n3.1.Heading of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line

proposal follows the 5% staff reduction reform (2013-2017) by reducing the Agency's staff gradually at a rate of 1% for the establishment plan for 2017 (a similar reduction rate was followed in the years 2013-2016). \n\n\n\n\nIn the course of 2014-2015, the Agency's establishment plan was reinforced with additional 40 posts to enable it to address the asylum related needs of different Member
