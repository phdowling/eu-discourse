"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 27.1.2016\nCOM(2016) 31 final\n2016/0014(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\non the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n{SWD(2016) 9 final}{SWD(2016) 10 final}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n1.1.Grounds for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe legal framework for the type-approval of automotive products covers three categories of vehicles: motor vehicles and their trailers, motorcycles, and tractors. The objective of this proposal is to revise the legal framework for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers. The legal framework for the two other vehicle categories has already been the subject of a major revision in 2013.\n\n\nType-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers are currently set out in Directive\u00a02007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Framework Directive\u2019)\n1\n. This framework aims at facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles and trailers in the internal market by laying down harmonised requirements designed to achieve common environmental and safety objectives. Directive\u00a02007/46/EC covers motor vehicles for the carriage of passengers (category\u00a0M) and of goods (category\u00a0N), and their trailers (category\u00a0O), as well as their systems and components. It provides a framework under which separate regulatory acts with specific safety and environmental requirements are operating. These regulatory acts deal with a multitude of detailed technical requirements for different types of vehicles, systems and components.\n\n\nAs part of the commitments the Commission made in its CARS2020\u00a0Action\u00a0Plan for a strong, competitive and sustainable European car industry\n2\n, the EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles has been the subject of a comprehensive fitness check in 2013. It confirmed that the EU type-approval legal framework is appropriate for achieving the main goals of harmonisation, effective operation of the internal market and fair competition. However, it was also recognised that differences in interpretation and strictness in application of the requirements across Member States are reducing the effectiveness of the framework. The Commission Staff Working document on this Fitness Check therefore acknowledged room for improvement and singled out the review of Directive\u00a02007/46/EC as a matter of priority, with the need to focus on the following aspects:\n\n\n\u2013introduction of market surveillance provisions to complement the type-approval requirements;\n\n\n\u2013clarification of the recall and safeguard procedures, as well as the conditions for granting extensions to approvals for existing types of vehicle;\n\n\n\u2013improving the enforcement of the type-approval framework by harmonising and enhancing the type-approval and conformity of production procedures applied by Member State authorities and technical services;\n\n\n\u2013clarification of the roles and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain, and of the authorities and parties involved in the enforcement of the framework; and\n\n\n\u2013improving the suitability of alternative type-approval schemes (national small series and individual approvals) and of the multi-stage type-approval process to provide appropriate flexibility for niche markets and SMEs, without however distorting the level playing field.\n\n\nAlthough the fitness check confirmed that the existing regulatory framework has its merits in meeting policy objectives, it has come under harsh criticism after the discovery that a German manufacturer (VW) had for several years used software to manipulate the emission performance of its cars. Within a week of the outbreak of the scandal, the Commission announced that it would reinforce the type-approval system, in particular by ensuring adequate supervisory mechanisms to ensure a correct and harmonised application of the type-approval procedures. In an internal market with 28 Member States and in a sector subject to constant technological and scientific progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules entail the risk of undermining the effectiveness of the system and therefore the main policy objectives of ensuring the safety and health of citizens and the protection of the environment. Many stakeholders openly called for such a revision in the aftermath of the VW scandal.\n\n\nThis revision aims to overcome these flaws and gaps and to restore the citizen's trust in the capability of the regulatory system to ensure an adequate level of protection of health and the environment.\n\n\n1.2.Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\n\n\n\u2013Directive\u00a02007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and technical units intended for such vehicles.\n\n\n\u2013Regulation\u00a0765/2008/EC on accreditation and market surveillance, containing rules for the European policy on accreditation\n3\n (control of the competence of laboratories and certification/inspection bodies delivering certificates in the EU) and for the policy in the field of market surveillance and controls of products from third countries (for safe products whatever their origin).\n\n\n\u2013Decision\u00a0768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products\n4\n, containing standard provisions to be used in EU internal market legislation for products (e.g. definitions, obligations of economic operators, safeguard clause, etc.).\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe European Commission launched a public consultation in 2010\n5\n, seeking to gather the views of interested parties on its intention to revise the framework directive. The aim of this public consultation was to verify whether the areas identified by the Commission services as having a potential for improving the enforcement of EU type-approval legislation for motor vehicles would provide the right scope and focus for the envisaged review of Framework Directive\u00a02007/46/EC.\n\n\n\n\nForty relevant responses were received which, overall, indicated a strong support for the aims of the initiative. Whilst 74% of the respondents concurred that the current type-approval framework was already of fairly high quality, 57.6% of them considered that nonetheless more could be done to emphasise and properly focus the legal application of market surveillance principles, with 47% of respondents saying that existing market surveillance provisions are ineffective, while just 2.9% agreed it was effective. This outcome clearly demonstrated that stakeholders share the view that more can and should be done to complement the ex-ante controls offered by the type-approval framework with ex-post market surveillance provisions.\n\n\nThe Commission services also commissioned a number of external studies to accompany and feed in to the Impact Assessment process. An ex-post evaluation study\n6\n on the framework directive was carried out in the first half of 2011, followed by an impact assessment (IA) study\n7\n in the second half of 2011. This study assessed the impact of the possible options developed for each of the needs identified by the Commission services and which were confirmed to be relevant by the public consultation. Based on the results of the public consultation and the IA study, a preferred combination of policy options for addressing these needs has been identified.\n\n\nFurther work on the preparation of the impact assessment and the review of the Framework Directive was undertaken in 2012/2013 by means of a fitness check pilot project. A study contract has been awarded for that purpose which was finalised in March 2013. A Commission Staff working document reporting on the outcome of the fitness check pilot project was published in November 2013\n8\n, highlighting the priorities for the envisaged revision of Directive\u00a02007/46/EC (See point\u00a01.1 above).\n\n\nHigh level involvement of stakeholders has taken place in the context of the CARS 21 High Level Group, resulting in a number of recommendations in relation to the type-approval framework that have been taken up by the Commission in its CARS 2020 Action Plan adopted in November 2012.\n\n\nFinally, and in line with the commitments the European Commission made in its CARS\u00a02020\u00a0Action\u00a0Plan, a competitiveness proofing study has been carried out in the second half of 2013 to complement the above mentioned actions. The need for mitigating measures for SMEs has been considered in the context of this study, which demonstrated that for the combination of policy options retained there would not be any significant impacts for the SMEs in the sector to the extent that they would require mitigating measures.\n\n\nIn addition, specific exchanges with Member States' authorities have taken place during the entire impact assessment process at meetings of the Technical Committee Motor Vehicles (TCMV) and the Type-Approval Authorities Experts Group (TAAEG). Exchange of views with industry and user associations about the initiative have taken place in the framework for the Motor Vehicles Working Group (MVWG). All interested stakeholders have also been consulted by the external study contractors for the collection of data and views.\n\n\nTriggered by the outburst of the VW emissions scandal, the European Parliament adopted on 5 October 2015 a Resolution on emission measurements in the automotive sector, calling on the Commission for significantly strengthening the current EU type approval regime including more EU oversight, in particular with regard to market surveillance, coordination and follow up regime for vehicles sold in the Union.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n3.1.Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\u00a0114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\n\n3.2.Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nThe framework legislation for the type-approval of motor vehicles contributes to the implementation of the internal market for goods. This proposal envisages at rendering the implementation and enforcement of this legislation more effective as part of the overall policy objective to deepen the internal market strategy.\n\n\nAlthough Member States are responsible for the implementation of the legislation in their territory, ensuring a harmonised and co-ordinated approach based on commonly applicable criteria and uniformly applied by Member States is essential for maintaining a level playing field across the EU by means of a harmonised interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the type-approval requirements, and backed-up by harmonised provisions on market surveillance to provide Member States with adequate means for post-market controls and for taking effective and common remedial action against the presence of non-compliant and unsafe products on the market.\n\n\nThe differences in the national organisation of type-approval and market surveillance in the Member States may give rise to a non-harmonised enforcement when viewed in the framework of the Union's Internal Market which no longer has internal borders and where controls at national borders have practically disappeared. To avoid that non-compliant products are placed on their territory, Member States also depend to a large extent on the effectiveness of the enforcement policy of their neighbours. Consequently, weaknesses in enforcement by one single Member State can seriously undermine the efforts taken by other Member States to prevent non-compliant products from entering their market. This interdependence is reinforced by the fact that the competence of enforcement authorities is limited to the national territory. Where remedial action is needed beyond the border, these authorities must rely on their colleagues in other Member States.\n\n\nThis is due to fact that the type-approval framework is based on the principle that all new vehicles produced in conformity with a type of vehicle approved by one Member State benefit from the right of being freely marketed and registered in the other Member States. This right applies to all such vehicles, irrespective of their origin of production. This means that also vehicles produced outside the EU can be freely imported within the EU provided they the manufacturer has certified that they have been produced in compliance with a type of vehicle approved in one of the EU Member States. In view of the global nature of automotive sector, with substantial imports of automotive products from outside the EU, this important cross-border dimension calls for co-ordinated action at EU level to ensure a level playing field.\n\n\nIf actions were to be taken individually by Member States at national level to address market problems, this may entail the risk of creating obstacles to the free movement of motor vehicles ensured by the framework legislation. Hence it is justified to take action at EU level.\n\n\n3.3.Proportionality principle\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and environmental protection.\n\n\nThe measures proposed to reinforce and further harmonise the implementation of the type-approval procedures are based on the agreed principles laid down in the common framework for the marketing of products, and on the reference provisions for Union harmonisation legislation for products as laid down in Annex\u00a0I of Decision No\u00a0768/2008/EC. Where necessary and justified, these provisions have been adapted to the specificities of the automotive sector, in particular with the view to recognise the existence of an already well-established type-approval framework and to ensure full coherence with this framework. This has in particular the case for the provisions on the information exchange and co-operation between market surveillance authorities on the one hand and the type-approval authorities and their designated technical services on the other.\n\n\n3.4.Choice of instruments\n\n\n\n\nThe use of a Regulation is considered to be appropriate in that it provides the required assurance for direct and harmonised application and enforcement while not requiring transposition into Member States\u2019 legislation.\n\n\nThe proposal continues to build on the \u2018split-level approach\u2019 already introduced in the EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles. This approach provides for legislation in three steps:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u2013the fundamental provisions and scope are laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article\u00a0114\u00a0TFEU in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\n\n\u2013the detailed technical specifications associated with the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article\u00a0290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2013implementing acts setting out the administrative provisions, such as the template for the information document and the type-approval certificates, the certificate of conformity, etc. will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article\u00a0291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\nThe budgetary implications of this proposal are as follows:\n\n\n\uf0b7Commission staff to organise and participate in 'joint assessments' of technical services;\n\n\n\uf0b7Costs for national assessors participating in 'joint assessments' of technical services in accordance with the Commission's rules on the reimbursement of expenses incurred by experts;\n\n\n\uf0b7Commission staff to provide scientific, technical and logistic support to the peer review system (joint audits of technical services)and to the coordination of Member States' market surveillance activities in the field of automotive products;\n\n\n\uf0b7Commission staff to manage and further develop the EU regulatory framework for the type-approval and market-surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (functioning of this Regulation and preparation of delegated/implementing acts) and to support and monitor Member States in ensuring its effective and efficient implementation;\n\n\n\uf0b7Costs for organising meetings of the Enforcement Forum laid down in Article\u00a010, including reimbursement of the travel expenses of the Member States;\n\n\n\uf0b7Costs for the establishment and management of the supervisory mechanism in respect of conformity assessments carried out by technical services;\n\n\n\uf0b7Costs for running compliance and conformity testing of motor vehicles by the Commission and\n\n\n\uf0b7Costs for participation in international regulatory cooperation, in particular in UNECE;\n\n\nDetails of the costs are set out in the legislative financial statement.\n\n\nIn view of the constraints of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 the implementation of the legislative proposal will have to be built on existing resources and to be designed in such a manner that additional financial resources under the EU budget are not needed. Actions foreseen in this draft proposal for a Regulation will have no budgetary impact on EU budget over and beyond the appropriations already foreseen in the official financial programming of the Commission as any requirements for financial resources would have to be met through assigned revenues and internal redeployment.\n\n\nFor the period following 31 December 2020, the amount shall be subject to the multiannual financial framework in force for the period commencing in 2021, in accordance with Article\u00a0312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n5.OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\n\n5.1.European Economic Area\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed act concerns matters relating to the European Economic Area (EEA) and should therefore be extended to the EEA.\n\n\n5.2.Repeal of existing legislation\n\n\nThe adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation.\n\n\n2016/0014 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n9\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. Internal market rules should be transparent, simple and consistent, thus providing legal certainty and clarity for the benefit of businesses and consumers.\n\n\n(2)To that end, a comprehensive EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, was established by Directive\u00a02007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n.\n\n\n(3)An assessment of the Union legal framework for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, carried out in 2013\n11\n, showed that the framework established by Directive\u00a02007/46/EC is appropriate for achieving the main goals of harmonisation, effective operation of the internal market and fair competition, and therefore should continue to apply.\n\n\n(4)In that assessment it was concluded, however, that there is a need to introduce market surveillance provisions to complement the type-approval requirements, a need to clarify the recall and safeguard procedures, as well as the conditions for granting extensions to approvals for existing types of vehicle, a need to improve the enforcement of the type-approval framework by harmonising and enhancing the type-approval and conformity of production procedures applied by Member States' authorities and technical services, a need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain, and of the authorities and parties involved in the enforcement of the framework, and a need to improve the suitability of alternative type-approval schemes (national small series and individual vehicle approvals) and of the multi-stage type-approval process to provide appropriate flexibility for niche markets and SMEs, without however distorting the level playing field.\n\n\n(5)In addition, recent problems encountered with the implementation of the type-approval framework have revealed particular weaknesses and demonstrate the need for a fundamental revision to ensure a robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework that provides a high level of safety and of health and environmental protection.\n\n\n\n\n(6)This Regulation sets out the harmonised rules and principles for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and the individual vehicle approval, with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for the benefit of businesses and consumers and to offer a high level of safety and protection of health and the environment.\n\n\n(7)This Regulation lays down the substantive technical and administrative type-approval requirements for motor vehicles of categories M and N and their trailers (category O), and for the systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles with a view to ensuring an adequate level of safety and environmental performance. These categories cover motor vehicles for the carriage of passengers, motor vehicles for the carriage of goods, and their trailers, respectively.\n\n\n(8)This Regulation should strengthen the current type-approval framework, in particular through the introduction of provisions on market surveillance. Market surveillance in the automotive sector should be introduced by specifying the obligations of the economic operators in the supply chain, the responsibilities of the enforcement authorities in the Member States, and the measures to be taken when automotive products are encountered on the market that represent serious safety or environmental risks or that do not comply with the type-approval requirements.\n\n\n(9)An effective implementation of the type-approval requirements should be ensured by enhancing the provisions on conformity of production by, inter alia, providing for mandatory periodic audits of the conformity control methods and the continued conformity of the products concerned and by reinforcing the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that carry out tests for whole-vehicle type-approval under the responsibility of type-approval authorities . The proper functioning of technical services is crucial for ensuring a high level of safety and environmental protection and citizens' confidence in the system. The criteria for designation of technical services provided by Directive 2007/46/EC should be laid down in greater detail in order to assure their consistent application. The assessment methods of technical services in the Member States have a tendency to progressively differ due to the increased complexity of their work. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for procedural obligations that ensure an information exchange and monitoring of Member States' practices for the assessment, designation, notification and monitoring of their technical services. Those procedural obligations should remove any existing discrepancies in the methods used and in the interpretation of the criteria for the designation of technical services.\n\n\n(10)The need for control and monitoring of technical services by the designating authorities has increased since technical progress has raised the risk that technical services do not possess the necessary competence to test new technologies or devices emerging within their scope of designation. As technical progress shortens product cycles and as the intervals of surveillance on-site assessments and of the monitoring vary between designating authorities, minimum requirements with regard to the intervals of the surveillance and monitoring of the technical services should be established.\n\n\n(11)Designation and monitoring of technical services by the Member States, in accordance with detailed and strict criteria, should therefore be subject to supervisory controls at Union level, including independent audits as a condition for the renewal of their notification after five years. The position of technical services vis-\u00e0-vis manufacturers should be strengthened, including their right and duty to carry out unannounced factory inspections and to conduct physical or laboratory tests on products covered by this Regulation, in order to ensure continuous compliance by manufacturers after they have obtained a type-approval for their products.\n\n\n(12)In order to increase transparency and mutual trust and to further align and develop the criteria for the assessment, designation, and notification of technical services, as well as extension and renewal procedures, Member States should cooperate with each other and with the Commission. They should consult each other and the Commission on questions with general relevance for the implementation of this Regulation and inform each other and the Commission on their model assessment checklist.\n\n\n(13)Where designation of a technical service is based on accreditation in the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n, accreditation bodies and designating authorities should exchange information relevant for the assessment of the competence of technical services.\n\n\n(14)The Member States should levy fees for the designation and monitoring of technical services to ensure sustainability of the monitoring of those technical services by Member States and to establish a level playing field for technical services. In order to ensure transparency, the Member States should inform the Commission and the other Member States before they adopt the level and structure of the fees.\n\n\n(15)When, in spite of the measures taken to ensure a coherent application and follow up of the requirements by the Member States, the competence of a technical service is in doubt, the Commission should have the possibility to investigate individual cases.\n\n\n(16)In order to ensure that tests and reports provided by technical services are not influenced by non-legitimate circumstances, the organisation and operation of technical services should ensure full impartiality. To be able to carry out their tasks in a coherent and systematic manner the technical services should possess a satisfactory management system including provisions on professional secrecy. In order to allow technical services to perform their work properly, the level of knowledge and competence and independence of their personnel should be guaranteed at all times.\n\n\n(17)The independence of technical services vis-\u00e0-vis manufacturers should be ensured, including by avoiding direct or indirect payments by the manufacturers for the type-approval inspections and tests they have carried out. Therefore the Member States should establish a type-approval fee structure that should cover the costs for carrying out all type-approval tests and inspections carried out by the technical services designated by the type-approval authority, as well as the administrative costs for issuing the type-approval and the costs for carrying out ex-post compliance verification tests and inspections.\n\n\n(18)A robust compliance enforcement mechanism is necessary in order to ensure that the requirements under this Regulation are met. Ensuring compliance with the type-approval and conformity of production requirements of the legislation governing the automotive sector should remain the key responsibility of the approval authorities, as it is an obligation closely linked to the issuing of the type-approval and requires detailed knowledge of its content. It is therefore important that the performance of approval authorities is regularly verified by means of peer-reviews, to ensure that a uniform level of quality and stringency is applied by all approval authorities in enforcing the type-approval requirements. Moreover, it is important to provide for the verification of the correctness of the type approval itself.\n\n\n(19)Closer coordination between national authorities through information exchange and coordinated assessments under the direction of a coordinating authority is fundamental for ensuring a consistently high level of safety and health and environmental protection within the internal market. This should also lead to more efficient use of scarce resources at national level. For this purpose a Forum should be established for Member States and the Commission to exchange information on and to coordinate their activities related to the enforcement of type-approval legislation. The currently informal cooperation between Member States in this respect would benefit from a more formal framework.\n\n\n(20)The rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to motor vehicles and their trailers, and to systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles without preventing Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks. Market surveillance may be a competence shared between different national authorities to take account of the national market surveillance systems in the Member States established under Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008. Effective coordination and monitoring at Union and national levels should guarantee that approval and market surveillance authorities enforce the new type-approval and market surveillance framework.\n\n\n(21)It is necessary to include rules on market surveillance in this Regulation in order to reinforce the rights and obligations of the national competent authorities, to ensure effective coordination of their market surveillance activities and to clarify the applicable procedures.\n\n\n(22)In order to increase transparency in the approval process and facilitate the exchange of information and the independent verification by market surveillance authorities, approval authorities and the Commission, type approval documentation should be provided in electronic format and be made publicly available, subject to exemptions due to protection of commercial interests and the protection of personal data.\n\n\n(23)The obligations of national authorities concerning market surveillance provided in this Regulation are more specific than those laid down in Article\u00a019 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008 to take account of the specificities of the type-approval framework and the need to complement that framework with an effective market surveillance mechanism ensuring a robust ex-post verification of compliance of the products covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n(24)Those more specific obligations for national authorities provided in this Regulation should include ex-post compliance verification testing and inspections of a sufficient number of vehicles placed on the market. The selection of the vehicles to be subject to this ex-post compliance verification should be based on an appropriate risk assessment which takes account of the seriousness of the possible non-compliance and the likelihood of its occurrence.\n\n\n(25)In addition, the Commission should organise and carry out or require to carry out ex-post compliance verification tests and inspections, independent from those carried out by Member States under their national market surveillance obligations. When non-compliance is established by those tests and inspections, or where it is found that a type approval has been granted on the basis of incorrect data the Commission should be entitled to initiate Union-wide remedial actions to restore the conformity of the vehicles concerned and to investigate the reasons for the incorrectness of the type approval. Appropriate funding should be ensured in the general budget of the Union to enable the execution of such compliance verification testing and inspections. In view of the budgetary constraints of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 the implementation of the legislative proposal will have to be built on existing resources and to be designed in such a manner that they do not generate additional financial resources. The Commission should be entitled to impose administrative fines where non-compliance is established.\n\n\n\n\n(26)In order to ensure a high level of vehicle functional safety, the protection of vehicle's occupants and other road users, and environmental protection, the technical requirements and environmental standards applicable to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units should continue to be harmonised and adapted to technical and scientific progress.\n\n\n(27)The objectives of this Regulation should not be affected by the fact that certain systems, components, separate technical units or parts and equipment can be fitted to or in a vehicle after that vehicle has been placed on the market, registered or entered into service. Appropriate measures should therefore be taken to ensure that the systems, components, separate technical units or parts and equipment that can be fitted to or in vehicles and that can significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety are controlled by an approval authority before they are placed on the market, registered or entered into service.\n\n\n(28)The EU type-approval system has to enable each Member State to confirm that every type of vehicle and every type of system, component and separate technical unit intended for such type of vehicle has undergone the tests and inspections provided for in this Regulation to verify its compliance with the type-approval requirements of this Regulation and that its manufacturer has obtained a type-approval certificate for it. The EU type-approval system obliges a manufacturer to produce his vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units in conformity with the approved type. A vehicle manufacturer has to certify this by issuing a certificate of conformity for every vehicle. Every vehicle accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity should be permitted to be made available on the market and registered for use throughout the Union.\n\n\n(29)Conformity of production is one of the cornerstones of the EU type-approval system, and therefore the arrangements set up by the manufacturer to ensure such conformity should be approved by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service designated for that purpose, and be subject to regular verification by means of independent periodic audits. In addition, approval authorities should ensure the verification of the continued conformity of the products concerned.\n\n\n(30)The continued validity of the type-approvals requires that the manufacturer informs the authority that has approved his type of vehicle about any changes to the characteristics of the type or the safety and environmental performance requirements applicable to that type. It is therefore important that the validity of issued type-approval certificates is limited in time and that those certificates can only be renewed when the approval authority has verified and is satisfied that the type of vehicle continues to comply with all the applicable requirements. Furthermore, the conditions for extending type-approvals should be clarified to ensure a uniform application of the procedures and enforcement of the type-approval requirements throughout the Union.\n\n\n(31)The assessment of reported serious risks to safety and of harm to public health and the environment should be conducted at national level, but coordination at Union level should be ensured where the reported risk or harm may exist beyond the territory of one Member State with the objective of sharing resources and ensuring consistency regarding the corrective action to be taken to mitigate the identified risk and harm.\n\n\n(32)In order to ensure that all vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units placed on the market offer a high level of safety and environmental protection, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain should take effective corrective measures, including the recall of vehicles, where a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit presents a serious risk for users or the environment as referred to in Article\u00a020 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008. Approval authorities should be empowered to assess and verify whether those measures are sufficient. The authorities of other Member States' should have the right to take safeguard measures in case they would consider that the manufacturer's corrective measures are not sufficient.\n\n\n(33)Appropriate flexibility should be provided by means of alternative type-approval schemes for manufacturers who produce vehicles in small series. They should be able to benefit from the advantages of the Union internal market provided that their vehicles comply with the specific EU type-approval requirements for vehicles produced in small series. In certain limited cases, it is appropriate to allow for national small series type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for vehicles produced in small series should be restricted to cases of very limited production. It is therefore necessary to define precisely the concept of vehicles produced in small series in terms of the number of vehicles produced, the requirements to be complied with and the conditions for placing those vehicles on the market. It is equally important to specify an alternative approval scheme for individual vehicles, in particular to provide sufficient flexibility for the approval of vehicles built in multiple stages.\n\n\n(34)The Union is a contracting party to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019)\n13\n. The Union has accepted a significant number of regulations annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement and has therefore the obligation to accept type-approvals issued in accordance with those regulations, as complying with the equivalent Union requirements. For the purpose of simplifying its type-approval framework and aligning it with the international framework of the UNECE, the Union in Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n\u00a0repealed its specific type-approval Directives and replaced them with the obligatory application of the relevant UNECE regulations. To reduce the administrative burden of the type-approval process, manufacturers of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units should be allowed to seek type-approval in accordance with this Regulation, where appropriate, directly by means of obtaining approval under the relevant UNECE regulations referred to in the Annexes to this Regulation.\n\n\n(35)Consequently, UNECE regulations and the amendments thereto which the Union has voted in favour of or that the Union applies, in accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC\n15\n, should be incorporated within the EU type-approval legislation. Accordingly, the power should be delegated to the Commission to amend the Annexes to this Regulation and to adopt delegated acts to ensure that the references to the UNECE regulations and their respective amendments in the list of the relevant regulatory acts are kept up-to-date.\n\n\n(36)Unrestricted access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, via a standardised format that can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition on the market for services providing such information is necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, particularly as regards the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. The requirements for the provision of repair and maintenance information have so far been laid down in Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n, Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0595/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n, Commission Regulation (EU)\u00a0No\u00a0692/2008\n18\n and Commission Regulation (EU)\u00a0No\u00a0582/2011\n19\n. Those requirements should be consolidated in this Regulation and Regulations (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0715/2007, (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0595/2009, (EU)\u00a0No 692/2008 and (EU)\u00a0No 582/2011 should be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(37)Whereas technical progress introducing new methods or techniques for vehicle diagnostics and repair, such as remote access to vehicle information and software, should not weaken the objectives of this Regulation with respect to access to repair and maintenance information for independent operators.\n\n\n(38)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\u00a0No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n.\n\n\n(39)In order to supplement this Regulation with further technical details, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of type-approval requirements concerning the environmental and safety performance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units for such vehicles. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n(40)Member States should lay down rules on penalties for the infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall report the imposed penalties to the Commission annually, to monitor the coherence of the implementation of these provisions.\n\n\n(41)In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2007/46/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. The adoption of a Regulation ensures that provisions are directly applicable and that they can be updated in a timely and more efficient manner to take better account of technical progress and regulatory developments in the context of the Revised 1958 Agreement.\n\n\n(42)In order to properly implement the compliance verification by the Commission and to ensure a level playing field for economic operators and national authorities, the Commission should be competent to impose harmonized administrative fines upon the economic operators found to have infringed upon this regulation regardless of where the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit was originally type-approved.\n\n\n(43)Whenever the measures provided for in this Regulation entail the processing of personal data, they should be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n, as well as the national implementing measures thereto.\n\n\n(44)In order to enable Member States and national authorities as well as economic operators to prepare for the application of the new rules introduced by the act, an application date following the entry into force should be set. \n\n\n(45)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to lay down harmonised rules on the administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of vehicles of categories M, N and O, and of systems, components and separate technical units, and on market surveillance of such vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n\n\n1.This Regulation establishes the administrative provisions and technical requirements for the type-approval and placing on the market of all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles referred to in Article\u00a02(1).

validity.\n\n\n2.Paragraph\u00a01 shall apply to complete vehicles for a period of 12 months from the date on which the EU type-approval became invalid, and to completed vehicles for a period of 18 months from that date.\n\n\n3.A manufacturer wishing to make available on the market, register or enter into service end-of-series vehicles in accordance with paragraph\u00a01 shall submit a request for that purpose to the national authority of the Member State that granted the EU type-approval. That request shall specify any technical or economic reasons preventing those vehicles from complying with the new type-approval requirements and shall include the VIN of the vehicles concerned.\n\n\n\n\nThe national authority concerned shall decide, within three months of receipt of that request, whether to permit the placing on the market, registration and entry into service of those vehicles within the territory of the Member State concerned and determine the number of vehicles in respect of which permission may be granted.\n\n\n4.Only end-of-series vehicles with a valid certificate of conformity that has remained valid for at least three months after its date of issue, but for which the type-approval has become invalid pursuant to point\u00a0(a) of Article\u00a033(2), may be made available on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union.\n\n\n5.The certificate of conformity of the vehicles made available on the market, registered or entered into service in accordance with this Article shall include a special entry indicating that those vehicles are end-of-series vehicles, as well as the date until which those vehicles may be made available on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union.\n\n\n6.Member States shall keep records of the VIN of the vehicles that they permitted to be made available on the market, registered or entered into service in accordance with this Article.\n\n\nArticle 48\nMaking available on the market or entry into service\nof components and separate technical units\n\n\n1.Components or separate technical units, including those intended for the aftermarket, may only be made available on the market or entered into service where they comply with the requirements of the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex\u00a0IV and are marked in accordance with Article\u00a036.\n\n\n2.Paragraph\u00a01 shall not apply to components or separate technical units specifically constructed or designed for new vehicles that are not covered by this Regulation.\n\n\n3.Member States may permit the making available on the market or entry into service of components or separate technical units that are exempted under Article\u00a037 or to be used on vehicles covered by approvals granted under Article\u00a039,\u00a040,\u00a042 and 43 concerning the component or separate technical unit in question.\n\n\n4.Member States may also permit the making available on the market or entry into service of components or separate technical units to be used on vehicles that were not required to be type-approved under this Regulation or under Directive 2007/46/EC at the time those vehicles were made available on the market, registered or entered into service.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\nSAFEGUARD CLAUSES\n\n\nArticle 49\nProcedure for dealing with vehicles, systems, components\nor separate technical units presenting a serious risk at national level\n\n\n1.Market surveillance authorities of one Member State that have taken action pursuant to Article\u00a020 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008 and Article\u00a08 of this Regulation, or that have sufficient reason to believe that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit covered by this Regulation presents a serious risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation, shall inform without delay the approval authority that granted the approval about its findings.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The approval authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned covering all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate fully with the approval and market surveillance authorities.\n\n\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the approval authority that granted the approval finds that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall require without delay the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective measures to bring the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into compliance with those requirements, or take restrictive measures, either to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, depending on the nature of the risk.\n\n\nArticle\u00a021 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008 shall apply to the restrictive measures referred to in the second subparagraph.\n\n\n3.The relevant approval authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation referred to in paragraph\u00a01 and the action required of the economic operator.\n\n\n4.The economic operator shall, in accordance with the obligations referred to in Articles\u00a011 to 19, ensure that all appropriate corrective measures are taken in respect of all non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that it has placed on the market, registered or has entered into service in the Union.\n\n\n5.Where the economic operator does not take adequate corrective measures within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph\u00a02, the national authorities shall take all appropriate provisional restrictive measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units on their national market, or to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.\n\n\nArticle 50\nNotification and objection procedures \nrelated to restrictive measures taken at national level\n\n\n1.The national authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States without delay of the restrictive measures taken in accordance with Article\u00a049(1) and\u00a0(5).\n\n\n\n\nThe information provided shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, its origin, the nature of the non-conformity alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national restrictive measures taken, and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator.\n\n\n2.The approval authority referred to in Article\u00a049(1) shall indicate whether the non-conformity is due to either of the following:\n\n\n(a)failure of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons, the protection of the environment or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation;\n\n\n(b)shortcomings in the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex\u00a0IV.\n\n\n3.Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure shall inform within one month of the receipt of the information referred to in paragraph\u00a01 the Commission and the other Member States of any restrictive measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-conformity of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.\n\n\n4.Where, within one month of the receipt of the information referred to in paragraph\u00a01, an objection has been raised by either another Member State or the Commission in respect of a restrictive measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be evaluated by the Commission in accordance with Article\u00a051.\n\n\n5.Where, within one month of the receipt of the information referred to in paragraph\u00a01, no objection has been raised by either another Member State or the Commission in respect of a restrictive measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. The other Member States shall ensure that similar restrictive measures are taken in respect of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned.\n\n\nArticle 51\nUnion safeguard procedure\n\n\n1.Where, during the procedure set out in Article\u00a050(3) and (4), objections have been raised against a restrictive measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission has considered that a national measure is contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall evaluate without delay the national measure after having consulted the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt a decision on whether the national measure is considered justified or not. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to the relevant economic operators. The Member States shall implement the Commission decision without delay and inform the Commission accordingly.\n\n\n2.Where the Commission considers the national measure to be justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. Where the Commission considers the national measure to be unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw or adapt the measure, in accordance with the Commission decision referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\n3.Where the national measure is considered justified and is attributed to shortcomings in regulatory acts referred to in Annex\u00a0IV, the Commission shall propose appropriate measures as follows:\n\n\n(a)where regulatory acts are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary amendments to the act concerned;\n\n\n(b)where UNECE regulations are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary draft amendments to the relevant UNECE regulations in accordance with the provisions of Annex\u00a0III of Council Decision 97/836/EC.\n\n\nArticle 52\nCompliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units\nthat present a serious risk to safety or serious harm to health and the environment\n\n\n1.Where, having performed an evaluation under Article\u00a049(1), a Member State finds that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, although they comply with the applicable requirements or are properly marked, present a serious risk to safety or may seriously harm the environment or public health, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective measures to ensure that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, when placed on the market, registered or entered into service, no longer presents that risk, or it shall take restrictive measures to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, depending on the nature of the risk.\n\n\nThe Member State may refuse to register such vehicles until the economic operator has taken all appropriate corrective measures.\n\n\n2.The economic operator shall ensure that appropriate corrective measures are taken in respect of all vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\n3.The Member State shall within one month of the request referred to in paragraph\u00a01 provide the Commission and the other Member States with all available information, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national restrictive measures taken.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall consult without delay the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and, in particular, the approval authority that granted the type-approval, and shall evaluate the national measure taken. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure referred to in paragraph\u00a01 is considered justified or not, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\n\n\n5.The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to the relevant economic operator or operators.\n\n\nArticle 53\nGeneral provisions related to non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units \n\n\n1.Where vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type, or are not in conformity with this regulation or were approved on the basis of incorrect data, the approval authorities, market surveillance authorities or the Commission may take the necessary restrictive measures in accordance with Article\u00a021 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008, to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, registration or entry into service on the market of non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, or to withdraw them from that market or to recall them, including the withdrawal of the type-approval by the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval, until the relevant economic operator has taken all appropriate corrective measures to ensure that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units are brought into conformity.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of paragraph\u00a01, deviations from the particulars in the EU type-approval certificate or the information package shall be deemed to constitute a failure to conform to the approved type.\n\n\nArticle 54\nNotification and objection procedures related to non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units \n\n\n1.Where an approval authority or market surveillance authority finds that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units are not in conformity with this Regulation or that the type-approval has been granted on the basis of incorrect data or that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type, it may take all appropriate restrictive measures in accordance with Article\u00a053(1).\n\n\n2.The approval authority or market surveillance authority or the Commission shall also request the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval to verify that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production continue to conform to the approved type or, where applicable, that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units already placed on the market are brought back into conformity. \n\n\n3.In the case of a whole-vehicle type-approval, where the non-conformity of a vehicle is due to a system, component or separate technical unit, the request referred to in paragraph\u00a02 shall also be addressed to the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval for that system, component or separate technical unit.\n\n\n4. In the case of a multi-stage type-approval, where the non-conformity of a completed vehicle is due to a system, component or separate technical unit that forms part of the incomplete vehicle or to the incomplete vehicle itself, the request referred to in paragraph\u00a02 shall also be addressed to the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval for that system, component, separate technical unit or incomplete vehicle.\n\n\n5.On receipt of the request referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 to 4 the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units concerned covering all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The approval authority shall also verify the data on the basis of which the approval was granted. The relevant economic operators shall fully cooperate with the approval authority.\n\n\n6.Where non-conformity is established by the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval for a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, that approval authority shall require without delay the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective measures to bring the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into compliance and where necessary the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall take the measures referred to in Article\u00a053(1) as soon as possible and at the latest within one month of the date of the request.\n\n\n7.The national authorities taking restrictive measures in accordance with Article\u00a053(1) shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States.\n\n\n8.Where, within one month after the notification of the restrictive measures taken by an approval authority or a market surveillance authority in accordance with Article\u00a053(1), an objection has been raised by another Member State in respect of the notified restrictive measure or where the Commission establishes a non-compliance in accordance with Article\u00a09(5), the Commission shall consult without delay the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and, in particular, the approval authority that granted the type-approval, and shall evaluate the national measure taken. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission may decide to take the necessary restrictive measures foreseen in Article\u00a053(1) by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to the relevant economic operators. The Member States shall implement the Commission decision without delay and inform the Commission accordingly.\n\n\n9.Where, within one month after the notification of the restrictive measures taken in accordance with Article\u00a053(1), no objection has been raised by either another Member State or by the Commission in respect of a restrictive measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. The other Member States shall ensure that similar restrictive measures are taken in respect of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned.\n\n\nArticle 55\nPlacing on the market and entry into service of parts or equipment \nthat may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of essential systems\n\n\n1.Parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of systems that are essential for the safety of the vehicle or for its environmental performance shall not be placed on the market or entered into service and shall be prohibited, unless they have been authorised by an approval authority in accordance with Article\u00a056(1) and\u00a0(4).\n\n\n2.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a088 to lay down the requirements that the parts and equipment referred to in paragraph\u00a01 have to comply with.\n\n\nThose requirements may be based on the regulatory acts listed in Annex\u00a0IV or may consist of a comparison of the parts or equipment with the environmental or safety performance of the original parts or equipment, as appropriate. In either case, the requirements shall ensure that the parts or equipment do not impair the functioning of those systems that are essential for the safety of the vehicle or its environmental performance.\n\n\n3.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a088 to amend Annex\u00a0XIII to take account of technical and regulatory developments by updating the list of parts or equipment on the basis of information regarding:\n\n\n\n\n(a)the seriousness of the risk to the safety or environmental performance of vehicles fitted with the parts or equipment in question;\n\n\n(b)the potential effect on consumers and aftermarket manufacturers of a possible authorisation for the parts or equipment under Article\u00a056(1).\n\n\n4.Paragraph\u00a01 shall not apply to original parts or equipment and to parts or equipment belonging to a system that has been type-approved in accordance with the regulatory acts listed in Annex\u00a0IV, except where the type-approval relates to aspects other than the serious risk referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, original parts or equipment means parts or equipment that are manufactured according to the specifications and production standards provided by the vehicle manufacturer for the assembly of the vehicle in question.\n\n\n5.Paragraph\u00a01 shall not apply to parts or equipment that are exclusively produced for racing vehicles. Parts or equipment listed in Annex\u00a0XIII that are used both in racing and on the road shall not be made available for vehicles intended for use on public roads, unless they comply with the requirements laid down in the delegated acts referred to in paragraph\u00a02 and have been authorised by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nArticle 56\nRelated requirements for parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk\n to the correct functioning of essential systems\n\n\n1.A manufacturer of parts or equipment may apply for the authorisation referred to in Article\u00a055(1) by submitting to the approval authority an application accompanied by a test report that is drafted by a designated technical service and that certifies that the parts or equipment for which authorisation is sought comply with the requirements referred to in Article\u00a055(2). The manufacturer may submit only one application for each type of part or equipment and to one approval authority only.\n\n\n2.The application for the authorisation shall include details of the manufacturer of parts or equipment, the type, the identification and part numbers of the parts or equipment, the vehicle manufacturer\u2019s name, the type of vehicle and, where appropriate, the year of construction or any other information permitting the identification of the vehicle to which the parts or equipment are to be fitted.\n\n\nThe approval authority shall authorise the placement on the market and the entering into service of the parts or equipment where it finds, taking into account the test report referred to in paragraph\u00a01 and other evidence, that the parts or equipment in question comply with the requirements referred to in Article\u00a055(2).\n\n\nThe approval authority shall issue to the manufacturer without delay an authorisation certificate in accordance with the template set out in Appendix\u00a01 of Annex\u00a0XI, numbered in accordance with point\u00a02 of Annex\u00a0XI.\n\n\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a088 to amend Annex\u00a0XI to take account of technical and regulatory developments by updating the template and the numbering system for the authorisation certificate.\n\n\n3.The manufacturer shall inform without delay the approval authority that gave the authorisation of any change affecting the conditions under which the authorisation has been issued. That approval authority shall decide whether the authorisation has to be reviewed or reissued and whether further tests are necessary.\n\n\nThe manufacturer shall ensure that the parts or equipment are produced and continue to be produced under the conditions under which the authorisation has been issued.\n\n\n4.Before issuing any authorisation, the approval authority shall verify the existence of arrangements and procedures for ensuring effective control of the conformity of production.\n\n\nWhere the approval authority finds that the conditions for issuing the authorisation are no longer fulfilled, it shall request the manufacturer to take the necessary measures to ensure that the parts or equipment are brought into conformity. Where necessary, it shall withdraw the authorisation.\n\n\n5.Upon request of a national authority of another Member State, the approval authority that has issued the authorisation shall, within one month of the receipt of that request, send to the former a copy of the issued authorisation certificate together with its attachments by means of a common secure electronic exchange system. The copy may also take the form of a secure electronic file.\n\n\n6.An approval authority that disagrees with the authorisation issued by another Member State shall bring the reasons for its disagreement to the attention of the Commission. The Commission shall take the appropriate measures in order to resolve the disagreement, which may include, where necessary, requiring the withdrawal of the authorisation, after having consulted the relevant approval authorities. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\n7.Until the list referred to in Article\u00a055(3) has been established, Member States may maintain national provisions dealing with parts or equipment that may affect the correct functioning of systems essential for the safety of the vehicle or its environmental performance.\n\n\nArticle 57\nGeneral provisions on recall of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units\n\n\n1.A manufacturer who has been granted a whole-vehicle type-approval and is obliged to recall vehicles in accordance with Article\u00a012(1), Article\u00a015(1), Article\u00a017(2), Article\u00a049(1), Article\u00a049(6), Article\u00a051(4), Article\u00a052(1), and Article\u00a053(1) of this Regulation or Article\u00a020 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008, shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the whole-vehicle type-approval thereof.\n\n\n\n\n2.A manufacturer of systems, components or separate technical units, who has been granted an EU type-approval and is obliged to recall systems, components or separate technical units in accordance with Article\u00a012(1), Article\u00a015(1), Article\u00a017(2), Article\u00a049(1), Article\u00a049(6), Article\u00a051(4), Article\u00a052(1), and Article\u00a053(1) of this Regulation or Article\u00a020 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008, shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval.\n\n\n3.The manufacturer shall propose to the approval authority that granted the type-approval a set of appropriate remedies to bring the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in conformity and, where appropriate, to neutralise the serious risk referred to in Article\u00a020 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008.\n\n\nThe approval authority shall carry out an evaluation to verify whether the proposed remedies are sufficient and timely enough, and it shall communicate the remedies that it has approved to the approval authorities of the other Member States and to the Commission without delay.\n\n\nArticle 58\nSpecific provisions on recall of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units\n\n\n1.Where an approval authority or the Commission considers that the remedies referred to in Article\u00a057(3) are insufficient or are not implemented quickly enough, they shall notify their concern to the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval and the Commission without delay.\n\n\nThe approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall request the manufacturer to take corrective measures to address the concerns notified. Where the manufacturer does not propose and implement effective corrective measures, the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall take all restrictive measures required, including the withdrawal of the EU type-approval and mandatory recall, and inform the approval authorities of the other Member States and the Commission about the restrictive measures taken. In the case of withdrawal of the EU type-approval, the approval authority shall inform without delay the manufacturer by registered letter or equivalent electronic means of that withdrawal.\n\n\n2.Where an approval authority considers that the restrictive measures taken by the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval pursuant to article\u00a058(1) are not sufficient or timely enough, .it shall inform the Commission thereof and it may take appropriate restrictive measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of the concerned non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units on their national market, or to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.\n\n\n3.The Commission shall hold appropriate consultations with the parties involved and shall decide whether the restrictive measures taken by the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval are sufficient and timely enough, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures to ensure that the conformity is restored and/or the serious risk referred to in Article\u00a057(3) is effectively neutralised. That decision shall also address the suitability of the restrictive measures taken by approval authorities who considered the action taken by the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval as not sufficient or timely enough. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nThe Commission shall address its decision to the Member States concerned and shall immediately communicate it to the relevant economic operators.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall implement without delay the Commission decision and inform the Commission accordingly.\n\n\n5.Where, within one month of receipt of the notification regarding the approved remedies referred to in Article\u00a057(3), no objection has been raised against those remedies by either another Member State or the Commission, those remedies shall be deemed justified. The other Member States shall ensure that those remedies are applied in respect of the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units concerned that have been made available on the market, registered, or entered into service in their territory.\n\n\nArticle 59\nRight to be heard of economic operators, notification of decisions and remedies available\n\n\n1.Except in cases where immediate action is necessary for reasons of serious risk to human health, safety and the environment, the economic operator concerned shall be given the opportunity to make submissions to the national authority within an appropriate period of time before any measure pursuant to Articles\u00a049\u00a0to\u00a058 is adopted by the national authorities of the Member States.\n\n\nIf action has been taken without the economic operator\u2019s being heard, the economic operator shall have the opportunity to make submissions as soon as possible and the national authority shall review the measure promptly thereafter.\n\n\n2.Any measure adopted by the national authorities shall state the exact grounds on which it is based.\n\n\nWhere the measure is addressed to a specific economic operator, it shall be notified without delay to the economic operator concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available under the law of the Member State concerned and of the time limits to which such remedies are subject.\n\n\nWhere the measure is of general scope, it shall be appropriately published in the national official journal or in an equivalent instrument.\n\n\n3.Any measure adopted by the national authorities shall be immediately withdrawn or amended upon the economic operator\u2019s demonstrating that effective corrective action has been taken.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\nINTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS\n\n\nArticle 60\nUNECE regulations required for EU type-approval\n\n\n\n\n1.UNECE regulations or amendments thereto which the Union has voted in

Where necessary to ensure the safety of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units already placed on the market, the designating type-approval authority shall instruct the concerned approval authorities to suspend or withdraw within a reasonable period of time, any certificates which were unduly issued.\n\n\n4.The other certificates which were issued on the basis of inspection and test reports issued by the technical service for which the notification has been suspended, restricted or withdrawn shall remain valid in the following circumstances:\n\n\n(a)in the case of suspension of a notification, on condition that, within three months after the suspension, the type-approval authority that issued the type-approval certificate confirms in writing to the type-approval authorities of the other Member States and the Commission that it is assuming the functions of the technical service during the period of suspension;\n\n\n(b)in the case of restriction or withdrawal of a notification, for a period of three months after the restriction or withdrawal. The type-approval authority that issued the certificates may extend the validity of the certificates for further periods of three months, for a maximum period altogether, of twelve months, provided it is assuming during that period the functions of the technical service whose notification has been restricted or withdrawn.\n\n\nThe type-approval authority assuming the functions of the technical service shall immediately inform the other type-approval authorities, the other technical services and the Commission thereof.\n\n\n\n\n5.An extension of the scope of the technical service's designation may be granted in accordance with the procedure set out in Article\u00a077 and subject to the notification referred to in Article\u00a078.\n\n\n6.A designation as technical service can only be renewed after the type-approval authority has verified whether the technical service continues to comply with the requirements of this Regulation. That assessment shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure set out in Article\u00a077.\n\n\nArticle 80\nMonitoring of technical services\n\n\n1.The type-approval authority shall continuously monitor the technical services to ensure compliance with the requirements set out in Articles\u00a072\u00a0to\u00a076, in Articles\u00a084 and 85 and in Appendix\u00a02 to Annex\u00a0V. \n\n\nTechnical services shall, on request, supply all relevant information and documents, required to enable that type-approval authority to verify compliance with those requirements.\n\n\nTechnical services shall, without delay, inform the type-approval authority of any changes, in particular regarding their personnel, facilities, subsidiaries or subcontractors, which may affect compliance with the requirements set out in Articles\u00a072\u00a0to\u00a076, in Articles\u00a084 and 85 and in Appendix\u00a02 to Annex\u00a0V, or their ability to perform the conformity assessment tasks relating to the vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units for which they have been designated.\n\n\n2.Technical services shall respond without delay to requests by a type-approval authority or by the Commission in relation to the conformity assessments they have carried out.\n\n\n3.The type-approval authority of the Member State in which the technical service is established shall ensure that the technical service carries out its obligation laid down in paragraph 2, unless there is a legitimate reason for not doing so.\n\n\nWhen the type-approval authority of the Member State in which the technical service is established invokes a legitimate reason, it shall inform the Commission thereof.\n\n\nThe Commission shall consult without delay the Member States. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of an implementing act whether the legitimate reason is considered justified or not. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nThe technical service or the type-approval authority may request that any information transmitted to the authorities of another Member State or to the Commission shall be treated confidentially.\n\n\n3.At least every 30 months, the type-approval authority shall assess whether each technical service under its responsibility continues to satisfy the requirements set out in Articles\u00a072\u00a0to\u00a076, in Articles\u00a084 and 85 and in Appendix\u00a02 to Annex\u00a0V. This assessment shall include an on-site visit to each technical service under its responsibility.\n\n\nWithin two months after finalising this assessment of the technical service, the Member States shall report to the Commission and to the other Member States on those monitoring activities. The reports shall contain a summary of the assessment which shall be made publicly available.\n\n\n4.Five years after the notification of a technical service, and every fifth years thereafter, the assessment to determine whether the technical service still complies with the requirements set out in Articles\u00a072\u00a0to\u00a076, in Articles\u00a084 and 85 and in Appendix\u00a02 to Annex\u00a0V shall be carried out by the type-approval authority of the Member State in which the technical service is established and a joint assessment team designated in accordance with the procedure described in Article\u00a077(1)\u00a0to\u00a0(4).\n\n\nArticle 81\nChallenge to the competence of technical services\n\n\n1.The Commission shall investigate all cases where concerns have been brought to its attention regarding the competence of a technical service or the continued compliance by a technical service with the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject under this Regulation. It may also commence such investigations on its own initiative.\n\n\nThe Commission shall investigate the responsibility of the technical service in the case where it is demonstrated or where there are justified grounds to consider that a type approval has been granted on the basis of false data or that the test results have been falsified or that data or technical specifications have been withheld that would have led to the refusal to grant the type approval,.\n\n\n2.The Commission shall consult the type-approval authority of the Member State where the technical service is established as part of the investigation referred to in paragraph 1. The type-approval authority of that Member State shall provide the Commission, upon request, with all relevant information relating to the performance and the compliance with the requirements concerning independence and competence of the technical service concerned.\n\n\n3.The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated confidentially.\n\n\n4.Where the Commission ascertains that a technical service does not or no longer comply with the requirements for its designation or that it is responsible for any of the wrong-doings referred to in paragraph 1, it shall inform the Member State of the type-approval authority thereof.\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission shall request that Member State to take restrictive measures, including the suspension, restriction or withdrawal of the designation, where necessary.\n\n\nWhere the Member State fails to take the necessary restrictive measures, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, suspend, restrict or withdraw the designation of the technical service concerned. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2). The Commission shall notify the Member State concerned of its decision and shall update the information published referred to in Article\u00a078(4) accordingly.\n\n\nArticle 82\nExchange of information on assessment, designation and monitoring of technical services\n\n\n1.Type-approval authorities shall consult each other and the Commission on questions with general relevance with regard to the implementation of the requirements set out in this Regulation in relation with the assessment, designation and monitoring of technical services.\n\n\n2.Type-approval authorities shall communicate to each other and the Commission not later than two years after the entry into force of this Regulation the model for assessment check-list used in accordance with Article\u00a077(1) and thereafter the adaptations made to this check-list until the Commission has adopted a harmonised assessment check-list. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts to establish the template of the assessment check-list. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\n3.When the assessment reports referred to in Article\u00a077(3) indicate discrepancies in the general practice of type-approval authorities, Member States or the Commission may request an exchange of information.\n\n\n4.The exchange of information shall be co-ordinated by the Forum referred to in Article\u00a010.\n\n\nArticle 83\nCooperation with national accreditation bodies\n\n\n1.Where designation of a technical service is based on accreditation within the meaning of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a0765/2008, Member States shall ensure that the national accreditation body that has accredited a particular technical service is kept informed by the type-approval authority on incident reports and other information that relate to matters under the control of the technical service when that information is relevant for the assessment of the performance of the technical service.\n\n\n2.Member States shall ensure that the national accreditation body in charge of the accreditation of a particular technical service is kept informed by the type-approval authority of the Member State where the technical service is established on findings relevant for the accreditation. The national accreditation body shall inform the type-approval authority of the Member State where the technical service is established on its findings.\n\n\nArticle 84\nOperational obligations of technical services\n\n\n1.Technical services shall carry out the activities for which they have been designated in accordance with Article\u00a072(1).\n\n\n2.Technical services shall comply at all times with all of the following:\n\n\n(a)allow their approval authority to witness the performance of the technical service during the conformity assessment;\n\n\n(b)provide their approval authority, upon request, with information on the categories of activities for which they have been designated.\n\n\n3.Where a technical service finds that a manufacturer does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall report this to the approval authority in order for the approval authority to require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures. The approval authority shall refuse to issue a type-approval certificate where those appropriate corrective measures have not been taken.\n\n\nArticle 85\nInformation obligations of technical services\n\n\n1.Technical services shall inform their approval authority of the following:\n\n\n(a)any non-conformity encountered which may require a refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a type-approval certificate;\n\n\n(b)any circumstances affecting the scope of and conditions for their designation;\n\n\n\n\n(c)any request for information which they have received from market surveillance authorities regarding their activities.\n\n\n2.Upon request from their approval authority, technical services shall provide information on the activities within the scope of their designation and on any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.\n\n\nArticle 86\nNational fees for costs relating to the activities exercised by the type-approval authorities \n\n\n1.The Member States shall levy fees on technical services applying to be designated established in their territory to cover wholly or partly, the costs relating to the activities exercised by the national authorities responsible for technical services in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n\n2.The Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to set out the structure and the level of the fees referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account the objectives of safety and the protection of human health and the environment, support of innovation and cost-effectiveness. When fixing the appropriate level of the fees, particular attention shall be paid to technical services that submitted a valid certificate delivered by the national accreditation body as referred to in Article\u00a083 and to\u00a0technical services that are small and medium-sized enterprises as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC\n29\n..\u00a0Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a087(2).\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\nIMPLEMENTING AND DELEGATED POWERS\n\n\nArticle 87\nCommittee procedure\n\n\n1.The Commission shall be assisted by the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles.

SMEs in the automotive sector are the most vulnerable to suffer from the market failures and regulatory shortcomings and particular attention is given to the potential impact the envisaged measures may have on them.\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National enforcement authorities should benefit from the measures aimed at addressing the regulatory shortcomings and avoiding additional burden upon them to remedy these shortcomings by taking corrective actions against non-compliant and unsafe products on their markets.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact\n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changes in the views of/complaints from consumers received by enforcement authorities relating to motor vehicles and vehicle components;\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changes in the number/percentage of non-compliant and unsafe automotive products present on the EU market (e.g. compared with existing surveys);\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changes in the number/percentage of safeguard measures taken by EU authorities against non-compliant and unsafe products both from intra-EU and extra-EU manufacturers/importers (i.e. taking into account increased traceability requirements for automotive products);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changes in trends in RAPEX notifications for vehicles; and\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changes in trends in voluntary recalls of motor vehicles (as an indicator for the effectiveness of the policy options retained in reducing the number of automotive products on the market representing a safety or environmental risk).\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term\n\n\n\nThe existing regulatory framework is being criticised for not sufficiently ensuring reliable ex-ante conformity assessments and effective post-market controls. The criticism has arisen in the aftermath of the findings in September 2015 that VW over several years manipulated the controls of the exhaust gas treatment devices.\n\n\nIn reponse to this criticism and weaknesses identified in the evaluation of the type-approval framework this proposal contains a wide range of measures related to:\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traceability of products and role and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsibilities of and co-operation between the different national authorities involved in the enforcement of the technical harmonisation legislation for motor vehicles;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quality of the type-approval and conformity assessment tasks carried out by technical services;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0post-market safeguard procedures and the provisions for the recall of vehicles, and\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0procedures for ensuring conformity of production.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nMember States are responsible for the implementation of the legislation in their territory, but ensuring a harmonised and co-ordinated approach based on commonly applicable criteria and uniformly applied by Member States is essential for maintaining a level playing field across the EU by means of a harmonised interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the type-approval requirements, and backed-up by harmonised provisions on market surveillance to provide Member States with adequate means for post-market controls and for taking effective and common remedial action against the presence of non-compliant and unsafe products on the market.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe existing directive relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles, has been the subject of a revision in 2007.  However, experience with the implementation has demonstrated that the mechanisms for ensuring a harmonised implementation and enforcement are not sufficiently robust. Important divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the directive's main objectives, i.e. achieving an adequate level of safety and environmental performance of motor vehicles.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nEnhanced coherence is expected with other legislation in the field of type-approval (e.g. concerning agricultural tractors and motorcycles), which has been reviewed in 2013.\n\n\nSynergies are expected in the field of market surveillance by building on the principles and standard reference provisions of the NLF regulation 765/2008 and Decision 768/2008.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact\n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2017 to 2020,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n32\n\n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2327 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles\u00a0208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nThe Commission intends to ensure the implementation of the measures concerned via centralised direct management through its own services, in particular via the JRC for the technical and scientific support, this will be regulated through the administrative arrangement instrument.\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules\n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Technical Committee Motor Vehicles (TCMV), set up by this Regulation, and the Forum laid down in Article\u00a010 will provide a platform to regularly discuss issues related to the implementation of the strenghtened regulatory framework for the type-approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles.\n\n\nMember states will have to report to the Commission on a yearly basis the penalties they have implemented.\n\n\nFive years after its entry into force, Member States shall inform the Commission of the application of the type-approval and market surveillance procedures laid down in this Regulation. Based on this information, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council about the implementation of the new Regulation.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system\n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified\n\n\n\nThe measures proposed to limit the duration of validity of the designation of technical sevrices could result in a temporary shortage of technical services and could result in delays for the manufacturers to have their products  type-approved.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe introduction of a coordinated supervision of technical services will be accompanied by suitable transitional provisions to enable technical services designated under Directive 2007/46/EC to have their designation renewed in accordnace with the provisions of the new Regulation, within a two years time span from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. The Commission shall create guidance to ensure a proportionate and workable operation of the new supervisory mechanism.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\n\n\n\nThe costs for the supervisory control mechanism will consist of the participation of EU Member states' experts and Commission representative in joint audits of technical services. The benefit will consist of ensuring a high level of reliability in the performance of conformity assessment activities carried out by technical services.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities\n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the application of all regulatory control mechanisms, the Commission services will devise an anti-fraud strategy in line with the Commission's anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) adopted on 24 June 2011 in order to ensure inter alia that its internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CASF and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk areas, in particular in relation to the financing of implementing activities of this Regulation. In particular a series of measures will be put in place such as:\n\n\n- decisions, agreements and contracts resulting from the financing of implementing activities of the Regulation will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- during the evaluation phase of a call for proposals/tender, the proposers and tenderers will be checked against the published exclusion criteria based on declarations and the Early Warning System (EWS);\n\n\nMoreover,the Commission will control a strict application of the rules on conflict of interests for the implementing actions under this Regulation.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the

wheelchair tie down and occupant restraint system \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following section\u00a01 and either section\u00a02 or 3 shall apply. \n\n\n\n\n\n1. Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.\n\n\n\n\nSurrogate wheelchair (SWC) means a rigid, re-usable test wheelchair, as defined in section\u00a03 of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.\n\n\n\n\nPoint P means a representation of the position of the wheelchair occupant's hip when seated in the SWC, as defined in section\u00a03 of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. General requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.\n\n\n\n\nEach wheelchair location shall be provided with anchorages to which a wheelchair tie-down and occupant restraint system (WTORS) shall be fitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.\n\n\n\n\nThe wheelchair occupant\u2019s lower belt anchorages shall be located in accordance with UNECE Regulation No\u00a014-07, paragraph\u00a05.4.2.2, relative to Point P on the SWC, when placed in the travelling position designated by the manufacturer. The upper actual anchorage(s) shall be located at least 1\u00a0100 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the points of contact between the rear tyres of the SWC and the vehicle floor. This condition shall still be satisfied after the test carried out according to point\u00a03 of this Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.\n\n\n\n\nAn assessment shall be made of the WTORS occupant belt to ensure compliance with the provisions of UNECE Regulation No\u00a016-06, paragraphs 8.2.2 to 8.2.2.4 and 8.3.1 to 8.3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum number of ISOFIX child seat anchorages need not to be provided. In the case of a multi-stage typeapproval where an ISOFIX anchorage system has been affected by the conversion, either the system shall be re-tested or the anchorages shall be rendered unusable. In the latter case the ISOFIX labels shall be removed and appropriate information shall be given to the vehicle purchaser.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Static in-vehicle testing\n\n\n3.1. Wheelchair occupant restraint anchorages\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.\n\n\n\n\nThe wheelchair occupant restraint anchorages shall resist the static forces prescribed for occupant restraint anchorages in UNECE Regulation No\u00a014-07, simultaneously with the static forces applied to the wheelchair tie-down anchorages as specified in point\u00a03.2 of this Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2. Wheelchair tie-down anchorages\n\n\nThe wheelchair tie-down anchorages shall resist the following forces, for at least 0.2 seconds, applied via the SWC (or a suitable surrogate wheelchair having a wheelbase, seat height and tie-down attachment points in accordance with the specification for the SWC), at a height of 300 +/\u2013 100 mm from the surface on which the SWC rests:\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a forward-facing wheelchair, a simultaneous force, coincident with the force applied to the occupant restraint anchorages, of 24,5 kN, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.\n\n\n\n\na second test applying a static force of 8,2 kN directed towards the rear of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a rearward-facing wheelchair, a simultaneous force, coincident with the force applied to the occupant restraint anchorages, of 8,2 kN, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.\n\n\n\n\na second test applying a static force of 24,5 kN directed towards the front of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Components of the system\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.\n\n\n\n\nAll components of the WTORS shall meet the relevant requirements of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012. However, the dynamic test specified in Annex\u00a0A and paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012 shall be carried out on the complete WTORS using the vehicle anchorage geometry instead of the test geometry specified in Annex\u00a0A of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012. This may be carried out within the vehicle structure or on a surrogate structure representative of the vehicle\u2019s WTORS anchorage geometry. The location of each anchorage shall lie within the tolerance provided for in paragraph\u00a07.7.1 of UNECE Regulation No\u00a016-06.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the occupant restraint part of the WTORS is approved according to UNECE Regulation No\u00a016-06, it shall be subject to the dynamic test of the complete WTORS specified in paragraph\u00a03.3.1 of this appendix but the requirements of paragraphs 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 of ISO10542-1:2012 shall be considered to have been met.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Dynamic in-vehicle testing\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.\n\n\n\n\nThe full assembly of the WTORS system shall be tested by an in-vehicle dynamic test in accordance with paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 and Annex\u00a0A of ISO\u00a010542-1:2012, testing all components/anchorages simultaneously, using a vehicle body-in-white or representative structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.\n\n\n\n\nThe component parts of the WTORS shall meet the relevant requirements of ISO10542-1:2012, paragraphs 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4. These requirements shall be deemed to have been met in respect of the occupant restraint if it is approved according to UNECE Regulation No\u00a016-06.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\u00a04\n\n\nOther special purpose vehicles\n(including special group, multi-equipment carrier and trailer caravans)\n\n\nThe exemptions provided for in this appendix are only permitted if the manufacturer demonstrates

requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nThe requirements set out in the relevant regulatory act are applicable. The series of amendments of the UNECE regulations that apply on a compulsory basis are listed in Annex\u00a0IV to Regulation (EC) No 661/2009. The series of amendments adopted subsequently are accepted as an alternative. Member States may grant extensions to existing type-approvals granted in accordance with the Directives repealed by Regulation (EC) 661/2009 under the conditions laid down in Article\u00a013(14) of that Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nThis regulatory act is not applicable to this vehicle (no requirements).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nFor vehicles with a reference mass not exceeding 2\u00a0610 kg. At the manufacturer\u2019s request, Regulation (EC) No\u00a0715/2007 may apply to vehicles with a reference mass not exceeding 2\u00a0840 kg. \n\n\nWith regard to access to information, for other parts (e.g. living compartment) than the base vehicle, it is sufficient that the manufacturer provides access to vehicle repair and maintenance information in a readily accessible and prompt manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nIn case of vehicles equipped with a LPG or CNG installation, a vehicle type-approval in accordance with UNECE Regulation No\u00a067 or UNECE Regulation No\u00a0110 is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nThe fitting of an electronic stability control (\u2018ESC\u2019) system is required by Article\u00a012 and Article\u00a013 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0661/2009. However, in accordance with UNECE Regulation No\u00a013, the fitting of an ESC system is not required for special purpose vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 and for vehicles for exceptional load transport and trailers with areas for standing passengers. N1 vehicles may be approved in accordance with UNECE Regulations No\u00a013 or No\u00a013-H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nThe fitting of an ESC system is required by Article\u00a012 and Article\u00a013 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0661/2009. Therefore, the requirements set out in Part\u00a0A of Annex\u00a09 to UNECE Regulation\u00a0No 13-H shall be fulfilled. N1 vehicles may be approved in accordance with UNECE Regulation No\u00a013 or UNECE Regulation No\u00a013-H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4A)\n\n\n\n\nIf fitted, the protective device shall fulfil the requirements set out in UNECE Regulation No\u00a018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4B)\n\n\n\n\nThis Regulation applies to seats not falling within the scope of UNECE Regulation No\u00a080. For other options, see Article\u00a02 of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nVehicles of categories other than M1 do not need to fully comply with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0672/2010 but shall be fitted with a windscreen defrosting and demisting device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\nVehicles of categories other than M1 do not need to fully comply with Regulation (EU) No \u00a01008/2010 but shall be fitted with a windscreen washing and wiping devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nFor vehicles with a reference mass exceeding 2\u00a0610 kg and that did not benefit from the possibility offered in note (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\nFor vehicles with a reference mass exceeding 2\u00a0610 kg that are not type-approved (at the manufacturer\u2019s request and provided their reference mass does not exceed 2\u00a0840 kg) under Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. For other parts than the base vehicle, it is sufficient that the manufacturer provides access to vehicle repair and maintenance information in a readily accessible and prompt manner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(9A)\n\n\n\n\nApplies only where such vehicles are fitted with equipment covered by UNECE Regulation No 64. Tyre pressure monitoring system for M1 vehicles applies on a compulsory basis in accordance with Article\u00a09(2) of Regulation (EC) No 661/2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\nApplies only to vehicles equipped with coupling(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\nApplies to vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden mass not exceeding 2,5 tonnes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\nOnly applicable to vehicles where the \u2018Seating Reference Point (\u201cR\u201d point)\u2019 of the lowest seat is not more than 700 mm above the ground level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\nApplies only where the manufacturer applies for type-approval of vehicles intended for the transport of dangerous goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(14)\n\n\n\n\nApplies only for vehicles of category N1, class I (reference mass \u2264 1 305 kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(15)\n\n\n\n\nAt the request of the manufacturer, a type-approval may be granted under this item, as an alternative to obtaining type-approvals under each individual item covered by Regulation (EC) No 661/2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(16)\n\n\n\n\nThe fitting of an advanced emergency braking system is not required for special purpose vehicles in accordance with Article\u00a01 of Regulation (EU) No 347/2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\nThe fitting of a lane departure warning system is not required for special purpose vehicles in accordance with Article\u00a01 of Regulation (EU) No 351/2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nThe approval authority may only grant exemption(s) if the manufacturer demonstrates that the vehicle cannot meet the requirements due to its special purpose. The exemptions granted are to be described on the vehicle type-approval certificate and the certificate of conformity (remark \u2013item 52 of the CoC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA1\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe fitting of ESC is not mandatory. In the case of multi-stage typeapprovals, where the modifications made at a particular stage are likely to affect the function of the base vehicle\u2019s ESC system, the manufacturer may either disable the system or demonstrate that the vehicle has not been rendered unsafe or unstable.
