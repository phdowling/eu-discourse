"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 30.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 434 final\n2016/0198(COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\nCONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\nThe current design of the residence permit originates from a Council Joint Action (97/11/JHA) adopted in 1997. Back in 2009, Member States considered that more sophisticated forgeries meant it was necessary to work on a new design for residence permits and decided to introduce more modern security features to improve the security features of residence permits.\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1030/2002, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 380/2008, lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals. Due to the introduction of biometric features (facial image and fingerprints), the sticker version of the residence permit was abandoned, and since 20 May 2011 only card versions are permitted. During the negotiation of the 2008 amendment to the Regulation, which introduced biometric identifiers by means of a contactless chip in the residence permit, some Member States expressed the wish to include an optional contact chip for national use in their e-government services. This was accepted, as was the optional use of additional (national) security features.\n\n\nThis residence permit card is also used for the local border traffic permit and the specific permits issued under EU legislation on legal migration.\n1\n\n\n\n\nUniformity versus national security features\n\n\n\nThe Commission is in favour of having a uniform format for residence permits, as is the case with the visa sticker. This would mean all Member States having the same card model, design and security features. However, taking into account the technical developments achieved in some Member States in the area of e-government, it was considered appropriate to accept the addition of a contact chip for e-government purposes for those Member States that wished to give third-country nationals the same advantages as their own citizens, while accepting that this would lead to a certain \u2018non-uniformity\u2019 of the format.\n\n\nIn that context, the following sentence was added under Annex I, 2(h) of the Regulation:\n\n\n\u2018Member States may also add additional national security features, provided that these are included in the list established under Article 2(1)(f) of this Regulation and provided that they comply with the harmonised appearance of the following models and that the efficiency of the uniform security features is not diminished.\u2019\n\n\nThis list was subsequently established by Commission Decision C (2009) 3770 of 20\u00a0May\u00a02009. It listed additional security features to which Member States could have recourse if they so choose.\n\n\nThe choice and implementation of additional optional security features and the scope for interpreting the technical specifications, which are no longer specific enough due to technical developments, meant that the quality and appearance of residence permits among Member States differed greatly.\n\n\nWork on a new design and security features started in 2010, when a subgroup of the committee set up under Article\u00a06 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01683/95 (\u2018the Article 6 committee\u2019) was established to work on this issue.\n\n\nFrom the Commission\u2019s point of view, this \u2018new start\u2019 was also an opportunity to explore the possibility of introducing a uniform and harmonised format and ensuring all residence permits offered the same highest possible level of security. This would help border guards and other officials recognise residence permits at first sight.\n\n\nHowever, as explained in point 3 below, it emerged during consultations with stakeholders that a completely harmonised approach would entail very high costs for some Member States. The compromise was to maintain a list of state-of-the-art additional security features which could be added to the common uniform format if desired.\n\n\nOne of the main reasons for this approach is that the technical specifications adopted in 2009 require the card to be made of plastic material (like credit cards). However, the technical specifications do not define exactly which plastic material is to be used. There are different types of plastic on the market, the most suitable being polycarbonate. Currently, all cards have a structure made up of different layers using different plastic materials, even though most use polycarbonate. The production technologies for the specific plastic materials available in each Member State are also different. The range of techniques used to produce the cards means that not all proposed security features can be accommodated. As the new residence permit should be cost-neutral, it was not feasible to pursue full harmonisation further.\n\n\nMember States wishing to continue with optional security features were ready to limit them to the minimum and specify the technologies to be used, location and size in the technical specifications. These would be set out in a future Commission implementing decision.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point\u00a02(a), applies, as it provides for \u2018the conditions of entry and residence, and standards on the issue by Member States of long-term visas and residence permits...\u2019 (ex-Article 63(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is no recast proposed?\n\n\n\nIn principle, a third substantial amendment should trigger a recast.\n\n\nHowever, in this instance, there are arguments which justify deviating from this rule. The main changes will apply in the Commission implementing decision setting out the secret technical specifications for the production of the new residence permit. There are no substantive changes in the enacting term of this proposed regulation; only the Annex is replaced to show the new design. There is a need for swift legislative action, as fraudsters are ahead and the residence permit needs to be made more fraud-proof. Furthermore, this regulation is of limited interest to the wider public, unlike other regulations in the area of visa policy such as the Visa Code.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\n\nArticle 79(2)(a) TFEU empowers the European Parliament and the Council to adopt \u2018measures concerning standards on the issue by Member States of long-term visas and residence permits\u2019.\n\n\nThe current proposal is within the limits set by those Treaty provisions, and does not alter the scope of Union legislation.\n\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to secure and further improve the uniform format for residence permits in the light of developments in fraudsters\u2019 practices. This objective cannot be satisfactorily achieved by the Member States acting alone because the format needs to be uniform and only the Union can amend an existing Union act.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nArticle 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union states that the content and form of Union action must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. The form chosen for this action must enable the proposal to achieve its objective and be implemented as effectively as possible.\n\n\nThe uniform format for residence permits was laid down in a regulation to ensure that it would be applied in the same way in all Member States. This proposal amends that regulation and must therefore take the form of a regulation. As to the content, this initiative is limited to improving the existing regulation. It aims to achieve the policy objective of combating irregular migration by rendering documents more difficult to counterfeit or falsify. The proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations and collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe subgroup of the Article 6 committee developed a requirements document which set out all the desired improvements that could be introduced into a new format. Member States agreed to contact their suppliers and to come forward with proposals. They then selected their preferred design and common security features, which were to be built into the new residence permit. One of the requirements was that the new format be cost neutral.\n\n\nDuring the discussions, it became clear that Member States were not in favour of a completely harmonised document. They insisted on maintaining the list of \u2018updated\u2019 additional security features, which could be added to a common \u2018uniform\u2019 format if desired. Due to the different production schemes in place, Member States did not wish to change their systems but preferred to continue with a common \u2018uniform\u2019 card with an improved level of security and an updated list of optional (national) security features. \u2018Uniformity\u2019 only meant having a uniform design and some standard security features, to which optional national security features could be added.\n\n\nThe cost implications for some Member States meant a compromise solution was reached. This involved keeping the possibility of additional optional security features but reducing the list to the minimum possible, depending on the impact of the security features on the uniform appearance, especially on the front side. In addition, the technical specifications (material and technologies to be used, features\u2019 location and size, etc.) would be tightened, so that divergent interpretations would no longer be possible. This should harmonise the appearance of the card, which is important for uniformity and recognition by border guards.\n\n\nThe comprehensive list of optional security features will be set out in the Annex containing the technical specifications adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 7 of this Regulation. The picture in the annex to this Regulation may therefore vary slightly on the reverse side of the residence permit depending on which optional features are used by individual Member States.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposed amendment has no implications for the EU budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\nDetailed provisions\n\n\n\nThe amending Regulation is based on Article 79(2)(a) of the TFEU, which replaced Article\u00a063(3)(a) TEC.\n\n\n\n1. Participation of Denmark\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No\u00a022 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not to be bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark must, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n\n\n\n2. Participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 4a of Protocol No\u00a021 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the treaties, the provisions of that Protocol also apply to measures proposed or adopted pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the TFEU amending an existing measure by which they are bound. The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01030/2002, which would be amended under this proposal. It follows that the provisions of Protocol No\u00a021 apply. This means that the United Kingdom and Ireland do not have to take part in the adoption of the proposed Regulation (Article 1 of Protocol No 21). However, under Article 3 of Protocol No\u00a021, they may notify the Council within three months after the proposal has been presented that they wish to take part in the adoption and application of this measure. \n\n\nArticle 4 of Protocol No\u00a021 also applies, giving the United Kingdom and Ireland the option of accepting the measure once it has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. \n\n\nTo take into account the choices to be made by the United Kingdom and Ireland in the three months following the adoption of the proposal, six possible recital texts are provided in square brackets. One or two of these will be selected as the appropriate one(s) by the European Parliament and the Council, on the basis of the choices made by the United Kingdom and Ireland in the three months following the adoption of the proposal.\n\n\n\n3. Development of the Schengen acquis in the sense of the association agreements\n\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1030/2002 is part of the Schengen acquis applicable to Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on the basis of their respective association agreements. The proposed amendment should therefore also apply to those associated countries.\n\n\n\n4. Enacting terms\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThis provision states that the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1030/2002 is to be replaced by the new Annex, containing the image and the general description of the new residence permit.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nTo allow existing stocks to be used up, provision is made for a transitional period of six months during which Member States can still use the old residence permits.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nFirstly, there is the usual provision for the entry into force of the Regulation.\n\n\nSecondly, it is provided that Member States must introduce the new residence permits nine months after the Commission adopts an implementing decision on the supplementary technical specifications.\n\n\n\n2016/0198 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 79 (2) (a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals.\n\n\n(2)The current uniform format for residence permits, which has been in circulation in its current lay-out since 1997, is to be considered as compromised in view of serious incidents of counterfeiting and fraud.\n\n\n(3)Therefore a new common design for residence permits for third-country nationals should be established with more modern security features in order to render the residence permits more secure and prevent forgery.\n\n\n(4)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the European Parliament and the Council have adopted this Regulation, whether it will implement it in its national law.\n\n\n(5)[In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United

part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.]\n\n\n(8)[In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.]\n\n\n(9)[In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom has
