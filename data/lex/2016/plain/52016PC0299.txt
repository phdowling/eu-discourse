Tariff quotas of the Union should be opened at zero or reduced duty rates for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for such products. \n\n\nOn 17 December 2013 the Council adopted Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products so that Union demand for the products in question could be met under the most favourable conditions.\n\n\nThe Regulation is updated every semester with the objective of accommodating the needs of the EU industry. The Commission, assisted by the Economic Tariff Questions Group (ETQG), has reviewed all requests for autonomous tariff quotas duties forwarded by the Member States.\n\n\nFollowing this review, the Commission considers that the opening of autonomous tariff quotas is justified for some new products, currently not listed in the Annex of the Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013. In relation to some other products the wording of the description has to be changed, new TARIC codes should be assigned, an end date needs to be added, or an increase of the initial quota volume became necessary. Products for which a tariff quota is no longer in the Union's economic interest are proposed to be withdrawn.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential trading agreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, FTA's, candidate countries and potential candidates).\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal is in line with agricultural, trade, enterprise, development and external relations policies.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the principle of proportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out to simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in accordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6). This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are fixed by the Council acting on qualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal; therefore a regulation is the appropriate instrument.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe scheme of the autonomous tariff quotas has been part of an evaluation study on autonomous tariff suspensions which was carried out in 2013, as autonomous quotas are measures similar to autonomous suspensions, apart from the fact that quotas have a limited import volume. The evaluation concluded that the core rationale for the scheme remains valid. The cost savings for EU businesses that import goods under the scheme can be significant. In turn, these savings can lead to wider benefits (such as higher competitive abilities, more efficient production methods, creation or maintenance of EU jobs etc.), depending on the product, company and sector in question.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe assessment of this proposal has been carried out with the assistance of the ETQG, which consists of delegations from all Member States plus Turkey. It met three times before the changes laid down in this proposal have been agreed.\n\n\nEach request (new or amendment) has been assessed carefully by the group. In particular, preventing any harm for EU producers and the strengthening and consolidation of the competiveness of EU production are part of the examination of each case. This assessment has been carried out by discussion within the ETQG and consultation by Member States of the concerned industries, associations, chambers of commerce and other stakeholders involved.\n\n\nAll listed quotas correspond to agreements or compromises reached in the discussion of the ETQG. There was no mention of potentially serious risks with irreversible consequences.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\nThe proposed amendment is a technical one concerning only the coverage of quotas listed in the Annex. The Regulation remains otherwise identical to the existing Council Regulation. Thus no impact assessment was carried out for this proposal.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal has no consequences on fundamental rights.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue which leads to uncollected customs duties of a total amount of approximately 2.8 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the traditional own resources of the budget is \u2013 2 773 841 EUR/year (75% x 3 698 455 EUR /year).\n\n\nThe loss of revenue in Traditional Own Resources shall be compensated by Member States contributions based on the GNI.\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe measures proposed are treated within the framework of TARIC (Tarif int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne/Integrated Tariff of the European Union) and applied by customs administrations of the Member States.\n\n\nChecks on the end-use of some of the products covered by this Council Regulation will be carried out in accordance with Article 254 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n2016/0153 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supply of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013\n1\n. Products within those tariff quotas can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates. For the reasons indicated, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2016, tariff quotas at zero duty rates for an appropriate volume as regards nine new products.\n\n\n(2)Moreover, in certain cases, the existing autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be adapted. In the case of one product, it is necessary to amend the product description for clarification purposes. In the case of three other products, the quota volumes need to be increased as such increase is in the interest of economic operators and the Union.\n\n\n(3)Finally, in case of one product, the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be closed with effect from 1 July 2016 as it is not in the Union\u2019s interest to continue granting it as of that date.\n\n\n(4)Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(5)As the changes regarding the suspensions for the products concerned provided for in this Regulation have to apply from 1 July 2016, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency,\n\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2691, 09.2692, 09.2693, 09.2696, 09.2697, 09.2698, 09.2699, 09.2694 and 09.2695 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted following the order of the CN codes indicated in the second column of the table in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2637, 09.2703, 09.2683 and 09.2659\u00a0are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2689 is deleted.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2016. \n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT \n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\n\nCouncil Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGET LINES\n\n\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12, Article 120\n\n\nAmount budgeted for the year 2016: \u20ac 18 465 300 000 \u20ac (B 2016)\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial implications\n\n\nX\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue.
