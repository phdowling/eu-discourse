measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nBy its judgment of 7 September 2016 in Case C-113/14, the Court of Justice annulled Article 7 of Regulation on the Common Organisation of the markets in the agricultural (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council) determining the reference thresholds for certain agricultural products on the grounds that these thresholds should have been adopted by the Council only, on proposal of the Commission, on the basis of Article 43(3) of the Treaty. \n\n\nThe Court also annulled Article 2 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products that fixes the level of the public intervention prices on the grounds that this Article is inextricably linked to the annulled Article 7 CMO. \n\n\nAs the Court maintained the legal effects of the annulled provisions in both acts for a maximum period of five months following the date of the judgment, it is therefore necessary, before the end of the five month period, to amend Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 by inserting into it the provisions on the reference thresholds and intervention price levels annulled by the Court and by making certain consequential adjustments.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal follows the judgment of the Court as regards the legal basis for the fixing of reference thresholds relating to the organisation of the markets in agricultural products.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal falls under shared competence between the EU and the Member States and complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle. \n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF

REGULATION\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)By judgment of 7 September 2016 in Case C-113/14\n1\n, the Court of Justice annulled Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n determining the reference thresholds for agricultural products on the grounds that those thresholds should have been adopted by the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, on the basis of Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFUE').\n\n\n(2)The Court of Justice also annulled Article 2 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013\n3\n determining the level of the public intervention prices on the grounds that that Article is inextricably linked to the annulled Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n\n\n(3)The Court of Justice declared
