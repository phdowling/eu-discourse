The implementation and monitoring of EU policies relies on comparable and high-quality statistical information about the economic, social and environmental situation in the EU and its components at national and regional level. European statistics are also indispensable if \u2018Europe\u2019 is to be understood by the general public and citizens are to take part in the democratic process and debate the present and future of the EU.\n\n\nIn order to satisfy the information needs stemming from the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities\n2\n, a number of urgent statistical gaps need to be addressed. Furthermore, the timeliness of some European statistics needs to be improved urgently, so that they provide the more uptodate information needed in the context of the European Semester exercise.\n\n\nAlthough national statistical systems have made a significant effort to modernise their production methods with the support of the 20132017 European statistical programme (ESP), the current statistical production infrastructure is still not flexible enough to deliver new statistics when needed, while also limiting the associated cost and administrative burden. Under the status quo, the European Statistical System (ESS) will not be in a position to satisfy the growing demand for statistics or the need to make them available more quickly, thus putting the relevance of European statistics at risk.\n\n\nAgainst this background, the objective of the proposal is to extend the ESP for the 20182020 period and provide the financial support that the ESS needs in order to be able to:\n\n\n\n\u2013provide highquality statistical information and close the statistical gaps that need to be addressed most urgently, focusing on a number of priority areas that reflect the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities;\n\n\n\u2013build the permanent capacity needed to respond more quickly to emerging needs and to adapt the statistical infrastructure so as to harness the potential of new data sources; and\n\n\n\u2013strengthen partnership within the ESS and beyond in order to further increase its productivity and secure its leading role in official statistics worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe parties who would be affected most directly by the proposal are users of statistics (e.g.\u00a0policymakers, the media and researchers), producers of statistics (national statistical institutes (NSIs) and other national authorities (ONAs)) and respondents (households and businesses).\n\n\nAs the ESP is a horizontal initiative, it is not part of the Commission\u2019s Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme (REFIT).\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nArticle 13 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics provides that the \u2018European Statistical Programme shall provide the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, setting out the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for a period corresponding to that of the multiannual financial framework\u2019. The ESP sets out the framework and priorities for European statistics for the duration of the programme and also sets the budget to cover that period. Eurostat annual work programmes are based on the multiannual ESP. The current ESP, as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\u00a099/2013 and covering the period from 2013 to 2017, is the eighth programme of its kind. \n\n\nThis initiative is intended to establish a legislative framework for the ESP for the duration of the multiannual financial framework (MFF).\n\n\nArticle 14 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 provides that the ESP is to be implemented by \u2018individual statistical actions\u2019 as decided: \n\n\n\n\u2013by the European Parliament and the Council; \n\n\n\u2013by the Commission under specific conditions; or \n\n\n\n\n\u2013in ESS agreements between NSIs or ONAs and the Commission (Eurostat). \n\n\n\nThis proposal does not address \"other statistics\" as defined in Commission Decision 2012/504/EU\n3\n that are not European statistics and that are identified in a planning and coordination exercise steered by Eurostat.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of European statistics is to underpin the development, monitoring and evaluation of European policies with reliable, objective, comparable and coherent statistical information.\n\n\nThe current proposal will support the 10 political priorities in the Commission\u2019s Agenda for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change and other Union policies such as the European Semester, the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and the European Energy Union. The need for a political response to the profound economic crisis and its social impact has fuelled demands for better economic and social policies based on robust and comparable evidence. Evidence-based decisions are especially important for the performance management of EU policies. On numerous occasions, most recently in the ECOFIN Council conclusions of 8 December 2015, the Council has stressed the vital importance of official statistics for policymaking. \n\n\nIn particular, the initiative will underpin Union policies in the following areas:\n\n\n\n\u2013in line with the key priorities on growth and job creation, skills, mobility and the reduction of poverty and social exclusion, social indicators should help to strengthen the EU social dimension, European monetary union and the social impact analysis of macroeconomic policies;\n\n\n\u2013to support the priority of \u2018boosting jobs, growth and investment\u2019, further statistical work is needed to analyse the growth and employment impact of technological change and innovation and to put in place a circular economy monitoring system;\n\n\n\u2013in order to provide better statistical evidence for the \u2018European Energy Union\u2019, more detailed data on energy consumption and better early estimates of energy balances are needed;\n\n\n\u2013statistics on online cross-border selling are needed for the \u2018digital single market\u2019 priority. In particular, there is a need for more detailed information on accessing services provided by intermediaries in content distribution, on trust in online platforms and intermediaries, and on barriers faced by households making cross-border purchases;\n\n\n\u2013to support the priority of \u2018a deeper and fairer economic and monetary union\u2019, a harmonised house price index and related statistics are becoming increasingly important in the context of assessing Member States\u2019 structural reforms. As a result, users are calling for further efforts to expand their scope and quality; and\n\n\n\u2013in order to \u2018strengthen the role of the EU as a global actor\u2019 and in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, statistics should help the EU to steer and monitor the impact of its external policies and assistance programmes, and to contribute to good governance and democratic debate in partner countries.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe Treaty legal basis for the proposal is Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, under which the European Parliament and the Council may adopt measures for the production of statistics where necessary for the activities of the Union. That Article sets out requirements as regards the production of European statistics, stating that they must conform to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall within the exclusive competence of the EU. The sharing of competence between the EU and Member States is justified by the need to ensure the high quality and comparability of statistics underpinning EU policies and by the transnational character of many aspects of statistics in general and European statistics in particular. Therefore, only a coordinated approach to the development, production and dissemination of European statistics \u2013 as provided for in the ESP \u2013 guarantees the required coherence and comparability of the statistics that are relevant for EU activities.\n\n\nThe objective of the proposed action, namely the development, production and dissemination of European statistics under an extended ESP for the 20182020 period, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and is therefore better achieved at EU level on the basis of an EU legal act, ensuring the necessary comparability of statistical information at European level in all statistical domains covered by this act. The data collection itself can be carried out by the Member States. \n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line with the principle of proportionality, the proposal for a Regulation confines itself to the minimum required to achieve its objective and does not go beyond what is necessary for this purpose. The specific objectives for the proposed extension of the programme are the same as in the current (2013-2017) programme. These are spelled out and planned in more detail in the Commission\u2019s annual statistical work programmes, which are prepared in close cooperation with the Member States and adopted taking into account the opinion of the ESS Committee. New statistical requirements with an impact on Member States will be prepared with the Member States\u2019 early and direct involvement.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nProposed instrument: Regulation.\n\n\nThe proposal is to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European statistical programme 2013-17\n4\n, by extending it to 2018-2020.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nThe evaluation of the 2008-2012 Community statistical programme, the mid-term evaluation\n5\n of the 2013-2017 ESP and final evaluations of the modernisation of European enterprise and trade statistics (MEETS) programme have been thoroughly analysed.\n\n\nThe 2013-2017 ESP mid-term evaluation concluded that the programme is generally well implemented, with 17 of the 23 detailed objectives well on track for completion. The ESP offers good EU added value, is run efficiently, responds to user needs and is consistent with other statistical programmes. For instance, the move towards new methods for the production of statistics helps the approaches used throughout the ESS. The evaluation puts forward three recommendations to guide and further optimise ESP implementation:\n\n\n\n\u2013pay particular attention to objectives where problems have been encountered;\n\n\n\u2013secure sufficient resources to maintain the necessary level of investment to modernise the production of European statistics; and\n\n\n\u2013identify and implement projects at EU level that can maximise EU added value.\n\n\n\nThe above recommendations have been carefully analysed and taken into account in this proposal.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nA strategy for consulting on the proposal to extend the 2013-2017 ESP was drawn up at an early stage with a view to collecting input and views from as many stakeholders as possible. In this context, and on the basis of intensive consultations with various stakeholder groups from 2014 onwards, Eurostat proposed a comprehensive approach to the consultation with stakeholders in the framework of the impact assessment.\n\n\nStakeholders were consulted in line with the strategy and the general principles and minimum standards identified by the Commission in its Guidelines on stakeholder consultation. The main elements of the strategy were a series of targeted consultations with key stakeholders and a public consultation\n6\n to ensure that all interested parties had an opportunity to express their views.\n\n\nAs the current 2013-2017 ESP had been drawn up in 2010-2011, it was considered important to get contributions from stakeholders to identify changes in the meantime that should be taken into account for the extension of the programme. These included political, economic and social changes, and developments in the fields of technology, statistics and methodology. An assessment was then carried out, in particular from the users\u2019 point of view, of priorities for European statistics until 2020. Finally, feedback was requested on the impact of the suggested actions on the users and producers of statistics and on respondents (in particular businesses), and difficulties identified that would need to be overcome in order to implement them. The consultations also focused on the impact of the various policy options for the extension of the ESP. \n\n\nThe consultation strategy identified and mapped stakeholder categories and groups so that all were sufficiently covered. These included institutional and non-institutional users of European statistics, producers (NSIs and ONAs), survey respondents (businesses and households) and the public at large. Extensive consultation with various stakeholder categories, starting in 2014 and continuing through 2015, involved:\n\n\n\n\u2013a conference of European statistics users and stakeholders; \n\n\n\u2013consultation of the Commission\u2019s Directorates-General;\n\n\n\u2013consultation of producers/NSIs; and\n\n\n\n\n\u2013a public consultation focusing on changes in the overall environment that could affect the priorities of the 2018-2020 ESP and the impact of the various options. \n\n\n\nAlso, at an early stage in the preparation of the ESP\n7\n and on an ongoing basis, the Commission consulted the European Statistics Advisory Committee, which represents users and respondents at European level and the members of which are wellestablished experts in the field of statistics. The Committee pointed to a clear need to reduce the burden on respondents, improve timeliness and incorporate new data sources from outside ESS, and to provide adequate resources to measure emerging policies.\n\n\nIn addition to the external consultations, the Commission has conducted an internal assessment of its statistical needs, indicating that those needs will not diminish over the 2018-2020 extension period. The current level of statistical information relevant for policy formulation, analysis and monitoring would need to be maintained. Data gaps should be filled, new needs in some specific policy areas should be covered, and more timely data and additional geographical breakdowns provided. In most cases, the new needs relate to the 10 political priorities set out in the Commission\u2019s political guidelines for 2014-2019. Moreover, there is a need to exploit new data sources (e.g.\u00a0\u2018big data\u2019) more effectively, which could lead to efficiency gains in the long run. Specific areas to be developed are social (including migration, health and gender) and business statistics. Changes in the design of European energy markets necessitate a streamlining of energy statistics so as to provide timely, comparable and sufficiently detailed data in the context of the energy union and climate policies.\n\n\nAnalysis of the feedback from the various stakeholder groups revealed a basic divergence:\n\n\n\n\u2013users ask for statistical products of the highest possible quality, in terms inter alia of relevance, timeliness, coverage and comparability; whereas\n\n\n\u2013given their scarce resources, producers face a series of challenges in meeting demand. \n\n\n\nAll groups pointed to a need further to modernise statistical production processes.\n\n\nThe results of the stakeholder consultations were studied thoroughly and fed into the analysis of the policy options in the context of the impact assessment. The preferred policy option, as put forward in the proposal, would have the greatest impact in terms of capacity to produce data more quickly, which is essential for meeting users\u2019 fundamental needs. The proposal also includes new measures to improve the relevance and timeliness of social and energy statistics and the exploitation of new data sources, including \u2018big data\u2019. There is an emphasis on modernisation projects to improve the flexibility of statistical production systems and reduce both the long-term costs for producers and the administrative burden for respondents.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nAn impact assessment\n8\n was carried out for this proposal. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on the impact assessment report on 18 March 2016. \n\n\nAs the establishment of a multiannual ESP is a requirement under Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the impact assessment did not examine whether or not to extend the ESP, but how best to do so. As the proposal extends the current (2013-2017) ESP, for all policy options the following existing specific objectives were taken over for 2018-2020:\n\n\n\n\u2013Objective 1: Provide high-quality statistical information necessary to support the development, monitoring and evaluation of EU policies and serving the needs of a wide range of users.\n\n\n\u2013Objective 2: Implement new methods to produce European statistics aiming at efficiency gains and quality improvements.\n\n\n\u2013Objective 3: Strengthen the partnership within the European Statistical System and beyond in order to further enhance its productivity and its leading role in official statistics worldwide.\n\n\nThe following policy options were considered:\n\n\nOption 1: Same ESP (2013-2017) extended to 2018-2020 (baseline scenario)\n\n\n\nThis option was taken as the baseline scenario against which to compare the other options. It involves no change in terms of statistics planned (objective 1), the framework for adapting the statistical infrastructure (objective 2) or partnerships (objective 3). \n\n\n\nOption 2: Extension of current ESP with adaptations\n\n\n\n\n\nThis option involves a programme for 2018-2020 that will keep the structure of the current programme while taking into account possible ways of harnessing the potential of \u2018big data\u2019 for producing statistics, the ESS Vision 2020 and the new needs of users. \n\n\nThis would see changes in terms of both programme content and budget. To some extent, it can also be regarded as changing the scope, in particular with a possible reprioritisation of current statistical outputs.\n\n\n\nOption 2a: Amendment of current ESP and reduced annual budget \n\n\n\nThis option was considered initially, but discarded at an early stage, since it does not sufficiently address the problems identified. It would entail a drastic reduction in the level of ambition for the detailed \u2018multipurpose statistics and efficiency gains\u2019 objective, in particular for \u2018new data sources\u2019 (no investment on \u2018big data\u2019) and be detrimental to data timeliness and relevance.\n\n\nIt emerged from the consultation of NSIs that this option would satisfy objective 2 requirements much less than expected for all Member States. In some countries, it is possible that no modernisation project would be taken up. Since activities relating to the implementation of ESS Vision 2020 depend on ESS funding, they would be seriously jeopardised without sufficient budgetary support. The cost of \u2018big data\u2019 (IT infrastructure, more advanced IT, statistical and other skills) and open data developments were highlighted.\n\n\n\nOption 2b: Amended programme, including improved statistical outputs to align statistical production with the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities, balanced by strong reprioritisation (same annual budget as current ESP)\n\n\n\nThis option would see a significant re-prioritisation of current statistical outputs to facilitate the improvement (in particular, as regards timeliness) of statistics in line with the most urgent user needs, in particular related to statistics on inequality, poverty and material deprivation, energy and the environment. To make room for the new actions, some existing data collections would need to be significantly reduced in scope and coverage (reduced information, geographical breakdowns or periodicity). Possible reductions of existing outputs would be based on an analysis of the costs and relative merits of these statistics.\n\n\n\nOption 2c: Amended programme, including new statistical outputs to align statistical production with the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities, complemented by major initiatives to reduce the burden on respondents and costs to NSIs, and increased annual budget\n\n\n\nThis option would involve the following new or improved statistical outputs (objective 1) in addition to the existing outputs of the current programme, taking into account new user needs:\n\n\n\n\u2013improve the timeliness of data on inequality, poverty and material deprivation of people in Europe (including flash estimates);\n\n\n\u2013produce more, and more timely, statistics on energy (efficiency, security, renewables, consumption, prices, etc.);\n\n\n\u2013improve the quality and timeliness of environmental data to support climate change policy and the circular economy;\n\n\n\u2013measure progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals;\n\n\n\u2013support drivers for technological change and e-commerce;\n\n\n\u2013improve annual population projections;\n\n\n\u2013extend housing price statistics;\n\n\n\u2013extend coverage of statistics on the service sector; and\n\n\n\u2013measure globalisation.\n\n\n\nIt would also involve new investments in the statistical infrastructure under objective 2, which would be focused on: \n\n\n\n\u2013exploratory work for a future EU social survey to increase substantially the flexibility of social indicators to provide more timely responses to new user needs;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013statistics on demand and dissemination as a service: developing the capacities to deliver more and better data analytics services and products to underpin, design and monitor EU polices, especially in the areas of competitiveness, the circular economy, agriculture and food policy, and regional development;\n\n\n\u2013modernisation, including the use of new sources: harnessing the potential of digital developments, notably as regards the take-up of new data sources (\u2018big data\u2019, \u2018internet of things\u2019.); and\n\n\n\u2013basic infrastructure and pilot projects for modernisation: strengthen the European statistical infrastructure through projects that build on experience of the European system of interoperable statistical business registers (EuroGroups register) and the census hub. Develop, and share among statistical authorities, new methodological and IT tools and ensure wider use of administrative data and data-linking techniques.\n\n\nOption 3: Two separate programmes\n\n\n\nThis option resembles Option 2b in terms of objectives and work planned, but focuses on a different way of managing the work: by means of two different programmes, one of which would address modernisation only:\n\n\n\n\u2013extension of the current ESP to 2018-2020 and alignment with the timeline of the MFF, without the modernisation aspects (objective 2 of the current programme);\n\n\n\u2013a separate programme focusing on the modernisation and development of the European statistical infrastructure, the content of which would reflect objective\u00a02 under option\u00a02b. It is not possible to set a different timeline for this second programme (e.g.\u00a0beyond 2020), because the timeline is determined by the current MFF (ending in 2020).\n\n\nPreferred policy option\n\n\n\nThe impact assessment looked into the impact of the options on the main stakeholder groups on the basis of various criteria. The impact on users was assessed on the basis of timeliness, relevance and harmonisation, while the impact on producers of statistics was analysed on the basis of cost reductions and level of shared infrastructure. Reduced burden was the main criterion for assessing the impact on respondents. Also, the impact on the EU budget was analysed for each of the options.\n\n\nFrom the multi-criteria analysis, option 2c emerged as the preferred policy option. This option would have the most positive impact on timeliness, with new actions focusing on enhanced timeliness for statistics on inequality, poverty and material deprivation, and for energy and environmental data.  The relevance of statistics for policymakers is expected to improve significantly under this option, with investment in new areas, re-prioritisation, an action to enhance capacities to deliver more and better services and products (e.g.\u00a0on-demand statistics), and enhanced dissemination.\n\n\nWith regard to the producers, option 2c will help to meet the new requirements under objectives\u00a01 and 2 by increasing the ESP budget, as called for by the main stakeholders. A substantial proportion of the additional budget will be disbursed through Member States via grants, which will enable them to modernise their production systems further and to tap into new data sources. \n\n\nOption\u00a02c is expected to reduce further the overall response burden for businesses and citizens, although most effects will materialise only in the medium term, since the use of new data sources will be implemented gradually and subject to local conditions in Member States. \n\n\nThe realisation of the preferred policy option would entail an increase in the operational budget granted to the ESP in 2018-2020. The impact assessment concluded that only additional investment would ensure the development of new statistical outputs and more timely data, as requested by users, without cutting other highly relevant statistics. Moreover, additional investments in the statistical infrastructure (both in Member States and Eurostat) will be needed to facilitate the use of new data sources for the production of statistical information tailored to users\u2019 needs, which will reduce administrative costs and response burden.\n\n\n\nOther impacts\n\n\n\nThe economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposal will be indirect. With regard to the economy, the initiative will lead to a more efficient statistical evidence base (e.g.\u00a0on globalisation, the service sector, innovation) for policies that contribute to stimulating and consolidating economic growth. Also, the proposal will improve capacity for assessing the social impact of economic policy decisions. Impacts on (un)employment levels, poverty trends and the labour market in general will be of particular interest. Improved timeliness of social indicators, combined with existing macroeconomic indicators, will enable more integrated and efficient analysis of decisions. As regards the environment, the proposal will facilitate policies that contribute to sustainable growth by providing improved energy and environmental statistics.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nAs the ESP is a horizontal initiative, it is not part of the Commission\u2019s REFIT programme. However, the Commission has launched three REFIT initiatives in the specific domains of agricultural, social and business statistics. These are designed to complement the modernisation efforts envisaged under the present initiative, by simplifying and streamlining the fragmented regulations on agricultural statistics, social surveys on persons and households, and business statistics, and to render data collections more efficient, more flexible and less burdensome for respondents. However, the initiatives can be implemented only in the medium-to-long term and will go beyond the timeframe of the extended programme.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount to be borne by the EU budget for the extension of the programme (20182020) is EUR\u00a0218.1 million (current prices).\n\n\nDetailed budgetary implications are set out in the legislative financial statement.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nUnder the revised Article 15(3), the Commission will submit a final evaluation report on the implementation of the programme to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2021, after consulting the ESS Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee. This will be carried out according to the Commission\u2019s guidelines. \n\n\nOn the basis of experience of the mid-term evaluation of the 2013-2017 ESP, Eurostat has started to link annual work programme activities with the 114 indicators in the ESP. This will have the double advantage of facilitating future evaluations and enabling automatic monitoring each year as to whether all ESP indicators are being achieved.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the proposed provisions\n\n\n\nThe proposal amends the 2013-2017 ESP by including new statistical outputs to align statistical production with the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities, complemented by initiatives to modernise statistical production methods and to reduce the burden on respondents and costs to NSIs.\n\n\n\n2016/0265 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European statistical programme 2013-17, by extending it to 2018-2020\n\n\n(Text with relevance for the EEA and Switzerland)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n9\n,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n10\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Reliable and relevant evidence based on European statistics is absolutely essential to measuring the progress and evaluating the efficiency of the Union\u2019s policies and programmes, especially in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy and the Agenda for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change.\n\n\n(2)Under Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n11\n, the European statistical programme is to provide the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, setting out the main fields and objectives of the actions envisaged for a period corresponding to that of the multiannual financial framework.\n\n\n(3)Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n covers the period from 2013 to 2017 only, whereas the current multiannual financial framework extends to 2020. It should therefore be amended to extend the European statistical programme to 2020.\n\n\n(4)In the context of Better Regulation, Union policies should increasingly be designed and monitored on the basis of solid evidence. European statistics have a distinct role to play in that respect and can make a real difference, especially in policy areas where responsiveness is key for policies to be successful.\n\n\n(5)Better statistics are therefore crucial to achieving better results and contributing to a better Europe, and greater efforts should be made to boost investments in official statistics at both European and national levels. This should provide guidance in priority policy areas and for capacity-building, in addition to current guidance and ongoing reprioritisation. More specifically, action should be taken to tackle the most urgent statistical gaps, increase timeliness and support political priorities and economic policy coordination through the European Semester. The Commission (Eurostat) should also provide new population projections in close cooperation with the national statistical institutes to update the analysis of the economic and budgetary implications of population ageing.\n\n\n(6)Experimental ecosystem accounts and climatechange statistics, including those relevant to climatechange adaptation and \u2018footprints\u2019, should be further developed, particularly in support of the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The European Energy Union and the 2030 framework for climate and energy, which aims to make the Union\u2019s economy and energy system more competitive, secure and sustainable, will require new statistics on energy consumption, energy efficiency, renewable energies, energy dependence and security of supply.\n\n\n(7)The extension of the programme is an opportunity to make adaptations and reflect the new orientations, to complement the existing objectives and ongoing prioritisation.\n\n\n(8)An appropriate increase of the budget for statistics at EU level should support these changes to the programme and bring significant added value and results through largescale projects, structural leverage effects and economies of scale benefiting statistical systems across the Member States.\n\n\n(9)This Regulation establishes a financial envelope for the extension of the European statistical programme to cover the years 2018 to 2020. This is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission\n13\n, during the annual budgetary procedure.\n\n\n(10)Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to extend the European statistical programme to cover the years 2018 to 2020, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\n(11)In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the draft proposal for an extension of the European statistical programme for the period 2018 to 2020 has been submitted for prior examination to the European Statistical System Committee, the European Statistical Advisory Committee established by Decision No 234/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n\u00a0and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics established by Council Decision 2006/856/EC\n15\n,\n\n\n(12)Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 99/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)In Article 1, the following paragraph is added:\n\n\n\u2018The programme shall be extended to cover the period 2018 to 2020.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n(2)In Article 7(1), the following paragraph is inserted: \n\n\n\u2018The Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2018 to 2020 shall be EUR 218.1 million, covered by the programming period 2014 to 2020.\u2019\n\n\n(3)Article 13 is replaced as follows:\n\n\n\u2018Protection of the financial interests of the Union\n\n\n1. The Commission shall take appropriate measures ensuring that, when activities financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Union are protected through the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, through consistent and effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, through the recovery of the amounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, through effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative and financial penalties.\n\n\n2. The Commission and the Court of Auditors or their representatives shall have the power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot checks, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors, subcontractors and third parties who have, directly or indirectly, received Union funds under the Programme.\n\n\n3. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n and in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96\n17\n with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract funded, directly or indirectly, within the framework of this Regulation.\n\n\n4. Cooperation agreements with third countries and international organisations and grant agreements and grant decisions and contracts resulting from the implementation of this Regulation shall expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections.\n\n\n5. Where the implementation of an action is outsourced or sub-delegated, in whole or in part, or where it requires the award of a procurement contract or financial support to be given to a third party, the contract, grant agreement or grant decision shall include the contractor's or beneficiary's obligation to impose on any third party involved explicit acceptance of those powers of the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF.\n\n\n6. Paragraphs 4 and 5 shall apply without prejudice to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\u2019\n\n\n(4)Article 15(3) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\u2018By 31 December 2021, the Commission shall, after consulting the ESSC and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, submit a final evaluation report on the implementation of the programme to the European Parliament and to the Council.\u2019\n\n\n(5)The Annex is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2018.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\nThe President\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\n\n1.3.Nature of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.4.Objective(s) \n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned \n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n3.2.Estimated impact on expenditure\u00a0\n\n\n3.2.1.Summary of estimated impact on expenditure \n\n\n3.2.2.Estimated impact on operational appropriations \n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature\n\n\n3.2.4.Compatibility with the current multiannual financial framework\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5.Third-party contributions \n\n\n3.3.Estimated impact on revenue\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\n\n1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nProposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17, by extending it to 2018-2020.\n\n\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n29 Statistics (29 01 \u2013 Administrative support for the \u2018Statistics\u2019 policy area;

and\n\n\n\u2212\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strengthening the partnership within the ESS and beyond to secure its leading role in official statistics worldwide.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following key performance indicators are set out in the programme statement and management plans, and reported in annual activity reports for the current (20132017) ESP; most of them will also be used for monitoring the implementation of the extension of the programme to 2018-2020:\n\n\nUsers' perception indicators (source: annual user satisfaction survey carried out by Eurostat):\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of users that rate as \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 the overall quality of data and services provided by Eurostat;.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of users that rate as \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 the overall quality of European statistics.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of users that rate as \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 the timeliness of European statistics for their purposes.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of users that rate as \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 the comparability of European statistics among regions and countries.\n\n\nFactual indicators:\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number of data extractions (in millions) made by external users from Eurostat public databases via the Eurostat website (source: monitoring reports on Eurostat electronic dissemination);\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Punctuality of a sample of statistics: average number of days in advance (positive) or late (negative), in comparison with the legal target. The sample is taken from the principal European economic indicators (PEEIs) (source: Eurostat annual status report on information requirements in EMU, as submitted to the Economic and Financial Committee) plus EU external trade (source: Eurostat).\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Length of the time series of a sample of statistics (Euro-Indicators \u2014 active series \u2013 source: Eurostat database).\n\n\nIndicators based on self-assessment (one for each objective):\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Degree of achievement of each specific objective, measured as a percentage of the achievement of the related activities/outputs (source: twice-yearly monitoring).\n\n\nFor monitoring the implementation of the extension of the programme to 2018-2020, the following improvements will be made:\n\n\nOne of the \"users' perception\" indicators (no. 1 to 4) \u2013 which are based on a unique source and are not univocally related to Eurostat programme or budget \u2013 will be deleted (no. 2).\n\n\nThe current indicator no. 7 on the length of the time series of a sample of statistics will be replaced by a more robust indicator that will cover all the statistical domains and take into account the provision of \"substitute\" series for the time series that are interrupted (for instance because of a change in the methodology). This new version of the indicator will be strongly tied with the programme objectives and directly or to a large extent influenced by the EU budget.\n\n\nAn additional indicator will measure the number of different \"statistics\" (i.e. indicators, sub-indicators, break-downs, units, etc.) made available to the users (as a whole and for the main statistical domains mainly affected by the ESP extension, e.g. social and environmental statistics). This indicator could be complemented by the number of data points/values/figures. The main difference between the two indicators is that the second increases also each time more recent figures become available while the first increases only when new kinds of statistics are produced. These new indicators will be strongly tied with the programme objectives and directly or to a large extent influenced by the EU budget.\n\n\nThe possibility of defining an improved timeliness indicator and developing an IT routine for calculating it on the basis of the data available in Eurostat public databases will be also analysed. If such a timeliness indicator can be implemented, it will replace the current indicator no. 3.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nUnder Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the ESP is to provide the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, setting out the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for a period corresponding to that of the MFF. ESPs lay down priorities on information needs for the conduct of EU activities and establish the budget for their implementation. As the current ESP terminates in 2017, it should be extended to cover the period 2018-2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a high level of demand for official statistics, as compared with other sources of information, because they are produced and disseminated in accordance with specific principles and quality criteria, and therefore have added value for users. A number of statistical gaps need to be addressed if statistics are to provide better support for EU policies. The timeliness of some statistics needs to be improved urgently, so as to provide the information needed for the European Semester exercise. The need for statistics arising from the Commission\u2019s 10 political priorities and from the increasing complexity of societies is bringing the relevance of current European statistics into question. \n\n\nAlthough national statistical systems have made a significant effort to modernise their production methods with the support of the 2013-2017 ESP, the current statistical production infrastructure is still not flexible enough to deliver new statistics when needed, while also limiting the associated cost and administrative burden. Unless the current level of investment is increased, the ESS will not be in a position to meet the growing demand for statistics or the need to make statistics available more quickly.\n\n\nThe parties who would be affected most directly by the proposal are users of statistics (e.g. policymakers, businesses, media, researchers and the general public at EU and national level), producers of statistics (national statistical institutes and other national authorities) and respondents (households and businesses).\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nMember States collect statistical information at national level but, in order for data at EU level to be comparable, they should do so according to the same harmonised principles. It is only through a coordinated approach to the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, as provided for in the ESP, that the necessary consistency and comparability of statistics relevant to the EU\u2019s areas of activity can be guaranteed. Action at EU level, as proposed, would also contribute to an effective use of resources (due to economies of scale) and support national authorities in developing their capacity in terms of harmonisation and methodologies.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe evaluation of the 2008-2012 Community statistical programme, the mid-term evaluation of the 2013-2017 ESP and final evaluations of the modernisation of European enterprise and trade statistics (MEETS) programme have been thoroughly analysed.\n\n\nThe 2013-2017 ESP mid-term evaluation concluded that the programme is generally well implemented, with 17 of the 23 detailed objectives well on track for completion. The ESP offers good EU added value, is run efficiently, responds to users\u2019 needs and is consistent with other statistical programmes. For instance, the move towards new methods for the production of statistics supports approaches used throughout the ESS. The evaluation puts forward three recommendations to guide and further optimise the programme\u2019s implementation:\n\n\n\u2212\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pay particular attention to objectives where problems have been encountered;\n\n\n\u2212\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0secure sufficient resources to maintain the necessary level of investment to modernise the production of European statistics; and\n\n\n\u2212\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identify and implement projects at EU level that can maximise EU added value.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nCommission Decision 2012/504/EU\n20\n defines Eurostat\u2019s role and responsibilities within the internal organisation of the Commission, as regards the development, production and dissemination of statistics. As to the planning and programming of actions in the field of statistics, Article 5 of the Decision provides that activities relating to European statistics are to be determined by the ESP and the annual work programme, as referred to in Articles\u00a013 and 17, respectively, of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0223/2009. \n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u2612\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from 1 January\u00a02018 to 31\u00a0December\u00a02020\n\n\n\u2013\u2612\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from 2018 to 2020 on commitment appropriations and from 2018 to 2024 on payment appropriations. \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\u00a0\n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2612 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1(3) of the proposed Regulation stipulates that the Commission will submit a final evaluation report on the implementation of the programme to the European Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 2021, after consulting the ESS Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee. The evaluation will be carried out according to the Commission\u2019s guidelines. \n\n\nOn the basis of experience of the mid-term evaluation of the 2013-2017 ESP, the Commission (Eurostat) has started associating the activities of the annual work programme with the 114 indicators set out in the ESP. This will have the double advantage of facilitating future evaluations and enabling automatic monitoring each year as to whether all ESP indicators are being achieved. Lessons learnt from past experience that were taken into account when drafting the proposal are presented in section\u00a01.5.3 above. The results of the stakeholder consultation and impact assessment are presented in section\u00a03 of the Explanatory Memorandum.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThe management mode of the proposed programme is central direct management by the Commission. From a financial point of view, the programme will be implemented by awarding contracts mainly in the domains of statistics and IT services, and by grants (mainly to national statistical authorities).\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 allows for direct awards of grants to those authorities. As regards grants, one of the main risks identified related to the calculation of staff costs; the risk level regarding the reimbursement of staff costs has been reduced by introducing the unit costs scheme (Commission Decision C(2014)\u00a06332).\n\n\nAnnual ex post quality reviews have revealed no relevant issues as regards procurement. Observations issued by the Commission's Internal Audit and the European Court of Auditors in 2011/2012 were addressed. No procurement audits have taken place since then. Eurostat management has identified no significant risks in this area.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nEurostat\u2019s 2012-2017 control strategy will be revised and extended so as to cover the extension of the ESP to 2018-2020. The strategy will be based on a risk analysis and assessment to be carried out before the programme is extended. \n\n\nThe main elements of the internal control system are, and will continue to be, the ex ante verification of the operational and financial aspects of each financial transaction (legality, regularity and sound financial management), in accordance with Article\u00a066(5) of the Financial Regulation. Ex ante controls cover the whole expenditure life-cycle, from the planning and programming of grants and procurements to payments. To this end, controls will be carried out for each transaction using specific checklists to be used by each actor in the financial circuits. Where appropriate, additional risk analysis and assessments may be envisaged on the basis of the results of the annual controls. Where appropriate, reinforced ex ante verifications and ex post controls may also be carried out.\n\n\nAppropriate supervision, financial and performance-based reporting, audit and evaluation will also contribute to implementation of the programme budget in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and in compliance with the requirements of legality and regularity. \n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nThe programme control strategy is deemed to keep the risk of non-compliance under the materiality criterion of 2\u00a0%, which is in line with the internal control and risk management objectives in Eurostat\u2019s 2016-2020 strategic plan. The internal control system (and its costs) is deemed adequate to achieve this objective. Complementarity between these sources of assurance will be ensured, so as to avoid duplication of effort and allow for cost-efficient controls. Eurostat considers that the costs of all controls will represent around 4.5\u00a0% of the programme budget. The benefits of control (apart from compliance with regulatory provisions) include better value for money, deterrent effects, efficiency gains and system improvements.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nOn 30 October 2013, Eurostat adopted its 2014-2017 Anti-fraud Strategy in accordance with the Commission\u2019s Anti-fraud Strategy (CAFS) of 24 June 2011. The Eurostat Strategy sets out three operational objectives: \n\n\ni.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to reinforce existing anti-fraud components; \n\n\nii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to integrate anti-fraud components better in Eurostat risk assessment/management and in audits, planning, reporting and monitoring; and \n\n\niii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to strengthen Eurostat\u2019s anti-fraud capacities and awareness as part of the Commission\u2019s anti-fraud culture.\n\n\nThe Strategy is accompanied by an anti-fraud action plan. Over the period of its application, implementation of the Strategy is monitored twice a year, with reporting to management. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurostat will evaluate the impact of the Strategy in 2017 and update it accordingly. In 2016, as a milestone in the evaluation of the Strategy, Eurostat will review its antifraud action plan. \n\n\nThe reviews of the Strategy and the action plan will be carried out on the basis of the updated OLAF methodology and guidance issued in February 2016.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.MFF heading(s) and expenditure budget line(s) affected

Accounting frameworks\n\n\nThe Commission Communication of 20 August 2009 entitled \u2018GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world\u2019, and the publication of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress have given new impetus to the key challenge for the ESS, namely how to achieve better statistics on cross-cutting issues and more integrated statistics to describe complex social, environmental and economic phenomena beyond the traditional measures of economic output. Work on GDP and beyond within the ESS focuses on three priority areas: statistics for the household sector and statistics measuring the distribution of income, consumption and wealth; measuring quality of life in a multidimensional way; and measuring environmental sustainability. The new worldwide Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 provide further impetus. The European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) offers an integrated and consistent framework for all economic statistics that should be complemented by other indicators in order to provide more comprehensive information for policy- and decision-making. Full implementation of the ESA 2010 will be supported by regular quality and compliance assessments, taking into account the progressive expiry of derogations until 2020, leading to further improvements in the timeliness and availability of indicators.\"\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objective 2.1.1 is amended as follows:\n\n\ni) The fourth indent is replaced by the following: \n\n\n\"\u2014 reinforcement of links with national accounts in the areas of social protection, health and education\"\n\n\nii) Two new indents are inserted after the fifth indent as follows: \n\n\n\"\u2014 the development of timely social indicators, including advanced techniques for now-casting and flash estimates;\n\n\n\u2014 supporting international data sharing for macroeconomic data to reduce the burden for data producers and improve the availability of comparable and consistent data to users;\"\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Objective 2.1.2, the last indent is replaced by the following: \n\n\n\n\n\"\u2014 the availability and extension of harmonised housing price statistics for all Member States.\"\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Objective 2.2.1, the indents are replaced by the following: \n\n\n\"\u2014 the development of a coherent system of environmental accounts as \u2018satellite accounts\u2019 to the main national accounts, providing information on atmospheric emissions, energy consumption, flows of natural resources, trade in raw materials, environmental taxation and spending on environmental protection, possibly including green growth/procurement;\n\n\n\u2014 the development of experimental ecosystem accounts;\n\n\n\u2014 the development of climate change-related statistics, including statistics relevant to climate change adaptation; and\n\n\n\u2014 the development of indicators measuring environmental \"footprints\".\"\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objective 3.1.1 is amended as follows:\n\n\ni) The first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of statistical production processes.
