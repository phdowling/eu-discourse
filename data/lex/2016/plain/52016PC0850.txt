In particular, the reform package included Regulation (EU) No 575/2013\n1\n (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) and Directive 2013/36/EU\n2\n (the Capital Requirements Directive or CRD), on prudential requirements for and supervision of institutions, Directive 2014/59/EU\n3\n (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD), on recovery and resolution of institutions and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014\n4\n on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). \n\n\nThese measures were taken in response to the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2008 and reflect internationally agreed standards. While the reforms have rendered the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, they do not yet comprehensively address all identified problems. The present proposals therefore aim to complete the reform agenda by tackling remaining weaknesses and implementing some outstanding elements of the reform that are essential to ensure the institutions' resilience but have only recently been finalised by global standard setters (i.e. the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)):\n\n\n\uf0b7a binding leverage ratio which will prevent institutions from excessively increasing leverage, e.g. to compensate for low profitability;\n\n\n\uf0b7a binding net stable funding ratio (NSFR) which will build on institutions\u2019 improved funding profiles and establish a harmonised standard for how much stable, long-term sources of funding an institution needs to weather periods of market and funding stress; \n\n\n\uf0b7more risk sensitive own funds (i.e. capital) requirements for institutions that trade to an important extent in securities and derivatives which will prevent too much divergence in those requirements that is not based on the institutions' risk profiles;\n\n\n\uf0b7last but not least, new standards on the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) which will require those institutions to have more loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity, tackle interconnections in the global financial markets and further strengthen the EU\u2019s ability to resolve failing G-SIIs while minimising risks for taxpayers.\n\n\nThe Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction in its Communication of 24 November 2015\n5\n and committed to bring forward a legislative proposal that builds on the international agreements listed above. Such risk reduction measures will not only further strengthen the resilience of the European banking system and the markets' confidence in it, but will also provide the basis for further progress in completing the Banking Union. The need for further concrete legislative steps to be taken in terms of reducing risks in the financial sector has been recognised also by the Ecofin Council Conclusions from 17 June 2016.\n6\n The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2016 on the Banking Union \u2013 Annual Report 2015 also indicates some areas in the current regulatory framework that could be further addressed.\n\n\nAt the same time, the Commission needed to take account of the existing regulatory framework and the new regulatory developments at international level and respond to challenges affecting the EU economy, especially the need to promote growth and jobs at times of uncertain economic outlook. Various major policy initiatives, such as the Investment Plan for Europe (EFSI) and the Capital Markets Union have been launched in order to strengthen the economy of the Union. The ability of institutions to finance the economy needs to be enhanced without impinging on the stability of the regulatory framework. In order to ensure that recent reforms in the financial sector interact smoothly with each other and with new policy initiatives, but also with broader recent reforms in the financial sector, the Commission carried out, on the basis of a call for evidence, a thorough holistic assessment of the existing financial services framework (including the CRR, CRD, BRRD and SRMR). The upcoming review of global standards was also assessed from a wider economic impact perspective. \n\n\nAmendments based on international developments represent a faithful implementation of international standards into Union law, subject to targeted adjustments in order to reflect EU specificities and broader policy considerations. For instance, the predominant reliance on bank financing by EU small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or for infrastructure projects prompts specific regulatory adjustments that ensure institutions remain capable of funding them as they constitute the backbone of the single market. A smooth interaction with existing requirements, such as for central clearing and collateralisation of derivatives exposures, or a gradual transition to some of the new requirements are necessary. Such adjustments, limited in terms of scope or time, do therefore not impinge on the overall soundness of the proposals, which are aligned with the basic level of ambition of the international standards.\n\n\nMoreover, based on the call for evidence, the proposals aim at improving existing rules. The analysis of the Commission showed that the present framework can be applied in a more proportionate way, taking into account in particular the situation of smaller and less complex institutions where some of the current disclosure, reporting and complex trading book-related requirements appear not to be justified by prudential considerations. Furthermore, the Commission has considered the risk attached to loans to SMEs and for funding infrastructure projects and found that for some of those loans, it would be justified to apply lower own funds requirements than are applied at present. Accordingly, the present proposals will bring corrections to these requirements and will enhance the proportionality of the prudential framework for institutions. Thereby, the ability of institutions to finance the economy will be enhanced without impinging on the stability of the regulatory framework. \n\n\nFinally, the Commission, in close cooperation with the Expert Group on Banking, Payments and Insurance has assessed the application of existing options and discretions in the CRD and the CRR. Based on this analysis, the present proposal is intending to eliminate some options and discretions concerning the provisions on the leverage ratio, on large exposures and on own funds. It is proposed to end to the possibility to create new State guaranteed deferred tax assets not relying on future profitability that would be exempted from deduction from regulatory capital.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nSeveral elements of the CRD and CRR proposals follows inherent reviews, whilst other adaptations of the financial regulatory framework have become necessary in light of subsequent developments, such as the adoption of the BRRD, the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the work undertaken by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and on international level.\n\n\nThe proposal introduces amendments to the existing legislation and renders it fully consistent with the existing policy provisions in the field of prudential requirements for institutions, their supervision and recovery and resolution framework.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nFour years after the European Heads of State and Governments agreed to create a Banking Union, two pillars of the Banking Union \u2013 single supervision and resolution \u2013 are in place, resting on the solid foundation of a single rulebook for all EU institutions. While important progress has been made, further steps are needed to complete the Banking Union, including the creation of a single deposit guarantee scheme. \n\n\n\n\nThe review of the CRR and the CRD is part of risk reducing measures that are needed to further strengthen resilience of the banking sector and that are parallel to the staged introduction of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). The review aims at the same time to ensure a continued single rulebook for all EU institutions, whether inside or outside the Banking Union. The overall objectives of this initiative, as described above, are fully consistent and coherent with the EU's fundamental goals of promoting financial stability, reducing the likelihood and the extent of taxpayers' support in case an institution is resolved as well as contributing to a harmonious and sustainable financing of economic activity, which is conducive to a high level of competitiveness and consumer protection.\n\n\nThese overall objectives are also in line with the objectives set by other major EU initiatives, as described above.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposed amendments are built on the same legal basis as the legislative acts that are being amended, i.e. Article 114 TFEU for the proposal for a regulation amending CRR and Article 53(1) TFEU for the proposal for a directive amending CRD IV.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe objectives pursued by the proposed measures aim at supplementing already existing EU legislation and can therefore best be achieved at EU level rather than by different national initiatives. National measures aimed at, for example, reducing institutions\u2019 leverage, strengthening their stable funding and trading book capital requirements would not be as effective in ensuring financial stability as EU rules, given the freedom of institutions to establish and provide services in other Member States and the resulting degree of cross-border service provision, capital flows and market integration. On the contrary, national measures could distort competition and affect capital flows. Moreover, adopting national measures would be legally challenging, given that the CRR already regulates banking matters, including leverage requirements (reporting), liquidity (specifically the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR) and trading book requirements.\n\n\nThe amendment of the CRR and CRD is thus considered to be the best option. It strikes the right balance between harmonising rules and maintaining national flexibility where essential, without hampering the single rulebook. The amendments would further promote a uniform application of prudential requirements, the convergence of supervisory practices and ensure a level playing field throughout the single market for banking services. These objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone. This is particularly important in the banking sector where many credit institutions operate across the EU single market. Full cooperation and trust within the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and within the colleges of supervisors and competent authorities outside the SSM is essential for credit institutions to be effectively supervised on a consolidated basis. National rules would not achieve these objectives.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nProportionality has been an integral part of the impact assessment accompanying the proposal. Not only have all the proposed options in different regulatory fields been individually assessed against the proportionality objective, but also the lack of proportionality of the existing rules has been presented as a separate problem and specific options have been analysed aiming at reducing administrative and compliance costs for smaller institutions (see sections 2.9 and 4.9 of the impact assessment).\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe measures are proposed to be implemented by amending the CRR and the CRD through a Regulation and a Directive, respectively. The proposed measures indeed refer to or develop further already existing provisions inbuilt in those legal instruments (liquidity, leverage, remuneration, proportionality).\n\n\nAs regards the new FSB agreed standard on TLAC, it is suggested to incorporate the bulk of the standard into the CRR, as only a regulation can achieve the necessary uniform application, much in the same way as the existing risk-based own funds requirements. Shaping prudential requirements in the form of an amendment to the CRR would ensure that those requirements will in fact be directly applicable to G-SIIs. This would prevent Member States from implementing diverging national requirements in an area where full harmonisation is desirable in order to prevent an un-level playing field. Fine-tuning of the current legal provisions within the BRRD will however be necessary to make sure that the TLAC requirement and the minimum requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) are fully coherent and consistent with each other.\n\n\nSome of the proposed CRD amendments affecting proportionality would leave Member States with a certain degree of flexibility to maintain\u00a0different rules at the stage of their transposition into national law. It would give Member States the option of imposing stricter rules on certain matters.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThe Commission carried out various initiatives in order to assess whether the existing prudential framework and the upcoming reviews of global standards were the most adequate instruments to ensure prudential objectives for EU institutions and also whether they would continue to provide the necessary funding to the EU economy. \n\n\nIn July 2015 the Commission launched a public consultation on the possible impact of the CRR and the CRD on bank financing of the EU economy with a particular focus on the financing of SMEs and of infrastructure and in September 2015 a Call for Evidence (CfE)\n7\n covering EU financial legislation as a whole. The two initiatives sought empirical evidence and concrete feedback on i) rules affecting the ability of the economy to finance itself and growth, ii) unnecessary regulatory burdens, iii) interactions, inconsistencies and gaps in the rules, and iv) rules giving rise to unintended consequences. In addition, the Commission gathered stakeholders' views in the framework of specific analyses carried out on provisions regulating remuneration\n8\n and on the proportionality of the rules contained in the CRR and the CRD. Finally, a public consultation was launched in the context of the study contracted out by the Commission to assess the impact of the CRR on the bank financing of the economy\n9\n. \n\n\nAll the initiatives mentioned above have provided clear evidence of the need to update and complete the current rules in order i) to reduce further the risks in the banking sector and thereby reduce the reliance on State aid and taxpayers' money in case of a crisis, and ii) to enhance the ability of institutions to channel adequate funding to the economy.\n\n\nAnnexes 1 and 2 of the impact assessment provide a summary of the consultations, reviews and reports.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe impact assessment\n10\n was discussed with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board and rejected on 7 September 2016. Following the rejection, the impact assessment was strengthened by adding i) a better explanation on the policy context of the proposal (i.e. it relation to both international and EU policy developments), ii) more details on stakeholders' views and iii) further evidence on the impacts (both in terms of benefits and costs) of the various policy options that are explored in the impact assessment. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion\n11\n on 27 September 2016 on the resubmitted impact assessment. The proposal is accompanied by the impact assessment. The proposal remains consistent with the impact assessment.\n\n\nAs shown by the simulation analysis and macroeconomic modelling developed in the impact assessment, there are limited costs to be expected from the introduction of the new requirements, in particular the new Basel standards such as the leverage ratio and the trading book. The estimated long-term impact on gross domestic product (GDP) ranges between -0.03% and -0.06% while the increase in funding costs for the banking sector is estimated to be under 3 basis points in the most extreme scenario. On the benefits side, the simulation exercise has shown that public resources required to support the banking system in case of a financial crisis of the size similar to 2007 \u2013 2008 would decrease by 32% \u2013 a decline from EUR 51 billion to EUR 34 billion.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe retention of simplified approaches to calculate own funds requirements are expected to ensure continued proportionality of the rules for smaller institutions. Furthermore, the additional measures to increase proportionality of some of the requirements (related to reporting, disclosure and remuneration) should decrease the administrative and compliance burden for those institutions.\n\n\nAs far as SMEs are concerned, the proposed recalibration of the own funds requirements for bank exposures to SMEs is expected to have a positive effect on bank financing of SMEs. This would primarily affect SMEs which currently have exposures beyond EUR 1,5 million as these exposures do not benefit from the SME Supporting Factor under the existing rules.\n\n\nOther elements of the proposal, particularly those aimed at improving resilience of institutions to future crises, are expected to increase sustainability of lending to SMEs. \n\n\nFinally, measures aimed at reducing compliance costs for institutions, in particular the smaller and less complex institutions, are expected to reduce borrowing costs for SMEs.\n\n\nOn the third country dimension, the proposal will enhance the stability of EU financial markets thereby reducing the likelihood and costs of potential negative spillovers for global financial markets. Moreover, the proposed amendments will further harmonise the regulatory framework throughout the Union thereby reducing substantially administrative costs for third country institutions operating in the EU. \n\n\nIn view of the ongoing review of the investment firms under the CRR and in light of the initial report delivered by EBA\n12\n, it is considered reasonable that the newly introduced requirements apply only to systemically relevant investment firms, whilst other investment firms are grandfathered until the completion of the review.\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with the Commission's priority for the Digital Single Market.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. In this context, the proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on these rights, as listed in the main UN conventions on human rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is an integral part of the EU Treaties and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\n\n4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal does not have implications for the Union budget.  \n\n\n5. OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nIt is expected that the proposed amendments will start entering into force in 2019 at the earliest. The amendments are tightly inter-linked with other provisions of the CRR and the CRD that are already in force and have been monitored since 2014. \n\n\nThe BCBS and the EBA will continue to collect the necessary data for the monitoring of the leverage ratio and the new liquidity measures in order to allow for the future impact evaluation of the new policy tools. Regular Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREPs) and stress testing exercises will also help monitoring the impact of the new proposed measures upon affected institutions and assessing the adequacy of the flexibility and proportionality provided for to cater for the specificities of smaller institutions. Additionally, the Commission services will continue to participate in the working groups of the BCBS and the joint task force established by the European Central Bank (ECB) and by EBA, that monitor the dynamics of institutions' own funds and liquidity positions, globally and in the EU, respectively.\n\n\nThe set of indicators to monitor the progress of the results stemming from the implementation of the preferred options consists of the following:\n\n\n\n\nOn Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nNSFR for EU institutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nAs of the date of application, 99% of institutions taking part to the EBA Basel III monitoring exercise meet the NSFR at 100% (65% of group 1 and 89% of group 2 credit institutions meet the NSFR as of end-December 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of data\n\n\n\n\nSemi-annual EBA Basel III monitoring reports\n\n\n\n\n\nOn leverage ratio:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nLeverage ratio for EU institutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nAs of the date of application, 99% of group 1 and group 2 credit institutions  have a leverage ratio of at least 3% (93,4% of group 1 institutions met the target as of June 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of data\n\n\n\n\nSemi-annual EBA Basel III monitoring reports\n\n\n\n\n\nOn SMEs\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nFinancing gap to SMEs in the EU, i.e. difference between the need for external funds and the availability of funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nAs of two years after the date of application, < 13% (last known figure \u2013 13% as of end 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of data\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission / European Central Bank SAFE Survey (data coverage limited to the euro area)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn TLAC:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nTLAC in G-SIIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nAll EU Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) meet the target (>16% of risk weighted assets (RWA)/6% of the Leverage Ratio Exposure Measure (LREM) as of 2019, > 18% Risk Weighted Assets (RWA)/6.75% LREM as of 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of data\n\n\n\n\nSemi-annual EBA Basel III monitoring reports\n\n\n\n\n\nOn trading book:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\n\n\n\n\nRWA for market risks for EU institutions\n\n\nObserved variability of risk-weighted assets of aggregated portfolios applying the internal models approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n\n\n- As of 2023, all EU institutions meet the own funds requirements for market risks under the final calibration adopted in the EU.\n\n\n- As of 2021, unjustifiable variability (i.e. variability not driven by differences in underlying risks) of the outcomes of the internal models across EU institutions is lower than the current variability* of the internal models across EU institutions.\n\n\n_______________\n\n\n*Reference values for the \"current variability\" of value-at-risk (VaR) and incremental risk charge (IRC) requirements should be those estimated by the latest EBA \"Report on variability of Risk Weighted Assets for Market Risk Portfolios\", calculated for aggregated portfolios, published before the entry into force of the new market risk framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of data\n\n\n\n\nSemi-annual EBA Basel III monitoring reports\n\n\nEBA Report on variability of Risk Weighted Assets for Market Risk Portfolios.

EBA will be mandated to define and gather the data needed for monitoring the above mentioned indicators as well as other indicators needed for the evaluation of the amended CRR and CRD. The methodology could be developed for individual options or a set of interlinked options depending on the circumstances present before launching the evaluation and depending on the output of monitoring indicators.\n\n\nCompliance and enforcement will be ensured on an ongoing basis where needed through the Commission launching infringement proceedings for lack of transposition or for incorrect transposition or application of the legislative measures. Reporting of breaches of EU law can be channelled through the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), including the national competent authorities and EBA, as well as through the ECB. EBA will also continue publishing its regular reports of the Basel III monitoring exercise on the EU banking system. This exercise monitors the impact of the Basel III requirements (as implemented through the CRR and the CRD) on EU institutions in particular as regards institutions' capital ratios (risk-based and non-risk-based) and liquidity ratios (LCR, NSFR). It is run in parallel with the one conducted by the BCBS.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nWaivers from capital and liquidity requirements (CRR)\n\n\nRequiring subsidiaries to comply with own funds and liquidity requirements on an individual basis may prevent institutions from managing those resources efficiently at the level of the group. This is particularly relevant in the current context where technological developments increasingly facilitate centralisation of capital and liquidity management in a group. \n\n\n\n\nUnder existing legislation competent authorities have been endowed with the possibility to waive the application of requirements on an individual level for subsidiaries or parents within a single Member State or part of a liquidity sub-group spread across several Member States, subject to safeguards ensuring that capital and liquidity are distributed adequately between the parent undertaking and the subsidiaries. With the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), group supervision has been substantially reinforced especially where group entities are situated in the Member States participating in the SSM, with the SSM having a better knowledge and direct powers over group entities situated in different Member States. However, pending the completion of the Banking Union, concerns in  Member States where the subsidiaries are located still persist that insufficient liquidity or capital at the level of subsidiaries in trouble might have fiscal consequences for such (\"host\") Member States. These concerns have been addressed in the current proposal through the following safeguards: the conditions already existing in the CRR are supplemented by a clearly framed obligation for the parent to support the subsidiaries. Such commitment of the parent is required to be guaranteed for the whole amount of the waived requirement and the guarantee needs to be collateralised for at least half of the guaranteed amount. The Commission will carefully monitor the implementation of the relevant provisions. \n\n\nIt is considered that, at this stage of the Banking Union, it should be possible for the competent authority supervising parents and subsidiaries established in different Member States within the Banking Union to waive the application of own funds and liquidity requirements for subsidiaries located in other Member States than the parent, but only provided the commitment of the parent to support such subsidiaries is guaranteed for the whole amount of the waived requirement and the guarantee is collateralised for at least half of the guaranteed amount. Articles 7 and 8 of the CRR are amended accordingly. The same waivers are made available, as an option, for competent authorities of Member States outside the Banking Union, subject to their explicit agreement.\n\n\nImplementation of the FSB total loss absorption capacity standard (CRR, BRRD, SRM)\n\n\nThe FSB published on 9 November 2015 the Total Loss-absorbing Capacity Term Sheet ('the TLAC standard') that was adopted a week later at the G20 summit in Turkey\n13\n. The TLAC standard requires Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), referred as G-SIIs in Union legislation, to have a sufficient amount of highly loss absorbing (\"bailinable\") liabilities to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation in resolution. The interaction of the TLAC standard with existing Union legislation pursuing the same regulatory objectives is described in more detail in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposals for amendments to the BRRD and the SRMR.\n\n\nConsistency with the BRRD\n\n\nThe TLAC standard is implemented in the Union via amendments to the CRR, building on the existing framework of the BRRD. In order to integrate the two frameworks which pursue the same policy purposes, new definitions have to be introduced, such as resolution entities, resolution group etc. (Article 4 of the CRR), and cooperation has to be warranted between competent authorities and resolution authorities (Article 2 of the CRR).\n\n\nBased on the review required in Article 518 of the CRR and in accordance with the requirements in Article 59 of the BRRD, the criteria for Additional Tier 1 instruments (Article 52 of the CRR) and Tier 2 instruments (Article 63 of the CRR) are amended to require that those instruments be written down or converted to Common Equity Tier 1 instruments at the point of non-viability. This will not change the status of capital instruments issued by EU institutions, while ensuring at the same time that only instruments issued by third-country subsidiaries of EU institutions that meet this additional requirement can be considered as Additional Tier 1 or as Tier 2 instruments by their EU parent entities when they calculate consolidated own funds requirements.\n\n\nThe requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\n\nThe TLAC standard is implemented in the EU by introducing a requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities composed of a risk-based ratio and on a non-risk-based ratio (new Article 92a of the CRR). Such requirement applies only in the case of G-SIIs, which may be a group of institutions or stand-alone institutions (Article 131(1) of the CRD). Article 6 of the CRR is amended to require stand-alone G-SIIs that are resolution entities to comply with the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities on a solo basis, whilst Article 11 is amended to require resolution entities part of groups designated as G-SIIs to comply with the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities on a consolidated basis. \n\n\nThe TLAC standard also contains a requirement for internal TLAC (i.e. a requirement to pre-position loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity at the level of subsidiaries within a resolution group), which is transposed in the EU by introducing a requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (new Article 92b of the CRR) that applies to non-EU G-SIIs (the BRRD contains already a similar rule for G-SIIs). Such requirement represents 90% of the requirement applicable to G-SIIs in accordance with the new Article 92a. The non-EU G-SII requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities applies to material subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIIs on a solo basis if they are neither resolution entities nor EU parent institutions, and on a consolidated basis if they are EU parent undertakings but not resolution entities.\n\n\nEligible liabilities\n\n\nA new Chapter 5a (new Articles 72a to 72l) on eligible liabilities is introduced in the CRR after the chapters governing own funds. New Article 72a lists excluded liabilities that cannot count towards fulfilling the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. Article 72b contains the eligibility criteria for eligible liabilities instruments, paragraph 2 reflecting the eligibility criteria for subordinated liabilities, whilst paragraphs 3 and 4 reflect eligibility criteria for liabilities that rank pari passu with excluded liabilities. Article 72c specifies that instruments may count towards eligible liabilities only where they have a residual maturity of at least one year. The eligibility criteria exclude liabilities issued through special purpose entities in line with the TLAC term-sheet. \n\n\nSection 2 of the new Chapter 5a (Articles 72e to 72j) provides for the deduction rules applicable to determine the net amount of liabilities that may count for the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. Institutions are obliged to deduct holdings of own eligible liabilities instruments (Article 72f), and holdings of eligible liabilities of other G-SIIs (Articles 72h and 72i). Article 72e(3) specifies a proportionate deduction for holdings of liabilities that rank pari passu with excluded liabilities and may count only up to a limited amount as eligible liabilities. Deductions are made from eligible liabilities, and from own funds \u2013 on the basis of a corresponding deduction approach (Article 66(e) of the CRR). Article 72j contains the exception from deductions for trading book items. Section 3 of the new Chapter 5a defines the concepts of eligible liabilities (Article 72k) and own funds and eligible liabilities (Article 72l). \n\n\nThe Commission will ask EBA for advice on alternative options for treating holdings of TLAC instruments issued by G-SIIs and on the impact of those options. One of the options that the Commission will seek advice on will be to implement the recently published by the BCBS approach to the treatment of TLAC holdings. Based on the advice, the Commission will consider whether changes to the solution put forward in this proposal are warranted.\n\n\nAdjustments to general requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\n\nChapter 6 of Title I of Part II of the CRR (Articles 73 to 80) is adjusted to reflect the introduction of the category of eligible liabilities. Articles 77 and 78 are extended to cover prior supervisory permission for the early redemption of capital instruments and eligible liabilities. Article 78 introduces the possibility to give a general prior permission to institutions to effect early redemptions, subject to criteria that ensure compliance with the conditions for granting such supervisory permission. Under Article 80, EBA is entrusted with monitoring issuances of own funds and eligible liabilities. To align own funds eligibility criteria with criteria for eligible liabilities, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments issued by a special purpose entity will be able to count for own funds purposes only until 31 December 2021.\n\n\nEquity investments in funds (CRR)\n\n\nIn December 2013, the BCBS published a new standard on the treatment of equity investments in funds. The new standard was aimed at clarifying the existing treatment and at achieving a more internationally consistent and risk-sensitive treatment of such exposures (i.e. one reflecting both the risk of the fund\u2019s underlying investments and its leverage). In order to implement the new standard in Union law, several changes were made to the CRR.\n\n\nArticle 128 is amended to ensure the definition of items associated with particularly high risk does not capture exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs. \n\n\nArticle 132 is amended to reflect the new general principles and requirements underlying the calculation of own funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs for institutions applying the Standardised Approach for credit risk.  \n\n\n\n\nA new Article 132a is introduced to detail the calculations under two of the approaches foreseen under Article 132, namely the look-through approach and the mandate-based approach.\n\n\nArticle 152 is amended to reflect the revised requirements and approaches to calculate own funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs for institutions applying the Internal Rating Based Approach for credit risk.\n\n\nStandardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) (CRR)\n\n\nIn March 2014, the BCBS published a standard on a new standardised method to compute the exposure value of derivatives exposures, the so-called Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR), to address the shortcomings of the existing standardised methods. In order to introduce the new method into Union law, while ensuring that the new rules remain proportionate, several changes to the CRR were made.\n\n\nIn Article 273, some definitions were modified and some new definitions were added to reflect the new methods introduced. The Mark-to-Market Method was replaced by the SA-CCR (Articles 274 to 280f). The rules related to the Standardised Method were removed. New rules on a simplified SA-CCR were introduced (Article 281). The current rules on the Original Exposure Method were modified (Article 282). The eligibility criteria for using the OEM were modified and eligibility criteria for using the simplified SA-CCR were introduced (Article 273a and 273b). Articles 298 and 299 were modified to reflect the introduction of the SA-CCR.\n\n\nExposures to CCPs (CRR and EMIR)\n\n\nIn April 2014, the BCBS published a final standard on the treatment of exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). The final standard addressed the shortcomings of the interim standard published two years earlier. In order to implement the final standard in Union legislation, several changes were made to the CRR and to Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (the European Market Infrastructure Regulation or EMIR).\n\n\nAmendments to Articles 300 to 310 and 497 of the CRR\n\n\nSeveral new definitions were added to Article 300 covering terms used in the amended rules on own funds requirements for exposures to CCPs. Article 301 was modified in order to introduce a specific treatment of institutions' exposures to a CCP due to cash transactions, to specify further the treatment of initial margin and to reflect the fact that a single method would be applicable to the calculation of own funds requirements for exposures to qualifying CCPs (QCCPs). Article 304 was modified in order to reflect change to the methods for calculating exposure values of derivatives, and to clarify the treatment of securities financing transactions (SFTs) and of collateral provided by clients to their clearing members. Articles 305 was modified to clarify the treatment of SFTs and to adjust the eligibility criteria for the preferential treatment of clients' exposures. A clarification of the treatment of clearing members' guarantees to their clients as well as of the treatment of SFTs was inserted in Article 306. A new method for calculating own funds requirements for prefunded default fund contributions to a QCCP was introduced in Article 308. The formula for calculating the own funds requirements for exposures to a non-qualifying CCP in Article 309 was modified. In Article 310, the alternative method for calculating the own funds requirements for exposures to CCPs was removed and replaced by a new treatment for unfunded default fund contributions. Finally, the transitional provisions in Article 497 were modified.\n\n\nAmendments to Articles 50a to 50d and 89 of EMIR\n\n\nArticles 50a to 50d were modified to incorporate a new method for calculating the hypothetical capital of a CCP that is needed by institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for default fund contributions to that CCP. Article 89(5a) was modified to update the transitional provisions related to that calculation.\n\n\nTrading book/Market risk (CRR)\n\n\nIn January 2016, the BCBS concluded its work on the fundamental review of the trading book and published a new standard on the treatment of market risk. The standard addressed the design flaws present in existing market risk framework, including the insufficient capture of the full range of risks to which institutions were exposed to and uncertainty about the boundary between the trading and non-trading (i.e. banking) book which created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The new standard contains revised rules for the use of internal models for calculating own funds for market risk, as well as a new standardised approach which replaces the existing one. In order to implement the new standard in Union law, while ensuring that the rules remain proportionate, several modifications were made to the CRR.\n\n\nIn Title I -General requirements, valuation and reporting\n\n\nArticle 94 sets out the revised conditions for an institution to benefit from the derogation for institutions with small trading book business, under which the own funds requirements for the credit risk of banking book positions may replace the own funds requirements for the market risk. Articles 102 and 103 clarify the general requirements for trading book positions. Article 104 and 104a clarify the criteria to assign positions in the trading book and the conditions for reclassifying a trading book position as a banking book position and vice versa. Article 104b defines the new concept of trading desk. Article 105 sets out the rules that must be respected to prudently value trading book positions. Article 106 describes the recognition and treatment of trading book positions which are considered as internal hedges of positions in the banking books.\n\n\nIn Title IV Chapter 1 \u2013 General provisions\n\n\nArticle 325 describes the different approaches that can be used by institutions to compute own funds requirements for market risk as well as the conditions for their use and how their use may be combined. Article 325a specifies in more detail the eligibility criteria for using the simplified standard approach for institutions with medium-sized trading book business. Article 325b lays out the conditions under which market risk exposures can be netted between different legal entities within a group for the purposes of calculating consolidated own funds requirements for market risk. Article 325c specifies the conditions under which the positions entered into by an institution in order to hedge against the adverse effect of changes in exchange rates on the institution's own funds ratios can be exempted from the market risk requirements.\n\n\nChapter 1a \u2013 The standardised approach\n\n\nSection 1 (Article 325d) describes the different components of the standardised approach. Section 2 (Articles 325e to 325l) describes the functioning of the first component, the sensitivities-based method. It sets out the general principles for the calculation and aggregation of delta, vega and curvature risks. Subsection 1 of Section 3 (Articles 325m to 325r) specifies the risk factors that have to be considered to calculate the sensitivities of trading book positions to different classes of risk. Subsection 2 of Section 3 (Articles 325s to 325u) explains how these sensitivities must be computed. Section 4 (Article 325v) describes the functioning of the second component of the standardised approach, the residual risk add-on. Section 5 describes the functioning of the third component of the standardised approach, the default risk charge. Article 325w gives the main definitions. Subsection 1 (Articles 325x to 325z) describes how the default risk charge must be computed for non-securitisation positions, while subsections 2 (Articles 325aa and 325ab) and 3 (Articles 325ac to 325ae) describe the same calculation for securitisations. Section 6 (Articles 325af to 325az) provides the risk weights and correlations that must be used for each risk class in combination with the sensitivities to determine own funds requirements for market risks under the standardised approach. Exposures to EU sovereigns are included in the first risk bucket, which is assigned the lowest risk weight (Articles 325ai and 325al). This treatment is in line with the non-rating dependent treatment currently provided for those types of exposures included in the non-trading book. The risk weights applicable to covered bonds issued by EU institutions were reduced (Articles 325ai and 325al). This treatment would prevent a potential significant increase in the capital requirements for exposures to covered bonds issued by EU institutions, thus maintaining lower funding costs for mortgage loans for housing and non-residential property.  \n\n\nChapter 1b \u2013 The internal model approach\n\n\n\n\nSection 1 (Articles 325ba and 325bb) specifies the conditions under which institutions are allowed to use internal models and how own funds requirements for market risk must be calculated for trading desks that benefit from this permission. Section 2 (Articles 325bc to 325bl) describes how expected shortfalls and liquidity horizons must be used in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk, the requirements that internal models must meet in terms of back testing, profit-and-loss (P&L) attribution, internal validation as well as more general qualitative and risk measurement requirements, and the stress scenario risk measure that must be calculated for the non-modellable risk factors. Like for the standardised approach, a beneficial treatment was introduced under the internal models approach via shorter liquidity horizons for exposures to EU sovereigns and covered bonds issued by EU institutions (Article 325be). Section 3 (Articles 325bm to 325bq) describes how the default risk charge must be calculated for trading desks subject to default risk using an internal model approach. \n\n\nChapters 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 The simplified standardised approach\n\n\nChapters 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 respectively own funds requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risks and commodity risks \u2013 reflect the simplified standardised approach under the revised market risk framework. These rules already existed in the current market risk framework and remain unchanged. Institutions will be able to use this approach until [date of application of this Regulation]. After this date, only institutions that fulfil the eligibility criteria set out in Article 325a will be able to use the simplified standardised approach.\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 The simplified internal approach\n\n\nChapter 5 constitutes the simplified internal models approach under the revised market risk framework. These rules already existed in the current market risk framework and remain unchanged. Institutions will be able to use this approach until [date of application of this Regulation]. After this date, institutions will no longer be able to use the simplified internal models approach for calculating the own fund requirements for market risks. However, Chapter 5 shall remain in force for calculating the own fund requirements for CVA risks under the Advanced method as set out in Article 383.\n\n\nPart Ten \u2013 Transitional provisions, reports, reviews and amendments, \n\n\nArticle 501b describes how own funds requirements for market risk, as calculated under Chapters 1a and 1b, will be phased-in. Article 519a specifies a number of technical elements of the revised market risk framework that may appear to be problematic once implemented. The EBA is mandated to review those technical elements no later than 3 years after the entry into force of this Regulation and the Commission may make proposals to change the related rules in light of the EBA conclusions. \n\n\nLarge exposures (CRR)\n\n\nThe current capital base (the 'eligible capital') only captures a small part of the overall large exposures that institutions have and is thus not sufficiently prudent to avoid that the maximum possible loss by an institution in case of the sudden failure of a single counterparty or a group of counterparties endangers the institution\u2019s survival as a going concern. Moreover, the current limit does not take into account the higher risks carried by the exposures that G-SIIs have to single counterparties or groups of connected clients and, in particular, as regards exposures to other G-SIIs. The financial crisis has, in fact, demonstrated that material losses in one G-SII can trigger concerns about the solvency of other G-SIIs with potentially serious consequences on financial stability. Finally, the current large exposures framework relies on less accurate methods than the new methodology (i.e. Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk, SA-CCR) that the BCBS has developed for computing banks\u2019 derivatives exposures (i.e. OTCs). The large exposures framework is amended to address the loopholes identified. In particular, the capital that can be taken into account to calculate the large exposures limit is limited to Tier 1 capital (no more Tier 2 capital); Article 395(1) is amended to introduce the lower limit of 15% for G-SIBs exposures to other G-SIBs and the amended Article 390 imposes the use of the SA-CCR methods for determining exposures to OTC derivative transactions, even for banks that have been authorised to use internal models. The modifications introduced in the current framework will overall increase the risk-sensitivity of the large exposures regime and better align the European system to the BCBS standard on large exposures issued in 2014.\n\n\nArticle 507 of the CRR required the Commission to review and report on the application of Article 400(1)(j) and Article 400(2). Since it was not possible to gather sufficient quantitative data to assess the potential impact of removing or rendering mandatory the exemptions listed in those provision, Article 507 provides for a new mandate to the EBA to report to the Commission on the use of the exemptions set out in Article 400 (1) and (2) and Article 390 (6). \n\n\nLeverage ratio (CRR)\n\n\nNew provisions are introduced and adjustments are made to several articles in the CRR in order to introduce a binding leverage ratio requirement for all institutions subject to the CRD. The leverage ratio requirement complements the current requirements on supervisory monitoring of the risk of excessive leverage in the CRD and the CRR requirements to calculate the leverage ratio, to report it to supervisors and, since January 2015, to disclose it publicly.\n\n\nThe leverage ratio requirement \n\n\nA leverage ratio requirement of 3% of Tier 1 capital \u2013 as agreed at international level -  is added to the own funds requirements in Article 92 of the CRR which institutions must meet in addition to their risk-based requirements. Thereby a harmonised binding requirement is introduced throughout the Union, setting a backstop for institutions. In addition, competent authorities remain responsible for monitoring leverage policies and processes of individual institutions and may impose additional measures to address risks of excessive leverage, if warranted.\n\n\nAdjustments to the leverage ratio exposure measure \n\n\nThe adjustments to the leverage ratio exposure measure that were already included in the current CRR have been carried over. Since a 3% leverage ratio would constrain certain business models and lines of business more than others, further adjustments are warranted. Institutions may reduce the leverage ratio exposure measure for public lending by public development banks (Article 429a(1)(d)), pass-through loans (Article 429(1)(e)) and officially guaranteed export credits (Article 429a(1)(f)). In order not to dis-incentivise client clearing by institutions, institutions are allowed to reduce the exposure measure by the initial margin received from clients for derivatives cleared through QCCPs (Article 429c(4)).\n\n\nA leverage ratio buffer for G-SIBs\n\n\nInternational discussions are ongoing on a possible leverage ratio buffer for G-SIBs. Once a final international agreement on the leverage ratio buffer will be reached it should be considered for inclusion in the CRR.\n\n\nRegulatory reporting (CRR)\n\n\nVarious provisions have been added to or amended in the CRR and the CRD to enhance proportionality and reduce costs on institutions in the overall regulatory reporting framework.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 99(5) is amended to include a mandate to EBA to deliver a report to the Commission on the cost of regulatory reporting by 31 December 2019. The mandate sets out a very precise methodology for EBA to quantify reporting costs on institutions and provides for an obligation to make recommendations on ways to simplify reporting for small institutions through amendments to existing EBA reporting templates. \n\n\nSmall institutions as defined in Article 430a will only be required to submit regulatory reports on an annual basis as opposed to semi-annually or more frequently for all other institutions (Articles 99(4), 100, 101, 394 and 430).\n\n\nReporting on large exposures will be simplified by removing one item and clarifying another item currently required to be reported under Article 394.\n\n\nDisclosure (CRR)\n\n\nEnhanced proportionality in disclosure requirements\n\n\nNew provisions are added in Part Eight to provide for a more proportionate disclosure regime that takes into account the relative size and complexity of institutions. These are classified into three categories as either significant (Article 433a), small (Article 433b) and other (Article 433c), with a further distinction between listed and non-listed institutions. Disclosure requirements will apply to each category of institutions on a sliding scale basis, with a differentiation in the substance and frequency of disclosures. \n\n\nAt the upper end of the sliding scale, large institutions with listed securities will be required to provide annual disclosures of all the information required under Part Eight, plus disclosures of selected information on a semi-annual and quarterly basis, including in the latter case a key prudential metrics table (Article 447). On the lower end, small non-listed institutions will only be required to make selected disclosures of governance, remuneration and risk management information and the key metrics table on an annual basis. \n\n\nTargeted amendments for consistency purposes with international standards and new or amended Pillar 1 requirements\n\n\nA number of amendments have been made to Titles II and III of Part Eight (Articles 435 to 455) to align better disclosure requirements with international standards on disclosures. In particular, a new requirement has been added to disclose information about significant investments in insurance undertakings that a competent authority has authorised not to be deducted from supplementary own fund requirements of financial conglomerates (Article 438(e) and (f)).\n\n\n\nOther amendments to these Titles are intended to reflect new or amended Pillar 1 requirements to be introduced as part of this legislative proposal. This will include disclosures on TLAC (Article 437a), counterparty credit risk (Article 439), market risk (Article 445) and liquidity requirements (Article 451a). Finally, some clarifications are made to the remuneration disclosures and a disclosure requirement is introduced concerning the use of derogations from the remuneration rules of Directive 2013/36/EU (Article 450).\n\n\n\nEmpowerments to the EBA and the Commission \n\n\nThe proposal comprises an empowerment to EBA to develop uniform disclosure formats, which should be as aligned as possible with international disclosure formats to facilitate comparability (Article 434a).\n\n\nTo the same end, the proposal includes an empowerment to the Commission to amend the disclosure requirements in Part Eight to reflect developments or amendments of international standards on disclosures (Article 456(k)).\n\n\nNSFR (CRR)\n\n\nA new Title is added to Part Six, and adjustments to existing provisions have been made to introduce a binding net stable funding ratio (NSFR) for credit institutions and systemic investment firms.\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\nAdjustments have been made to the general provisions in Part One. Amendments have been made to Article 8 to adjust the conditions under which institutions can benefit from waivers from liquidity requirements at individual level, and to Articles 11 and 18 regarding consolidation rules.\n\n\nExisting liquidity provisions\n\n\nAmendments are introduced in Titles I and II of Part Six to adjust definitions and reporting requirements. Definitions are adjusted in Article 411, while reporting requirements are further specified in Articles 412, 413, 415, 416 and 422 to 425. Article 414 is modified to integrate the new NSFR requirement and specify the applicable consequences should it be breached. \n\n\nThe new Title IV of Part Six:  The net stable funding ratio\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1 The net stable funding ratio (Articles 428a and 428b)\n\n\nArticle 428a specifies rules for subsidiaries in third countries for the calculation of the NSFR on a consolidated basis.\n\n\nArticle 428b defines the general design of the NSFR which is calculated as the ratio of an institution's amount of available stable funding (ASF) to its amount of required stable funding (RSF).\n\n\nChapter 2 General rules of calculation of the net stable funding ratio (Articles 428c to 428h)\n\n\nArticle 428c clarifies the general rules that apply to calculate the NSFR. \n\n\nArticle 428d specifies the way derivatives contracts shall be taken into account for the calculation of the NSFR, while Article 428e specifies the netting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions.\n\n\nArticle 428f defines the conditions under which some assets and liabilities can be considered as interdependent and draws a list of products whose assets and liabilities shall be considered as such: centralised regulated savings, promotional loans, covered bonds issuance without funding risk on a one-year horizon and derivatives client clearing activities. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act to review this list (new paragraph 3 of Article 460).\n\n\nArticle 428g specifies the treatment of deposits in cooperative networks or institutional protection schemes and Article 428h introduces a discretion for competent authorities to grant a preferential treatment to intragroup transactions under some conditions. \n\n\nChapter 3 Available stable funding (Articles 428i to 428o)\n\n\nSection 1 (Articles 428i and 428j) of this Chapter defines the general rules that apply to calculate the amount of ASF that constitutes the numerator of the NSFR. \n\n\nSection 2 (Articles 428k to 428o) defines the ASF factors that apply to the regulatory capital and to different liabilities depending on their characteristics, in particular their maturity and the nature of the counterparty.\n\n\nChapter 4 Required stable funding (Articles 428p to 428ag)\n\n\nSection 1 (Articles 428p and 428q) of this Chapter defines the general rules that apply to calculate the amount of RSF that constitutes the denominator of the NSFR. \n\n\nSection 2 (Articles 428r to 428o) defines the RSF factors that apply to different assets and off-balance sheets exposures depending on their characteristics, in particular their maturity, their liquidity and the nature of the counterparty. \n\n\nThe definitions and RSF factors applied for the calculation of the NSFR reflect the definitions and haircuts applied for the calculation of the EU LCR. In particular, assets eligible as high quality liquid assets (HQLA) Level 1, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, are subject to a 0% RSF factor to avoid negative impacts on the liquidity of sovereign bond markets.\n\n\nAssets resulting from transactions with financial customers having a residual maturity of less than six months and secured by HQLA Level 1, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, are subject to a 5% RSF factor (Article 428s). If they are unsecured or secured by other assets, these transactions are subject to a 10% RSF factor (Article 428u). These adjustments to the Basel RSF factors (that are of 10% and 15% respectively) are meant to mitigate the immediate impact on the liquidity of interbank funding markets, on the liquidity of the securities and on market making activities. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act to review this treatment and the treatment of secured transactions more broadly, taking into account the conclusions of a report prepared by the EBA. If no decision is taken by 3 years after the date of application of the NSFR, these RSF factors will be raised to respectively 10% and 15% (new paragraph 7 of Article 510 in Part Ten).\n\n\nFor derivatives contracts, if derivatives assets (offset by variation margins received in the form of cash and HQLA Level 1, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds) are greater than derivatives liabilities (offset by all variation margins posted), the difference is subject to a 100% RSF factor (Article 428ag). In addition, assets posted as initial margin or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP are subject to a 85% RSF factor (Article 428af). Furthermore, a risk-sensitive approach adjusted compared to the Basel NSFR is introduced to capture the future funding risk of derivatives. For unmargined derivatives contracts, a 10% RSF factor applies to their gross derivatives liabilities (Article 428u) and, for margined derivatives contracts, an option is introduced to either apply a 20% RSF factor to gross derivatives liabilities or to use the potential future exposure (PFE) as calculated under the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk - SA-CCR (Article 428x). The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act to review this treatment, taking into account the conclusions of a report prepared by the EBA. If no decision is taken by 3 years after the date of application of the NSFR, a 20% RSF factor on gross derivatives liabilities will apply for all derivatives contracts and all institutions (new paragraph 5 of Article 510).\n\n\nIFRS 9 (CRR)\n\n\nArticle 473a is added to phase in the new incremental provisioning requirements for credit risk under IFRS over a period starting on 1 January 2019 and ending on 31 December 2023 to mitigate the financial impact on institutions.\n\n\nSME supporting factor (CRR)\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal includes changes to capital requirements for exposures to SMEs (Article 501). The current capital reduction of 23,81% for an exposure to an SME, if it does not exceed EUR 1,5 million, is maintained. In relation to an SME exposure exceeding EUR 1,5 million, 23,81% capital reduction is proposed for the first EUR 1,5 million share of the exposure and a 15% reduction for the remaining part of the exposure above the threshold of EUR 1,5 million. Institutions will be able to continue implementing the reduction by adjusting the risk-weighted exposure amount for a given SME.\n\n\nTreatment of infrastructure exposures (CRR)\n\n\nPromoting viable infrastructure projects in domains like transport, energy, innovation, education, research is of vital importance for the economic growth of the Union. In conjunction with other Commission initiatives, like the Capital Market Union and the Investment Plan for Europe, the proposal aims at mobilising private finance for high quality infrastructure projects. Building on the recent developments in the regulatory framework for insurance undertakings and on the on-going work carried out in the context of the upcoming reform of the Standardised Approach by the BCBS, it is proposed to grant, under both the Standardised Approach and the Internal Based Approach for credit risk, a preferential treatment to specialised lending exposures aiming at funding safe and sound infrastructure projects. These are defined through a set of criteria able to reduce the risk profile of the exposure and enhance the capacity of institutions to manage that risk. The criteria are consistent with those identifying qualifying infrastructure projects that receive a preferential treatment in the Solvency II framework. The proposed treatment is subject to a review clause in order to possibly fine-tune the provision in light of its impact on infrastructure investments in the EU and to take into account any relevant development at global level. It will also allow, if appropriate, to amend the provision in view of more flexibility with regard to the financing structure of infrastructure projects, i.e. to extend the treatment to infrastructure corporates. The Commission, after consulting the EBA, will report on the trends in the market for infrastructure investments and the effective risk profile of those investments and shall submit this report to the European Parliament and the Council together with any appropriate proposal.\n\n\nInvestment firms review (CRR)\n\n\nThe review under Article 508(3) on investment firms is now in its second phase. In a first report published in December 2015, EBA found that the bank-like rules under the CRR were not fit for purpose for the majority of investment firms with the exception of the more systemic ones that pose risks similar to those faced by credit institutions. At the request of the Commission, the EBA is conducting additional analytical work and a data-gathering exercise in order to articulate a more appropriate and proportionate capital treatment for investment firms which will cover all parameters of a possible new regime. EBA is expected to deliver their final input to the Commission in June 2017. The Commission intends to present legislative proposals setting-up a specific prudential framework for non-systemic investment firms by the end of 2017.\n\n\nPending the adoption of these proposals, it is considered appropriate to allow investment firms that are not systemic to apply the CRR in the version as it stood before the amendments come into force. Systemic investment firms will, for their part, be subject to the amended version of the CRR. This will ensure that systemic firms are treated appropriately while alleviating the regulatory burden for non-systemic firms who would otherwise have to temporarily apply a new set of rules designed for credit institutions and systemic investment firms during the period preceding the final adoption of the dedicated investment firms' prudential framework that will be proposed in 2017.\n\n\nIntroducing a modified framework for interest rate risk (CRR and CRD)\n\n\nFollowing developments at the BCBS level on the measurement of interest rate risks, Articles 84 and 98 of the CRD and Article 448 of the CRR are amended in order to introduce a revised framework for capturing interest rate risks for banking book positions. The amendments include the introduction of a common standardised approach that institutions might use to capture these risks or that competent authorities may require the institution to use when the systems developed by the institution to capture these risks are not satisfactory, improved outlier test and disclosure requirements. In addition, EBA is mandated, in Article 84 of the CRD, to elaborate the details of the standardised methodology the criteria and conditions that institutions should follow to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate interest rate risks and, in Article 98 of the CRD, to define the six supervisory shock scenarios applied to interest rates and the common assumption that institutions have to implement for the outlier test.\n\n\n2016/0360 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities, counterparty credit risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, large exposures, reporting and disclosure requirements and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank\n14\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n15\n, \n\n\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In the aftermath of the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2008 the Union implemented a substantial reform of the financial services regulatory framework to enhance the resilience of its financial institutions. That reform was largely based on internationally agreed standards. Among its many measures, the reform package included the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n, which strengthened the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms.\n\n\n(2)While the reform has rendered the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, it did not address all identified problems. An important reason for that was that international standard setters, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), had not finished their work on internationally agreed solutions to tackle those problems at the time. Now that work on important additional reforms has been completed, the outstanding problems should be addressed.\n\n\n(3)In its Communication of 24 November 2015, the Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction and committed bringing forward a legislative proposal that would build on internationally agreed standards. The need to take  further concrete legislative steps in terms of reducing risks in the financial sector has also been recognised also by the Council in its Conclusions of 17 June 2016 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 10 March 2016\n18\n.\n\n\n(4)Risk reduction measures should not only further strengthen the resilience of the European banking system and the markets' confidence in it, but also provide the basis for further progress in completing the Banking Union. Those measures should also be considered against the background of broader challenges affecting the Union economy, especially the need to promote growth and jobs at times of uncertain economic outlook. In that context, various major policy initiatives, such as the Investment Plan for Europe and the Capital Markets Union, have been launched in order to strengthen the economy of the Union. It is therefore important that all risk reduction measures interact smoothly with those policy initiatives as well as with broader recent reforms in the financial sector. \n\n\n(5)The provisions of this amending Regulation should be equivalent to internationally agreed standards and ensure the continued equivalence of Directive 2013/36/EC and this Regulation with the Basel III framework. The targeted adjustments in order to reflect Union specificities and broader policy considerations should be limited in terms of scope or time in order not to impinge on the overall soundness of the prudential framework.\n\n\n(6)Existing risk reduction measures should also be improved to ensure that they can be applied in a more proportionate way and that they do not create an excessive compliance burden, especially for smaller and less complex institutions.\n\n\n(7)Leverage ratios contribute to preserving financial stability by acting as a backstop to risk based capital requirements and by constraining the building up of excessive leverage during economic upturns. Therefore, a leverage ratio requirement should be introduced to complement the current system of reporting and disclosure of the leverage ratio. \n\n\n(8)In order not to unnecessarily constrain lending by institutions to corporates and private households and to prevent unwarranted adverse impacts on market liquidity, the leverage ratio requirement should be set at a level where it acts as a credible backstop to the risk of excessive leverage without hampering economic growth. \n\n\n(9)The European Banking Authority (EBA) concluded in its report to the Commission\n19\n that a Tier 1 capital leverage ratio calibrated at 3% for any type of credit institution would constitute a credible backstop function. A 3% leverage ratio requirement was also agreed upon at international level by the Basel Committee. The leverage ratio requirement should therefore be calibrated at 3%.  \n\n\n(10)A 3% leverage ratio requirement would however constrain certain business models and lines of business more than others. In particular, public lending by public development banks and officially guaranteed export credits would be impacted disproportionally. The leverage ratio should therefore be adjusted for these types of exposures. \n\n\n(11)A leverage ratio should also not undermine the provision of central clearing services by institutions to clients. Therefore, the initial margins on centrally cleared derivative transactions received by institutions in cash from their clients and that they pass on to central counterparties (CCP), should be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure.  \n\n\n(12)The Basel Committee has revised the international standard on the leverage ratio in order to specify further certain aspects of the design of that ratio. Regulation (EU) No- 575/2013 should be aligned with the revised standard so as to enhance the international level playing field for EU institutions operating outside the Union, and to ensure the leverage ratio remains an effective complement to risk-based own funds requirements.\n\n\n(13)The Basel Committee is currently considering the introduction of a leverage ratio surcharge for globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The final outcome of the Basel Committee's calibration work should give rise to a discussion on the appropriate calibration of the leverage ratio for systemically important EU institutions. \n\n\n(14)On 9 November 2015, the FSB has published the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Term Sheet (TLAC standard') which was endorsed by the G-20 at the November 2015 summit in Turkey. The TLAC standard requires global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), to hold a sufficient amount of highly loss absorbing (bail-in-able) liabilities to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation in resolution.  In its Communication of 24 November 2015, the Commission committed to bringing forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2016 that would enable the TLAC standard to be implemented by the internationally agreed deadline of 2019.\n\n\n(15)The implementation of the TLAC standard in the Union needs to take into account the existing minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), set out in Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n. As TLAC and MREL pursue the same objective of ensuring that institutions have sufficient loss absorbing capacity, the two requirements are complementary elements of a common framework. Operationally, the harmonised minimum level of the TLAC standard should be introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 through a new requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, while the firm-specific add-on for global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and the firm-specific requirement for non-G-SIIs should be introduced through targeted amendments to Directive 2014/59/EU and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n. The relevant provisions introducing the TLAC standard in this Regulation (EU) should be read together with those in the aforementioned legislation and with Directive 2013/36/EU.\n\n\n(16)In accordance with the TLAC standard that only covers G-SIBs, the minimum requirement for a sufficient amount of own funds and highly loss absorbing liabilities introduced in this Regulation should only apply in the case of G-SIIs. However, the rules concerning eligible liabilities introduced in this Regulation should apply to all institutions, in line with the complementary adjustments and requirements in Directive 2014/59/EU. \n\n\n(17)In line with the TLAC standard, the requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities should apply to resolution entities which are either themselves G-SIIs or are part of a group identified as a G-SII. The requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities should apply on either an individual basis or a consolidated basis, depending on whether such resolution entities are stand-alone institutions with no subsidiaries, or parent undertakings. \n\n\n(18)Directive 2014/59/EU allows for resolution tools to be used not only for institutions but also for financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies. Parent financial holding companies and parent mixed financial holding companies should therefore have sufficient loss absorption capacity in the same way as parent institutions. \n\n\n\n\n(19)To ensure the effectiveness of the requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities, it is essential that the instruments held for meeting that requirement have a high capacity of loss absorption. Liabilities that are excluded from the bail-in tool referred to in Directive 2014/59/EU do not have that capacity, and neither do other liabilities that, although bail-in-able in principle might raise difficulties for being bailed in in practice. Those liabilities should therefore not be considered eligible for the requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities. On the other hand, capital instruments, as well as subordinated liabilities have a high loss absorption capacity. Also, the loss absorption potential of liabilities that rank pari passu with certain excluded liabilities should be recognised up to a certain extent, in line with the TLAC standard.\n\n\n(20)To avoid double counting of liabilities for the purposes of the requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities, rules should be introduced for the deduction of holdings of eligible liabilities items that mirror the corresponding deduction approach already developed in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for capital instruments. Under that approach, holdings of eligible liabilities instruments should first be deducted from eligible liabilities and, to the extent there are no sufficient liabilities, they should be deducted from Tier 2 capital instruments.\n\n\n(21)The TLAC standard contains some eligibility criteria for liabilities that are stricter than the current eligibility criteria for capital instruments. To ensure consistency, eligibility criteria for capital instruments should be aligned as regards the non-eligibility of instruments issued through special purpose entities as of 1 January 2022.\n\n\n(22)Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the international standard on the prudential treatment of institutions' exposures to CCPs has been amended in order to improve the treatment of institutions' exposures to qualifying CCPs (QCCPs). Notable revisions of that standard included the use of a single method for determining the own funds requirement for exposures due to default fund contributions, an explicit cap on the overall own funds requirements applied to exposures to QCCPs, and a more risk-sensitive approach for capturing the value of derivatives in the calculation of the hypothetical resources of a QCCP. At the same time, the treatment of exposures to non-qualifying CCPs was left unchanged. Given that the revised international standards introduced a treatment that is better suited to the central clearing environment, Union law should be amended to incorporate those standards.\n\n\n(23)In order to ensure that institutions adequately manage their exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIUs), the rules spelling out the treatment of those exposures should be risk sensitive and should promote transparency with respect to the underlying exposures of CIUs,. The Basel Committee has therefore adopted a revised standard that sets a clear hierarchy of approaches to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for those exposures. That hierarchy reflects the degree of transparency over the underlying exposures. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be aligned with those internationally agreed rules.\n\n\n(24)For calculating the exposure value of derivative transactions under the counterparty credit risk framework, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently gives institutions the choice between three different standardised approaches: the Standardised Method ('SM'), the Mark-to-Market Method ('MtMM') and the Original Exposure Method ('OEM').\n\n\n(25)Those standardised approaches however do not recognise appropriately the risk-reducing nature of collateral in the exposures. Their calibrations are outdated and they do not reflect the high level of volatility observed during the financial crisis. Neither do they recognise appropriately netting benefits. To address those shortcomings, the Basel Committee decided to replace the SM and the MtMM with a new standardised approach for computing the exposure value of derivatives exposures, the so-called Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk ('SA-CCR'). Given that the revised international standards introduced a new standardised approach that is better suited to the central clearing environment, Union law should be amended to incorporate those standards.\n\n\n(26)The SA-CCR is more risk-sensitive than the SM and the MtM and should therefore lead to own funds requirements that better reflect the risks related to institutions' derivatives transactions. At the same time, the SA-CCR is more complex for institutions to implement. For some of the institutions which currently use the MtM method the SA-CCR may prove to be too complex and burdensome to implement. For those institutions, a simplified version of the SA-CCR should be introduced. Since such a simplified version will be less risk sensitive than the SA-CCR, it should be appropriately calibrated in order to ensure that it does not underestimate the exposure value of derivatives transactions.\n\n\n(27)For institutions which have very limited derivatives exposures and which currently use the OEM, both the SA-CCR and the simplified SA-CCR could be too complex to implement. The OEM should therefore be reserved for those institutions, but should be revised in order to address its major shortcomings.\n\n\n(28)To guide an institution in its choice of permitted approaches clear criteria should be introduced. Those criteria should be based on the size of the derivative activities of an institution which indicates the degree of sophistication an institution should be able to comply with to compute the exposure value.\n\n\n(29)During the financial crisis, trading book losses for some institutions established in the Union were substantial. For some of them, the level of capital required against those losses proved insufficient, leading them to seek extraordinary public financial support. Those observations led the Basel Committee to remove a number of weaknesses in the prudential treatment for trading book positions which are the own fund requirements for market risks.\n\n\n(30)In 2009, a first set of reforms were finalised at international level and transposed in the Union law with Directive 2010/76/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n.\n\n\n(31)The 2009 reform did however not address the structural weaknesses of the own fund requirements for market risk standards. The lack of clarity about the boundary between the trading and banking books gave opportunities for regulatory arbitrage while the lack of risk sensitivity of the own fund requirements for market risks did not allow to capture the full range of risks to which institutions were exposed. \n\n\n(32)The Basel Committee therefore initiated the Fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) to address those weaknesses. This work was concluded in January 2016. The FRTB standards enhance the risk-sensitivity of the market risk framework by setting an amount of own fund requirements that is more proportionate to the risks of trading book positions and they clarify the definition of the boundary between banking and trading books.\n\n\n(33)The implementation of the FRTB standards in the Union needs to preserve the good functioning of financial markets in the Union. Recent impact studies about the FRTB standards show that the implementation of the FRTB standards is expected to lead to a steep increase in the overall own fund requirement for market risks. To avoid a sudden contraction of trading businesses in the Union, a phase-in period should therefore be introduced so that institutions can recognise the overall level of own fund requirements for market risks generated by the transposition of the FRTB standards in the Union. Particular attention should also be paid to European trading specificities and adjustments to the own funds requirements for sovereign and covered bonds, and simple, transparent and standardised securitisations.\n\n\n(34)A proportional treatment for market risks should also apply to institutions with limited trading book activities, allowing more institutions with small trading activities to apply the credit risk framework for banking book positions as set out under a revised version of the derogation for small trading book business. In addition, institutions with medium-sized trading book should be allowed to use a simplified standardised approach for calculating the own fund requirements for market risks in line with the approach currently in use under Regulation (EU) 575/2013.\n\n\n(35)The large exposures framework should be strengthened to improve the ability of institutions to absorb losses and to better comply with international standards. To that end, a higher quality of capital should be used as a capital base for the calculation of the large exposures limit and exposures to credit derivatives should be calculated with the SA-CCR. Moreover, the limit on the exposures that G-SIBs may have towards other G-SIBs should be lowered to reduce systemic risks related to interlinks among large institutions and the probability that the default of G-SIBs counterparty may have on financial stability.\n\n\n(36)While the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) ensures that credit institutions and systemic investment firms will be able to withstand severe stress on a short-term basis, it does not ensure that those credit institutions and investment firms will have a stable funding structure on a longer-term horizon. It became thus apparent that a detailed binding stable funding requirement should be developed at EU level which should be met at all times with the aim of preventing excessive maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and overreliance on short-term wholesale funding.\n\n\n(37)Consistent with the Basel Committee's stable funding standards, rules should therefore be adopted to define the stable funding requirement as a ratio of an institution's amount of available stable funding to its amount of required stable funding over a one-year horizon. This is the binding net stable funding ratio ('NSFR'). The amount of available stable funding should be calculated by multiplying the institution's liabilities and regulatory capital by appropriate factors that reflect their degree of reliability over the one-year horizon of the NSFR. The amount of required stable funding should be calculated by multiplying the institution's assets and off-balance sheet exposures by appropriate factors that reflect their liquidity characteristics and residual maturities over the one-year horizon of the NSFR. \n\n\n(38)The NSFR should be expressed as a percentage and set at a minimum level of 100%, which indicates that an institution holds sufficient stable funding to meet its funding needs during a one-year period under both normal and stressed conditions. Should its NSFR falls below the 100% level, the institution should comply with the specific requirements laid down in Article 414 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for a timely restoration of its NSFR to the minimum level. The supervisory measures in case of non-compliance should not be automatic, competent authorities should instead assess the reasons for non-compliance with the NSFR requirement before defining potential supervisory measures.\n\n\n\n\n(39)In accordance with the recommendations made by EBA in its report of 15 December 2015 prepared pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 510 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the rules for calculating the NSFR should be closely aligned with the Basel Committee's standards, including developments in those standards regarding the treatment of derivatives transactions. The necessity to take into account some European specificities to ensure that the NSFR does not hinder the financing of the European real economy however justifies adopting some adjustments to the Basel NSFR for the definition of the European NSFR. Those adjustments due to the European context are recommended by the NSFR report prepared by EBA and relate mainly to specific treatments for i) pass-through models in general and covered bonds issuance in particular; ii) trade finance activities; iii) centralised regulated savings; iv) residential guaranteed loans; and v) credit unions. These proposed specific treatments broadly reflect the preferential treatment granted to these activities in the European LCR compared to the Basel LCR. Because the NSFR complements the LCR, those two ratios should indeed be consistent in their definition and calibration. This is in particular the case for required stable funding factors applied to LCR high quality liquid assets for the calculation of the NSFR that shall reflect the definitions and haircuts of the European LCR, regardless of compliance with the general and operational requirements set out for the LCR calculation that are not appropriate in the one-year frame of the NSFR calculation.\n\n\n(40)Beyond European specificities, the stringent treatment of derivative transactions in the Basel NSFR could have an important impact on institutions\u2019 derivatives activities and, consequently, on European financial markets and on the access to some operations for end-users. Derivative transactions and some interlinked transactions, including clearing activities, could be unduly and disproportionately impacted by the introduction of the Basel NSFR without having been subject to extensive quantitative impact studies and public consultation. The additional requirement to hold 20 % of stable funding against gross derivatives liabilities is very widely seen as a rough measure that overestimates additional funding risks related to the potential increase of derivative liabilities over a one year horizon. It therefore seems reasonable to adopt an alternative more risk-sensitive measure not to hinder the good functioning of the European financial markets and the provision of risk hedging tools to institutions and end-users, including corporates, to ensure their financing as an objective of the Capital Market Union. \n\n\nFor unmargined derivatives transactions, the future funding risks of which are contingent on some unpredictable events, such as rating triggers requiring to post collateral, and which are best approximated by their market value that would be the amount of funding required should such an event occur, a 10 % required stable funding ('RSF') factor should apply to their gross derivatives liabilities. The 20 % RSF factor seems indeed to be very conservative. For margined derivatives transactions, an option is introduced for institutions using SA-CCR to either apply the 20 % RSF factor as indicated in the Basel standard or to use their potential future exposure ('PFE') as calculated under SA-CCR. Institutions not using SA-CCR have very small derivatives portfolios and should be exempted from this requirement. That approach is more risk-sensitive and, since it is intended for counterparty credit risk and for the leverage ratio calculation, it should not constitute an additional burden for institutions to compute. \n\n\n(41)The Basel asymmetric treatment between short term funding, such as repos (stable funding not recognised) and short term lending, such as reverse repos (some stable funding required \u2013 10% if collateralised by Level 1 high quality liquid assets - HQLA - as defined in the LCR and 15% for other transactions) with financial customers aims at discouraging extensive short term funding links between financial customers which are a source of interconnection and make it more difficult to resolve a particular institution without a contagion of risk to the rest of the financial system in case of failure. However, the calibration of the asymmetry is overly conservative and may affect the liquidity of securities usually used as collateral in short term transactions, in particular sovereign bonds, as institutions will probably reduce the volume of their operations on repo markets. It could also undermine market-making activities, as repo markets facilitate the management of the necessary inventory, thereby contradicting the objectives of the capital market union. Furthermore, this would make it more difficult to transform these securities into cash rapidly at a good price, which could endanger the effectiveness of the LCR whose logic is to have a buffer of liquid assets that can be easily transformed into cash in case of liquidity stress. Eventually, the calibration of this asymmetry may affect the liquidity of interbank funding markets, in particular for liquidity management purposes, as it will become more expensive for banks to lend to each other on a short term basis. The asymmetrical treatment should be maintained but RSF factors be reduced to 5% and 10% respectively (instead of 10% and 15%). \n\n\n(42)In addition to the recalibration of the Basel RSF factor that applies to short term reverse repo transactions with financial customers secured by sovereign bonds (5% RSF factor instead of 10%), some other adjustments have proven to be necessary to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR does not hinder the liquidity of sovereign bonds markets. The Basel 5% RSF factor that applies to Level 1 HQLA, including sovereign bonds, implies that institutions would need to hold ready available long-term unsecured funding in such percentage regardless of the time during which they expect to hold such sovereign bonds. This could potentially further incentivise institutions to deposit cash at central banks rather than to act as primary dealers and provide liquidity in sovereign bond markets. Moreover, it is not consistent with the LCR that recognises the full liquidity of these assets even in time of severe liquidity stress (0% haircut). The RSF factor of HQLA Level 1 as defined in the EU LCR, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, should therefore be reduced from 5% to 0%. \n\n\n(43)Furthermore, all HQLA Level 1 as defined in the EU LCR, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, received as variation margins in derivatives contracts should offset derivatives assets while the Basel standard only accepts cash respecting the conditions of the leverage framework to offset derivatives assets. This broader recognition of assets received as variation margins will contribute to the liquidity of sovereign bonds markets, avoid penalizing end-users that hold high amounts of sovereign bonds but few cash (like pension funds) and avoid adding additional tensions on the demand for cash on repo markets.\n\n\n(44)The NSFR should apply to institutions both on an individual and a consolidated basis, unless competent authorities waive the application of the NSFR on an individual basis. This duplicates the scope of application of the LCR that the NSFR complements. Where the application of the NSFR at individual level has not been waived, transactions between two institutions belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme should in principle receive symmetrical available and required stable funding factors to avoid a loss of funding in the internal market and to not impede the effective liquidity management in European groups where liquidity is centrally managed. Such preferential symmetrical treatments should only be granted to intragroup transactions where all the necessary safeguards are in place, on the basis of additional criteria for cross-border transactions, and only with the prior approval of the competent authorities involved as it may not be assumed that institutions experiencing difficulties in meeting their payment obligations will always receive funding support from other undertakings belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme.\n\n\n(45)The consolidation of subsidiaries in third countries should take due account of the stable funding requirements applicable in those countries. Accordingly, consolidation rules in the Union should not introduce a more favourable treatment for available and required stable funding in third country subsidiaries than the treatment which is available under the national law of those third countries.\n\n\n(46)In accordance with Article 508(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the Commission is to report on an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms and submit, where appropriate, a legislative proposal. Until that provision starts applying, investment firms other than systemic investment firms should remain subject to the national law of Member States on the net stable funding requirement. However, investment firms other than systemic investment firms should be subject to the NSFR laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated basis, where they form part of banking groups, to allow an appropriate calculation of the NSFR at consolidated level.\n\n\n(47)Institutions should be required to report to their competent authorities in the reporting currency the binding detailed NSFR for all items and separately for items denominated in each significant currency to ensure an appropriate monitoring of possible currencies mismatches. The NSFR should not subject institutions to any double reporting requirements or to reporting requirements not in line with the rules in force and institutions should be granted sufficient time to get prepared to the entry into force of new reporting requirements.\n\n\n(48)As the provision of meaningful and comparable information to the market on institutions' common key risk metrics is a fundamental tenet of a sound banking system, it is essential to reduce information asymmetry as much as possible and facilitate comparability of credit institutions\u2019 risk profiles within and across jurisdictions, The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published the revised Pillar 3 disclosure standards in January 2015 to enhance the comparability, quality and consistency of institutions' regulatory disclosures to the market.                            It is, therefore, appropriate to amend the existing disclosure requirements to implement those new international standards.\n\n\n(49)Respondents to the Commission's Call for Evidence on the EU regulatory framework for financial services regarded current disclosure requirements as disproportionate and burdensome for smaller institutions. Without prejudice to aligning disclosures more closely with international standards, smaller and less complex institutions should be required to produce less frequent and detailed disclosures than their larger peers, thus reducing the administrative burden to which they are subject.  \n\n\n(50)Some clarifications should be made to the remuneration disclosures. Furthermore, institutions benefitting from a derogation from certain remuneration rules should be required to disclose information concerning such derogation.\n\n\n(51)The application of the expected credit loss provisioning introduced by the revised international accounting standards on financial instruments \"IFRS9\", may lead to a sudden significant increase in the capital ratios of institutions. While discussions are on-going on the appropriate prudential treatment of the impact of increased expected credit losses and to prevent an unwarranted detrimental effect on lending by credit institutions, the incremental provisioning for credit risk of IFRS9 should be phased in.\n\n\n(52)Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of the pillars of the Union's economy as they play a fundamental role in creating economic growth and providing employment. Given the fact that SMEs carry a lower systematic risk than larger corporates, capital requirements for SME exposures should be lower than those for large corporates to ensure an optimal bank financing of SMEs. Currently, SME exposures of up to EUR 1,5 million are subject to a 23,81% reduction in risk weighted exposure amount. Given that the threshold of EUR 1,5 million for an SME exposure is not indicative of a change in riskiness of an SME, reduction in capital requirements should be extended to SME exposures beyond the threshold of EUR 1,5 million and for the exceeding part should amount to a 15% reduction of a risk-weighted exposure amount.\n\n\n(53)Investments in infrastructure are essential to strengthen Europe's competitiveness and to stimulate job creation. The recovery and future growth of the Union economy depends largely on the availability of capital for strategic investments of European significance in infrastructure, notably broadband and energy networks, as well as transport infrastructure, particularly in industrial centres; education, research and innovation; and renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Investment Plan for Europe aims at promoting additional funding to viable infrastructure projects through, inter alia, the mobilization of additional private source of finance. For a number of potential investors the main concern is the perceived absence of viable projects and the limited capacity to properly evaluate risk given their intrinsically complex nature. \n\n\n(54)In order to encourage private investments in infrastructure projects it is therefore essential to lay down a regulatory environment that is able to promote high quality infrastructure projects and reduce risks for investors. In particular capital charges for exposures to infrastructure projects should be reduced provided they comply with a set of criteria able to reduce their risk profile and enhance predictability of cash flows. The Commission should review the provision by [three years after the entry into force] in order to assess a) its impact on the volume of infrastructure investments by institutions and the quality of investments having regard to EU's objectives to move towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient and circular economy; and b) its adequacy from a prudential standpoint. The Commission should also consider whether the scope should be extended to infrastructure investments by corporates. \n\n\n(55)Article\u00a0508(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council2 requires the Commission to report to the European Parliament and to the Council on an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms and of firms referred to in points (2)(b) and (c) of Article 4(1) of that Regulation, to be followed, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal. That legislative proposal may introduce new requirements for those firms. In the interest of ensuring proportionality and to avoid unnecessary and repetitive regulatory changes, investment firms which are not systemic should therefore be precluded from complying with the new provisions amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Investment firms that\u00a0pose the same systemic risk as credit institutions should however be subject to the same requirements as those that apply to credit institutions.\n\n\n(56)In light of the strengthened group supervision resulting from the reinforcement of the prudential regulatory framework and the establishment of the Banking Union,  it is desirable that institutions take ever more advantage of the benefits of the single market, including for ensuring an efficient management of capital and liquidity resources throughout the group. Therefore the possibility to waive the application of requirements on an individual level for subsidiaries or parents should be available to cross-border groups, provided there are adequate safeguards to ensure that sufficient capital and liquidity will be at the disposal of entities subject to the waiver. Where all the safeguards are met, it will be for the competent authority to decide whether to grant such waivers. Competent authorities' decisions should be duly justified. \n\n\n(57)In order to facilitate institutions' compliance with rules set out in this Regulation and in Directive 36/2013/EU, as well as with regulatory technical standards, implementing technical standards, guidelines and templates adopted to implement those rules, the EBA should develop an IT tool aimed at guiding institutions' through the relevant provisions, standard and templates in relation to their size and business model.\n\n\n\n\n(58)To facilitate the comparability of disclosures, the EBA should be mandated to develop standardised disclosure templates covering all substantial disclosure requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council. When developing these standards the EBA should take into account the size and complexity of institutions, as well as the nature and level of risk of their activities.  \n\n\n(59)In order to ensure an appropriate definition of some specific technical provisions of Regulation (EU) No 573/2013 and to take into account possible developments at international level, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the list of products or services whose assets and liabilities can be considered as interdependent and in respect of the definition of the treatment of derivatives, secured lending and capital market driven transactions and of unsecured transactions of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the NSFR.\n\n\n(60)The Commission should adopt draft regulatory technical standards developed by EBA in the areas of own funds requirements for market risk for non-trading book positions, instruments exposed to residual risks, jump to default calculations, permission to use internal models for market risk, internal model back testing, P&L attribution, non-modellable risk factors and default risk in the internal model approach for market risk by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission and EBA should ensure that those standards and requirements can be applied by all institutions concerned in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of those institutions and their activities.\n\n\n(61)For the purposes of applying large exposures rules, the Commission should specify, through the adoption of acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in which circumstances the conditions for the existence of a group of connected clients are met and how to calculate the value of exposures arising from contracts referred to in Annex II and credit derivatives not directly entered into with a client but underlying a debt or equity instrument issued by that client and the cases and the time limit within which competent authorities might allow the exposure limit to be exceeded. The Commission should also issue regulatory technical standard to specify the format and frequency of reporting related to large exposures, as well as the criteria for identifying shadow banks to which reporting obligations on large exposures refer.\n\n\n(62)On counterparty credit risk, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the definition of aspects related to the material risk driver of transactions, the supervisory delta and the commodity risk category add-on. \n\n\n(63)Before the adoption of acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(64)To react more efficiently to developments over time in disclosure standards at international and Union levels, the Commission should have a mandate to amend the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 575/2013 through a delegated act.\n\n\n(65)The EBA should report on where proportionality of the Union supervisory reporting package could be improved in terms of scope, granularity or frequency.  \n\n\n(66)For the purpose of applying own funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs, the Commission should specify, through the adoption of a regulatory technical standard, how institutions shall calculate the risk weighted exposure amount under the mandate-based approach where any of the inputs required for that calculation are not available.\n\n\n(67)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to reinforce and refine already existing Union legislation ensuring uniform prudential requirements that apply to credit institutions and investment firms throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n(68)In view of the amendments to the treatment of exposures to QCCPs, specifically to the treatment of institutions' contributions to QCCPs' default funds, the relevant provisions in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 which were introduced in that Regulation by Regulation (EU) No 575/20136 and which spell out the calculation of the hypothetical capital of CCPs that is then used by institutions to calculate their own funds requirements should also be amended.\n\n\n(69)The application of certain provisions on new requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities that implement the TLAC standard should be 1 January 2019 as agreed at international level.\n\n\n(70)Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly, \n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 575/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Article 1\nScope\n\n\nThis Regulation lays down uniform rules concerning general prudential requirements that

underlying exposures of a CIU to use the look-through approach may calculate the risk weighted exposure amount of those exposures in accordance with the limits set in the CIU\u2019s mandate and relevant legislation.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, institutions shall carry out the calculations under the assumption that the CIU first incurs exposures to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant legislation in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirement and then continues incurring exposures in descending order until the maximum total exposure limit is reached.\n\n\nInstitutions shall carry out the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter, in Chapter 5 of this Title, and in Sections 3, 4, or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title.\n\n\n3.By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article may replace the own funds requirement for the credit valuation adjustment risk of derivatives exposures of that CIU by an amount equal to 50% of the exposure value of those exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter\u00a06 of this Title, as applicable.\n\n\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivatives exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were

way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk weighted exposure amount of the CIU in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article may replace the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivatives exposures of that CIU by an amount equal to 50% of the exposure value of those exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title, as applicable.\n\n\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit

principles:\n\n\n\n\n(a)for exposures belonging to the equity exposure class referred to in point (e) of Article 147(2), institutions shall apply the simple risk-weight approach set out in Article 155(2);\n\n\n(b)for exposures belonging to the securitisation exposure class, institutions shall apply the ratings based method set out in Article 261;\n\n\n(c)for all other underlying exposures,

between private equity exposures, exchange-traded exposures and other equity exposures, it shall treat the exposures concerned as other equity exposures.\n\n\n5.Where the conditions of Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU may calculate the risk weighted exposure amount for those exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(2). However, for the exposures listed in point (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 of this Article, institutions shall apply the approaches set out therein.\n\n\n6.Subject to Article 132b(2), institutions

derivatives\n\n\n1.Institutions may use equity derivatives, which are total return swaps or economically effectively similar, as eligible credit protection only for the purpose of conducting internal hedges.\n\n\n\n\nWhere an institution buys credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on the swap as net income, but does not record the offsetting deterioration in the value of the asset that is protected either through reductions in fair value or by an addition to reserves, that credit protection does not qualify as eligible credit protection.\n\n\n2.Where an institution conducts an internal hedge using an equity derivative, in order for the internal hedge to qualify as eligible credit protection for the purposes of this Chapter, the credit risk transferred to the trading book shall be transferred out to a third party or parties.\n\n\nWhere an internal hedge has been conducted in accordance with the first subparagraph and the requirements in this Chapter have been met, institutions shall apply the rules set out in Sections 4 to 6 of this Chapter for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts where they acquire unfunded credit protection.\".\n\n\n(60)Article 223 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)In paragraph 3, the last subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"In the

following:\n\n\n\"(6) 'hedging set' means a group of transactions within a single netting set for which full or partial offsetting is allowed for determining the potential future exposure under the  methods set out in Sections 3 or 4 of this Chapter ;\n\n\n (12) 'Current Market Value'  or 'CMV'  means, for the purposes of Section 3 to Section 5 of this Chapter, the net market value of all the transactions within a netting set gross of any collateral held or posted where positive and negative market values are netted in computing the CMV;\".\n\n\n(62)In Article 272, the following points (7a) and (12a) are inserted:\n\n\n\"(7a) 'one way margin agreement' means a margin agreement under which an institution is required to post variation margins to a counterparty but is not entitled to receive variation margin from that counterparty or vice-versa;\".\n\n\n\"(12a) 'net independent collateral amount' or 'NICA' means the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of net collateral received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set other than variation margin;\".\n\n\n(63)Article 273 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)Paragraph 1 is  replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Institutions shall calculate the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this

An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a (3) shall not use the method set out in Section 5 of this Chapter.\n\n\nTo determine the exposure value for the contracts listed in point 3 of Annex II an institution shall not use the method set out in Section 5 of this Chapter.\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter on a permanent basis.\"\n\n\n(b)Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 are  replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"6. Under all methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.\n\n\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, where one margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets with that counterparty and the institution is using one of the method set out in Section 3 and Section 6 of this Chapter to calculate the exposure value of these netting sets, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with that Section.\n\n\nFor a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of CVA for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds in accordance with point (c) of Article 33(1).\n\n\n7. In calculating the exposure value in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3 to 5 of this Chapter, institutions may treat two OTC derivative contracts included in the same netting agreement that are perfectly matching as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equals to zero.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, two OTC derivative contracts are perfectly matching when they meet all of the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)their risk positions are opposite;\n\n\n(b)their features, with the exception of the trade date, are identical; \n\n\n(c)their cash-flows fully offset each other.\n\n\n8. Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of those positions.\n\n\n9. For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, institutions shall treat transactions where specific wrong way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291.\".\n\n\n(64)The following Articles 273a and 273b are inserted:\n\n\n\"Article 273a\nConditions for using simplified methods for calculating the exposure value\n\n\n1.An institution may calculate the exposure value of derivative positions in accordance with the method set out in Section 4 provided that the size of its on- and off-balance sheet derivative business is equal to or less than the following thresholds on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis:\n\n\n(a)10 % of the institution\u2019s total assets;\n\n\n(b)EUR\u00a0150 million;\n\n\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the size of their on- and off-balance sheet derivative business on a given date by including all their derivative positions except credit derivatives that are recognised as internal hedges against non-trading book credit risk exposures.\n\n\n2.An institution may calculate the exposure value of interest rate, foreign exchange and gold derivative positions in accordance with Section 5, provided that the size of its on- and off-balance sheet derivative business is equal to or less than the following thresholds on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis:\n\n\n(a)5 % of the institution\u2019s total assets;\n\n\n\n\n(b)EUR 20 million;\n\n\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the size of their on- and off-balance sheet derivative business on a given date by including all their derivative positions referred to contracts in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Annex II;\n\n\n3.For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall calculate the size of their on- and off-balance sheet derivative business on a given date in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)derivative positions shall be valued at their market prices on that given date. Where the market value of a position is not available on a given date, institutions shall take the most recent market value for that position. \n\n\n(b)the absolute value of long positions shall be summed with the absolute value of short positions.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the methods set out in Sections 4 or 5 of this Chapter that they use, or cease to use,

For the purpose of this calculation, institutions shall not use the method sets out in Article 225.\n\n\n(e)the same collateral item shall not be included in both VM and NICA at the same time;\n\n\n(f)the same collateral item shall not be included in both VMMA and NICAMA at the same time;\n\n\n\n\n(g)any collateral posted to the counterparty that is segregated from the assets of that counterparty and, as a result of that segregation, is bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of that counterparty shall not be recognised in the calculation of NICA and NICAMA.\n\n\n2.For the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral posted referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1, institutions shall replace the formula in Article 223(2) with the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.For the purpose of point (d) of the paragraph 1, institutions shall set the liquidation period relevant for the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of any collateral received or posted in accordance with one of the following time horizon: \n\n\n(a)for the netting sets referred to in Article 276(1), the time horizon shall be one year; \n\n\n(b)for the netting sets referred to in Articles 276(2) and (3), the time horizon shall be the margin period of risk determined in accordance with point(b) of Article 279d(1). \n\n\nArticle 277\n\nMapping of transactions to risk categories\n\n\n1.Institutions shall map each transaction of a netting set to one of the following six risk categories to determine the potential future exposure of the netting set referred to in Article 278:\n\n\n(a)interest rate risk;\n\n\n(b)foreign exchange risk;\n\n\n(c)credit risk;\n\n\n(d)equity risk;\n\n\n(e)commodity risk;\n\n\n(f)other risks.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall conduct the mapping referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of the primary risk driver of the transaction. For transactions other than those referred to in paragraph 3, the primary risk driver shall be the only material risk driver of a derivative position. \n\n\n3.From [date of application of this Regulation], for a derivative transaction allocated to the trading book for which an institution uses the approaches laid down in either Chapters 1a or 1b to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk, the primary risk driver shall be the risk factor associated with the highest absolute sensitivity among all the sensitivities for that transaction calculated in accordance with Chapter 1b of Title IV.\n\n\n4.Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, when mapping transactions to the risk categories listed in paragraph 1, institutions shall apply the following requirements:\n\n\n(g)where the primary risk driver of a transaction is an inflation variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the interest rate risk category;\n\n\n(h)where the primary risk driver of a transaction is a climatic conditions variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the commodity risk category.\n\n\n5.By way of derogation from paragraph 2, institutions shall map derivative transactions that have more than one material risk driver to more than one risk category. Where all the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to the same risk category, institutions shall only be required to map one time that transaction to this risk category based on the most material of those risk drivers. Where the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to different risk categories, institutions shall map that transaction one time to each risk category for which the transaction has at least one material risk driver, based on the most material of the risk drivers in that risk category.\n\n\n\n\n6.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater detail: \n\n\n(a)a method for identifying the only material risk driver of transactions other than those referred to in paragraph 3; \n\n\n(b)a method for identifying transactions with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of these risk drivers for the purposes of paragraph 3;\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [6 months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n\n\nArticle 277a\n\nHedging sets\n\n\n1.Institutions shall establish the relevant hedging sets for each risk category of a netting set and assign each transaction to those hedging sets as follows:\n\n\n(a)transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver is denominated in the same currency. \n\n\n(b)transactions mapped to the foreign exchange risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver is based on the same currency pair;\n\n\n(c)all the transactions mapped to the credit risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;\n\n\n(d)all the transactions mapped to the equity risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;\n\n\n(e)transactions mapped to the commodity risk category shall be assigned to one of the following five hedging sets based on the nature of their primary risk driver:\n\n\n(I)energy;\n\n\n(II)metals;\n\n\n(III)agricultural goods;\n\n\n(IV)climatic conditions;\n\n\n(V)other commodities.\n\n\n(f)transactions mapped to the other risks category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver is identical. \n\n\nFor the purpose of point (a), transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver shall be assigned to separate hedging sets, other than the hedging sets established for transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver. Those transactions shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver is denominated in the same currency.\n\n\n2.By the way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions shall establish separate individual hedging sets in each risk category for the following transactions:\n\n\n\n\n(a)transactions for which the primary risk driver is either the market implied volatility or the realised volatility of a risk driver or the correlation between two risk drivers; \n\n\n(b)transactions for which the primary risk driver is the difference between two risk drivers mapped to the same risk category or transactions that consist of two payment legs denominated in the same currency and for which a risk driver from the same risk category of the primary risk driver is contained in the other payment leg than the one containing the primary risk driver. \n\n\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where their primary risk driver is identical.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where the pair of risk drivers in those transactions as referred to in point (b) is identical and the two risk drivers contained in this pair are positively correlated. Otherwise, institutions shall assign transactions referred to in point (b) to one of the hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 1, on the basis of only one of the two risk drivers referred to in point (b).\n\n\n3.The institutions shall make available upon request by the competent authorities the number of hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 2 for each risk category, with the primary risk driver or the pair of risk drivers of each of those hedging sets and with the number of transactions in each of those hedging sets.\n\n\nArticle 278\n\nPotential future exposure\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure ('PFE') of a netting set as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\na\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the index that denotes the risk categories included in the calculation of the potential future exposure of the netting set;\n\n\nAddOn(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the add-on for risk category 'a' calculated in accordance with Articles 280a to 280f, as applicable;\n\n\nmultiplier\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the multiplier factor calculated in accordance with the formula referred to in paragraph 3.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this calculation, institutions shall include the add-on of a given risk category in the calculation of the potential future exposure of a netting set where at least one transaction of the netting set has been mapped to that risk category.\n\n\n2.The potential future exposure of multiple netting sets subject to one margin agreement, as referred in Article 275(3), shall be calculated as the sum of all the individual netting sets considered as if they were not subject to any form of margin agreement.\n\n\n3.For the purpose of paragraph 1, the multiplier shall be calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nFloorm\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05%;\n\n\ny \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0=      \n\n\n\n\nNICAi \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0=\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the net independent collateral amount calculated only for transactions that are included in netting set 'i'.

(ii) non-securitisation credit spread risk; (iii) securitisation credit spread risk  (non-CTP); (iv) securitisation credit spread risk  (CTP); (v) equity risk; (vi) commodity risk; and (vii) foreign exchange risk.\n\n\n(2) 'sensitivity' means the relative change in the value of an position, calculated with the institution's pricing model, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of the position. \n\n\n(3) 'bucket' means a sub-category of positions within one risk class with a similar risk profile to which a risk-weight is assigned as defined in subsection 1 of Section 3 of this Chapter.\n\n\nArticle 325f\nComponents of the sensitivities-based method\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for market risk under the sensitivities-based method by aggregating the following three own fund requirements in accordance with Article 325i:\n\n\n(a)own fund requirements for delta risk which captures the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its non-volatility related risk factors and assuming a linear pricing function; \n\n\n(b)own fund requirements for vega risk which captures the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its volatility-related risk factors;\n\n\n(c)own fund requirements for curvature risk which captures the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in the main non-volatility related risk-factors not captured by delta risk.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1, \n\n\n(d)all the positions of instruments with optionality shall be subject to the own fund requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1.\n\n\n(e)all the positions of instruments without optionality shall only be subject to the own fund requirements referred to in points (a) of paragraph 1. \n\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, instruments with optionality include, amongst others: calls, puts, caps, floors, swaptions, barrier options and exotic options. Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be standalone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risks. \n\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying's notional value shall be considered to be instruments without optionality. \n\n\nArticle 325g \nOwn funds requirements for delta and vega risks\n\n\n\n\n1.Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in subsection 1 of Section 3 of this Chapter to calculate the own fund requirements for delta and vega risks.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 3 to 8 to calculate own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.\n\n\n3.For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirementsfor delta or vega risksto each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in subsection 2 of Section 3 of this Chapter. If the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.\n\n\n4.Sensitivities shall be assigned to one of the buckets 'b' within each risk class. \n\n\n5.Within each bucket 'b', the positive and negative sensitivities to the same risk factor shall be netted, giving rise to net sensitivities ( to each risk factor k within a bucket.\n\n\n6.The net sensitivities to each risk factor () within each bucket shall be multiplied by the corresponding risk weights (RWk) prescribed in Section 6, giving rise to weighted sensitivities (WSk) to each risk factor within that bucket in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.The weighted sensitivities to the different risk factors within each bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero, giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity (Kb). The corresponding correlations for weighted sensitivities within the same bucket (), laid down in Section 6, shall be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.The bucket-specific sensitivity (Kb) shall be calculated for each bucket within a risk class in accordance with paragraphs 5 to 7. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, using the corresponding correlations \u03b3bc  for weighted sensitivities in different buckets laid down in  6, giving rise to the risk-class specific delta or vega own funds requirement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere for all risk factors in bucket b and in bucket c. Where those values for  and  produce a negative number for the overall sum of , the institution shall calculate the risk-class specific delta or vega own funds requirements using an alternative specification whereby for all risk factors in bucket b and  for all risk factors in bucket c.\u00a0\n\n\nThe risk-class specific delta or vega risk own fund requirements shall be calculated for each risk class in accordance with paragraphs (1) to (8).\n\n\nArticle 325h\nOwn funds requirements for curvature risk\n\n\n1.Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 to calculate own funds requirements for curvature risk.\n\n\n2.Using the sensitivities calculated in accordance with Article 325g(4), for each risk class, a net curvature risk requirement  for each risk factor (k) included in that risk class shall be calculated in accordance with the formula below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\ni = the index that denotes an instrument subject to curvature risks associated with risk factor k;\n\n\n = the current level of risk factor k;\n\n\n\n\n = the value of an instrument i as estimated by the pricing model of the institution by using the current value of risk factor k;\n\n\n and = the value of an instrument i after  is shifted upward and downward respectively in accordance with the corresponding risk weights; \n\n\n = the risk weight for curvature risk factor k for instrument i determined in accordance with Section 6. \n\n\n = the delta sensitivity of instrument i with respect to the delta risk factor that corresponds to curvature risk factor k. \n\n\n3.For each risk class, the net curvature risk requirements  calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be assigned to one of the buckets (b) within that risk class. \n\n\n4.All the net curvature risk requirements  within each bucket (b) shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the corresponding prescribed correlations kl among pairs of risk factors k,l within each bucket shall be used, giving rise to the bucket-specific curvature risk own funds requirements:\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\u03c8 = a function that takes the value 0 if  and both have negative signs. In all other cases, \u03c8shall take the value of 1.\n\n\n5.The net curvature risk own funds requirements shall be aggregated across buckets within each risk class in accordance with the formula below, where the corresponding prescribed correlations \u03b3bc\u00a0for sets of net curvature risk requirements belonging to different buckets shall be used. This gives rise to the risk-class specific curvature risk own funds requirements.\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nfor all risk factors in bucket b, and in bucket c;\n\n\n is a function that takes the value 0 if  and  both have negative signs. In all other cases,  takes the value of 1.\n\n\nWhere these values for  and  produce a negative number for the overall sum of \n\n\nthe institution shall calculate the curvature risk charge using an alternative specification whereby  for all risk factors in bucket b and  for all risk factors in bucket c.\n\n\n6.The risk class specific curvature risk own funds requirements shall be calculated for each risk class in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5. \n\n\nArticle 325i\nAggregation of risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks\n\n\n1.Institutions shall aggregate risk-class specific own funds requirements for the delta, vega and curvature risks in accordance with the process set out in paragraphs\u00a02 to 5. \n\n\n2.The process to calculate delta, vega and curvature risk-class specific own funds requirements described in Articles 325g and 325h shall be performed three times per risk-class, each time using a different set of correlation parameters  (correlation between risk factors within a bucket) and  (correlation between buckets within a risk class. Each of those three sets shall correspond to a different scenario, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n(a)the 'medium correlations' scenario, whereby the correlation parameters  and  remain unchanged from those specified in Section 6.\n\n\n(b)the 'high correlations' scenario, whereby the correlation parameters  and  that are specified in Section 6 shall be uniformly multiplied by 1,25, with  and  subject to a cap at 100%.\n\n\n(c)the 'low correlations' scenario, whereby the corresponding prescribed correlations specified in Section 6 shall be uniformly multiplied by 0,75.\n\n\n3.All the risk-class specific own funds requirements resulting from each scenario shall be aggregated separately for delta, vega and curvature risk, giving rise to three different, scenario-specific, own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risk.\n\n\n4.The final delta, vega or curvature own fund requirements, shall be the largest of the three scenario-specific own fund requirements for delta, vega or curvature risk calculated in accordance with paragraph 3.\n\n\n5.The sensitivities-based method own fund requirement shall be the sum of the three final delta, vega and curvature own funds requirements.\n\n\nArticle 325j\nTreatment of index instruments, multi-underlying options\n\n\n1.Institutions shall use a look through approach for index instruments and multi-underlying options where all the constituents of the index or the option have delta risk sensitivities of the same sign. The sensitivities to constituent risk factors from index instruments and multi-underlying options are allowed to net with sensitivities to single name instruments without restrictions, except for positions of in the CTP. \n\n\n2.Multi-underlying options with delta risk sensitivities of different signs shall be exempted from delta and vega risk but shall be subject to the residual risk add-on referred to in Section 4 of this Chapter. \n\n\nArticle 325k\nTreatment of collective investment undertakings\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a position in a collective investment undertaking ('CIU') using one of the following approaches:\n\n\n(a)An  institution that  is able to identify the underlying investments of the CIU or the index instrument on a daily basis shall look through to those underlying investments and calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for this position in accordance with the approach set out in Article 325j(1); \n\n\n(b)Where daily prices for the CIU may be obtained but an institution is aware of the mandate of the CIU, that institution shall consider the CIU position as an equity instrument for the purposes of the sensitivities based-method;\n\n\n(c)Where daily prices for the CIU may be obtained but an institution is not aware of the mandate of the CIU, that institution shall consider the CIU position as an equity instrument for the purposes of the sensitivities based-method and assign that CIU position the risk weight of the equity risk bucket \u201cother sector\u201d.\n\n\n2.Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report their own funds requirements for market risk for positions in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter:\n\n\n(a)the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU invests exclusively in securities and deposits all those securities at that depository;\n\n\n(b)for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3).\n\n\n3.EBA shall develop regulatory technical standards to specify in more detail which risk weights shall be assigned to positions in the CIU referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [fifteen months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with article 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 325l\nUnderwriting positions\n\n\n1.Institutions may use the process set out in this Article for calculating the own funds requirements for market risks of underwriting positions of debt or equity instruments. \n\n\n2.Institutions shall apply one of the appropriate multiplying factors listed in Table 1 to the net sensitivities of all the underwriting positions in each individual issuer, excluding the underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of formal agreements, and calculate the own funds requirements for market risks in accordance with the approach set out in this Chapter on the basis of the adjusted net sensitivities.\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\nworking day 0\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworking day 1\n\n\n\n\n90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworking days 2 to 3\n\n\n\n\n75%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworking day 4\n\n\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworking day 5\n\n\n\n\n25%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nafter working day 5\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this Article, 'working day 0' means the working day on which the institution becomes unconditionally committed to accepting a known quantity of securities at an agreed price.\n\n\n3.Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the application of the process set out in this Article.\n\n\nSection 3\nRisk factor and sensitivity definitions\n\n\nSubsection 1\nRisk factor definitions\n\n\nArticle 325m\nGeneral interest rate risk factors\n\n\n1.For all general interest rate risk factors, including inflation risk and cross-currency basis-risk, there shall be one bucket per currency, each containing different types of risk factor. \n\n\nThe delta general interest rate risk factors applicable to interest rate-sensitive instruments shall be the relevant risk-free rates per currency and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall assign risk factors to the specified vertices by linear interpolation or by using a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of the institution to report market risks or profits and losses to senior management.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall obtain the risk-free rates per currency from money market instruments held in the trading book of the institution that have the lowest credit risk, such as overnight index swaps. \n\n\n3.Where institutions cannot apply the approach referred to in paragraph\u00a02, the risk-free rates shall be based on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark positions to market, such as the interbank offered rate swap curves. \n\n\nWhere the data on market-implied swap curves described in paragraph 2 and the first subparagraph of this paragraph are insufficient, the risk-free rates may be derived from the most appropriate sovereign bond curve for a given currency.\n\n\nWhere institutions use the risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from credit spread risk own funds requirements. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to this risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes. \n\n\n4.In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6. \n\n\nInstitutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. \n\n\n5.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described above, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket.\n\n\n\n\n6.Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or EUR. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over USD or basis over EUR either on 'basis over US dollar' or 'basis over EUR'. \n\n\nEach cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are  cross-currency basis used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.\n\n\nInstitutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to this risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over  EUR and basis over USD, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two.\n\n\n7.The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraph 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be on bucket per currency. \n\n\nFor netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.\n\n\nWhere institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following shall apply:\n\n\n(a)where\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped in accordance with that maturity.\n\n\n(b)where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows: \n\n\n(I)the first risk factor shall be mapped in accordance with the maturity of the option;\n\n\n(II)the second risk factor shall be mapped in accordance with the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option.\n\n\n8.The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. \n\n\n9.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325h. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the same risk factor. There shall be only one net sensitivity per bucket. \n\n\nThere shall be no curvature risk charge for inflation and cross currency basis risks.\n\n\nArticle 325n\nCredit spread risk factors for non-securitisation\n\n\n1.The delta credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments that are sensitive to credit spread shall be their issuer credit spread rates, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and mapped to each of the following maturities: 0.25 years, 0.5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall apply one risk factor per issuer and maturity, regardless of whether those issuer credit spread rates are inferred from debts instruments or credit default swaps. The buckets shall be sectorial buckets, as referred to in Section 6, and each bucket shall include all the risk factors allocated to the relevant sector.\n\n\n2.The vega credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with non-securitisation underlyings that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the implied volatilities of the underlying's issuer credit spread rates inferred as laid down in paragraph 1, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.\n\n\n3.The curvature credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments shall consist of one vector of credit spread rates, representing a specific issuer credit spread curve. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates used as variables in the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula  in accordance with Article 325h. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred from either relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor as long as those vectors correspond to the same issuer.\n\n\nArticle 325o\nCredit spread risk risk-factors for securitisation\n\n\n1.Institutions shall apply the CTP securitisations credit spread risk factors referred to in paragraph 3 to securitisation positions that belong to the CTP, as referred to in Article 104(7) to (9), \n\n\n\n\nInstitutions shall apply the securitisations non-CTP credit spread risk factors referred to in paragraph 5 to securitisation positons that do not belong to the CTP, as referred to in Article 104(7) to (9).\n\n\n2.The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk of securitisations that belong to the CTP shall the same as the buckets applicable to the  credit spread risk of non-securitisations, as referred to in Section 6. \n\n\nThe buckets applicable to the credit spread risk of securitisations that do not belong to the CTP shall be specific to this risk-class category, as referred to in Section 6. \n\n\n3.The   credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that belong to the CTP are the following:\n\n\n(a)the delta risk factors shall be all the relevant credit spread rates of the issuers of the ' underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and for each of the following maturities: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n\n\n(b)the Vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that belong to the CTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred as described in point a of this paragraph, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the corresponding option subject to own funds requirements: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. \n\n\n(c)the curvature risk factors shall be the relevant credit spread yield curves of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position expressed as a vector of credit spread rates for different maturities, inferred as indicated in paragraph a of this paragraph. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates that are used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the securitisation position to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula  as specified in Article 325h. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred either from relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor as long as those vectors correspond to the same issuer.\n\n\n5.The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that do not belong to the CTP shall refer to the spread of the tranche rather than the spread of the underlying instruments and shall be the following:\n\n\n(a)the delta risk factors shall be the relevant tranche credit spread rates, mapped to the following maturities, in accordance with the maturity of the tranche: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n\n\n(b)the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that do not belong to the CTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the tranches, each of them mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n\n\n(c)the curvature risk factors shall be the same as those described in point (a) of this paragraph. To all those risk factors, a common risk weight shall be applied, as referred to in Section 6.\n\n\nArticle 325p\n\nEquity risk-factors\n\n\n1.The buckets for all equity risk factors shall be the sectorial buckets referred to in Section 6.\n\n\n2.The equity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be all the equity spot prices and all the equity repurchase agreement rates or equity repo rates. \n\n\nFor the purposes of equity risk, a specific equity repo curve shall constitute a single risk factor, which is expressed as a vector of repo rates for different maturities. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of repo rates that are used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. \n\n\nInstitutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to this risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the repo rate risk factor of the same equity security, regardless of the number of components of each vector.\n\n\n3.The equity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity shall be the implied volatilities of equity spot prices, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be no vega risk capital charge for equity repo rates. \n\n\n4.The equity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity are all the equity spot prices, regardless of the maturity of the corresponding options. There shall be no curvature risk charge for equity repo rates. \n\n\nArticle 325q\nCommodities risk-factors\n\n\n\n\n1.The buckets for all commodity risk factors shall be the sectorial buckets referred to in Section 6.\n\n\n2.The commodity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to commodity sensitive instruments shall be all the commodity spot prices per commodity type and per each of the two contract grades: basic or par grade. Institutions shall only consider two commodity prices on the same type of commodity, with the same maturity and with the same type of contract grade to constitute the same risk factor where the set of legal terms regarding the delivery location are identical. \n\n\n3.The commodity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be the implied volatilities of commodity prices per commodity type, which shall be mapped to the following maturity steps in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall consider sensitivities to the same commodity type and allocated to the same maturity to be a single risk factor, which institutions shall then offset. \n\n\n4.The commodity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be one set of commodity prices with different maturities per commodity type, expressed as a vector. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are prices of that commodity that are used as variables by the pricing model of the institution for that instrument. Institutions shall not differentiate between commodity prices by grade or by delivery location. \n\n\nThe sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula  shall be calculated as specified in Article 325h. For the purpose of curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors having a different number of components to constitute the same risk factor provided that those vectors correspond to the same commodity type.\n\n\nArticle 325r\nForeign exchange risk risk-factors\n\n\n1.The foreign exchange delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to foreign exchange sensitive instruments shall be all the spot exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the institution's reporting currency. There shall be one bucket per currency pair, containing a single risk factor and a single a net sensitivity.\n\n\n2.The foreign exchange vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to foreign exchange shall be the implied volatilities of exchange rates between the currency pairs referred to in paragraph 1. Those implied volatilities of exchange rates shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n\n\n3.The foreign exchange curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to foreign exchange shall be the same as those referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall not be required to distinguish between onshore and offshore variants of a currency for all foreign exchange delta, vega and curvature risk factors. \n\n\nSubsection 2: \nSensitivity definitions\n\n\nArticle 325s\nDelta risk sensitivities\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate delta GIRR\u00a0sensitivities as follows:\n\n\n(a)the sensitivities to risk factors consisting of risk-free rates shall be calculated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n = the rate of a risk-free curve k a with maturity t; \n\n\nVi (.) = the pricing function of instrument i; \n\n\nx,y = other variables in the pricing function.\n\n\n(b)the sensitivities to risk factors consisting of inflation risk and cross-currency basis () shall be calculated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n = a vector of m components representing the implied inflation curve or the cross-currency basis curve for a given currency j with m being equal to the number of inflation or cross-currency related variables used in the pricing model of instrument i; \n\n\n = the unity matrix of dimension (1 x m); \n\n\nVi (.) = the pricing function of the instrument i; \n\n\ny, z = other variables in the pricing model\n\n\n2.Institutions shall calculate the delta credit spread risk sensitivities for all securitisation and non-securitisation positions ()as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n = the value of the credit spread rate of an issuer j at maturity t; \n\n\nVi (.) = the pricing function of instrument i; \n\n\nx,y = other variables in the pricing function.\n\n\n3.Institutions shall calculate delta equity sensitivities as follows:\n\n\n(a)the sensitivities to risk factors k (sk) consisting on equity spot prices\u00a0shall be calculated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nk is a specific equity security;\n\n\nEQk is the value of the spot price of that equity security; and\n\n\nVi (.) is the pricing function of instrument i.\n\n\nx,y are other variables in the pricing model\n\n\n\n\n(b)the sensitivities to risk factors consisting on equity repos rates shall be calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nk = the index that denotes the equity;\n\n\n = a vector of m components representing the  repo term restructure for a specific equity k with m being equal to the number of repo rates corresponding to different maturities used in the pricing model of instrument i; \n\n\n = the unity matrix of dimension (1 x m); \n\n\nVi (.) = the pricing function of the instrument i; \n\n\ny, z = other variables in the pricing model of instrument i.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate the delta commodity sensitivities to each risk factor k (sk) as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nk = a given commodity risk factor;\n\n\nCTYk = the value of risk factor k;\u00a0\n\n\nVi (.) = the market value of instrument i as a function of risk factor k.\n\n\n5.Institutions shall calculate the delta foreign exchange sensitivities to each foreign exchange risk factor k (sk) as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nk = a given foreign exchange risk factor;\n\n\nFXk = the value of the risk factor;\n\n\nVi (.) = the market value of instrument i as a function of the risk factor k.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 325t\nVega risk sensitivities\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the vega risk sensitivity of an option to a given risk factor k (sk) as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nk = a specific vega risk factor, consisting of an implied volatility;\n\n\n =  the value of that risk factor, which should be expressed as a percentage; \n\n\nx,y = other variables in the pricing function.\n\n\n2.In the case of risk classes where vega risk factors have a maturity dimension, but where the rules to map the risk factors are not applicable because the options do not have a maturity, institutions shall map those risk factors to the longest prescribed maturity. Those options shall be subject to the residual risks add-on.\n\n\n3.In the case of options that do not have a strike or barrier and options that have multiple strike or barriers, institutions shall apply the mapping to strikes and maturity used internally by the institution to price the option. Those options shall also be subject to the residual risks add-on.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall not calculate the vega risk for securitisation tranches included in the CTP referred to in Article 104(7) to (9) that do not have an implied volatility. Delta and curvature risk charges shall be computed for those securitisation tranches.\n\n\nArticle 325u\nRequirements on sensitivity computations\n\n\n1.Institutions shall derive sensitivities from the institution\u2019s pricing model used in their profit and loss reporting. \n\n\n2.Institutions shall assume that the implied volatility remains constant when computing the delta sensitivities for instruments subject to optionality.. \n\n\n3.Institutions shall assume that the underlying of the option follows either a lognormal or a normal distribution in the pricing models from which sensitivities are derived when computing a vega general interest rate risk or credit spread risk sensitivity. Institutions shall assume that the underlying follows either a lognormal or a normal distribution in the pricing models from which sensitivities are derived when computing a vega equity, commodity or foreign exchange sensitivity. \n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate all sensitivities excluding credit valuation adjustments.\n\n\nSection 4\nThe Residual Risk Add-On\n\n\nArticle 325v\nOwn fund requirements for Residual Risks\n\n\n1.In addition to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, institutions shall apply additional own fund requirements in accordance with this Article to instruments exposed to residual risks.\n\n\n2.Instruments are exposed to residual risks where they meet any of the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)the instrument references an exotic underlying; \n\n\n\n\n(b)the instrument bears other residual  risks. \n\n\n3.Institutions shall calculate the additional own fund requirements referred to in paragraph 1 as the sum of gross notional amounts of the instruments referred to in paragraph 2 multiplied by the following risk weights: \n\n\n(a)1,0% in the case of instruments referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2; \n\n\n(b)0,1% in the case of instruments referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2. \n\n\n4.By the way of derogation from paragraph 1, institution shall not apply the own fund requirement for residual risks to an instrument that meets any of the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)the instrument is listed on a recognised exchange; \n\n\n(b)the instrument is eligible for central clearing in accordance with Regulation (EU) 648/2012;\n\n\n(c)the instrument perfectly offsets the market risks of another position of the trading book, in which case the two perfectly matching trading book positions shall be exempted from the own fund requirement for residual risks.\n\n\n5.EBA shall develop regulatory technical standards to specify in more details what is an exotic underlying and which instruments are exposed to other residual risks for the purpose of paragraph 2.\n\n\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take the following elements into account:\n\n\n(d)Exotic underlying shall include exposures that are not in the scope of the delta, vega or curvauture risk tretaments under the sensitivities-based method laid down in Section 2 or the default risk charge laid down in Section 5. EBA shall at least examine whether longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised volatility should be considered as exotic underlying exposures.\n\n\n(e)When defining which instruments ar exposed to other residual risks, EBA shall at least examine instruments that meet any of the following criteria:\n\n\n(I)An instrument is subject to vega and curvature risk own funds requirements in the sensitivities based method laid down in Section 2 and generates pay-offs that cannot be replicated as a finite linear combination of plain-vanilla options;\n\n\n(II)An instrument is a securitisation position that belongs to the CTP, as referred to in Article 104(7) to (9). Non-securitisation hedges that belong to the CTP shall not be considered.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [fifteen months after the entry into force of this Regulation]\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with article 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n\n\nSection 5\nThe Default Risk Charge\n\n\nArticle 325w\nDefinitions and general provisions\n\n\n1.Default risk own funds requirements shall apply to debt and equity instruments, to derivative instruments having the former instruments as underlyings and to derivatives whose pay-offs or fair values are affected by the event of default of an obligor other than the counterparty to the derivative instrument itself. Institutions shall calculate the default risk requirements shall be calculated separately for each of the following types of instruments: non-securitisations, securitisations that do not belong to the-CTP and securitisations that belong to the CTP. The final default risk own funds requirements for an institution shall be the summation of these three components.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n\n\n(a)'short exposure ' means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a gain for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure.\n\n\n(b)' long exposure ' means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a loss for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure.\n\n\n(c)gross jump to default (JTD) amount means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce on a specific exposure.\n\n\n(d)net jump to default (JTD) amount means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce on a specific institution, after offsetting among gross JTD amounts has taken place.\n\n\n(e)LGD is the loss given default of the obligor on an instrument issued by this obligor expressed as a share of the notional of the instrument.\n\n\n(f)default risk weights mean the percentage representing the estimated probabilities of default of each obligor, according to the creditworthiness of that obligor.\n\n\nsubsection 1\ndefault risk charge for non-securitisations\n\n\nArticle 325x\nGross jump to default amounts\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each long exposure to debt instruments formulas follows :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nVnotional = the notional value of the instrument;\n\n\nP&Llong = a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the long exposure. Gains shall enter the formula with a positive sign and losses with a negative. \n\n\nAdjustmentlong = the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument. Increases shall enter the Adjustmentlong term with a positive sign and decreases with a negative sign.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall calculate gross JTD amounts for each short exposure to debt instruments formulas follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nVnotional = the notional value of the instrument that shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;\n\n\nP&Lshort = a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the short exposure. Gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses with a negative sign.\n\n\nAdjustmentshort = the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's gain in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument. Decreases shall enter the Adjustmentshort\u00a0term with a positive sign and decreases with a negative sign.\n\n\n\n\n3.The LGD for debt instruments to be applied by institutions for the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be the following:\n\n\n(a)exposures to non-senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 100%; \n\n\n(b)exposures to senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 75%; \n\n\n(c)exposures to covered bonds, as referred to in Article 129, shall be assigned an LGD of 25%.\n\n\n4.For the purpose of the calculations set out in paragraph 1 and 2, notional values in the case of debt instruments shall be the face value of the debt instrument. For the purpose of the calculations set out in paragraph 1 and 2, notional values in the case of derivative instruments on an underlying debt security shall be the face value of the underlying debt instrument. \n\n\n5.For exposures to equity instruments, institutions calculate the gross JTD amounts as follows, instead of those referred to in paragraph 1 and 2: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nV = the fair value of the equity or, in case of derivative instruments on equities, the fair value of the underlying equity of the derivative instrument.\n\n\n6.Institutions shall assign an LGD of 100% to equity instruments for the purpose of the calculation set out in paragraph 6.\n\n\n7.In the case of exposures to default risk arising from derivative instruments whose payoffs in the event of default of the obligor are not related to the notional value of a specific instrument issued by this obligor or to the LGD of the obligor or an instrument issued by this obligor, institutions shall use alternative methodologies to estimate the Gross JTD amounts, which shall meet the definition of Gross JTD in paragraph 3 of article 325t.\n\n\n8.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in more details how institutions shall calculate JTD amounts for different types of instruments in accordance with this Article, and which alternative methodologies institutions shall use for the purpose of the estimation of Gross JTD amounts referred to in paragraph 7. \n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [fifteen months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with article 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n\n\nArticle 325y\nNet jump to default amounts\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate net jump to default amounts by offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short and long exposures. Offsetting shall only be possible among exposures to the same obligor where short exposures have the same or lower seniority than long exposures. \n\n\n2.Offsetting shall be either full or partial depending on the maturities of the offsetting exposures: \n\n\n(a)offsetting shall be full where all offsetting exposures have maturities of one year or more;\n\n\n(b)offsetting shall be partial where at least one of the offsetting exposures has a maturity of less than one year, in which case, the size of the JTD amount of each exposure with a maturity of less than one year shall be scaled down by the ratio of the exposure\u2019s maturity relative to one year.\n\n\n3.Where no offsetting is possible gross JTD amounts shall equal net JTD amounts in the case of exposures with maturities of one year or more. Gross JTD amounts with maturities of less than one year shall be scaled down to calculate net JTD amounts. \n\n\n\n\nThe scaling factor for those exposures shall be the ratio of the exposure\u2019s maturity relative to one year, with a floor of 3 months. \n\n\n4.For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the maturities of the derivative contracts, and not those of their underlyings, shall be considered. Cash equity exposures shall be assigned a maturity of either one year or three months, at the institution's discretion. \n\n\nArticle 325z\n\nCalculation of default risk own funds requirement\n\n\n1.Net JTD amounts, irrespective of the type of counterparty, shall be multiplied by the corresponding default risk weights in accordance with their credit quality as specified in Table 2:\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality category\n\n\n\n\nDefault risk weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 1\n\n\n\n\n0.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 2\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 3\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 4\n\n\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 5\n\n\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality step 6\n\n\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrated\n\n\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaulted\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Exposures which would receive a 0% risk-weight under the Standardised approach for credit risk in accordance with Part III, Title II, Chapter 2 shall receive a 0% default risk weight for the default risk own fund requirements.\n\n\n3.The weighted net JTD shall be  allocated to the following buckets: corporates, sovereigns, and local governments/municipalities. \n\n\n4.Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\ni = to the index that denotes an instrument belonging to bucket b;\n\n\n = default risk own fund requirement for bucket b;\n\n\n = a ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summation of long and short positions for the purposes of the  and the  shall be made for all positions within a bucket regardless of the credit quality step to which those positions are allocated, resulting in the bucket-specific default risk own fund requirements.\n\n\n5.The final default risk own fund requirement for non-securitisations shall be calculated as a simple sum of the bucket-level own fund requirements. \n\n\nSubsection 2\nDefault Risk Charge for securitisations (non-CTP)\n\n\nArticle 325aa\nJump to default amounts\n\n\n1.Gross jump to default amounts for securitization exposures shall be the fair values of the securitisation exposures. \n\n\n\n\n2.Net jump to default amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross jump to default amounts and short gross Jump to default amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible among securitisation exposures with the same underlying asset pool and belonging to the same tranche. No offsetting shall be permitted between securitisation exposures with different underlying asset pools, even where the attachment and detachment points are the same. \n\n\n3.Where, by decomposing or combining existing securitisation exposures, other existing securitisation exposures can be perfectly replicated, except for the maturity, the exposures resulting from the decomposition or combination may be used instead of the original ones for the purposes of offsetting.\n\n\n4.Where, by decomposing or combining existing exposures in underlying names, the entire tranche structure of an existing securitisation exposure can be perfectly replicated, the exposures resulting from decomposition or combination may be used for the purposes of offsetting. Where underlying names are used in this way, they shall be removed from the non-securitisation default risk treatment. \n\n\n5.Article 325y shall apply to both original and replicated securitisation exposures. The relevant maturities shall be those of the securitisation tranches. \n\n\nArticle 325ab\nCalculation of default risk own funds requirement for securitisations\n\n\n1.Net JTD amounts of securitisation exposures shall be multiplied by 8% of the risk weight that applies to the relevant securitisation exposure, including STS securitisations, in the non-trading book in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches set out in Title II, Chapter 5, Section 3, and irrespective of the type of counterparty. \n\n\n2.A maturity of one year shall be applied to all tranches where risk weights are calculated in accordance with the SEC-IRBA and SEC-ERBA.\n\n\n3.The risk-weighted JTD amounts for individual cash securitisation exposures shall be capped at the fair value of the position.\n\n\n4.Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to the following buckets:\n\n\n(a)one common bucket for all corporates, regardless the region.\n\n\n(b)44 different buckets corresponding to 1 bucket per region for each of the eleven asset classes defined. The eleven asset classes are ABCP, Auto Loans/Leases, RMBS, Credit Cards, CMBS, Collateralised Loan Obligations, CDO-squared, Small and Medium Enterprises, Student loans, Other retail, Other wholesale. The 4 regions are Asia, Europe, North America, and other regions.\n\n\n5.In order to assign a securitisation exposure to a bucket, institutions shall rely on a classification commonly used in the market. Institutions shall assign each securitisation exposure to only one of the buckets above. Any securitisation exposure that an institution cannot assign to a type or region of underlying shall be assigned to the categories 'other retail', 'other wholesale' or 'other regions' respectively.\n\n\n6.Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in the same way as for default risk of non-securitisation exposures, using the formula in Article 325z(4), resulting in the default risk own fund requirement for each bucket.\n\n\n7.The final default risk own fund requirement for non-securitisations shall be calculated as a simple sum of the bucket-level own fund requirements. \n\n\nSubsection 3\nDefault Risk Charge for securitisations (CTP)\n\n\nArticle 325ac\nScope\n\n\n1.For the CTP, the capital charge shall include the default risk for securitisation exposures and for non-securitisation hedges. These hedges shall be removed from the default risk non-securitisation calculations. There shall be no diversification benefit between the default risk charge for non-securitisations, default risk charge for securitisations (non-CTP) and default risk charge for the securitisation CTP. \n\n\n2.For traded non-securitisation credit and equity derivatives, JTD amounts by individual constituent issuer legal entity shall be determined by applying a look-through approach.\n\n\nArticle 325ad\nJump to default amounts for the CTP\n\n\n1.Gross jump to default amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the CTP shall be the fair values of those exposures. \n\n\n\n\n2.Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points: \n\n\n(a)attachment point = (N \u2013 1) / Total Names \n\n\n(b)detachment point = N / Total Names \n\n\nwhere \u201cTotal Names\u201d shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool.\n\n\n3.Net jump to default amounts shall be determined by offsetting long and short gross jump to default amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible among exposures that are otherwise identical except for maturity. Offsetting shall only be possible in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)for index products, offsetting shall be possible across maturities among the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the specifications for exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325y. Long and short gross jump to default amounts that are perfect replications may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model. For the purposes of this Article, decomposition with a valuation model means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with a LGD of 100%. In such cases, the sum of gross jump to default amounts of single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross jump to default amount of the undecomposed exposure. \n\n\n(b)Offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for re-securitisations.   \n\n\n(c)For indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities among the same index family, series and tranche by replication or decomposition. For the purposes of this Article:\n\n\n(I)replication means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series.\n\n\n(II)decomposition means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.\n\n\nWhere the long and short exposures are otherwise equivalent except for one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net Jump to default amount shall reflect the residual exposure.\n\n\n(d)Different tranches of the same index series, different series of the same index and different index families may not be offset. \n\n\nArticle 325ae\nCalculation of default risk own funds requirement for the CTP\n\n\n1.Net JTD amounts shall be multiplied by:\n\n\n(a)for tranched products, the default risk weights corresponding to their credit quality as specified in Article 348(1) and (2);\n\n\n(b)for non-tranched products, by the default risk weights referred to in Article 325y (1). \n\n\n2.Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to buckets that correspond to an index.. \n\n\n3.Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\ni = an instrument belonging to bucket b;\n\n\n = the default risk own fund requirement for bucket b;\n\n\nctp = the ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Article 325z(4), but using long and short positions across the entire CTP and not just the positions in the particular bucket. \n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate the default risk own fund requirements of the CTP (DRCCTP) by using the following formula:\n\n\n\nSection 6\nRisk weights and Correlations\n\n\nSubsection 1\nDelta risk weights and

requirements:\n\n\n(a)in calculating PEStRS, institutions shall only apply scenarios of future shocks to a subset of modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio which has been chosen by the institution, to the satisfaction of competent authorities, so that the following condition is met at time t, with the sum taken over the preceding 60 business days:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn institution that no longer meets the requirement referred to in the first subparagraph of this point shall immediately notify the competent authorities thereof and update the subset of modellable risk factors within two weeks in order to meet that requirement. Where, after two weeks, that institution has failed to meet that requirement, it shall revert to the approach set out in Chapter 1a to calculate the own fund requirements for market risks for some trading desks, until that institution can demonstrate to the competent authority that it is meeting the requirement set out in the first subparagraph of this point;\n\n\n(b)in calculating PEStRS,i institutions shall only apply scenarios of future shocks to the subset of modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio chosen by the institution for the purposes of point (a) and which have been mapped to the broad risk factor category i in accordance with Article 325be;\n\n\n(c)the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period of financial stress that shall be identified by the institution in order to maximise the value of PEStRS. Institutions shall review the identification of this stress period at least on a monthly basis and shall notify the outcome of that review to the competent authorities.For the purpose of identifying that stress period, institutions shall use an observation period starting at least from 1 January 2007, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities. \n\n\n(d)the model inputs of PEStRS,i shall be calibrated to the 12-month stress period that has been identified by the institution for the purposes of point (c).\n\n\n3.For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall numbers PEStRC\u00a0and PEStRC,i referred to in Article 325bc(2), institutions shall, in addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1, meet the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)in calculating PEStRC, institutions shall only apply scenarios of future shocks to the subset of modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3;\n\n\n(b)in calculating PEStRC,i, institutions shall only apply scenarios of future shocks to the subset of modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3;\n\n\n(c)the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be calibrated to historical data from the preceding 12-months period. Those data shall be updated at least on a monthly basis.\n\n\n4.For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall numbers PEStFC and PEStFC,i referred to in Article 325bc(2), institutions shall, in addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1, meet the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)in calculating PEStFC , institutions shall apply scenarios of future shocks to all the modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio;\n\n\n(b)in calculating PEStFC,i, institutions shall apply scenarios of future shocks to all the modellable risk factors of positions in the portfolio which have been mapped to the broad risk factor category i in accordance with Article 325be;\n\n\n(c)the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be calibrated to historical data from the preceding 12-months period. Those data shall be updated at least on a monthly basis. Where there is a significant upsurge in the price volatility of a material number of modellable risks factors of an institution's portfolio which are not in the subset of risk factors referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may require an institution to use historical data from a period shorter than the preceding 12-months, but such shorter period shall not be shorter than the preceding 6-months period. Competent authorities shall notify EBA of any decision requiring an institution to use historical data from a shorter period than 12 months and substantiate it.\n\n\n5.In calculating a given partial expected shortfall number referred to in Article 325bc(2), institutions shall maintain the values of the modellable risks factors for which they have not been required in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to apply scenarios of future shocks for this partial expected shortfall number.\n\n\n6.By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, institutions may decide to calculate the partial expected shortfall numbers PEStRS,i, PEStRC,i and PEStFC,i on a weekly basis.\n\n\nArticle 325be\nLiquidity horizons\n\n\n1.Institutions shall map each risk factor of positions attributed to trading desks for which they have been granted the permission referred to in Article 325ba(1) or are in the process of being granted that permission to one of the broad risk factor categories listed in Table 2,\u00a0as well as to one of the broad risk factor subcategories listed in that Table.\n\n\n\n\n2.The liquidity horizon of a risk factor of the positions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the liquidity horizon of the corresponding broad risk factor subcategories it has been mapped to.\n\n\n3.By way of derogation from paragraph 1, an institution may decide, for a given trading desk, to replace the liquidity horizon of a broad risk subcategory listed in Table 2 with one of the longer liquidity horizons listed in Table 1. Where an institution takes this decision, the longer liquidity  horizon shall apply to all the modellable risk factor of the positions attributed to this trading desk mapped to this broad risk subcategory for the purpose of calculating the partial expected shorfall numbers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bd(1). \n\n\nAn institution shall notify the competent authorities of the trading desks and the broad risk subcategories for which it decides to apply the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\n\n4.For calculating the partial expected shorfall numbers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bd(1), the effective liquidity horizon 'EffectiveLH' of a given modellable risk factor of a given trading book position shall be calculated as

factors of the positions attributed to trading desks for which they have been granted the permission referred to in Article 325ba(1) or are in the process of being granted that permission.\n\n\n2.An institution shall consider a risk factor of a trading book position as modellable where all the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)the institution has identified at least 24 verifiable prices  which contained that risk factor over the preceding 12-months period; \n\n\n(b)there is no more than one month between the dates of two consecutive observations of verifiable prices identified by the institution in accordance with point (a);\n\n\n(c)there is a clear and apparent relationship between the value of the risk factor and each verifiable price  identified by the institution in accordance with point (a).\n\n\n3.For the purposes of paragraph 2, a verifiable price means any one of the following: \n\n\n(a)the market price of an actual transaction to which the institution was one of the parties;\n\n\n(b)the market price of an actual transaction that was entered into by third parties and for which price and trade date are publicly available or have been provided by a third party;\n\n\n(c)the price obtained from a committed quote provided by a third party.\n\n\n4.For the purposes of points (b) and (c) of paragraph 3, institutions may consider a price or a committed quote provided by a third party as a verifiable price, provided that the third party agrees to provide evidence of the transaction or a commited quote to competent authorities upon request.\n\n\n5.An institution may identify a verifiable price for the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 2 for more than one risk factor.\n\n\n6.Institutions shall consider risk factors derived from a combination of modellable risk factors as modellable.\n\n\n7.Where an institution considers a risk factor to be modellable in accordance with paragraph 1, the institution may use data other than the verifiable prices it used to prove that the risk factor is modellable in accordance with paragraph 2 to calculate the scenarios of future shocks applied to that risk factor for the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall referred to in Article 365 as long as that data inputs fulfils the relevant requirements set out in Article 325bd.\n\n\n8.Institutions shall consider as non-modellable a risk factor that does not fulfil all the conditions set out in paragraph 2 and shall calculate the own funds requirements for that risk factor in accordance with Article 325bl.\n\n\n9.Institutions shall consider risk factors derived from a combination of modellable and non-modellable risk factors as non-modellable.\n\n\n10.By way of derogation from paragraph 2, competent authorities may permit an institution to consider a risk factor that meets all of the conditions in paragraph 2 as non-modellable for a period of less than one year. \n\n\nArticle 325bg\nRegulatory back-testing requirements and multiplication factors\n\n\n1.For any given date, an institution's trading desk meets the backtesting requirements referred to in Article 325ba(1) where the number of overshootings as referred to in paragraph 2 for that trading desk that occurred over the most recent 250 business days do not exceed any of the following:\n\n\n(a)12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence internal on the basis of back-testing hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value;\n\n\n\n\n(b)12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence internal on the basis of back-testing actual changes in the portfolio's value;\n\n\n(c)30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence internal on the basis of back-testing hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value;\n\n\n(d)30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence internal on the basis of back-testing actual changes in the portfolio's value;\n\n\n2.For the purpose of paragraph 1, institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio's value composed of all the positions attributed to the trading desk. An overshooting shall mean a one-day change in that portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)a one-day holding period;\n\n\n(b)scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desk's positions referred to in Article 325bh(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325bf;\n\n\n(c)data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data from the preceding 12-months period. Those data shall be updated at least on a monthly basis;\n\n\n(d)unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325bb(1).\n\n\n3.Institutions shall count the daily overshootings referred to in paragraph 2in accordance with the following:\n\n\n(a)back-testing hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day;\n\n\n(b)back-testing actual changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day excluding fees, commissions, and net interest income;\n\n\n(c)an overshooting shall be counted each day the institution is not able to assess the portfolio's value or is not able to calculate the value-at-risk number referred to in paragraph 1;\n\n\n4.An institution shall calculate, in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6, the multiplication factor (mc) referred to in Article 325bb for the portfolio of all the positions attributed to trading desks for which it has been granted the permission referred to in Article 325ba(1). That calculation shall be updated on at least a monthly basis.\n\n\n5.The multiplication factor (mc) shall be the sum of the value of 1,5 and an add-on between 0 and 0,5 in accordance with Table 3. For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 4, this add-on shall be calculated by the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this paragraph in accordance with the following:\n\n\n(a)an overshooting shall be a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following :\n\n\n(I)a one-day holding period;\n\n\n(II)a 99th percentile, one tailed confidence interval;\n\n\n(III)scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desks' positions referred to in Article 325bh(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325bf;\n\n\n(IV)data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data from the preceding 12-months period. Those data shall be updated on at least a monthly basis;\n\n\n(V)unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325bb(1);\n\n\n\n\n(b)the number of overshootings shall be equal to the higher of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio; \n\n\n(c)in counting daily overshootings, institutions shall apply the provisions set out in paragraph 3.\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of overshootings\n\n\n\n\nAdd-on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer than 5\n\n\n\n\n0,00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n0,20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n0,26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n0,33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n0,38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n0,42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 9\n\n\n\n\n0,50\n\n\n\n\n\n6.Competent authorities may limit the add-on to that resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes where the number of overshootings under back-testing actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.\n\n\n7.Competent authorities shall monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 4 or a trading desk's compliance with the backtesting requirements referred to in paragraph 1. Institutions shall notify promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days after the occurrence of an overshooting, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme and provide an explanation for those overshootings.\n\n\n8.By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 5, competent authorities may permit an institution not to count an overshooting where a one-day change in its portfolio's value exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution's internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor. To do so, the institution shall substantiate to the competent authorities that the stress scenario risk measure calculated in accordance with Article 325bl for this non-modellable risk factor is higher than the positive difference between the institution's portfolio's value and the related value-at-risk number.\n\n\n9.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the technical elements that shall be included in the actual and hypothetical changes the portfolio's value of an institution for the purpose of this Article.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [six months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010.\n\n\nArticle 325bh\nProfit and loss attribution requirement\n\n\n1.For any given month, an institution's trading desk meets the profit and loss (P&L) attribution requirements for the purpose of Article 325ba(1) where that trading desk complies with the requirements set out in this Article. \n\n\n2.The P&L attribution requirement shall ensure that the theoretical changes in a trading desk portfolio's value, based on the institution's risk-measurement model, are sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the trading desk portfolio's value, based on the institution's pricing model. \n\n\n3.An institution's compliance with the P&L attribution requirement shall lead, for each position in a given trading desk, to the identification of a precise list of risk factors that are deemed appropriate for verifying the institution's compliance with the backtesting requirement set out in Article 325bg.    \n\n\n4.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify: \n\n\n(a)in light of international regulatory developments, the technical criteria that shall ensure that the theoretical changes in a trading desk portfolio's value is sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the trading desk portfolio's value for the purposes of paragraph 2;\n\n\n(b)the technical elements that shall be included in the theoretical and hypothetical changes in a trading desk portfolio's value for the purpose of this Article.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [six months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010.\n\n\nArticle 325bi\nRequirements on risk measurement \n\n\n\n\n1.Institutions using an internal risk-measurement model used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risks as referred to in Article 325bb shall ensure that that model meets all of the requirements:\n\n\n(a)the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in subsection 1 of section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&L attribution requirement as referred to in Article 325bh. An institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model. \n\n\n(b)the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Proxies used for risk factors shall show a good track record for the actual position held.\n\n\n(c)the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution's trading strategies The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves; \n\n\n(d)the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. Foreign exchange positions of a CIU of which an institution is not aware of shall be carved out from the internal models approach and treated in accordance with Chapter 1a of this Title;\n\n\n(e)the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor for at least each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions. The sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions' activities in the equity markets. The model shall incorporate at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor with the individual risk factors for each equity markets For material exposures to equity markets, the model shall incorporate at least one idiosyncratic risk factor for each equity exposure.\n\n\n(f)the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor for at least each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities in which case a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type will be acceptable. For material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions. \n\n\n(g)proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data are insufficient, including during the period of stress.\n\n\n(h)for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options' maturities. \n\n\n2.Institutions may use empirical correlations within broad risk factor categories and, for the purposes of calculating the unconstrained expected shortfall measure\u00a0\u00a0as referred to in Article 325bc(1), across broad risk factor categories only where the institution's approach for measuring those correlations is sound, consistent with the applicable liquidity horizons, and implemented with integrity.\n\n\nArticle 325bj\nQualitative requirements\n\n\n1.Any internal risk-measurement model used for the purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and shall comply with all of the following qualitative requirements:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any internal risk-measurement model used to calculate capital requirements for market risks shall be closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management. That unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal risk-measurement model. That unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter and shall be responsible for the overall risk management system. That unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risks, and on the appropriateness of measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution's overall risk exposure;\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the institution shall have a sufficient number of staff skilled to a level appropriate to the sophistication of any internal risk-measurement models, and being skilled in the trading, risk-control, audit and back-office areas;\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the institution shall have in place a documented set of internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the overall operation of any internal risk-measurement models;\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any internal risk-measurement model shall have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks;\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the institution shall frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which shall encompass any internal risk-measurement model. The results of these stress tests shall be reviewed by senior managementat on at least a monthly basis and comply with the policies and limits approved by the institution's management body. The institution shall take appropriate actions where the results of those stress tests show excessive losses arising from the trading's business of the institution under certain circumstances;\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the institution shall conduct an independent review of any internal risk-measurement models, either as part of its regular internal auditing process,or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review, to the satisfaction of competent authorities.\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of point (h), a third-party undertaking means an undertaking that provides auditing or consulting services to institutitons and that has staff that is sufficiently skilled in the area of market risks in trading activities. \n\n\n2.The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and the independent risk-control unit.The institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk-management process at least once a year. That review shall assess the following:\n\n\n(a)the adequacy of the documentation of the risk-management system and process and the organisation of the risk-control unit;\n\n\n(b)the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processes the institution employs for approving risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the scope of risks captured by the model, the accuracy and appropriateness of the risk-measurement system and the validation of any significant changes to the internal risk-measurement model;\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations and the accuracy and appropriateness for generating data proxies where the available data are insufficient to meet the requirement set out in this Chapter;\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the verification process the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources used to run any of its internal risk-measurement models, including the independence of those data sources;\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the verification process the institution employs to evaluate back-testing requirements and P&L attribution requirements that are conducted in order to assess the internal risk-measurement models' accuracy.\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where the review is performed by a third-party undertaking in accordance to point (h) of paragraph 1, the verification that the internal validation process set out in Article 325bk fulfils its objectives.\n\n\n3.Institutions shall update the techniques and practices they use for any of the internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter in line with the evolution of new techniques and best practices that develop in respect of those internal risk-measurement models.\n\n\nArticle 325bk\nInternal Validation\n\n\n1.Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that any internal risk-measurement model used for purposes of this Chapter has been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that any such models are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. \n\n\n2.Institutions shall conduct the validation referred to in paragraph 1 in the following circumstances: \n\n\n(a)when any internal risk-measurment model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to that model;\n\n\n(b)on a periodic basis and especially where there have been significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal risk-measurment model no longer being adequate. \n\n\n3.The validation of any internal risk-measurement model of an institution shall not be limited to back-testing and P&L attribution requirements, but shall, as a minimum, includes the following:\n\n\n(a)tests to verify whether the assumptions made in the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;\n\n\n(b) own internal model validation tests, including back-testing in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;\n\n\n(c)the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal risk-measurment model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example material basis risks and concentration risk or the risks associated with the use of proxies.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 325bl\nCalculation of stress scenario risk measure\n\n\n1.At time t, an institution shall calculate the stress scenario risk measure for all the non-modellable risk factors of the trading book positions in a given portfolio as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\nm\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0=         the index that denotes all the non-modellable risk factors of the \n\n\npositions in the portfolio which represent an idyosyncratic risk which has been mapped to the credit spread broad risk factor category in accordance with Article 325be(1) and for which the institution has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, that those risk factors are uncorrelated;\n\n\nl\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0=\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the index that denotes all the non-modellable risk factors of the positions in the portfolio other than those denoted by the index 'm';\n\n\nICSStm\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the stress scenario risk measure, as determined in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, of the non-modellable risk factor 'm';\n\n\nSStl\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the stress scenario risk measure, as determined in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, of the non-modellable risk factor 'l'; \n\n\n2.The stress scenario risk measure of a given non-modellable risk factor means the loss that is incurred in all the trading book positions of the portfolio which includes that non-modellable risk factor where an extreme scenario of future shock is applied to that risk factor. \n\n\n3.Institutions shall determine to the satisfaction of competent authorities appropriate extreme scenarios of future shock for all the modellable risk-factors. \n\n\n4.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater details: \n\n\n(a)how institutions shall determine the extreme scenario of future shock applicable to non-modellable risk factors and how they shall apply that extreme scenario of future shock to those risk factors; \n\n\n(b)a regulatory extreme scenario of future shock for each broad risk factor subcategory listed in Table 2 of Article 325be which institutions may use when they cannot determine an extreme scenario of future shock in accordance with point (a), or which competent authorities may require the institution to apply when those authorities are not satisfied with the extreme scenario of future shock determined by the institution.\n\n\nIn developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration that the level of own funds requirements for market risk of a non-modellable risk factor as set out in this Article shall be as high as the level of own funds requirements for market risks that would be calculated under this Chapter were this risk factor modellable.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [six months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010.\n\n\nSECTION 2\nINTERNAL DEFAULT RISK MODEL\n\n\nArticle 325bm\nScope of the internal default risk model\n\n\n5.All the institution's positions that have been  attributed to trading desks for which the institution has been granted the permission referred to in Article 325ba(1) shall be subject to an own funds requirement for default risk where the positions contain at least one risk factor mapped to the broad risk categories 'equity' or 'credit spread' in accordance with Article 325be(1). That own funds requirement, which is incremental to the risks captured by the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325bb(1), shall be calculated with the institution's internal default risk model which shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Section \n\n\n\n\n6.There shall be one issuer of traded debt or equity instruments related to at least one risk factor for each of the positions referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\nArticle 325bn\nPermission to use an internal default risk model\n\n\n1.Competent authorities shall grant an institution permission to use an internal default risk model to calculate the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325bb(2) for all the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bm that are assigned to a given trading desk provided that the internal default risk model complies with Articles 325bo, 325bp, 325bq, Articles 325bj and 325bk for that trading desk. \n\n\n2.EBA shall issue guidelines on the requirements of Articles 325bo, 325bp and 325bq by [two years after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\n3.Where an institution's trading desk, for which at least one of the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bm has been assigned to, do not meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1, the own funds requirements for market risks of all the positions in this trading desk shall be calculated in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a.\n\n\nArticle 325bo\nOwn funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model for the portfolio of all the positions referred to in Article 325bm as follows:\n\n\n(a)the own funds requirements shall be equal to a value-at-risk number measuring potential losses in the market value of the portfolio caused by the default of issuers related to those positions at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year;\n\n\n(b)the potential loss referred to in point (a) means a direct or indirect loss in the market value of a position caused by the default of the issuers and which is incremental to any losses already taken into account in the current valuation of the position. The default of the issuers of equity positions shall be represented by the issuers' equity prices dropping to zero;\n\n\n(c)institutions shall determine default correlations between different issuers based on a conceptually sound methodolgy and using objective historical data of market credit spreads and equity prices covering at least a 10 year time period including the stress period identified by the institution in accordance with Article 325bd(2). The calculation of default correlations between different issuers shall be calibrated to a one-year time horizon;\n\n\n(d)the internal default risk model shall be based on a one-year constant position assumption.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for default risk using an internal default risk model as referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a weekly basis.\n\n\n3.By way of derogation from points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the time horizon of one year by a time horizon of sixty days for the purpose of calculating the default risk of equity positions, in which case the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and default probabilities shall be consistent with a time horizon of sixty days and the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and bond prices shall be consistent with a time horizon of one year.\n\n\nArticle 325bp\nRecognition of hedges in an internal default risk model\n\n\n1.Institutions may incorporate hedges in their internal default risk model and they may net positions where the long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. \n\n\n2.Institutions may in their internal default risk model only recognise hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers by explicitly modelling the gross long and short positions in the different instruments, including modelling of basis risks between different issuers. \n\n\n3.Institutions shall capture in their internal default risk model material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge's maturity and the one year time horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in their instruments. Institutions shall recognise a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.\n\n\nArticle 325bq\nParticular requirements for an internal default risk model\n\n\n1.The internal default risk model referred to in Article 325bn(1) shall be capable of modelling the default of individual issuers as well as the simultaneous default of multiple issuers and take into account the impact of those defaults in the market values of the positions included in the scope of that model  . For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using at least two type of systematic risk factors and at least one idiosyncratic risk factor.\n\n\n2.The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependence between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n\n\n3.The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.\n\n\n4.The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.\n\n\n5.To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution\u2019s estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03%;\n\n\n(b)the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;\n\n\n(c)default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combinaison with current market prices, default data from a historical time period of at least five years;  default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices.\u00a0\n\n\n(d)an institution that has been granted the permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 shall use the methodology set out in Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 to calculate default probabilities;\n\n\n(e)an institution that has not been granted the permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities. In both situations, the estimates of default probabilities shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article. \n\n\n6.To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution\u2019s estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements :\n\n\n(a)the loss given default estimates are floored at 0%;\n\n\n(b)the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;\n\n\n(c)an institution that has been granted the permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 shall use the methodology set out in Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 to calculate loss given default estimates;\n\n\n(d)an institution that has not been granted the permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1, Chapter 3, Title II, Part 3 shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities. In both situations, the estimates of loss given default shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article. \n\n\n7. As part of the independent review and validation of their internal models used for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk measurement system, institutions shall do all of the following:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0verify that their modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of thesystematic risk factors of the model;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Those tests shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.\n\n\n8.The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions.\n\n\n9.The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.\n\n\n10.Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default correlation assumptions between different issuers in accordance with Article 325bo(2). \n\n\n\n\n11.Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation and other modelling assumptions are transparent for the competent authorities.\n\n\n12.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that have to be fulfilled by an institution's internal methodology or external sources for estimating default probabilities and loss given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [15 months after the entry into force of this Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\".\n\n\n(85)In Title IV of Part Three, the Title of Chapter 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Chapter 2\nOwn funds requirements for position risks under the simplified standardised approach\".\n\n\n(86)In Title IV of Part Three, the Title of Chapter 3 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Chapter 3\n Own funds requirements for foreign-exchange risk under the simplified standardised approach\".\n\n\n(87)In Title IV of Part Three, the Title of Chapter 4 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Chapter 4\nOwn funds requirements for commodity risks under the simplified standardised approach\".\n\n\n(88)In Title IV of Part Three, the Title of Chapter 5 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Chapter 5\nOwn funds requirements using the simplified internal models approach\".\n\n\n(89)The introductory part in Article 384(1) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\" 1. An institution which does not calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk for its counterparties in accordance with Article 383 shall calculate a portfolio own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty in accordance with the following formula, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386:\"\n\n\n(90)The definition of EADitotal in Article 384(1) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\" EADitotal = the total counterparty credit risk exposure value of counterparty 'i' (summed across its netting sets) including the effect of collateral in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of Title II, Chapter 6 as applicable to the calculation of the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk for that counterparty.\"\n\n\n(91)Article 390 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"Article 390\nCalculation of the exposure value\n\n\n1.The exposures to a group of connected clients shall be calculated by adding the exposures to individual clients in that group.\n\n\n2.The overall exposures to individual clients shall be calculated by adding the exposures of the trading book and those of the

Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 5, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.\". \n\n\n(d)paragraph 7 is deleted.\n\n\n(13)Article 419 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"2. Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:\n\n\n(a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;\n\n\n(b) for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and provided that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place;\n\n\n(c) where there is a deficit of Level 1 assets, additional Level 2A assets may be held by the institution and any cap applicable to those assets in accordance with Article 17 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 may be amended.\".\n\n\n(b)paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"5. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the derogations referred to in paragraph 2, including the conditions of their application.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [six months after the entry into force of the amending Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\".\n\n\n(14)Article 422 is amended as follows:\n\n\n\n\n(a)paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"4. Clearing, custody, cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 shall only cover those services to the extent that those services are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. Those services shall not merely consist of correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and institutions shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.\n\n\nPending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria to identify an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day horizon without compromising its operational functioning and shall report those criteria to the competent authorities. Competent authorities may, in the absence of a uniform definition, provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.\".\n\n\n(b)paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"8. Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage on a case-by-case basis, to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7, when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(a)the counterparty is:\n\n\n(I)a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution;\n\n\n(II)linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC;\n\n\n(III)an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7);\n\n\n(IV)the central institution or a member of a network compliant with Article 400 (2)(d);\n\n\n(b)there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market- wide stress scenario;\n\n\n(c)a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Article 425;\n\n\n(d)the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.\".\n\n\n(15)In Article 423, paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"2. An institution shall notify to the competent authorities all contracts entered into of which the contractual conditions lead, within 30 days following a material deterioration of its credit quality, to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs. Where the competent authorities consider those contracts material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts which shall correspond to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in its credit quality, such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.\n\n\n3. The institution shall add an additional outflow which shall correspond to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on its derivatives transactions if material.\n\n\nEBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying under which conditions the notion of materiality may be applied and specifying methods for the measurement of the additional outflow.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by [six months after the entry into force of the amending Regulation].\n\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\".\n\n\n(16)In Article 424, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\"4. The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 % to the extent that the committed amount exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and that the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.\".\n\n\n(17)In Article 425(2), point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"(c) loans with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow, provided that the contract allows the institution to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;\".\n\n\n(18)In Part Six, the following new Title IV is inserted after Article 428 :\n\n\n\"TITLE IV\nTHE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe net stable funding ratio\n\n\nArticle 428a\nApplication on a consolidated basis\n\n\nWhere the net stable funding ratio set out in this Title applies on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(4), the following shall apply:\n\n\n(a)required stable funding factors in a subsidiary having its head office situated in a third country which are subject to higher percentages than those specified in Chapter 4 of this Title under the national law of that third country setting out the net stable funding requirement shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the higher rates specified in the national law of that third country;\n\n\n(b)available stable funding factors in a subsidiary having its head office situated in a third country which are subject to lower percentages than those specified in Chapter 3 of this Title under the national law of that third country setting out the net stable funding requirement shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the lower rates specified in the national law of that third country; \n\n\n(c)third country assets which meet the requirements laid down in Title II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and which are held by a subsidiary having its head office situated in a third country shall not be recognized as liquid assets for consolidated purposes where they do not qualify as liquid assets under the national law of that third country setting out the liquidity coverage requirement;\n\n\n(d)investment firms other than systemic investment firms within the group shall be subject to Article 428b on a consolidated basis and to Article 413 for both individual and consolidated purposes. Except than as specified in this point, investment firms other than systemic investment firms shall remain subject to the detailed net stable funding requirement for investment firms as laid down in the national law of Member States.\n\n\nArticle 428b\nThe net stable funding ratio\n\n\n1.The detailed net stable funding requirement laid down in Article 413(1) shall be equal to the ratio of an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 of this Title to the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4 of this Title over a one year period and shall be expressed as a percentage. Institutions shall calculate their net stable funding ratio in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\n2.Institutions shall maintain a net stable funding ratio of at least 100%. \n\n\n3.Where at any time the net stable funding ratio of an institution has fallen or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100%, the requirement laid down in Article 414 shall apply. The institution shall aim at restoring its net stable funding ratio to the level referred to in paragraph 2. Competent authorities shall assess the reasons for non-compliance with the level referred to in paragraph 2 before taking, where appropriate, any supervisory measures.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall calculate and monitor their net stable funding ratio in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination, and separately for their transactions denominated in each of the currencies subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).  \n\n\n5.Institutions shall ensure that the currency denomination of their liabilities is consistent with the distribution by currency of their assets. Where appropriate, competent authorities may require institutions to restrict currency mismatch by setting limits on the proportion of required stable funding in a particular currency that can be met by available stable funding that is not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2). \n\n\nIn determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatch that may be applied in accordance with this Article, competent authorities shall at least consider:\n\n\n\n\n(a)whether the institution has the ability to transfer available stable funding from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group and to swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets during the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio; \n\n\n(b)the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign currency exchange hedges in place.\n\n\nAny restriction on currency mismatch imposed in accordance with this Article shall constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\nGeneral rules of calculation of the net stable funding ratio\n\n\nArticle 428c\nCalculation of the net stable funding ratio\n\n\n1.Unless specified otherwise in this Title, institutions shall take into account assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items on a gross basis.\n\n\n2.For the purpose of calculating their net stable funding ratio, institutions shall apply the appropriate stable funding factors set out in Chapters 3 and 4 of this Title to the accounting value of their assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, unless specified otherwise in this Title. \n\n\n3.Institutions shall not count double required stable funding and available stable funding.\n\n\nArticle 428d\nDerivatives contracts\n\n\n1.Institutions shall apply the provisions of this Article to calculate the amount of required stable funding for derivatives contracts as referred to in Chapter 4 of this Title.\n\n\n2.By way of derogation from Article 428c(1), institutions shall take into account the accounting value of derivative positions on a net basis where those positions are included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Articles 295, 296 and 297. Where that is not the case, institutions shall take into account the accounting value of derivative positions on a gross basis and they shall treat those derivatives positions as their own netting set for the purpose of Chapter 4 of this Title.\n\n\n3.For the purpose of this Title, the 'market value of a netting set' means the sum of the market values of all the transactions included in a netting set.\n\n\n4.All derivative contracts referred to in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 2 of Annex II that involve a full exchange of principal amounts on the same date shall be calculated on a net basis across currencies, including for the purpose of reporting in a currency that is subject to a separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2), even where those transactions are not included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Articles 295, 296 and 297.\n\n\n5.Cash received as collateral to mitigate the exposure of a derivative position shall be treated as such and shall not be treated as deposits to which Chapter 3 of this Title applies.\n\n\n6.Competent authorities may decide, with the approval of the relevant central bank, to waive the impact of derivatives contracts on the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, including through the determination of required stable funding factors and of provisions and losses, where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(a)those contracts have a residual maturity of less than six months; \n\n\n(b)the counterparty is the ECB or the central bank of a Member State; \n\n\n(c)the derivatives contracts serve the monetary policy of the ECB or the central bank of a Member State. \n\n\nWhere a subsidiary having its head office in a third country benefits from the waiver referred to in the first subparagraph under the national law of that third country which sets out the net stable funding requirement, that waiver as specified in the national law of the third country shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes. The subsidiary in a third country shall otherwise not benefit from this waiver.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 428e\nNetting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 428c(1), assets and liabilities resulting from secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(2) and (3) with a single counterparty shall be calculated on a net basis, provided that those assets and liabilities respect the netting conditions set out in Article 429b(4). \n\n\nArticle 428f\nInterdependent assets and liabilities\n\n\n1.Subject to prior approval of competent authorities, an institution may consider that an asset and a liability are interdependent, provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: \n\n\n(a)the institution acts solely as a pass-through unit to channel the funding from the liability into the corresponding interdependent asset;\n\n\n(b)the individual interdependent assets and liabilities are clearly identifiable and have the same principal amount;\n\n\n(c)the asset and interdependent liability have substantially matched maturities with a maximum delay of 20 days between the maturity of the asset and the maturity of the liability; \n\n\n(d)the interdependent liability is requested pursuant to a legal, regulatory or contractual commitment and is not used to fund other assets;\n\n\n(e) the principal payment flows from the asset are not used for other purposes than repaying the interdependent liability; \n\n\n(f)the counterparties for each pair of interdependent assets and liabilities are not the same.\n\n\n2.Assets and liabilities directly linked to the following products or services shall be considered to meet the conditions of paragraph 1 and be considered as interdependent :\n\n\n(a)centralised regulated savings, where institutions are legally required to transfer regulated deposits to a centralised fund which is set up and controlled by the central government of a Member State and which provides loans to promote public interest objectives, provided that the transfer of deposits to the centralised fund occurs on at least a monthly basis;\n\n\n(b)promotional loans and credit and liquidity facilities that fulfil the criteria set out in Article 31(9) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 for institutions acting as simple intermediaries that do not support any funding risk;\n\n\n(c)covered bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC;\n\n\n(d) covered bonds that meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5), as appropriate, where the underlying loans are fully matched funded with the covered bonds issued or where there exists non-discretionary extendable maturity triggers on the covered bonds of one year or more until the term of the underlying loans in the event of refinancing failure at the maturity date of the covered bond ; \n\n\n(e)derivatives client clearing activities, provided that the institution does not guarantee the performance of the CCP to its clients and, as a result, does not incur any funding risk.\n\n\nArticle 428g\nDeposits in institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks\n\n\nWhere an institution belongs to an institutional protection scheme of the type referred to in Article 113(7), to a network that is eligible for the waiver provided for in Article 10 or to a cooperative network in a Member State, the sight deposits that the institution maintains with the central institution and that are considered as liquid assets for the depositing institution in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to the following requirements:\n\n\n(a)the appropriate required stable funding factor to be applied under Section 2 of Chapter 4 of this Title for the depositing institution, depending on the treatment of those sight deposits as Level 1, Level 2A or Level 2B assets in accordance with Article 16 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and on the relevant haircut applied to those sight deposits for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio;\n\n\n(b)a symmetric available stable funding factor for the central institution receiving the deposit.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 428h\nPreferential treatment within a group or an institutional protection scheme\n\n\n1.By way of derogation from Article 428g and from Chapters 3 and 4 of this Title, competent authorities may on a case-by-case basis authorise institutions to apply a higher available stable funding factor or a lower required stable funding factor to assets, liabilities and committed credit or liquidity facilities where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(a)the counterparty is one of the following:\n\n\n(I)the parent or a subsidiary of the institution;\n\n\n(II)another subsidiary of the same parent; \n\n\n(III)linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC; \n\n\n(IV)a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation as the institution;\n\n\n(V)the central institution or an affiliate of a network or a cooperative group as referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation; \n\n\n(b)there are reasons to expect that the liability or committed credit or liquidity facility received constitutes a more stable source of funding or that the asset or committed credit or liquidity facility granted requires less stable funding within the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio than the same liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility with other counterparties;\n\n\n(c)the counterparty applies a higher required stable funding factor symmetric to the higher available stable funding factor or a lower available stable funding factor symmetric to the lower required stable funding factor;\n\n\n(d)the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State. \n\n\n2.Where the institution and the counterparty are established in different Member States, competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 1 where, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, the following criteria are fulfilled: \n\n\n(a)there are legally binding agreements and commitments between group entities regarding the liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility;\n\n\n(b)the funding provider presents a low funding risk profile;\n\n\n(c)the funding risk profile of the funding receiver has been adequately taken into account in the liquidity risk management of the funding provider.\n\n\nThe competent authorities shall consult each other in accordance with point (b) of Article 20(1) to determine whether the additional criteria set out in this paragraph are met.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\nAvailable stable funding\n\n\nSECTION 1\nGeneral provisions\n\n\nArticle 428i\nCalculation of the amount of available stable funding\n\n\nUnless specified otherwise in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and regulatory capital by the appropriate available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and regulatory capital.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 428j\nResidual maturity of a liability or regulatory capital\n\n\n1.Unless specified otherwise in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and regulatory capital to determine the appropriate available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall take into account existing options to determine the residual maturity of a liability or of regulatory capital. They shall do so on the assumption that investors will redeem a call option at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution\u2019s ability not to exercise the option, considering in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.\n\n\n3.To determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter, institutions shall treat any portion of liabilities having a residual maturity of one year or more that matures in less than six months or between six months and less than one year as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.\n\n\nSection 2\nAvailable stable funding factors\n\n\nArticle 428k\n0% available stable funding factor\n\n\n1.Unless otherwise specified in Articles 428l to 428o, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0% available stable funding factor with the exception of the following:\n\n\n(a)deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;\n\n\n(b)minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument.\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and minority interests shall be subject to one of the following factors:\n\n\n(I)0%, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than six months;\n\n\n(II)50%, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is of minimum six months and less than one year;\n\n\n(III)100%, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more.\n\n\n2.The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0% available stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transactions or that have failed to, but are still expected to, settle;\n\n\n(b)liabilities that are categorised as interdependent with assets in accordance with Article 428f; \n\n\n(c)liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by:\n\n\n(I)the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n\n\n(II)the central bank of a third country;\n\n\n(III)financial customers;\n\n\n\n\n(d)any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in Articles 428l to 428o.\n\n\n3.Institutions shall apply a 0% available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of market values across all netting sets with positive market value and the sum of market values across all netting sets with negative market value calculated in accordance with Article 428d of this Regulation.\n\n\nThe following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n\n\n(a)variation margins received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the market value of a netting set with positive market value where the collateral received as variation margins qualifies as Level 1 assets under Title II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds referred to in point (f) of Article 10(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, and that institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse; \n\n\n(b)all variation margin posted by institutions to their counterparties shall be deducted from the market value of a netting set with negative market value.\n\n\nArticle 428l\n50% available stable funding factor\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 428k, the following liabilities shall be subject to a 50% available stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)deposits received that fulfil the criteria for operational deposits set out in Article 27 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61;\n\n\n(b)liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:\n\n\n(I)the central government of a Member State or a third country;\n\n\n(II)regional governments or local authorities of a Member State or a third country;\n\n\n(III)public sector entities in a Member State or a third country;\n\n\n(IV)multilateral development banks referred to in Article 117(2) and international organisations referred to in Article 118;\n\n\n(V)credit institutions as referred to in point (e) of Article 10(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61;\n\n\n(VI)non-financial corporate customers;\n\n\n(VII)credit unions authorised by a competent authority, personal investment companies and clients that are deposit brokers to the extent that those liabilities do not fall under point (a);\n\n\n(c)liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of minimum six months and less than one year provided by:\n\n\n(I)the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n\n\n(II)the central bank of a third country;\n\n\n(III)financial customers;\n\n\n\n\n(d)any other liabilities with a residual maturity of minimum six months and less than one year not referred to in Articles 428m to 428o.\n\n\nArticle 428m\n90% available stable funding factor\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 428k, sight retail deposits and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the criteria set out in Article 25 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 90% available stable funding factor. \n\n\nArticle 428n\n95% available stable funding factor\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 428k, sight retail deposits and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year  that fulfil the criteria set out in Article 24 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 95% available stable funding factor.\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 428o\n100% available stable funding factor\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 428k, the following liabilities and capital items and instruments shall be subject to a 100% available stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)the Common Equity Tier 1 items of the institution before the adjustments required pursuant to Articles 32 to 35, the deductions pursuant to Article 36 and the application of the exemptions and alternatives laid down in Articles 48, 49 and 79;\n\n\n(b)the Additional Tier 1 items of the institution before the deduction of the items referred to in Article 56 and before Article 79 has been applied thereto;\n\n\n(c)the Tier 2 items of the institution before the deductions referred to in Article 66 and before the application of Article 79, having a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the expected maturity to less than one year;\n\n\n(d)any other capital instruments of the institution with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the expected maturity to less than one year;\n\n\n(e)any other secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities with a residual maturity of one year or more, including term deposits, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428k to 428n.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \nRequired stable funding\n\n\nSECTION 1\nGeneral provisions\n\n\nArticle 428p\nCalculation of the amount of required stable funding\n\n\n1.Unless specified otherwise in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance sheet items by the appropriate required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance sheet items.\n\n\n2.Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(2) and (3), that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding. \n\n\n3.Assets that institutions have lent, including in secured lending transactions and capital market driven transactions, that remain on their balance sheet and over which they retain beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to appropriate required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter. Otherwise, these assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.\n\n\n4.The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered: \n\n\n(a)assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution. Those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme. Institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in Chapter 2 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer; \n\n\n\n\n(b)assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of; \n\n\n(c)assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance.\n\n\n5.Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margins posted in accordance with point (b) of Articles 428k(3) and 428ag(3) or as initial margins posted or as contributions to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428af from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double-counting.\n\n\n6.Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions in the institutions' balance sheet and that these transactions will be reflected in the institutions' balance sheet when settled. \n\n\n7.Competent authorities may determine required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding within the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall in particular take into account material reputational damage for the institution that could result from not providing that funding. \n\n\nCompetent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance sheet exposures for which they have determined required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.\n\n\nArticle 428q\nResidual maturity of an asset\n\n\n1.Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance sheet transactions when determining the appropriate required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance sheet items under Section 2 of this Chapter.\n\n\n2.For assets that are encumbered, the maturity used to determine the appropriate required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter shall be either the residual maturity of the asset or  the maturity of the transaction being the source of encumbrance, whichever is the longest. An asset that has less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factor to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter to the same asset held unencumbered.\n\n\n3.Where an institution re-uses or re-pledges an asset that was borrowed, including in secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(2) and (3), and that is accounted for off balance sheet, the residual maturity of the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed and which is used to determine the required stable funding factor to be applied under Section 2 of this Chapter, shall be the residual maturity of the transaction through which the asset is re-used or re-pledged.\n\n\n4.Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with their underlying exposure. Institutions shall however subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution can freely dispose or exchange such assets and the term of the liabilities to the institutions\u2019 customers that generate this segregation requirement. \n\n\n5.When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer will exercise any option to extend maturity. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution\u2019s ability not to exercise the option, in particular considering markets\u2019 and clients\u2019 expectations that the institution should extend certain assets at their maturity date.\n\n\n6.For amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portion that matures in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively to determine the appropriate required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.\n\n\nSECTION 2\nRequired Stable Funding Factors\n\n\nArticle 428r\n0% required stable funding factor\n\n\n1.The following assets shall be subject to a 0% required stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)unencumbered assets eligible as Level 1 high quality liquid assets in accordance with Article 10 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds referred to in point (f) of Article 10(1) of that Delegated Regulation , regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements as set out in Article 8 of that Delegated Regulation ;\n\n\n(b)unencumbered shares or units in CIUs eligible for a 0% haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with point (a) of Article 15(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation  respectively; \n\n\n(c)all central bank reserves, held in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;\n\n\n(d)all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or of a third country with a residual maturity of less than six months;\n\n\n\n\n(e)trade date receivables arising from sales of financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction or that have failed to, but are still expected to, settle; \n\n\n(f)assets that are categorised as interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f.\n\n\n2.By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, considering in particular the extent to which reserve requirements exist on a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.\n\n\nFor subsidiaries having their head office situated in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the national law of that third country setting out the net stable funding requirement, this higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes. \n\n\nArticle 428s\n5% required stable funding factor\n\n\nThe following assets and off-balance sheet items shall be subject to a 5% required stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)unencumbered shares or units in CIUs eligible for a 5% haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with point (b) of Article 15(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation ;\n\n\n(b)assets that have a residual maturity of less than six months resulting from secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(2) and (3) with financial customers, where those assets are collateralised by assets that qualify as Level 1 assets under Title II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds referred to in point (f) of Article 10(1) of that Delegated Regulation , and where the institution would be legally entitled and operationally able to reuse those assets for the life of the transaction, regardless of whether the collateral has already been reused. Institutions shall take those assets into account on a net basis where Article 428e(1) of this Regulation applies;\n\n\n(c)the undrawn portion of irrevocable and conditionally revocable committed credit and liquidity facilities as they referred to in Article 31(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61;\n\n\n(d)trade finance off-balance sheet related products as referred to in Article 111(1) of this Regulation with a residual maturity of less than six months.\n\n\nArticle 428t\n7% required stable funding factor\n\n\nUnencumbered assets eligible as Level 1 extremely high quality covered bonds in accordance with point (f) of Article 10(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 7% required stable funding factor, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation .\n\n\nArticle 428u\n10% required stable funding factor\n\n\n1.The following assets and off-balance sheet items shall be subject to a 10% required stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)assets that have a residual maturity of less than six months resulting from secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(2) and (3) with financial customers, other than those referred to in point (b) of Article 428s. Those assets shall be taken into account on a net basis where Article 428e(1) applies;\n\n\n(b)assets that have a residual maturity of less than six months resulting from transactions with financial customers other than those referred to in point (b) of Article 428s and in point (a) of this Article;\n\n\n(c)trade finance on-balance sheet related products with a residual maturity of less than six months;\n\n\n(d)trade finance off-balance sheet related products as referred to in Article 111(1) with a residual maturity of minimum six months and less than one year.\n\n\n2.For all netting sets of derivative contracts that are not subject to margin agreements under which institutions post variation margins to their counterparties, institutions shall apply a 10% required stable funding factor to the absolute market value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative market value. \n\n\nArticle 428v\n12% required stable funding factor\n\n\n\n\nUnencumbered shares or units in CIUs eligible for a 12% haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with point (c) of Article 15(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 12% required stable funding factor, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 428w\n15% required stable funding factor\n\n\nThe following assets and off-balance sheet items shall be subject to a 15% required stable funding factor:\n\n\n(a)unencumbered assets eligible as Level 2A assets in accordance Article 11 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation;\n\n\n(b)trade finance off-balance sheet related products as referred to in Article 111(1)with a residual maturity of one year or more.\n\n\nArticle 428x\n20% required stable funding factor\n\n\n1.Unencumbered shares or units in CIUs eligible for a 20% haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with point (d) of Article 15(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 20% required stable funding factor, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation.\n\n\n2.For all netting sets of derivative contracts subject to margin agreements under which institutions post variation margins to their counterparties, institutions shall apply a 20% required stable funding factor to the absolute market value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative market value.\n\n\n3.An institution may replace the stable funding requirement set out in paragraph 2 for all netting sets of derivative contracts subject to margin agreements under which an institution posts variation margins to its counterparty with the amount of required stable funding calculated as the absolute amount of the difference between:\n\n\n(a)for all netting sets with negative market value, gross of collateral posted, and which are subject to a margin agreement under which the institution posts variation margin to its counterparty, the sum of all the risk category Addon(a) calculated in accordance with Article 278(1);\n\n\n(b)for all netting sets with positive market value, gross of collateral received, and which are subject to a margin agreement under which the institution receives variation margin from its counterparty, the sum of all the risk category Addon(a) calculated in accordance with Article 278(1).\n\n\nFor the purpose of this calculation and in order to determine the risk position of derivative contracts included in the netting sets referred to in the first sub-paragraph, institutions shall replace the maturity factor calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article 279c(1) by either the maturity factor calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 279c(1) or by the value of 1.\n\n\n4.Institutions that use the methods set out in Sections 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to determine the exposure value of their derivative contracts shall not apply the stable funding requirement set out in paragraph 2 of this Article to netting sets of derivative contracts subject to margin agreements under which institutions post variation margins to their counterparties and where those netting sets have a negative market value.\n\n\nArticle 428y\n25% required stable funding factor\n\n\nUnencumbered Level 2B securitisations referred to in point (a) of Article 13(14) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall be subject to a 25% required stable funding factor, regardless of their compliance with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in Articles 8 and 17 of that Delegated Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 428z\n30% required stable funding factor\n\n\nThe following assets shall be subject to a 30% required stable funding

institution guarantees the performance of its client\u2019s trade exposures to the CCP arising from that transaction, the institution shall calculate its exposure resulting from the guarantee in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 4, as if that institution had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin.\n\n\nThe treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall also apply to an institution acting as a higher-level client that guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph and of the second subparagraph, institutions may consider an affiliated entity as a client only where that entity is outside the scope of regulatory consolidation at the level at which the requirement set out in Article 92(3)(d) is applied.\n\n\n6.For the purposes of paragraph 4(e) of this Article and Article 429g, 'regular-way

weight applies to the guaranteed part of the exposure in accordance with Article 114(4) or Article 116(4);\n\n\n\n\n(g)where the institution is a clearing member of a QCCP , the trade exposures of  that institution, provided that they are cleared with that QCCP and meet the conditions laid down in point (c) of Article 306(1).\n\n\n(h)where the institution is a higher-level client within a multi-level client structure, the trade exposures to the clearing member or to an entity that serves as a higher-level client to that institution, provided that the conditions laid down in Article 305(2) are met and provided that the institution is not obligated to reimburse its client for any losses suffered in the event of default of either the clearing member or the QCCP.\n\n\n(i)fiduciary assets which meet all of the following conditions:\n\n\n(I)they are recognised on the institution's balance sheet by national generally accepted accounting principles, in accordance with Article 10 of

risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce exposure values of assets;\n\n\n(c)assets shall not be netted with liabilities;\n\n\n(d)SFTs shall not be netted.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, a cash pooling arrangement offered by an institution does not violate the condition set out in that point only where the arrangement meets both of the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)the institution offering the cash pooling arrangement transfers the credit and debit balances of several individual accounts of a group of entities included in the arrangement ('original accounts') into a separate, single account and thereby sets the balances of the original accounts to zero;\n\n\n(b)the institution carries out the actions referred to in point (a) of this paragraph on a daily basis.\n\n\n3.By way of derogation from paragraph 2, a cash pooling arrangement that does not meet the condition laid down in point (b) of that paragraph, but meets the condition laid down in point (a) of that paragraph, does not violate the condition laid down in point (c) of paragraph 1, provided that the arrangement meets all of the following additional conditions:\n\n\n(a)the institution has a legally enforceable right to set-off the balances of the original accounts through the transfer into a single account at any point in time;\n\n\n(b)there are no maturity mismatches between the balances of the original accounts;\n\n\n(c)the institution charges or pays interest based on the combined balance of the original accounts;\n\n\n(d)the competent authority of the institution considers that the frequency by which the balances of all original accounts are transferred is adequate for the purpose of including only the combined balance of the cash pooling arrangement in the leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\n\n4.By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate the exposure value of cash receivable and cash payable under an SFT with the same counterparty on a net basis only where all the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;\n\n\n(b)the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in all of the following situations:\n\n\n(I)in the normal course of business;\n\n\n(II)in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy;\n\n\n(c)the counterparties intend to settle on a net basis, to settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement. \n\n\n\n\n5.For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 4, institutions may conclude that a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement only where, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement and all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)the transactions are settled through the same settlement system;\n\n\n(b)the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that the settlement of the transactions will occur by the end of the business day;\n\n\n(c)any issues arising from the securities legs of the SFTs do not interfere with the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.\n\n\nThe condition in point (c) of the first subparagraph is met only where the failure of any SFT in the settlement mechanism may delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or may create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.\n\n\nWhere there is a failure of the securities leg of an SFT in the settlement mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement mechanism, institutions shall split out this transaction and its matching cash leg from the netting set and treat them on a gross basis.\n\n\n6.For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, 'cash pooling arrangement' means an arrangement whereby the credit or debit balances of several individual accounts are combined for the purpose of cash or liquidity management.\n\n\nArticle 429c \nCalculation of the exposure value of derivatives\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 3. \n\n\nWhen determining the exposure value institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Institutions shall not take into account cross-product netting, but may net within the product category as referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives when they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement as referred to in point (c) of Article 295.\n\n\nInstitutions shall include in the exposure measure sold options even where their exposure value can be set to zero in accordance with the treatment laid down in Article 274(5).\n\n\n2.Where the provision of collateral related to derivatives contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction.\n\n\n3.For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions calculating the replacement cost of derivative contracts in accordance with Article 275 may recognise only collateral received in cash from their counterparties as the variation margin referred to in Article 275, where the applicable accounting framework has not already recognised the variation margin as a reduction of the exposure value and where all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated;\n\n\n(b)the variation margin is calculated and exchanged at least daily based on a mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions; \n\n\n(c)the variation margin received is in a currency specified in the derivative contract, governing master netting agreement, credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement or as defined by any netting agreement with a QCCP;\n\n\n(d)the variation margin received is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative contract subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts that are applicable to the counterparty;\n\n\n(e)the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, where an institution provides cash collateral to a counterparty and that collateral meets the conditions laid down in points (a) to (e) of that subparagraph, the institution shall consider that collateral as the variation margin posted to the counterparty and shall include it in the calculation of replacement cost.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution shall be considered to have met the condition therein where the variation margin is exchanged on the morning of the trading day following the trading day on which the derivative contract was stipulated, provided that the exchange is based on the value of the contract at the end of the trading day on which the contract was stipulated.\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, where a margin dispute arises, institutions may recognise the amount of non-disputed collateral that has been exchanged.\n\n\n4.For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall not include collateral received in the calculation of NICA as defined in point 12a of Article 272, except in the case of derivatives contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.\n\n\n5.For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall set the value of the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 278(1) to one, except in the case of derivatives contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.\n\n\n6.By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Section 4 or Section 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to determine the exposure value of contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II, but only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92.\n\n\nWhere institutions apply one of the methods referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall not reduce the exposure measure by the amount of margin they received.\n\n\nArticle 429d \n\nAdditional provisions on the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives\n\n\n1.In addition to the treatment laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.\n\n\nInstitutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.\n\n\n2.Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n(a)the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;\n\n\n(b)the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;\n\n\n(c)the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to specific wrong-way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);\n\n\n(d)where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution\u2019s Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;\n\n\n(e)the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client services structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of Article 429a, as applicable.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the PFE calculation in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the exposure measure.\n\n\n3.For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 2, 'material term' means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity.\n\n\n4.By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 2, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same.\n\n\n5.Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives  where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital.\n\n\n6.In case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 2 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.\n\n\n\n\n7.For the purposes of this Article, 'written credit derivative' means any financial instrument through which an institution effectively provides credit protection including credit default swaps, total return swaps and options where the institution has the obligation to provide credit protection under conditions specified in the options contract.\n\n\nArticle 429e \nCounterparty credit risk add-on for SFTs\n\n\n1.In addition to the calculation of the exposure value of SFTs, including those that are off-balance sheet in accordance with Article 429b(1), institutions shall include in the exposure measure an add-on for counterparty credit risk determined in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable.\n\n\n2.Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty which are not subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions laid down in Article 206 (Ei*) on a transaction-by-transaction basis in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\ni\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the index that denotes the transaction;\n\n\nEi\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty under transaction i;\n\n\nCi\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the fair value of cash or securities received from the counterparty under transaction i.\n\n\nInstitutions may set Ei* equal to zero where Ei is the cash lent to a counterparty and the associated cash receivable is not eligible for the netting treatment set out in Article 429b(4).\n\n\n3.Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions laid down in Article 206 (E\u00a1*) on an agreement-by-agreement basis in accordance with the following formula:\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\ni\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the index that denotes the netting agreement;\n\n\nEi\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty for the transactions subject to master netting agreement i;\n\n\nCi\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= the fair value of cash or securities received from the counterparty subject to master netting agreement i.\n\n\n4.For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the term counterparty includes also triparty agents that receive collateral in deposit and manage the collateral in the case of triparty transactions.\n\n\n5.By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 222, subject to a 20% floor for the applicable risk weight, to determine the add-on for SFTs including those that are off-balance sheet. Institutions may use this method only where they also use it for calculating the exposure value of those transactions for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements as set out in points (a) to (c) of Article 92(1).\n\n\n6.Where sale accounting is achieved for a repurchase transaction under the applicable accounting framework, the institution shall reverse all sales-related accounting entries.\n\n\n7.Where an institution acts as an agent between two parties in an SFT, including an off-balance sheet SFT, the following shall apply to the calculation of the institution's exposure measure:\n\n\n\n\n(a)where the institution provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the parties in the SFT and the indemnity or guarantee is limited to any difference between the value of the security or cash the party has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, the institution shall only include the add-on determined in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, in the exposure measure;\n\n\n(b)where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the exposure measure;\n\n\n(c)where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or the cash in the transaction to an amount greater than the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include in the exposure measure also the full amount of the security or the cash to which it is exposed;\n\n\n(d)where the institution acting as agent provides an indemnity or guarantee to both parties involved in an SFT, the institution shall calculate its exposure measure in accordance with points (a) to (c) separately for each party involved in the transaction.\n\n\nArticle 429f \nCalculation of the exposure value of off-balance sheet items\n\n\n1.Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, SFTs and positions defined in Article 429d, in accordance with Article 111(1).\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 166(9), where a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, institutions shall use the lower of the two conversion factors associated with the individual commitment.\n\n\n2.By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may reduce the credit exposure equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet item by the corresponding amount of specific credit risk adjustments. The calculation shall be subject to a floor of zero.\n\n\n3.By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions shall apply a conversion factor of 10% to low risk off-balance sheet items referred to in point (d) of Article 111(1).\n\n\nArticle 429g \nCalculation of the exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement\n\n\n1.Institutions shall treat cash related to regular-way sales and securities related to regular-way purchases which remain on the balance sheet until the settlement date as assets in accordance with point (a) of Article 429(4).\n\n\n2.Institutions that,  in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply trade date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall reverse out any offsetting between cash receivables for regular-way sales awaiting settlement and cash payables for regular-way purchase awaiting settlement allowed under that framework. After institutions have reversed out the accounting offsetting, they may offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where both the related regular-way sales and purchases are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.\n\n\n3.Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply settlement date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall include in the exposure measure the full nominal value of commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, institutions may offset the full nominal value of the commitments related to regular-way purchases by the full nominal value of cash receivables related to regular-way sales awaiting settlement only where both the regular-way purchases and sales are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.\n\n\nArticle 430 \nReporting requirement\n\n\n1.Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on the leverage ratio as set out in this Part. Reporting on the leverage ratio shall be submitted on an annual basis by small institutions as defined in Article 430a and, subject to paragraph 2, on an annual basis or more frequently by other institutions.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of the reporting requirement laid down in paragraph 1, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the uniform reporting templates, the instructions on how to use those templates, the frequency and dates of reporting and the IT solutions.\n\n\nThe reporting requirements specified in the draft implementing technical standards shall be proportionate, having regard to the institutions' size and complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities.\n\n\nEBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by [12 months after entry into force].\n\n\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\".\n\n\n\n\n(20)Part Eight is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"PART EIGHT \nDISCLOSURE BY INSTITUTIONS TITLE I \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\n\nArticle\u00a0430a\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Part and Articles 13, 99, 100, 394 and 430 the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n(1) ''large institution'' means an institution that meets any of the following conditions: \n\n\n(a)the institution has been identified as a global Systemically important institution ('G-SII') in accordance with Article 131(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/36/EU ;\n\n\n(b)the institution has been identified as other systemically important institution ('O-SII') in accordance with Article 131(1) and (3) of Directive 2013/36/EU;\n\n\n(c)the institution is, in the Member State where it is established, one of the three largest institutions by total value of assets; \n\n\n(d)the total value of the institution's assets on the basis of its consolidation situation is equal to or larger than EUR 30 billion;\n\n\n(e)the total value of the institution's assets is equal to or larger than EUR 5 billion and the ratio of its total assets relative to the GDP of the Member State where it is established is on average equal to or larger  than 20 % over the four-year period immediately preceding the current annual disclosure period.\n\n\n(2) \"large subsidiary\" means a subsidiary that qualifies as a large institution as defined in paragraph 1.\n\n\n(3) \"non-listed institution\" means an institution that has not issued securities that are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State, as defined in point (21) of article 4 (1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.   \n\n\n(4) \"small institution\" means an institution the value of the assets of which is on average equal to or less than EUR 1.5 billion over the four-year period immediately preceding the current annual disclosure period.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 431 \nDisclosure requirements and policies\n\n\n1.Institutions shall publicly disclose the information referred to in Titles II and III in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Title, subject to the exceptions referred to in Article 432. \n\n\n2.Institutions shall publicly disclose any permission for the instruments and methodologies referred to in Title III granted by the competent authorities under Part Three.\n\n\n3.The management body or senior management of institutions shall adopt formal policies to comply with the disclosure requirements laid down in this Part and put in place internal processes, systems and controls to verify that the institutions' disclosures are appropriate and in compliance with the requirements laid down in this Part. At least one member of the management body or senior management of institutions shall attest in writing that the relevant institution has made the disclosures required under this Part in accordance with the policies and internal processes, systems and controls referred to in this paragraph. The written attestation referred to in this paragraph shall be included in institutions' disclosures.   \n\n\nInstitutions shall also have policies in place to verify that their disclosures convey their risk profile comprehensively to market participants. Where institutions find that the disclosures required under this Part do not convey the risk profile comprehensively to market participants, they shall publicly disclose information in addition to the information required to be disclosed under this Part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, institutions shall only be required to disclose information that is material and not proprietary or confidential as referred to in Article 432.\n\n\n4.All quantitative disclosures shall be accompanied by a qualitative narrative and any other supplementary information that may be necessary in order for the users of that information to understand the quantitative disclosures, noting in particular any significant change in any given disclosure compared to the information contained in the previous disclosure.\n\n\n5. Institutions shall, if requested, explain their rating decisions to SMEs and other corporate applicants for loans, providing an explanation in writing when asked. The administrative costs of that explanation shall be proportionate to the size of the loan.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 432\nNon-material, proprietary or confidential information\n\n\n1.Institutions may omit one or more of the disclosures listed in Titles II and III where the information provided by those disclosures is not regarded as material, except for the disclosures laid down inArticle 435(2)(c), Article 437 and Article 450.\n\n\nInformation in disclosures shall be regarded as material where its omission or misstatement could change or influence the assessment or decision of a user of that information relying on it for the purpose of making economic decisions.\n\n\nEBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010, issue guidelines on how institutions have to apply materiality in relation to the disclosure requirements of Title II and III.\n\n\n2.Institutions may also omit one or more items of information referred to in Titles II and III where those items include information that is regarded as proprietary or confidential in accordance with this paragraph, except for the disclosures laid down in Articles 437 and 450.\n\n\nInformation shall be regarded as proprietary to institutions where disclosing it publicly would undermine their competitive position.
