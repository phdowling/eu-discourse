"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 5.7.2016\nCOM(2016) 442 final\n2016/0204(APP)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2018-2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nOn 15 February 2007, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 (the Regulation)\n1\n establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (the Agency). The Agency became operational on 1 March 2007.\n\n\nThe objective of the Agency is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and its Member States, when implementing Union law, with assistance and expertise relating to fundamental rights in order to support them when they take measures or formulate courses of action within their respective spheres of competence to fully respect fundamental rights. The tasks entrusted to the Agency are set-out in Article 4 of the Regulation and relate to the collection, analysis and dissemination of reliable and comparable information and data, to the development of methods and standards to improve comparability, objectivity and reliability of data at European level, and to the formulation of conclusions and opinions on specific thematic topics for the Union institutions and the Member States. The Agency also raises public awareness of fundamental rights and disseminates information about its work. The Agency carries out its tasks within the scope of Union law. In doing so the Agency refers to fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The Agency is not a legislative or a standard setting body. It is not authorised to deal with the legality of Union acts or with the fulfilment of Member States' obligations under Union law. Its work is instrumental in providing data, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues to support evidence-based policy making across the EU, thereby also contributing to the development of a culture of fundamental rights in the EU.\n\n\nAccording to Article 5 of the Regulation, the thematic areas of activity of the Agency shall be determined through a five-year Multiannual Framework. The Agency shall carry out its tasks within the thematic areas set out in that Framework. The Multiannual Framework is not a work programme. The Agency's work programmes are adopted each year by its Management Board within the thematic areas determined by the Multiannual Framework and after the Commission has delivered an opinion. Following requests from the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission under Article 4(1)(c) and (d) of the Regulation, the Agency can work outside these thematic areas, provided its financial and human resources so permit.\n\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to establish the Multiannual Framework for the Agency for the years 2018-2022, as required by Article 5 of the Regulation. The current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) expires at the end of 2017.\n\n\nThe Agency's five-year Multiannual Framework must be based on a number of elements laid down by Article 5 of the Regulation such as:\n\n\n(i) The Commission shall consult the Management Board when preparing its proposal;\n\n\n(ii) The Multiannual Framework must be in line with the Union's priorities, taking due account of the orientations resulting from the European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions in the field of fundamental rights;\n\n\n(iii) The Multiannual Framework must have due regard to the Agency's financial and human resources;\n\n\n(iv) The Multiannual Framework must include provisions with a view to ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights;\n\n\n(v) The Multiannual Framework must include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance among the thematic areas.\n\n\nThe Commission has also taken into account the following considerations when preparing this proposal:\n\n\n(i) The need to ensure that the Agency's work remains focused on key areas, taking into account its financial and human resources;\n\n\n(ii) The need to ensure continuity in the Agency's work, particularly given the importance of the delivery of relevant, objective, reliable and comparable data by the Agency over the years;\n\n\n(iii) The consultations carried out by the Agency and the Agency's internal and external evaluations.\n\n\nThemes proposed:\n\n\nBased on the above, the Commission proposes to follow the opinion of the Agency's Management Board suggesting to confirm the previous thematic areas whilst removing the exclusion of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adding a reference to police cooperation. In addition, within the theme related to Roma integration, social inclusion aspects would be strengthened. The thematic areas proposed for the Multiannual Framework of the Agency for the years 2018-2022 are therefore the following (alphabetical order):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access to justice and victims of crime;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0equality and non-discrimination;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information society and, in particular, respect for private life and protection of personal data;\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0judicial and police cooperation;\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0migration, borders, asylum and integration of refugees and migrants;\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0racism, xenophobia and related intolerance;\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights of the child;\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roma integration and social inclusion.\n\n\n\n \u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and with other Union policies\n\n\nThe current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) was established on 11 March 2013 by Council Decision No 252/2013/EU\n2\n. Article 2 of this Decision sets-out the following thematic areas:\n\n\na)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access to justice;\n\n\nb)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0victims of crime, including compensation to victims of crime;\n\n\nc)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information society and, in particular, respect for private life and protection of personal data;\n\n\nd)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roma integration;\n\n\ne)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0judicial cooperation, except in criminal matters;\n\n\nf)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights of the child;\n\n\ng)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation;\n\n\nh)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0immigration and integration of migrants, visa and border control and asylum;\n\n\ni)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0racism, xenophobia and related intolerance.\n\n\n\nThis proposal confirms the relevance for the next five year period of the thematic areas laid down for the Agency for 2013-2017. No theme is withdrawn. Confirming current themes will ensure continuity and consistency in the Agency's work. It will allow the Agency to pursue ongoing work and reiterate large scale studies in these areas, in order to improve comparability and identify trends. It will also enable the Agency to enhance the reliability, objectivity, relevance and comparability of the data collected and to be collected in these areas. It will allow the Agency to develop and refine its expertise in these domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 5(2)(c) requires the Multiannual Framework to be in line with the Union's priorities, taking due account of the orientations resulting from the European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions in the field of fundamental rights. The issues relating to fundamental rights raised by European Parliament resolutions\n3\n and Council conclusions\n4\n in the last years largely confirm the relevance of the themes proposed for the Multiannual Framework 2018-2022. They also point to the relevance of including police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.\n\n\nFurthermore, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance remains a central theme for the Agency's work under the proposal which is consistent with Article 5(2)b of the Regulation and with the need to support the Commission and the Member States with data and expertise pertaining to the implementation of Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law\n5\n.\n\n\nMoreover, the continued focus on equality and non-discrimination, the rights of the child, migration and asylum, the protection of personal data, access to justice, victim's rights and judicial cooperation will also further support the implementation of EU legislation and policies in other important areas of fundamental rights\n6\n. Roma integration also remains a strong priority and an area where the Agency still has much to deliver. Highlighting social inclusion in this respect, as proposed by the Agency's Management Board, is well in line with EU developments in this area\n7\n.\n\n\nFinally, pursuant to Article 5(2)e of the Regulation, the proposal includes provisions with a view to ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights\n8\n. The most relevant Union agencies and bodies in relation to this proposal are the European Asylum Support Office (EASO)\n9\n, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX)\n10\n, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE)\n11\n, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)\n12\n, European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)\n13\n, the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit (EUROJUST)\n14\n, the European Police Office (EUROPOL)\n15\n, the European Police College (CEPOL)\n16\n, the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (EUROFOUND)\n17\n and the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA)\n18\n.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the decision establishing the Multiannual Framework 2018-2022 is Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This was also the legal basis for the decision establishing the Multiannual Framework 2013-2017.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that for the first Multiannual Framework 2007-2012 the legal basis was Article 5(1) of the Agency's Regulation (Council Regulation No168/2007). However, this legal basis cannot be used anymore because it is a secondary legal basis within the meaning of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019s judgment in case C-133/06\n19\n. The legal basis for Multiannual Framework proposals should be a provision of the Treaty. In the absence of any other (more specific) provision, the legal basis should be that of the Agency's Regulation, which was adopted on the basis of Article 308 of the former Treaty of the European Community. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, an amended version of this article has now become Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Agency's Regulation provides that the Agency's Multiannual Framework shall be adopted every five years by the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament. This is therefore a recurring and compulsory EU initiative, allowing to confirm or update the thematic areas on which the Agency should focus its work for the next five year period.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal is proportionate as it follows the format and scope prescribed by the Regulation. There is no latitude for the Commission. It is to be noted also that the Agency was established to develop a body of relevant, objective, reliable and comparable information and data on fundamental rights issues at European level in order to fill the knowledge gap in the areas covered by the Multiannual Framework. There is currently no less burdensome way to collect and centralise comparable fundamental rights' relevant information from all Member States to support the development of evidenced based policies in the EU in the area of fundamental rights. This was confirmed by the Agency's external evaluation carried out in 2012\n20\n.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThere is no choice for the instrument to be used. Article 5 of the Regulation provides that the Multiannual Framework shall be established by the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.\n\n\nIn conformity with Article 352 TFEU which is the legal basis for the proposal, the Council shall adopt its decision, acting unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluation\n\n\n\nAs per Article 30(4) of the Regulation, an external evaluation was conducted in 2012\n21\n. It gave a favourable assessment in terms of adequacy of the Agency's assistance and expertise. A new external evaluation will be carried out in 2017 and will look at progress and achievements since the last evaluation. It will cover the way in which the Agency implemented its work programme, within the 2013-2017 Multiannual Framework (See also point 5 below for other monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements).\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultation and collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThe Regulation requires that the Commission consults the Agency's Management Board when preparing its proposal on the Multiannual Framework. The Commission asked the Agency's Management Board at its meeting of 19-20 May 2015 to prepare grounds for an opinion to be delivered to the Commission in early 2016. The opinion providing the Management Board's views for revising the current Multiannual Framework was delivered to the Commission on 1 March 2016\n22\n. The opinion is based on discussions during the Management Board's September 2015 meeting, a targeted stakeholders' consultation in September 2015, a stakeholders' meeting in November 2015, the opinion of the Agency's Scientific Committee and a mid-term review of the Agency's activities between 2013-2015\n23\n. The Commission also consulted the Agency's Management Board on its draft proposal at its meeting of 19-20 May 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mid-term review of the Agency's activities between 2013-2015 concluded to the relevance of the thematic objectives of the current Multiannual Framework and to the need to further develop the Agency's expertise and pool of data in these areas. This conclusion was informed in particular by stock taking reports assessing achievements for each thematic area and putting forward a preliminary analysis of the impact achieved in the different thematic areas.\n\n\nThe targeted stakeholders' consultation\n24\n was based on a questionnaire about the Multiannual Framework and its revision. 86% of all respondents found that the current Multiannual Framework themes were still relevant and should be kept in the Agency's new Multiannual Framework for 2018-2022. This was confirmed by the November 2015 stakeholders' meeting, the opinion of the Scientific Committee and by the Agency's Management Board's opinion delivered on 1 March 2016.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nArticle 5 of the Regulation prescribes that the thematic areas of activity of the Agency must be laid down in a five-year Multiannual Framework to be adopted by the Council acting on a proposal by the Commission. The current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) expires at the end of 2017. Making a proposal for a new Multiannual Framework is thus a compulsory, recurring task under the Regulation. It is not optional. Furthermore, the themes under the previous Multiannual Framework remain relevant. One of them is obligatorily fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, as prescribed by article 5 (2)b of the Regulation. There is therefore not much latitude on the themes either.\n\n\nThe Multiannual Framework does not entail any budgetary implications (see point 4).\n\n\nThe better regulation guidelines 'toolbox' makes clear that an impact assessment is only required when the expected economic, environmental or social impacts of EU action are likely to be significant, which is not the case for the Multiannual Framework. The 'toolbox' also indicates that an impact assessment is not necessary \"when there is little or no choice available for the Commission (for instance when the Commission is implementing previous policy decisions already subject to an impact assessment)\"\n25\n. This is the case for the Multiannual Framework as under the Regulation, which was subject to an impact assessment that covered the obligation for a Multiannual Framework, the Commission has no option but to make a proposal on a Multiannual Framework every five years.\n\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines' requirements, the absence of impact assessment and its justification was flagged in the roadmap for the proposal.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal does not have any direct implication for the EU budget. The Multiannual Framework sets the thematic frame in which the Agency must carry-out its tasks. The Agency will develop projects within the areas of its Multiannual Framework and within the human and financial resources in the Agency's annual budget as adopted by the budgetary authority. This will be detailed in the Agency's programming documents.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nPursuant to Article 12(6)a of the Regulation, the Agency's Management Board shall adopt the Agency's work programme in accordance with the Multiannual Framework and after the Commission and the Scientific Committee have delivered an opinion. This contributes to ensuring the consistency of the Agency's activities with the Multiannual Framework.\n\n\nFurthermore, the Agency draws-up a Strategic Plan for the period covered by the Multiannual Framework, setting out its objectives and expected results for each of the thematic areas. This serves as guidance for the preparation of the programming documents.\n\n\nThe Agency publishes an annual report on its activities pursuant to Article 4(1)g of the Regulation and regularly carries out internal evaluations of its work, based on the Multiannual Framework, the Strategic Plan and its programming documents. A mid-term review was conducted in November 2015 covering the period 2013-2015\n26\n. It was based on stock taking reports for each of the thematic areas covered by the Multiannual Framework and illustrated the main achievements. It also provided a preliminary impact analysis on the accomplishment of the \u2018Objectives\u2019 and \u2018Expected results\u2019 foreseen in the Agency's Strategic Plan 2013-2017\n27\n for each thematic area. This was discussed by the Management Board in its meeting of September 2015. The stock-taking exercise and mid-term review also contributed to the reflection on thematic areas for the Agency's Multiannual Framework 2018 \u2013 2022.\n\n\nMoreover, as mentioned in point 3, an external evaluation was conducted in 2012\n28\n. A new external evaluation will be carried out in 2017.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Access to justice and victims of crime: These areas are already thematic areas of focus for the Agency under the Multiannual Framework 2013-2017. They are closely related as they cover the pathway to effective justice for citizens. They can therefore be regrouped for the sake also of simplifying the Multiannual Framework. The Stockholm Programme has underlined the need for better access to justice in the EU and for improved support for those who fall victim of crime in the EU. In its Communication on an EU Justice Agenda for 2020\n29\n the Commission referred to the importance to facilitate access to justice on equal terms in the Member States and ensure swift, reliable and trustworthy remedy, including through \"out of court\" solutions. It also highlighted EU efforts to uphold the rights of victims of crime\n30\n and the respect of the right to an effective remedy. The European Council in its Conclusions of 27 June 2014 defining strategic guidelines for the area of freedom, security and justice underlined the need to further simplify access to justice, promote effective remedies and reinforce the protection of victims. A call was made to mobilise the expertise of the Agency in this context. The Agency has in the past years gradually developed its expertise in this area. It for instance published a report on Victims of crime in the EU\n31\n, a report on severe labour exploitation\n32\n and large scale surveys which include questions on respondents' experiences as victims of crime (European Union Minorities and Discrimination survey, survey on LGBT persons, survey on Jewish people's experiences and perceptions of antisemitism, violence against women surveys)\n33\n. The Agency has furthermore produced general reports on access to justice, including in specific settings (e.g. asylum seekers, data protection, children and in relation to the freedom to conduct a business), launched Clarity online guidance on where to turn to get remedy (to be included in e-justice before the end of 2016), and is currently working on a Handbook on Access to justice in Europe\n34\n. In order to enable the Agency to pursue its work in these areas and further develop its expertise and body of reliable and comparable data, these thematic areas should be confirmed in the Multiannual Framework for the period 2018-2022. This also came out clearly in the internal evaluations of the Agency and in the public consultation launched by the Agency in the autumn 2015, where an overwhelming majority of respondents indicated that these areas of focus should be maintained. Maintaining these areas of focus is supported by the Agency's Management Board.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equality and non-discrimination: It is expected that the Agency will continue to collect data on discrimination and equality. This was a central area for the Multiannual Framework 2013-2017 and it should remain so. To simplify the wording used in the previous Multiannual Framework, reference should be made to equality and non-discrimination in general and not enumerate the specific grounds of discrimination covered by Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is to be noted that gender issues should only be dealt with in close consultation and cooperation with EIGE which has as a specific mandate to collect data on gender equality and discrimination based on gender. The Agency has published a number of relevant reports on equality and non-discrimination over the last years (people with disabilities\n35\n, discrimination based on sexual orientation\n36\n, situation on Equality in the EU\n37\n). Its EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS II)\n38\n will be regularly reiterated in order to be able to identify trends. The Agency is furthermore playing a specific role within the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Continued work on equality and non-discrimination by the Agency will be important to raise awareness on issues on the ground and further support policy making in the area. This is supported also by the Agency's stakeholders as shown during the consultation process and by the Agency's Management Board.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information society and, in particular, respect for private life and protection of personal data: with the Digital Agenda for Europe\n39\n, the European Commission underlined the crucial role of ICT and particularly the internet as \u201ca vital medium of economic and societal activity: for doing business, working, playing, communicating and expressing ourselves freely.\u201d The Digital Single Market Strategy confirmed this approach. The Strategy pays particular attention to its impact on the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information. \n\n\nIt will be important to consolidate online trust and security and ensure access to a plurality of information, sources and views. This can be done by addressing fundamental rights issues in the cyberspace, in particular by strengthening policies to protect and enhance media freedom and pluralism, foster media literacy, foster privacy and personal data protection and combat cybercrime. Specific initiatives were taken by the EU, such as the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography\n40\n, the EU Cybercrime Strategy\n41\n, the development of the European Cybercrime Centre within Europol, the Directive addressing trafficking in human beings\n42\n and the new EU legislative framework for data protection\n43\n. Fundamental rights online are also an important element in Internet Governance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Agency has produced a number of studies in the area of data protection such as a Handbook on European data protection case law\n44\n, a study on remedy available to individuals in relation to surveillance practices\n45\n, and is currently working on a study on the fundamental rights implications of the use of biometric data\n46\n. It is important that the Agency reinforces its expertise and collects data on fundamental rights issues pertaining to the digital world \u2013 including media content \u2013 and the governance of the Internet and on problems on the ground pertaining to the implementation of EU law in this area. The Agency will closely work with other EU agencies and actors in these fields, such as the European Data Protection Supervisor, the European Data Protection Board, ENISA, eu-LISA and the Joint Research Service (JRC).\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judicial and police cooperation: In its Communication on an EU Justice Agenda for 2020\n47\n the Commission underlined the importance of enhancing mutual trust by building bridges between the different justice and administrative systems of the Member States. This applies to civil, commercial, administrative and criminal matters and implies fostering cooperation between judicial, administrative and law enforcement authorities and developing minimum standards across the EU. It is important that the Agency is able to support by its research and data initiatives aiming at reinforcing judicial cooperation. This thematic area should therefore remain in the 2018-2022 Multiannual Framework.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that judicial cooperation on criminal matters was excluded from the 2013-2017 Multiannual Framework by the Council. The Commission had however included this area in its 2011 proposal\n48\n. The European Parliament also strongly advocated the inclusion of criminal and police cooperation in the Agency's current Multiannual Framework and deeply regretted the lack of agreement in the Council in this regard\n49\n. Indeed, since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, judicial cooperation in criminal matters is part of the EU acquis and important EU initiatives have been taken in this area such as for example the creation of a European Prosecutors Office\n50\n and common standards for the protection of the rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal procedures\n51\n. The European Council in its Conclusions of 27 June 2014 defining strategic guidelines for the area of freedom, security and justice underlined amongst other things the need to continue efforts to strengthen the rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. A call was made to mobilise the expertise of the Agency in this context. Furthermore, end 2014 the transitional phase set out in the Lisbon Treaty for the area of justice came to an end. This lifted limitations to the judicial control by the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the Commission's role as Guardian of the Treaty over the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Data and information on the situation on the ground is thus important for the Commission to carry out its monitoring role. The Agency's work in the area of criminal justice already proved useful, on the basis of ad hoc studies made at Commission's request (on children in criminal proceedings\n52\n, transfer of prisoners\n53\n, right to interpretation, translation and information in criminal proceedings\n54\n). It should now be fully part of the thematic on judicial cooperation. This was strongly supported by the Agency's Management Board in its opinion and raised also in the external evaluation of the Agency carried out in 2012\n55\n.\n\n\nThis also applies to police cooperation which should be expressly mentioned in the 2018-2022 Multiannual Framework. The importance of strengthening police cooperation was already underlined by the European Council in its conclusions of 27 June 2014 and made all the more clear following the terrorist attacks that struck EU member States in 2015. The fundamental rights dimension is crucial in this respect. This was highlighted by the Commission in its communication on a European Agenda on Security\n56\n. Also in this domain the Agency provided valuable support on the basis of ad hoc requests from Commission services. For example, it developed \"Twelve operational fundamental rights considerations for law enforcement when processing Passenger Name Record (PNR) data\" in the context of assisting Member States in developing the appropriate fundamental rights standards when processing PNR data. Strengthened police cooperation is also needed in the light of the refugee crisis which brings about an increase in trafficking in human beings and smuggling of migrants. It is important that the Agency can support through reliable and comparable data and the collection of best practices, initiatives in areas such as for example fight against smuggling of migrants, organised crimes and terrorism.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Migration, borders, asylum and integration of refugees and migrants: Due to the sharp increase of the numbers of asylum seekers in the last years, migration has become a high priority for the Commission, as emphasized by President Juncker in his speech on the State of the Union on 9 September 2015 and as demonstrated by the adoption of the European Agenda on Migration in May 2015\n57\n and the numerous initiatives already taken by the Commission in this field or still to come. In this context and considering the increasing migratory flows towards the EU, the work carried out by the Agency is crucial in highlighting issues on the ground. The Agency should continue to work on the collection of data on this topic in close cooperation with other EU agencies, in particular EASO and FRONTEX. The Agency has already published a number of reports in the last years (e.g. \"return/transfer of children at risk who are EU nationals\", \"social inclusion and migrant participation in society\", \"alternative detention for asylum seekers and people in return procedures\", \"costs of exclusion from healthcare \u2013 the case of migrants in irregular situation\", \"fundamental rights at land borders: findings from selected European union border crossing points\", \"legal entry channels to the EU for persons in need of international protection: a toolbox\", \"fundamental rights at airports and land borders\", \"handbook on European law relating to asylum, borders and immigration\")\n58\n and took part in training activities on fundamental rights for border guards in cooperation with FRONTEX. It is also publishing regular data collection on the current migration situation in the EU\n59\n. As far as the integration of migrants (including refugees) is concerned, the Agency will conduct in 2016 and 2017 two major projects on migrants' integration. First, the second wave of the EU Minorities and Discrimination survey (EU-MIDIS II) which will enable to identify trends. Second, the collection of information on national and regional/local policies on social inclusion and migrant participation in society through the Agency's research network FRANET (SIMPS). This important work on discrimination towards migrants and on social inclusion will have to be continued beyond 2018. Stakeholders are largely supporting the Agency's continued work on migration issues. A call for the Agency to further work on these issues was also made by its Management Board.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Racism, xenophobia and related intolerance: this thematic area must be included in the Multiannual Framework as prescribed by Article 5 (2)b if the Regulation itself. Racism, xenophobia and other expressions of intolerance are on the rise in the EU, both on and off line. Growing challenges are brought on by the fight against terrorism and radicalisation and in the area of migration. The EU has availed itself of a common framework on combatting racism and xenophobia\n60\n which is being closely monitored by the Commission. The Commission's first Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights resulted in a list of actions to fight hate crime and hate speech and foster a culture of inclusive tolerance in the EU\n61\n. During the Colloquium the lack of reliable and comparable data on hate crime was underlined. It is therefore important that the Agency focusses its work in helping Member States to progress in this area, including by developing a common methodology to record hate crime. It should do so in cooperation with Eurostat. It will furthermore be important that the Agency regularly reiterates its large scale studies such as the one on antisemitism in order to identify trends, and develops a body of data on anti-Muslim hatred and a separate body of data on xenophobia in light of the migration context.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rights of the child: The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and is a priority for the EU. It was a major area of focus for the Agency's work under the Multiannual Framework 2013-2017. The Agency has published a wealth of research on rights of the child of relevance also to a number of other policy areas such as asylum and migration, social inclusion, justice, non-discrimination, racism and xenophobia, violence against children, child protection and child welfare\n62\n. The Commission organises an annual European Forum on the rights of the child \n63\n and has recently taken steps in the area of child protection systems\n64\n and children in migration\n65\n. Child-rights focused research and data is essential to support and inform EU and national initiatives. It is important that rights of the child remain an area of focus for the Agency for 2018-2022 in order to allow it to continue to collect data and track progress and trends over time on issues such as child-friendly justice and children in vulnerable situations, making operational the indicators on the rights of the child developed by the Agency. This was strongly supported by the Agency's Management Board.\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roma integration and social inclusion: Roma integration constitutes a clear priority for the EU. The \u2018EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020\u2019 requests the Agency to collect data across the Member States on the situation of Roma with respect to access to employment, education, healthcare and housing, as well as to work with Member States to develop monitoring methods which can provide a comparative analysis of the situation of Roma across Europe. The Agency has developed an expertise in the collection of data on Roma issues over the last years, as shown by its reports on the situation of Roma in 11 Member States, the situation of Roma EU citizens moving to and settling in other EU Member States and the EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey\n66\n. Keeping Roma as a key thematic priority was called for by stakeholders as shown by the results of the public consultation carried out by the Agency. It was also clearly supported by the Agency's Management Board. The Agency should therefore continue its efforts to provide data for all Member States, based also on the set of Roma integration indicators to be developed by the Agency in complementarity with the online reporting tool developed by the Commission. Social inclusion deserves strengthened focus in this context in light of the importance of the fight against poverty and social exclusion which is one the EU's five targets in the Europe 2020 growth strategy. The Agency's experience in collecting information on the social inclusion experience of Roma and other minorities and vulnerable groups (for example through surveys such as EU-MIDIS: the EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey or projects such as SIMPS: the collection of information on national and regional/local policies on social inclusion and migrant participation in society) could also be beneficial for future work of the Agency, such as for example in the context of the upcoming Fundamental Rights Survey or in light of EU priorities linked to the future European Pillar of Social Rights. Complementarity and synergies should be sought with the work of other actors such as EUROFUND or Eurostat, strengthening existing cooperation. It is to be noted that a reinforced focus on social inclusion in the Agency's Multiannual Framework was called for by stakeholders in the public consultation carried out by the Agency in 2015 and by the Agency's Management Board in its opinion on the next Multiannual Framework. It was also called for by the European Parliament\n67\n.\n\n\n\n2016/0204 (APP)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2018-2022\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 352 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n68\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In order for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (the Agency) to carry out its tasks properly, a Multiannual Framework is to be adopted by the Council every five years, determining the thematic areas of the Agency's work in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights\n69\n.\n\n\n\n\n(2)The first Multiannual Framework was adopted by the Council in Decision 2008/203/EC of 28 February 2008 implementing Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 as regards the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012\n70\n.
