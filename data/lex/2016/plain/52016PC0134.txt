They aim to control the catch that can be taken with a given amount of fishing effort and also to minimise the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem. They form an integral part of the regulatory framework of most fisheries management systems including within Union waters.\n\n\nTechnical measures can be grouped into:\n\n\n\u2013measures that regulate the operation of the gear;\n\n\n\u2013measures that regulate the design characteristics of the gears that are deployed;\n\n\n\u2013minimum sizes below which fish must be returned to the sea;\n\n\n\u2013measures that set spatial and temporal controls (e.g. closed/limited entry areas and seasonal closures) to protect aggregations of juvenile or spawning fish; and\n\n\n\u2013measures that mitigate the impacts of fishing gears on sensitive species (e.g. marine mammals, seabirds and turtles) or closed areas to protect sensitive habitats (e.g. coldwater coral reefs).\n\n\nThe history of technical measures applying in European fisheries legislation within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is one of numerous regulations, amendments, implementing rules and temporary technical measures introduced as stop-gaps to resolve emerging problems. Across all Union sea basins and non-Union waters in which Union vessels operate there are more than 30 regulations which contain technical measures. \n\n\nCurrently there are three detailed technical measures regulations enacted under the ordinary legislative procedure covering the main sea basins in Union waters \u2013 Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms covering the North-east Atlantic  (and the Black Sea since 2012); Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 of 21 December 2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1626/94; and Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98. \n\n\nIn addition to those regulations there are a number of Commission acts which contain detailed rules on the construction of gears (e.g. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3440/84 of 6 December 1984 on the attachment of devices to trawls, Danish seines and similar nets) or relating to specific area closures (e.g. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1922/1999 of 8 September 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards conditions under which vessels exceeding eight metres length overall shall be permitted to use beam trawls within certain waters of the Community) as well as technical measures introduced to alleviate immediate threats to conservation following from depletion of certain stocks (e.g. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2056/2001 of 19 October 2001 establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stocks of cod in the North Sea and to the west of Scotland). These regulations generally emanate from empowerments contained in the main regulations. \n\n\nThere are also a number of other standalone regulations which contain technical measures. These include Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26 April 2004 laying down measures concerning bycatches of cetaceans in fisheries and amending Regulation (EC) No 88/98 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 of 26 June 2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels. \n\n\nThere are several co-decided regulations that transpose technical measures agreed for third-country waters covered under Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) such as the Convention on Conservation on Antarctic Living Marine Resources (CCALMR) and the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) among others. These regulations are not covered under the scope of this proposal.\n\n\nBefore the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) technical measures were also included in Fishing Opportunities Regulations setting annual TACs and quotas in the Northeast Atlantic, Baltic, and the Black Sea as well as for deep-sea species. These were a mixture of supposedly temporary technical measures with a mixture of regionally specific measures and derogations from general provisions contained in other regulations. Following the adoption of the TFEU such measures could no longer be included in the Fishing Opportunities Regulations except for those measures with a direct functional link to the catch limits for a particular stock or stocks. Therefore only a limited number of such measures are now contained in the Fishing Opportunities Regulations. For example there is a closed area off the west coast of Ireland to protect Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) relating to the TAC for this species in this area. Measures emanating from other RFMOS such as Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) are also still included in the Fishing Opportunities Regulation for the North-east Atlantic as temporary measures.\n\n\nAs this illustrates the regulatory structure for technical measures has become highly complex and somewhat dis-jointed. A retrospective evaluation\n1\n carried out to support this proposal has shown that the current technical measures have largely not delivered on the objectives of the previous CFP \u2013 Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy. This is more evident in some sea basins than others (e.g. North-east Atlantic) but the general perception is one of multiple complex and ineffective rules contained in an inflexible governance structure. \n\n\nWith the new challenges of the new CFP\n2\n, which came into force on 1 January 2014, the retrospective evaluation concluded that the current regulatory structure for technical measures will continue to be sub-optimal. This is because of five identifiable problems:\n\n\n(1)Sub-optimal performance: Technical measures provide little incentive to fish selectively where there is no cost to discarding, or of catching sensitive species or impacting adversely on the seabed. This has resulted in a failure to control fishing pressure leading to overfishing of a number of stocks and to high levels of discards in some fisheries and limited protection afforded to sensitive habitats and species. Additionally some measures have created legal obstacles or discouraged innovation for the development of more selective fishing practices with the result that circumvention, both legally and illegally, to minimise the economic impacts of measures has been common. \n\n\n\n\n(2)Difficult to measure effectiveness: The current regulations do not contain any defined metrics on which to measure success. This has made it difficult to measure the effectiveness of technical measures in contributing to the achievement of the conservation objectives of the CFP. \n\n\n(3)Prescriptive and complex rules: Technical measures have become more numerous and complex over time and attempted to control too many technical aspects of fishing operations. Some are difficult for control authorities to enforce, and for fishermen to comply with. They impose high administrative burden and costs on Member States and stakeholders. This has undermined the catching sector's confidence and provided a strong incentive to negate the regulations resulting in the adoption of more legislation to counter negation of the rules. \n\n\n(4)Lack of flexibility: Technical measures are mostly decided following a complex, inflexible and lengthy politically-driven process which is not well suited to defining detailed technical rules that need frequent updating and periodic review. This has restricted the ability to adjust or revise technical measures to react to changes in fisheries or to take advantage of innovation in gear technology or to react to unexpected events. In addition temporary rules or derogations have remained in place unchanged for long periods further undermining the confidence of the catching sector.\n\n\n(5)Insufficient involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making process: Technical measures are based on negative, mostly coercive incentives in a hierarchical governance system (i.e. top-down rather than bottom-up). This has led to the perception by fishermen and stakeholders that they are not part of a participatory process. Fishermen perceive that technical measures are impractical, do not represent current fishing practice and are sometimes contradictory.\n\n\nDuring the negotiations of the new CFP there was a general consensus amongst Member States, stakeholders and the European Parliament confirming this rather negative perception of the current technical measures. This was despite the fact that no political agreement for a new package of measures had been reached in the last ten years, previous Commission proposals in 2002\n3\n and in 2008\n4\n having failed for a number of reasons. Member States argued that the text had grown too complicated and difficult to interpret and that those proposals did not address the underlying problems sufficiently. Stakeholders argued that they were not properly consulted and the rules went further than simple consolidations of existing measures. Even attempts to align the technical measures regulations in the Northeast Atlantic, Baltic and Mediterranean with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) have failed because negotiations have tended to move away from alignment to the detailed substance of these regulations.\n\n\nThese repeated failures to reach agreement on a new technical measures regulation clearly highlight the need for a new approach. This should be based on simplification, adaptation of decision-making to the Lisbon Treaty, strengthening the long-term approach to conservation and resource management including tackling the discards problem, regionalisation, further stakeholder involvement and more industry responsibility (i.e. a culture of compliance). \n\n\nIn addressing these problems and recognising these institutional difficulties this proposal aims to:\n\n\n\u2013Optimise the contribution of technical measures to achieving the key objectives of the new CFP.\n\n\n\u2013Create the flexibility required to adjust technical measures by facilitating regionalised approaches (consistent with the objectives in Union law).\n\n\n\u2013Simplify the current rules in line with the Commission's REFIT programme\n5\n.\n\n\nWhile this proposal principally changes the governance structure of technical measures rather than making wholesale changes to the measures themselves, the improved flexibility and incentives for fishing selectivity it introduces will deliver improvements in the effectiveness of technical measures. Over time yields will be optimised through the catching of larger fish and the impacts of fishing on the marine ecosystem will be reduced through the adoption of responsible fishing practices.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 204/585/EC\u00a0sets the general framework for the CFP. Technical measures sit within this framework as tools for contributing to the achievement of the overall objectives of the CFP as follows:\n\n\n(1)The attainment of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) will be facilitated by the application of technical measures which regulate exploitation pattern (i.e. how fishing pressure is distributed across the age profile of a stock). Obtaining MSY from a given stock will require that the exploitation pattern avoids fishing on younger age groups. To achieve this will require a combination of effective technical measures (i.e. measures that regulate the operation and design of the gear, minimum conservation reference sizes (mcrs) and spatial/temporal closures) that lead to improvements in exploitation patterns in an adaptive regulatory structure.\n\n\n(2)The gradual elimination of discards and minimisation of unwanted catches will require the application of technical (gear operation and design) as well as tactical changes (closed or restricted areas) to drive increased selectivity and avoidance of unwanted catches (i.e. fish below mcrs). The landing obligation introduced to achieve this objective will require a rethink on the current governance structure of technical measures to allow for more flexibility to achieve this goal. \n\n\n(3)Ensuring fishing activities are consistent with wider ecological considerations will depend on the application of technical measures that minimise the impacts of fishing gears on the ecosystem (e.g. mitigation measures or closed areas). Specifically technical measures must contribute to the attainment of good environmental status with respect to 4 out of the 11 descriptors included under Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive)- Maintaining biological diversity (Descriptor 1); Maintaining commercially-exploited populations of fish and shellfish within safe biological limits and with a healthy age and size distribution (Descriptor 3); Maintaining all elements of marine food webs at normal abundance and diversity (Descriptor 4); and Maintaining sea-floor integrity (Descriptor 6). The key challenge will be creating a framework for implementing such measures in such a way as they most effectively protect the species most at risk and sensitive habitats and areas in need of protection. \n\n\nIn addition to these objectives the new CFP promotes regionalisation as a new governance approach. Regionalisation provides an important opportunity to introduce simplification of the rules set by the legislator and particularly relevant for the future use of technical measures as management tools, since part of the problem of the effectiveness of the technical measures is related to the governance structure they operate in. Regionalisation will allow the development of technical measures at regional level (i.e. ultimately under the umbrella of multiannual plans or in the short-term through other Union measures). Regionalisation also gives scope to limit the need for detailed technical measures adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers under co-decision. Within a simplified legal framework defined by the legislator, measures can be regionally devised and tailor-made to the specificities of different fisheries. Regionalisation also provides an opportunity to utilise technical measures much more as a driver for the achievement of sustainable fisheries rather than simply as restrictive and coercive measures complementing fishing opportunities and effort restrictions. Regionalised decision-making also avoids having to make frequent changes to the substance of technical measures contained in co-decided acts. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal and its objectives are consistent with Union policy. In particular with legal obligations contained in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (Water Framework Directive). The full implementation of these Directives is part of the EU\u2019s response to its commitments under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and is reinforced by the commitment made by EU Heads of State \"to halt the loss of biodiversity [in the EU] by 2010\"; it is further reiterated in the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020\n6\n.\n\n\nTechnical measures have also the potential to contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy\n7\n, in particular its resource efficiency flagship initiative through better use of fish stocks. In addition, the reform of technical measures will contribute to the REFIT programme through the simplification and deletion of a number of existing regulations and specific measures.\n\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis is Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe provisions of this proposal relate to the conservation of marine biological resources that falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. Consequently the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is amending measures which already exist; therefore no concern on the proportionality principle arises. The proposed measures comply with the proportionality principle as they are appropriate and necessary. No other less restrictive measures are available to obtain the desired policy objectives.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. \n\n\nOther means would not be adequate for the following reason: Regulations must be amended by a Regulation.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nIn December 2012, an evaluation of technical measures was carried out. This consisted of a retrospective evaluation1 of the existing technical measures regulations in place in terms of their relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and acceptance. During the course of this evaluation extensive consultations were held with representatives of the fishing industry, national administrations and the research agencies of Member States. This was completed in June 2013. It was followed by a prospective evaluation1 of the likely economic, social and environmental impacts as well as the effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and acceptability of different defined policy options. This study was completed in July 2014.\n\n\nThe restrospective evaluation confirmed that the current technical measures are overly complex and have been largely ineffective. They do not have clear, well-defined objectives and targets nor do they provide positive incentives which reward responsible practices and incentivise compliance. Control of the measures is costly and the governance structure they operate in currently is inflexible and very much top-down with limited consultation with stakeholders. \n\n\nThe prospective evaluation concluded that results-based management may be the best approach for future technical measures if control and enforcement problems can be solved. In such an approach, there should be less of a need for multiple prescriptive technical measures regulations.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nAn internet-based public consultation was held from January to May 2014\n8\n. Detailed contributions\u00a0were\u00a0received from the key stakeholders ((i.e. Member States, the European Parliament, Advisory Councils, the catching sector and NGOs)\n9\n. The main conclusions, which largely concurred with the findings of the retrospective and prospective evaluation were as follows:\n\n\n(1)Any new technical measures regulation(s) should move away from micro-management towards a results-based management approach.\n\n\n(2)Fishermen should become more accountable for what they catch rather than the construction and operation of the fishing gears they deploy.\n\n\n(3)Simplification of the rules is a fundamental objective but simplification should not create inequalities in the management systems across Member States (\u201cmaintaining a level playing field\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n(4)Regionalisation is seen as an important opportunity to introduce simplification of technical measures regulations. \n\n\n(5)A framework approach is preferred. This should contain overarching objectives and minimum common standards to be applied across the EU. It should also contain safeguards to ensure action can be taken if problems in fisheries emerge.\n\n\n(6)Improvements in selectivity have been achieved in the past when incentive structures have been aligned with management objectives. Such structures need to be built-in to any new regulatory framework for technical measures.\n\n\nApart from the public consultation, numerous workshops, consultations and meetings were held during the period from 2011 to early 2015 with the key stakeholders. The combination of the public consultation and the extensive follow-up dialogue with the key stakeholders (i.e. the catching sector, NGOs and Member States) have ensured that the views expressed fully represent the different stakeholder groups.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThree meetings of an Expert Working Group (EWG) of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) were convened in October 2012\n10\n, March 2013\n11\n and March 2015\n12\n. These meetings explored the potential of technical measures as a management tool in the context of the CFP. The findings of these reports helped to define the options that were considered in the prospective evaluation carried out as well as providing information for the development of the proposal.\n\n\nIn addition to these meetings, several ad-hoc requests were made to STECF and also the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on specific issues relating to fishing gear selectivity; replacing mesh size and catch composition rules; bycatch of marine mammals and other protected species; and on existing closed and restricted areas. These also provided guidance in the drafting of the proposal. \n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nAn Impact Assessment (IA) has been conducted, taking account of the information from the public and follow-up targeted consultations, retrospective and prospective evaluations, expert advice, comments from the Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG) set up to support this initiative and the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). \n\n\nFor the IA, three policy options and one sub-option were considered against the baseline scenario as those most likely to achieve the objectives and address the problems identified.\n\n\n\u2013Baseline situation: The current regulations with the CFP as the central element remain in place, elaborated in a series of technical and other conservation regulations surrounding the CFP The baseline would take account of recent adjustments that remove legal contradictions with new obligations under the CFP (the landing obligation, and alignment with the TFEU concerning establishment of current Commission empowerments). Regionalisation of technical measures would take place through discard plans or multiannual plans, expanding the 'web' of regulations further and adding on new rules that derogate from or amend existing technical rules.\n\n\n\u2013Consolidation: A new regulation with a limited scope consolidating in one Regulation the common rules for all fisheries in all areas (e.g. generic prohibitions on certain fishing methods).\u00a0Common rules (under co-decision) would be separated from rules with potential for regionalisation. The latter technical rules would remain in place in the existing regulations (co-decision and Commission acts). Any recent amendments or changes to the regulations and alignment of the regulations with the TFEU would be included. Regionalisation of technical measures would be through discard plans adopted by the Commission as Delegated Acts, and through Delegated Acts adopted by the Commission on the basis of the new, co-decided multiannual plans. These Delegated Acts would introduce (temporary) derogations from and amendments to the existing rules. Regionalisation would happen if and where the Member States submit joint recommendations for discard plans on a temporary basis for a maximum duration of 3 years. After that period, maintaining these derogations in place would require the adoption of Delegated Acts that are adopted by virtue of an empowerment in an EU multiannual plan.\n\n\n\u2013Framework Approach: A new framework Regulation containing a) general provisions (scope, objectives, guiding principles) and definition of the expected results and corresponding standards; b) common rules and technical provisions (as in option 1); and c) baseline standards (by region) corresponding to identified results which would function as default measures in the context of regionalisation. The baseline standards would be based on the substance of the existing rules and would principally replace the current mesh size and catch composition rules, convert the current minimum sizes into minimum conservation reference sizes, maintain closures needed to protect aggregations of juveniles and spawning fish as well as any other regionally specific technical rules. The structure would be recast (one single regulation instead of the numerous regulations in place). Many existing regulations would be repealed and integrated and/or rationalized in the new framework. The baselines and default technical measures that correspond to these objectives would be applicable unless and until regionalised measures are designed and introduced into Union law (through Delegated Acts). Where no regionalised action is developed, the baselines would continue to function as default rules. Member States would have options to move further away from more rigid technical rules (the default measures) towards a more flexible, results-based management approach under regionalisation to meet the projected results and objectives of a plan. \n\n\n\u2013Framework without baselines: The main elements of the framework would be maintained except for the baseline measures. An empowerment would be included for the development of specific measures under regionalisation. This empowerment would allow for the establishment of measures required regionally to meet the objective of the CFP through Delegated Acts as part of the discard and multiannual plans. \n\n\n\u2013Elimination of the existing rules: Most of the existing technical measures regulations would be repealed immediately, with an exception for essential nature conservation measures which would remain in place. Any technical measures necessary in the longer term would be developed regionally under multiannual plans (with the possibility of temporarily incorporating technical measures into discard plans in the short term). There would be no framework regulation under this option.\n\n\nComparison of options\n\n\nThe framework approach with baseline standards was evaluated to best meet the objectives set and provide a level of security that conservation objectives will continue to be met while regionalisation develops. In the longer-term (at the latest by 2022) it aims to have any technical measures required included under regional plans. It is best geared to managing this transition to regionalisation in the period up to 2022. \n\n\nThe framework without baselines and the elimination of technical measures would bring about simplification of technical measures immediately which would find favour with the catching sector but are both riskier options. They represent a drastic change in governance implying a shift in the burden of proof to all fishermen (and Member States). They would rely on fishermen documenting and demonstrating transparently that they are meeting the general objectives and agreed results (under the CFP) and the specific objectives and results identified in multiannual plans. They rely on immediate behavioural change of fishermen and on peer-pressure and self-regulation to ensure unselective fishing practices do not prevail. Member States, some sections of the catching sector and NGOs seem reluctant to move in this direction at least in the short-term.\n\n\nConsolidation of technical measures was the least favoured option. It essentially maintains the current complex regulatory structure in place and does not provide any clear incentives for stakeholders over and above the baseline scenario. It is also not fully coherent with the spirit of regionalisation as envisaged under the CFP.\n\n\nSummary of Impacts\n\n\n\n\nThe preferred option largely presents changes to the regulatory structure and governance of technical measures. Few new measures are introduced and any changes to the substance are very much about deletion of rules in order to simplify and lessen administrative burden, improve controllability or consolidate nature conservation measures. Therefore the analysis of impacts in the IA was based on a qualitative assessment supported with specific examples or case studies. The main impacts are as follows:\n\n\nEconomic\n\n\nThe economic impacts of the framework approach would be positive. The framework approach would drive regionalisation. The increased flexibility and greater stakeholder participation in developing technical measures afforded by regionalisation should incentivise the adoption of selective gears more rapidly than other policy options. This will help to deliver MSY and reductions in unwanted catches with corresponding benefits in economic terms from increased fishing opportunities. This would steadily improve over time, particularly if selective fishing is rewarded by Member States with increased fishing opportunities allowed for under the CFP.\n\n\nSocial\n\n\nEmployment in the catching sector is likely to reduce in the short-term as the catching sector adjusts to the challenges of moving to MSY and the landing obligation. However, assuming that regionalisation is accelerated and the most concerned fleet segments notably those targeting mixed demersal species would strive to improve selectivity quickly, any negative impacts would be counteracted more quickly. Employment levels would stabilise. In the longer-term once sustainable fishing is achieved, fishing opportunities will increase (by at least 20% by 2020). Such significant increase has the potential to create new jobs in the catching sector. Fishing sustainably will lead to increase income and wages and therefore job attractiveness. \n\n\nEnvironmental\n\n\nAny negative, short-term impacts are likely to be negated quicker than under the other options considered. The framework would manage the transition to regionalisation and, through the inclusion of baseline standards and retention of existing technical measures that are still necessary, ensure that the environmental sustainability objectives of the CFP are not jeopardised. In the longer-term regionalisation should lead to the development of measures within an adaptive governance framework that will be more responsive and anticipatory to threats to marine ecosystems and allow the taking of protective measures expediently.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nSimplification\n\n\nSimplification of the existing regulations is a primary objective of this proposal. The new framework will replace 6 co-decided regulations by one regulation with 3 other Regulations being partially repealed or amended. It also will lead to the repealing of up to 10 supporting Commission Regulations. Certain elements of these regulations will be brought under the framework proposal pending regionalisation. This allows for a second level of simplification in two main areas. Firstly almost half of the 40 existing closed or restricted areas relating to the protection of juveniles and spawning aggregations are deleted or simplified. This is based on advice from STECF, taking account of comments received by Member States and stakeholders. The second area of simplification is in the complex mesh size and catch composition tables in the existing regulations for the northeast Atlantic and Baltic. In each region these have been simplified into a default baseline mesh size for towed and static gears based on existing exploitation patterns with several derogations allowing the use of smaller mesh size gears to maintain important fisheries.\n\n\nSMEs\n\n\nThe catching sector comprising around 82,000 vessels and employing 98,500 Full-time equivalents (FTE) is the most affected by potential changes to the technical measures regulations.\u00a0Of these approximate 82,000 fishing vessels, almost 98% of them would be classified as micro-enterprises employing fewer than 10 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed \u20ac2 million. With such a high proportion of the sector being micro-enterprises exempting them from this proposal would undermine the conservation objectives of the CFP as few fishing enterprises would be governed by the general rules.\n\n\nThe impacts on SMEs in terms of administrative costs and burden would be positive in that there would be immediate simplification of the current regulations and a greater role for the catching sector through the Advisory Councils in the development of technical measures going forward. In addition the potential move to a results-based system in the longer-term would lead to further simplification of the technical rules. This implies a shift in the burden of proof onto the catching sector and put onus on them to demonstrate and document catches accurately. Potentially this may increase costs associated with documentation of catches although the costs incurred would depend on the approach of the Member States to \u201cregionalised control\u201d and offset against the greater flexibility such an approach would afford. \n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThis proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure. \n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\n\n\nUnder the preferred option clear targets would be established for the reduction and as far as possible elimination of unwanted catches by 2019 and fishing at MSY for all stocks by 2020. Targets for the reduction of the negative impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems would also be established to contribute to the achievement of good environmental status by 2020. In order to measure achievement of these targets the following environmental, economic, social and compliance indicators for monitoring technical measures are proposed:\n\n\nEnvironmental: evolution of catch profiles, number of stocks at MSY and evolution of bycatches of sensitive species and protection of sensitive habitats \n\n\nEconomic: income, Gross Value Added (GVA), revenue/breakeven revenue and net profit margins\n\n\nSocial: employment and crew wages\n\n\nCompliance: number of infringements related to technical rules and at-sea patrol days.\n\n\nData for monitoring would be available under the existing Data Collection Framework (DCF)\n13\n, from advice from the STECF and ICES as well as from annual reports from the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).\n\n\nEvaluation\n\n\nAn ex-post evaluation discussing the key evaluation questions of technical measures should be carried out before 2022 when the landing obligation should be fully operational, MSY achieved for all stocks and good environmental status achieved for marine ecosystems. This evaluation would directly feed into the retrospective evaluation of the CFP scheduled to begin in 2022.\n\n\nThe new multiannual plans will periodically be assessed by STECF and ICES to measure whether sustainability objectives are being achieved. These evaluations will provide indications of whether technical measures included as part of these plans are effective.\n\n\nReporting requirements under Articles 49 (functioning of the CFP) and Article 50 (progress on achieving MSY) of the CFP, while not directly related to technical measures, will also provide insight into the effectiveness of technical measures.\n\n\nMeasures developed regionally will also have to be evaluated on a regular basis by STECF or ICES to ensure such measures are consistent with objectives of the CFP.\n\n\nAnnual Reports of the EFCA in relation to Joint Deployment Programmes (JDPs) document the number and reasons for infringements detected compared to the number and nature of inspections carried out. These provide an indication of the level of compliance with the technical measures regulations.\n\n\nReporting\n\n\nBy the end of 2020 and every third year thereafter, the Commission will report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Regulation including an assessment of the impact of technical measures on the conservation of fisheries resources and on the environmental impacts of fisheries on marine ecosystems. On the basis of that report, the Commission will propose any necessary amendments.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal has the following structure:\n\n\nGeneral Provisions \u2013 contains the scope, overarching and specific objectives, targets linked to the general and specific objectives expressed in terms of levels of unwanted catches; thresholds for bycatches of sensitive species; and reduction in the extent of the seabed significantly affected by fishing; principles of good governance and definitions. The definitions relate primarily to the definition of fishing gears and fishing operations and are common to all regions. They consolidate and update the existing definitions contained in the existing Regulations.\n\n\nCommon Technical Measures \u2013 contains common rules currently contained in all of the primary technical measures regulations but applicable to all sea basins and considered as de facto permanent as there is no need or justification for changing them. The provisions included under this part are \n\n\n\n\n\u2013prohibited gears and practices including prohibition on the sale of marine species caught using certain gear types, \n\n\n\u2013measures to protect sensitive species (e.g. marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds) and habitats (e.g. coldwater corals) including those listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives;\n\n\n\u2013general restrictions on the use of towed gears and conditions for their use (covers basic codend construction and permissible attachments to fishing gears);\n\n\n\u2013restrictions on the use of static nets. This includes the consolidation of the existing restrictions on the use of driftnets (i.e. prohibition to use drift nets above 2.5km, prohibition on using such gears to target highly migratory species and the total prohibition on the use of driftnets in the Baltic). Under regionalisation Member States should strengthen these provisions up to and including the introduction of a total prohibition on the use of such gears where there is scientific evidence that shows the continued use of driftnets constitutes a threat to the conservation status of sensitive species in that region;\n\n\n\u2013minimum conservation reference sizes (definition, measurement, use of fish below mcrs);\n\n\n\u2013common measures to reduce discarding (highgrading, slipping, protection for species not under catch limits).\n\n\nRegionalisation \u2013 sets the general principles for regionalisation with reference to baseline measures which will apply where no regional measures are in places and establishes the empowerments needed for regionalisation of technical measures through multiannual plans, temporary discard plans and conservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under environmental legislation. The empowerments allow the development of regional measures based on joint recommendations submitted by regional groups of Member States that amend/derogate from the existing baseline measures, establish new measures or derogate measures provided that it can be demonstrated such measures have no conservation benefit or that alternative measures have been put in place. These empowerments emanate from the CFP. The regional measures that can be taken under temporary discard plans are also defined, as well as safeguards that will be taken if scientific evidence shows that the conservation objectives are not being met by the regional measures. To this effect, a safeguard clause is included that allows the Commission to act where available scientific advice indicates that immediate action is required to protect marine species. This allows the Commission to establish technical measures to alleviate such threats, in addition to or by way of derogation to this Regulation or technical measures otherwise fixed in accordance with Union law. Such measures could include restrictions on the use fishing gears or on fishing activities in certain areas or during certain periods.\n\n\nTechnical Measures in non-Union waters: contains an empowerment for the Commission to adopt delegated acts in respect of existing detailed rules concerning lists of vulnerable marine ecosystems and also specific technical measures related to defined fisheries for blue ling and redfish agreed by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). It further allows, through amendment of the corresponding Regulation, the Commission to adopt delegated acts in respect of existing technical measures in Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011\n14\n on the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM). It also allows the Commission to incorporate into Union law future amendments of those measures adopted by NEAFC and also measures adopted by the GFCM. Currently no such empowerments exist.\n\n\nTechnical Provisions - contains common provisions for conducting scientific research and also for the artificial restocking and transplantation of marine species.\n\n\nProcedural Provisions - contains the exercise of delegation with respect to the delegated acts contained in the proposal and also the committee procedure in respect of implementing acts.\n\n\nFinal Provisions \u2013 contains the repeals and amendments to the relevant regulations as well as the review and reporting process.\n\n\nAnnexes \u2013 The Annexes contain baseline measures by sea basin (i.e. North Sea, Baltic, Northwestern waters, Southwestern waters, Mediterranean, Black Sea and the outermost regions). These baseline measures will apply in the absence of measures being put in place regionally. They include baseline mesh sizes, minimum conservation reference sizes, closed or restricted areas to protect juveniles and spawning fish and any other regionally specific measures. There are also annexes containing a list of prohibited species that if caught as bycatches must be returned immediately to the sea; closed areas established for the protection of sensitive habitats and a list of species that are prohibited for capture with driftnets.\n\n\n2016/0074 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the conservation of fishery resources and the protection of marine ecosystems through technical measures, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1967/2006, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1224/2009 and Regulations (EU) No 1343/2011 and (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 894/97, (EC) No 850/98, (EC) No 2549/2000, (EC) No 254/2002, (EC) No 812/2004 and (EC) No 2187/2005 \n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n15\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n16\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n establishes a Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.\n\n\n(2)Technical measures are tools to support the implementation of the CFP. However, a retrospective evaluation has shown that their current regulatory structure is unlikely to deliver on the objectives of the CFP and a new approach should be taken to increase their effectiveness focusing on adapting the governance structure. \n\n\n(3)There is a need to develop a framework for the regulation of technical measures. That framework should establish general rules to apply across all Union waters and provide for the creation of technical measures that take account of the regional specificities of fisheries through the process of regionalisation introduced by the CFP.\n\n\n(4)The framework should cover the taking and landing of fisheries resources as well as the operation of fishing gears and the interaction of fishing activities with marine ecosystems. \n\n\n(5)It should apply to fishing operations conducted in Union waters by Union and non-Union vessels and nationals of Member States (without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State) as well as to Union vessels operating in the outermost regions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 349 of the Treaty. It should also apply in non-Union waters to technical measures adopted for the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) Regulatory area and in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Agreement area.\n\n\n(6)Technical measures where relevant should apply to recreational fisheries which can have a significant impact on the stocks of fish and shellfish species.\n\n\n(7)Technical measures should contribute to achieving the CFP objectives to fish at maximum sustainable yield levels, reduce unwanted catches and eliminate discards and to contribute to the achievement of good environmental status (GES) as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n. \n\n\n(8)Technical measures should specifically provide protection for juveniles and spawning aggregations of fish through the use of selective fishing gears and avoidance measures. Technical measures should also minimise and eliminate where possible, the impacts of fishing gears on the marine ecosystem and in particular on sensitive species and habitats. They should also contribute to having in place management measures for the purposes of complying with obligations under Council Directive 92/43/EEC\n19\n, Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \n20\n and Directive 2008/56/EC.\n\n\n(9)To evaluate the effectiveness of technical measures, targets relating to the levels of unwanted catches; to the level of bycatches of sensitive species and to the extent of seabed habitats adversely affected by fishing; should be established that reflect the objectives of the CFP, Union environmental legislation (in particular Council Directive 92/43 and Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n), and international best practice. \n\n\n(10)In order to ensure uniformity in the understanding and implementation of technical rules, definitions of fishing gears and operations contained in existing technical measures regulations should be updated and consolidated.\n\n\n(11)Certain destructive fishing gears or methods which use explosives, poisons, stupefying substances, electric current, pneumatic hammers or other percussive instruments; towed devices and grabs for harvesting red coral or other type of corals and coral-like species and certain spear-guns should be prohibited except in the specific case of the electric pulse trawl which may be used under certain strict conditions.\n\n\n(12)In light of advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), certain common rules defining restrictions on the use of towed gears and on the construction of codends should be established to prevent bad practice that leads to unselective fishing.\n\n\n(13)In order to restrict the use of driftnets which can fish over large areas and result in significant catches of sensitive species the existing restrictions on using such gears should be consolidated.\n\n\n(14)In light of advice from STECF, fishing with static nets in ICES divisions IIIa, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIIc, VIIj and VIIk and ICES sub-areas VIII, IX, X and XII east of 27\u00b0 W in waters with a charted depth of more  than 600 metres should continue to be prohibited to provide protection for sensitive deep-sea species. \n\n\n(15)For certain rare fish species, such as species of sharks and rays, even limited fishing activity could result in a serious risk to their conservation. To protect such species a general prohibition on fishing for them should be introduced. \n\n\n(16)To afford the strict protection for sensitive marine species such as marine mammals, seabirds and marine reptiles provided for in Directives 92/43/EEC and 2009/147/EC, Member States should put in place mitigation measures to minimise and where possible eliminate the catches of those species from fishing gears.\n\n\n\n\n(17)In order to provide continued protection for sensitive marine habitats located off the coasts of Ireland, the United Kingdom and around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands existing restrictions on the use of demersal fishing gears should be maintained.\n\n\n(18)Where scientific advice and technical information identifies other such areas, then similar restrictions should be introduced to protect these habitats.\n\n\n(19)In accordance with the CFP, minimum conservation reference sizes should be established to ensure the protection of juveniles of marine species and in establishing fish stock recovery areas. \n\n\n(20)The manner in which the size of marine species is to be measured should be defined.\n\n\n(21)In order to assist the catching sector implement the landing obligation, Member States should put in place measures to facilitate the storage and the finding of outlets for marine species which are below the minimum conservation reference size. These measures should include support for investment in the construction and adaptation of landing sites and shelters or support for investment to add value to fishery products.\n\n\n(22)The practises of highgrading and slipping should be prohibited except in cases where exemptions are introduced under the landing obligation.\n\n\n(23)In cases where scientific advice indicates that there are significant unwanted catches of species which are not subject to catch limits and therefore not subject to the application of the landing obligation, Member States should carry out pilot projects with the aim of exploring ways to reduce such catches and with a view to introducing appropriate technical measures to achieve this aim.\n\n\n(24)Where no technical measures are in place at regional level then defined baseline standards should apply. Those baseline standards should be derived from existing technical measures, taking account of STECF advice and the opinions of stakeholders. They should consist of baseline mesh sizes for towed gears and static nets, minimum conservation reference sizes, closed or restricted areas, nature conservation measures to mitigate against bycatches of marine mammals and seabirds in certain areas and any other regionally specific measures currently in existence that are still required to ensure conservation objectives continue to be met until such times measures are put in place under regionalisation.\n\n\n(25)Member States in conjunction with stakeholders can develop joint recommendations for appropriate technical measures that deviate from the baselines in accordance with the regionalisation process set out in the CFP. \n\n\n(26)Such regional technical measures should as a minimum be equivalent in terms of exploitation patterns and protection for sensitive species and habitats as the baseline standards.\n\n\n(27)The main instrument for establishing regional technical measures should be through multiannual plans as defined in the CFP. Under such multiannual plans the baseline standards may be amended, new measures established to supplement or replace the baseline standards or derogate from these measures where it can be demonstrated they have no conservation benefit or that alternative measures have been put in place that ensure the objectives and targets continue to be met. In accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, multiannual plans may also contain other nature conservation measures to minimise the negative impact of fishing on the ecosystem, such as the ones necessary for the purpose of complying with the obligations under Article 13(4) of Directive 2008/56/EC, Article 4 of Directive 2009/147/EC or Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC.\n\n\n(28)In developing joint recommendations to adopt alternative size and species selective gears to the baseline mesh sizes in multiannual plans regional groups of Member States should ensure that such gears result in, as a minimum, similar or improved  selectivity patterns as the baseline gears.\n\n\n(29)In developing joint recommendations to amend or establish new closed or restricted areas in multiannual plans to protect juveniles and spawning aggregations, regional groups of Member States should define the specifications, extent, duration, gear restrictions and control and monitoring arrangements in their joint recommendations.\n\n\n(30)In developing joint recommendations to amend or establish minimum conservation reference sizes in multiannual plans, regional groups of Member States should ensure the objectives of the CFP are not jeopardised by ensuring that the protection of juveniles of marine species should be respected while ensuring that no distortion is introduced into the market and that no market for fish below minimum conservation reference sizes is created.\n\n\n(31)The creation of real-time closures in conjunction with moving-on provisions as an additional measure for the protection of juveniles or spawning aggregations should be allowed as an option to be developed under joint recommendations. The conditions for the establishment and lifting of such areas as well as the control and monitoring arrangements should be defined in the relevant joint recommendations.\n\n\n(32)On the basis of scientific assessment of the impacts of innovative gears, duly evaluated by the STECF, the use of such or extension to the use of novel gears, such as the electric pulse trawl could be included as an option in joint recommendations from regional groups of Member States. The use of innovative fishing gears should not be permitted where scientific assessment indicates that their use will lead to negative impacts on sensitive habitats and non-target species.\n\n\n(33)In order to minimise the bycatches of sensitive species and impacts of fishing gears on sensitive habitats, regional groups of Member States should develop additional mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of fishing on sensitive species and habitats. Where scientific evidence shows that there is a serious threat to the conservation status of such species and habitats then Member States should introduce additional restrictions on the construction and operation of certain fishing gears or even the introduction of a total prohibition on their use in that region. In particular such provisions could be applied to the use of driftnets which in certain areas has resulted in significant catches of cetaceans and seabirds.\n\n\n(34)Where no multiannual plan is in place Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 allows for the establishment of temporary discard plans for the implementation of the landing obligation. As part of such plans it should be allowed to establish technical measures which are strictly linked to the implementation of the landing obligation and which aim to increase selectivity and reduce unwanted catches as much as possible.\n\n\n(35)In order to maintain existing detailed recommendations agreed by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of lists of vulnerable marine ecosystems and also specific technical measures related to defined measures to protect blue ling and redfish. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the incorporation into Union law of future amendments of those measures adopted by NEAFC which form the subject matter of certain expressly defined non-essential elements of this Regulation and which become binding upon the Union in accordance with the terms of this Convention. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n\n\n(36)In order not to hinder scientific research, artificial restocking and transplantation, the provisions of this Regulation should not apply to operations which may be necessary for the conducting of such activities.\n\n\n\n\n(37)Where available scientific advice indicates that immediate action is required to protect marine species, the Commission should be able in duly justified cases to adopt immediately applicable delegated acts establishing technical measures to alleviate such threats, in addition to or by way of derogation to this Regulation or technical measures otherwise fixed in accordance with Union law. Those measures should be designed in particular to address unexpected changes in stock patterns as a result of high or low levels of recruitment of juveniles into a stock, to provide protection for spawning fish or shellfish when stocks are at very low levels or other changes in the conservation status of fish stocks which may threaten the status of a stock. They could include restrictions on the use of towed or static gears or on fishing activities in certain areas or during certain periods.\n\n\n(38)The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to update the list of fish and shellfish for which directed fishing is prohibited; to update the list of sensitive areas where fishing should be restricted; to adopt technical measures as part of multiannual plans; and to adopt technical measures as part of temporary discard plans. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. \n\n\n(39)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions of this Regulation in respect of the establishment of the specification of devices to reduce wear and tear, to strengthen or to limit the escape of catches in the forward part of towed gears; to define the specification of the selection devices attached to defined baseline gears; to define the specifications of the pulse trawl; restrictions on construction and the control and monitoring measures to be adopted by the flag Member State; to define rules on: the control and monitoring measures to be adopted by the flag Member State when using static gears in depths between 200-600 metres, to define detailed rules on the control and monitoring measures to be adopted for certain closed or restricted areas; and to define detailed rules on the signal and implementation characteristics of devices used to deter cetaceans from static nets and methods used to minimise bycatches of seabirds and marine reptiles, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n.\n\n\n(40)By the end of 2020 and every third year thereafter the Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Regulation, on the basis of information supplied by Member States and the relevant Advisory Councils and following evaluation by the STECF. This report should assess the extent to which technical measures both regionally and at Union level have contributed to achieving the objectives and in reaching the targets of this Regulation. On the basis of that report, where at regional level there is evidence that the objectives and targets have not been met, Member States within that region should submit a plan setting out the corrective actions to be taken to ensure those objectives and targets can be met. The Commission should also propose to the European Parliament and to the Council any necessary amendments to this Regulation on the basis of that report.\n\n\n(41)By reason of the number and importance of the amendments to be made, Council Regulations (EC) (EC) 894/97\n23\n, 850/98\n24\n, (EC) No 2549/2000\n25\n, (EC) No 254/2002\n26\n, (EC) No 812/2004\n27\n  and (EC) No 2187/2005\n28\n should be repealed. \n\n\n(42)Council Regulations (EC) 1967/2006\n29\n, (EC) No 1098/2007\n30\n, (EC) 1224/2009\n31\n and Regulations (EU) No 1343/2011\n32\n and (EU) No 1380/2013\n33\n of the European Parliament and of the Council should be amended accordingly. \n\n\n(43)In order to supplement or amend existing detailed rules transposing recommendations agreed by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of technical measures in Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the incorporation into Union law of future amendments of those measures adopted by GFCM which form the subject matter of certain expressly defined non-essential elements of this Regulation and which become binding upon the Union in accordance with the terms of the GFCM Agreement. Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 should be amended accordingly. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nSubject matter \n\n\nThis Regulation lays down technical measures concerning:\n\n\n(a)the taking and landing of fisheries resources; and \n\n\n(b)the operation of fishing gears and the interaction of fishing activities with marine ecosystems.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nScope\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall apply to activities pursued by Union fishing vessels and nationals of Member States, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State, in the fishing zones referred to in Article 5 as well as by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries when fishing in Union waters.\n\n\n2.Articles 7 and 14 and Part A of Annexes V to X shall also apply to recreational fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n3.
