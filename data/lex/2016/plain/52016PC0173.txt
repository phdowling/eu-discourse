Subsequently, negotiations for a multiparty trade agreement were launched in January 2009 between the EU and Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Bolivia chose not to participate in the process. After 4 rounds, Ecuador suspended its participation in the talks and negotiations continued with Peru and Colombia only. \n\n\nOn 26 June 2012 the EU signed a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru (the Trade Agreement). The Trade Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 March 2013 for Peru and 1 August 2013 for Colombia.\n\n\nArticle 329 of the Trade Agreement lays down the provisions whereby other Member Countries of the Andean Community can become Parties to the Trade Agreement.\n\n\nFollowing the request by Ecuador to restart negotiations with the Union to become a Party to the Trade Agreement, negotiations were conducted between the Union and Ecuador in 2014. The negotiations for the Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Trade Agreement (\u2018the Protocol of Accession\u2019) were concluded in July 2014.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission informed EU Member States orally and in writing on the process of the negotiations with Ecuador via the Trade Policy Committee of the Council. The European Parliament has also been regularly informed on developments via its Committee on International Trade (INTA). The complete text resulting from the negotiations was circulated to both institutions. \n\n\nFollowing the initialling of the Protocol of Accession, an interim reciprocal arrangement was necessary for the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption. On the EU side, Regulation (EU) No 1384/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2014 on the tariff treatment for goods originating in Ecuador provides for the maintenance of the preferential duty rates applicable to goods originating in Ecuador on 12 December 2014 as from 1 January 2015. Regulation (EU) No 1384/2014 will expire on 31 December 2016.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 329(4) and footnote 89 of the Trade Agreement, the EU- Colombia - Peru Trade Committee established in the framework of the Trade Agreement approved the Protocol of Accession of Ecuador at its meeting of 8 February 2016. \n\n\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe accession of Ecuador to the existing Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement, reinforces the legal framework of the EU trade relations with this country and facilitates reciprocal trade and investment. It also incorporates Ecuador to the regime of joint rules and institutions established by the Trade Agreement. \n\n\nMoreover, accession to the Trade Agreement will provide an anchor for Ecuador's economic reforms and efforts to integrate the global economy, increase welfare and consolidate its growth with a view to improving the living conditions of its citizens. \n\n\nBy means of the Protocol of Accession, the Commission reached the objectives set out in the negotiating directives, namely to eliminate high tariffs, tackle technical barriers to trade, liberalise services markets, protect valuable EU geographical indications (GIs), open-up public procurement markets, include commitments on the enforcement of labour and environmental standards and offer effective and swift dispute settlement procedures. The resulting agreement goes well beyond WTO commitments and ensures a level playing field with competitors in the region. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe Protocol also contains a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development that links the Trade Agreement to EU objectives in the field of labour, environment, and climate change. \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0this Council decision is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular its Articles 91, 100(2) and 207(4), first subparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(5), thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international trade and policy objectives towards Ecuador and Latin America in general, and as reflected in several EU-CELAC summit declarations. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(5) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions on international agreements. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER REMARKS\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\n\nA detailed Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) examining the Agreement's potential economic, social and environmental effects has been conducted and published in October 2009. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe signature of the Protocol is not subject to REFIT procedures; it does not imply any costs for the Union SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights in the Union. \n\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nForegone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 80 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Nature and scope of the Protocol of Accession\n\n\nThe Protocol of Accession of Ecuador to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru on the other part, establishes the necessary modifications to the Trade Agreement to take account of the accession of Ecuador. The Trade Agreement establishes the conditions for EU economic operators to take full advantage of the opportunities and the emerging complementarities between our respective economies. Over the course of its implementation, the Trade Agreement will fully relieve EU exporters of industrial and fisheries products to Ecuador from paying customs duties. It satisfies the criteria established in Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 (to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce with respect to substantially all trade between the parties) i.e.: 99.5 % of EU exports are covered (100% of our trade in industrial products in 10 years; and around 90% of agriculture after 17 years). In addition, it will allow for the dismantling of several important non-tariff barriers. Ecuador will benefit from substantial new access to the EU market in particular for their key agriculture export: bananas, and the EU will grant 100% duty-free coverage for fisheries of Ecuadorian origin and liberalise 99, 9% of industrial tariff lines and 100% of industrial imports at entry into force. \n\n\nOn services and establishment as well as public procurement coverage, the agreement matches the ambition of the Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. It includes substantial commitments on all key sectors (notably financial services, telecommunications, transport) for cross-border supply and establishment in particular, while the EU's concerns in terms of temporary presence of natural persons for business purposes (mode 4) have been dealt with satisfactorily. In procurement, the EU has obtained the commitment of institutions at both central and sub-central level with appropriately low thresholds. \n\n\nThe Trade Agreement also establishes a set of disciplines which go beyond those agreed in the multilateral framework, notably on intellectual property (e.g. 116 EU geographical indications protected in Ecuador, data protection conditions clarified); sustainable development (the agreement is GSP+ equivalent or above on labour and environmental issues and contains specific commitments on sustainable fisheries); competition (disciplines on monopolies and State Enterprises \u2013 transparency obligations on subsidies); technical barriers to trade (WTO+ elements on market surveillance, transparency in regulation procedures and disciplines on labelling and marking); Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (WTO+ measures on animal welfare, regionalisation, approval of export establishments, on the spot inspections and import checks) among others. In addition, via its accession Ecuador will participate in the Trade Committee as well as in a set of sub-committees which allow for consultations on specific trade concerns under its different titles. A key added value of the agreement is therefore to lock-in and promote \u2013 above and beyond those rules that derive from the WTO framework \u2013 openness policies and respect for internationally agreed best practices at the domestic level while securing a transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable environment for EU operators and investors in the region. The possibility of the EU to avail itself of the bilateral dispute settlement mechanism foreseen under the agreement will also contribute to this objective.\n\n\nThe Protocol should be applied provisionally, pending the completion of internal procedures for its entry into force. By the provisional application of the Protocol, the provisions of the Trade Agreement also apply provisionally, with the exception of Articles Articles 2, 202 (1), 291 and 292 thereof, as in the case of the Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru\n1\n.\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nUnder the general provisions of the Trade Agreement, the Parties undertake to continuously monitor the operation and impact of this Trade Agreement. \n\n\nEcuador will take part in the Trade Committee that is established in accordance with Article 12 of the Trade Agreement, which oversees and is responsible for the operation, implementation and correct application of the Trade Agreement.\n\n\nThe Trade Committee also supervises the work of all specialised bodies established under the Agreement, to which Ecuador will also participate as a Party to the Trade Agreement.\n\n\nThe following specialised bodies have already been established under the auspices of the Trade Committee. \n\n\n\uf0b7Market Access Subcommittee.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agriculture Subcommittee \n\n\n\uf0b7Subcommittee of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\n\n\n\uf0b7Sub-committee on Government Procurement\n\n\n\uf0b7IPR Subcommittee.\n\n\n\uf0b7Customs Subcommittee.\n\n\n\uf0b7Subcommittee on Trade and Sustainable Development.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Technical Barriers to Trade Subcommittee.\n\n\nAs far as reporting, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 19/2013 the Commission committed to submit an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application, implementation and fulfilment of obligations of the Agreement. Two such reports have been submitted, most recently on February 2016\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal in articles 1 and 2 and 3 contains provisions on the signing of the Protocol on behalf of the Union, on the establishment of the instrument of full powers to sign the Protocol, and on its application between the EU and Ecuador on a provisional basis by the Union. It also contains provisions on the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union by the General Secretariat of the Council. \n\n\nArticle 4 specifies that the Protocol of Accession must not be construed as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly invoked before European Union or Member State courts or tribunals.\n\n\nArticle 5 establishes the date of the entry into force of the Decision.\n\n\n2016/0091 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Protocol of Accession to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other part, to take account of the Accession of Ecuador\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 91, 100(2), and the first subparagraph of 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(5), thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n2\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 19 January 2009 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a trade agreement on behalf of the Union with those Member Countries of the Andean Community which shared the aim to reach an ambitious, comprehensive, and balanced trade agreement. \n\n\n(2)On 26 June 2012, the Union signed the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other part\n3\n (\"Trade Agreement\").

AM and NT commitments are independent of each other; accordingly, if no AM commitment has been made (remaining \u201cunbound\u201d), this does not invalidate the NT commitment. \n\n\nFor methodological revision and analysis purposes, we would point out the following:\n\n\n\u2013No commitments of any kind are being made in the sectors or sub-sectors of services not shown on the list\n\n\n\u2013For the services sub-sectors in which commitments are being maintained or new commitments are being incorporated, the amendments appear in the left-hand column headed \u201cSector or sub-sector\u201d\n\n\n\u2013Reservations, conditions and exclusions relative to the rules on market access and national treatment and applied to maintained or newly-incorporated commitments appear in the right-hand column headed \u201cDescription of reservations\u201d. \n\n\n\u2013To complement the list, the same right-hand column includes \u201ccomments\u201d considered necessary on the commitment or reservation being incorporated or maintained.\n\n\n\u2013Commitments in specific sectors or sub-sectors are subject to the horizontal reservations and limitations included in the first section, which apply across the board and unconditionally to all sectors unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\u2013The commitments do not include measures relating to requirements, technical standards, procedures or processes necessary for the provision of a service and that apply even when not shown on the list, unless they are presented as restrictions on the rules on market access and national treatment\n\n\nThe reservations, conditions and exclusions included on the list below will not apply, insofar as they present inconsistencies, to the sub-sectors and modes committed by Ecuador on the Schedule of Specific Commitments undertaken for its membership of the World Trade Organisation \u2013 WTO in 1996, a recast version of which can be found in document S/DCS/W/ECU of 24 January 2003, produced from the original texts of and amendments to documents GATS/SC/98/Suppl.1 and GATS/SC/98/Suppl.2, of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Accordingly, the said reservations, conditions and exclusions will be applicable to and required for the new sectors and/or modes of supply set out on the list below only.\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions included in Article 107(3) relating to the scope of the rules in the Title on Trade in Services, Establishment and Electronic Commerce, no measures that may be adopted or maintained by the State of Ecuador in relation to grants and subsidies are listed.\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, based on Article 107(5) of the Title on Trade in Services, Establishment and Electronic Commerce, Ecuador reserves the right to establish, maintain and fully implement its national legislation with the aim of attaining legitimate policy objectives in areas such as the protection of vulnerable groups, consumer protection, health and the environment among others. \n\n\nIn accordance with Article 107(4) of the Title on Trade in Services, Establishment and Electronic Commerce, this offer does not include services provided in the exercise of governmental authority.\n\n\nThe rights and obligations derived from this schedule of commitments are not directly applicable and effective and thus do not confer directly enforceable rights on natural or legal persons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector or sub-sector\n\n\n\n\nDescription of reservations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL SECTORS\n\n\n\n\nProvision of services in strategic sectors and public services\n\n\nThe provision of public services and services in strategic sectors will require concession rights, licences, authorisations or other forms of permission to be obtained beforehand in accordance with the relevant legislation applicable to the respective sector. Where a requirement is laid down for the provision of the services to take place in part or in full on Ecuadorian territory, a requirement may also be laid down for domiciliation of an establishment in Ecuador for legal persons incorporated under the laws of another country and whose main domicile is in another country.\n\n\nSuch requirements apply to the provision of public services and those related to energy exploitation in all its forms, telecommunications, exploitation of non-renewable natural resources, transport and refining of hydrocarbons, biodiversity and genetic heritage, water and the radio spectrum. \n\n\nThe total or partial acquisition of blocks of shares or any rights over the control, management or administration of companies active in the areas listed in the preceding paragraph may be subject to the approval of the competent authorities.\n\n\nThe criteria for the granting of licences, authorisations and other forms of permission shall be transparent and non-discriminatory as regards the participation of service providers from the EU Party and shall not constitute a quantitative restriction for the provision of the service.\n\n\nThe specific commitments undertaken by Ecuador in this Agreement in strategic sectors and public services shall be considered as constituting the exceptional circumstances provided for in national legislation in relation to the delegation to private initiative in the provision of public services and in the strategic sectors.\n\n\nOwnership of land or waters\n\n\nForeign national or legal persons may not, in any capacity, acquire land or concessions in national security zones for economic exploitation purposes.\n\n\nEcuador reserves the right to adopt or maintain measures related to the ownership of property by foreign nationals in border areas, on the national coasts or on island territory.\n\n\nEssential security\n\n\nThe manufacture, import, possession and use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is prohibited, as is the introduction into the national territory of nuclear waste and toxic waste.\n\n\nSocial Economy\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic, Ecuador reserves the right to establish measures granting preferential and differential treatment to the sectors that operate and pursue activities using the social economy model, including the associative and community cooperative sectors.\n\n\nCultural heritage and natural heritage\n\n\nEcuador reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that grants rights or preferences to local communities with regard to the support, fostering, promotion and development of expressions related to the intangible cultural heritage. Similarly, it reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that grants rights or preferences to local communities with regard to the protection, preservation, recovery and promotion of Ecuador's natural heritage, taken to mean all of the physical, biological and geological features of value from the environmental, scientific, cultural or landscape point of view, including the national system of protected areas and fragile and threatened ecosystems.\n\n\n\nPublishing industry\n\n\nEcuador reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure that grants to a natural or legal person of the EU Party the same treatment as granted to a natural or legal person from Ecuador in the publishing sector of the latter Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n\n\n\nThe provision of cross-border financial services in Ecuador, including insurance and insurance-related services, does not imply that the providers of such services may conduct or advertise business on Ecuadorian territory. Ecuador may define the terms \u201cconduct business\u201d and \u201cadvertise\u201d, wherever such definitions are not inconsistent with the commitments made by Ecuador for modes 1 and 2.\n\n\nEcuador may require written evidence of the authorisation granted by a competent authority of the other Party for the providers of cross-border financial services and for the financial products and instruments they offer in Ecuador.\n\n\nInsurance enterprises may contract reinsurance abroad, as long as the reinsurance enterprises are classified in accordance with international standards, and subjected to the rules laid down by the Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Fund Administrators (\u2018SBS - Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros\u2019). For greater transparency, if the insurance enterprises contract reinsurances directly, they should do it with enterprises included in the SBS reinsurance registry.\n\n\nThe auxiliary services of the financial services related to the provision and transfer of financial information and the processing of financial data shall be registered in accordance with the rules laid down by the Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Fund Administrators. The said auxiliary services may not collect, maintain and deliver credit information. For greater transparency, financial information services or the processing of financial data shall be subject to the Ecuadorian provisions regulating the protection of such information.\n\n\nFor greater transparency, the mandatory risk ratings for financial institutions incorporated under Ecuadorian law require the foreign risk-rating agencies to first register with the Ecuadorian Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Fund Administrators.\n\n\nOn the securities market, Ecuador will accept the risk rating by an agency recognised by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) as a \u201cNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organisation \u2013 RSRO\u201d, in the event of a secondary public offering on the Ecuadorian securities market, securities issued abroad or a primary public offering on the Ecuadorian securities market by multilateral issuers recognised as local issuers. \n\n\nEcuador reserves the right to adopt or maintain measures that restrict the acquisition of obligatory insurance outside of Ecuador, or that require that obligatory insurance be purchased from suppliers established in Ecuador such as the Seguro Obligatorio de Accidentes de Tr\u00e1nsito (SOAT, Obligatory Traffic Accident Insurance).

Ecuador does not undertake any commitment for contractual service providers and professionals whose activities are not liberalised pursuant to Articles 126 and 127 of this Agreement.\n\n\nFor methodological revision and analysis purposes, the list below is presented as follows:\n\n\n\u2013The sectors of services out of which the sectors affected by restrictions in this offer are described are shown on the left-hand side headed \u201cSector or sub-sector\u201d.\n\n\n\u2013To complement the list, the right-hand column includes the restrictions or limitations affecting the corresponding sector or sub-sector.\n\n\n\u2013Commitments in specific sectors or sub-sectors are subject to the horizontal reservations and limitations included in the first section, which apply across the board and unconditionally to the categories of Contractual Service Providers and Independent Professionals.\n\n\nIn accordance with the provisions included in Article 107(7) relating to the scope of the rules in the Title on Trade in Services, Establishment and Electronic Commerce, no measures are listed that relate to regulation of the entry of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, Ecuadorian territory, including those measures adopted or maintained by Ecuador as necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders.\n\n\nThe list below does not include measures related to requirements and procedures concerning qualifications, technical standards and requirements concerning degrees, and procedures related to employment, work and social security conditions. Such measures, which include but are not limited to: the need to obtain a licence, the need to obtain recognition of qualifications in regulated sectors, the need to pass specific examinations, including language examinations, the need to have a legal domicile in the territory where the economic activity is performed, the need to comply with national regulations and practices concerning minimum wages and with collective wage agreements in the host country, even if not listed, apply in any case to Contractual Service Providers and Independent Professionals.\n\n\nThe rights and obligations derived from this schedule of commitments are not directly applicable and effective and thus do not confer directly enforceable rights on natural or legal persons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector or sub-sector\n\n\n\n\nDescription of reservations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHORIZONTAL COMMITMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL SECTORS \n\n\n\n\nThe recognition of academic degrees or certificates issued by foreign higher education bodies may be subject to bilateral agreements providing for reciprocity.

It must be clarified that membership of the \"Foro del Consejo de la Judicatura\" (Judiciary Council Association) does not constitute a requirement for the provision of liberalised legal services. However, foreign lawyers who apply for admission to the cited Association shall be required to perform one year of pre-professional practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb) Accounting, auditing and bookkeeping services\n\n\n(CPC 862)\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd) Architectural services\n\n\n(CPC 8671 and 8674)\n\n\n\n\nIn order for a foreign architect who qualified abroad to be able to obtain a permanent licence from the College of Architects of Ecuador to exercise the profession in the country, the following are required:\n\n\na) Submission to the National Register of a properly reasoned application for authorisation;\n\n\nb) Verification that Ecuadorian architects can practise with no restrictions in the applicant's country of origin.\n\n\nc) Verification that the applicant is present in the country legally, and more specifically verification of his/her immigrant status, in the light of the relevant legislation.\n\n\nd) Presentation of an academic qualification duly ratified in Ecuador; and\n\n\ne) Verification of the applicant's worthiness and solvency to exercise the activities proposed, with a certificate from the college or society of architects in his/her country of origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne) Engineering services (CPC 8672)\n\n\nf) Integrated Engineering Services (CPC 8673)\n\n\n\n\n\nNational or foreign enterprises, and consortia of national and/or foreign enterprises formed for the performance of engineering works shall be obliged to have, for the performance of that work, a staff of engineers employed on the Project, not less than 80% of the total of which must be Ecuadorian engineers, until the tenth year of their establishment in the country: from the eleventh year onwards they must increase the percentage of Ecuadorian professionals by 4% per year until it reaches 90%.

UNBUNDLING(\n2\n):\n\n\nFor the period of five years following the entry into force of this Agreement, procuring entities listed under subsections 1, 2 and 3 may subject government procurement to mandatory requirements for the incorporation of domestic content pursuant to the study of technological unbundling carried out on the basis of the methodology defined by the Servicio Nacional de Contrataci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (SERCOP) of Ecuador. These requirements shall take the form of objective and clearly defined conditions for the participation in the tendering procedures for the award of the procurement. \n\n\nProcurement entities shall indicate the existence of domestic content conditions in their notice of intended procurement and specify them in detail in the contract documents.\n\n\nSuch conditions shall only cover the procurement procedures of goods and construction services and shall not exceed 40 per cent of the full contract value.\n\n\n3.THRESHOLD CALCULATION FORMULA\n\n\nThe threshold shall be adjusted at two-year intervals with each adjustment taking effect on January 1, beginning 1 January 2018. \n\n\nThe calculation of the values of thresholds shall be based on the average of the daily values of the SDR to US Dollar exchange rate over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision, with effect from 1 January. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars. This methodology can be modified by the EU Party and Ecuador within the Trade Committee meeting as described in Article 12 paragraph 4 of this Agreement.\n\n\n4.ECUADORIAN AUTHORITIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 190 OF THIS AGREEMENT\n\n\nIn the case of Ecuador, the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo, the Corte Nacional de Justicia and the Servicio Nacional de Contrataci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (SERCOP) are impartial authorities for the purposes of Article 190 paragraph 6 of this Agreement.

Ecuador commits to ensure national treatment of applications for protection of intellectual property rights in line with the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Articles 3 and 27(1) thereof. \n\n\nThe Parties reaffirm their commitment to the 'Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health' adopted by the Doha WTO Ministerial Conference on 14 November 2001 and the right of the Parties to resort to the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement which provide flexibility for the purpose of protecting public health.
