The 11th EDF Financial Regulation provides for regular contributions to be made by Member States to the EDF treasury against pre-determined financial commitments. Regular contributions are triggered by technical Council Decisions which reflect the implementation of financial commitments previously decided. \n\n\nSome of the headings in the explanatory memorandum are therefore not applicable to regular contribution calls such as this one.\n\n\n\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nRefer to point 1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nConsistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nRefer to point 1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nLegal basis\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 21(7) of the 11th EDF Financial Regulation, the amount managed by the Commission and the amount managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) are specified separately.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 52 of the 11th EDF Financial Regulation, the EIB has sent the Commission its updated estimates of commitments and payments under the instruments it manages.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 22(1) of the 11th Financial Regulation calls for contributions shall first use up the amounts available from previous EDFs, one after the other. The calls for contributions in this proposal therefore concern amounts under the 10th EDF for both the EIB and the Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 21(3) of the 11th EDF Financial Regulation, the Council must decide on this proposal at the latest 21 calendar days following the presentation by the Commission of its proposal.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 1 of Council Decision 2013/759/EU establishing the Bridging Facility\n4\n, the shares of Member States\u2019 contributions set out in Article 1(2) (a) of the Internal Agreements of the 8th, 9th and 10th EDF shall be reduced accordingly, after the entry into force of the 11th EDF Internal Agreement. The reduction will have an impact on 2015, 2016 and 2017 Member States' contributions according to the option for adjustment chosen by each Member States.\n\n\nArticle 23(1) of the 11th EDF Financial Regulation provides that a Member State which fails to pay the instalment of the contribution due by the deadline will be required to pay interest on the amount unpaid; the arrangements for the payment of interest are specified in the same Article.\n\n\n\nSubsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nRefer to point 1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nProportionality\n\n\n\nRefer to point 1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nChoice of the instrument\n\n\n\nRefer to point 1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nEx-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\nStakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\nCollection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\nRegulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot relevant\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nRefer to point 1.

Therefore a call for funds under the 10th EDF should be made.\n\n\n(4)The Council has adopted on the 24 November 2015, on a proposal by the Commission, the Decision to set the ceiling for the annual amount of the Member States' EDF contributions for 2016 at EUR 3 450 000 000 for the Commission, and at EUR 150\u00a0000 000 for the European Investment Bank\n8\n.\n\n\n(5)The Council has adopted the creation of the Bridging Facility on 12 December 2013 regarding transitional EDF management measures from 1 January 2014 until the entry into force of the 11th European Development Fund\n9\n.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe individual European Development Fund contributions to be paid by the Member States to the European Commission and the European Investment Bank as the second instalment for 2016 are set out in the table in the Annex 1.\n\n\nPayments of those contributions may be combined with adjustments under the implementation of the deduction of the funds committed under the Bridging Facility, following an adjustment plan communicated by each Member State to the Commission at the adoption of the third instalment 2015.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p.3\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L
