Context of the Proposal\n\n\n\uf0b7Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal aims to revise the founding regulation of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) from 1975. The reasons for the revision are twofold. \n\n\nThe revision of the Eurofound's Founding Regulation will align certain provisions of the existing Regulation governing Eurofound with the Common Approach on Decentralised Agencies. \n\n\nThe revision also offers the opportunity to update the objectives and tasks of Eurofound. Since its establishment in 1975, the Foundation has adapted its activities to the overall societal, institutional and economic developments and emerging trends in European policies in the field of living and working conditions. The new objectives and tasks will be adjusted to better reflect these developments and Eurofound's current contribution to the development of social and work-related policies, by providing relevant and high quality research output in the field of employment, industrial relations, working and living conditions. \n\n\nThe revision is not an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT).\n\n\nThe other two so-called tripartite Agencies of the European Union, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) will also undergo a revision of their respective Founding Regulations at the same time as Eurofound.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with the existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe Eurofound's Founding Regulation has been amended three times, in 1993, 2003, and 2005, mainly to take account of EU enlargement or Treaty changes. However, such amendments have not significantly altered the fundamentals of the Agency.\n\n\nThis revision will provide a clearer description of the role of Eurofound in supporting the Commission, other EU institutions and bodies, Member States and social partners in shaping policies on living and working conditions as well as in promoting social dialogue. It will update the mandate of Eurofound as a centre for analysis, research and policy monitoring in these policy areas.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe role of Eurofound is to inform and contribute towards better evidence-based policymaking in areas relevant to living and working conditions. The revision takes into consideration the existing EU policies on living and working conditions, and foresees complementarity with ongoing and planned research in this area carried out with EU funding, such as those financed under the Horizon 2020 programme.\n\n\n2. Legal Basis, Subsidiarity and Proportionality\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposed legal basis is Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which covers the activities carried out by Eurofound in the area of working and living conditions where it refers to measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States in Art 153(2)(a) TFEU. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThis proposal addresses certain aspects relating to how the EU agency operates internally and within the EU institutional framework. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal cannot be achieved by action at national level.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe revision of the Founding Regulation should be considered in terms of its impact on administrative burden and budgetary costs so as to respect the proportionality principle. A general principle which shall guide the revision is the necessity to keep the text of the Founding Regulation simple, clear and flexible, while relying on other forms of regulation (e.g. Rules of Procedure) for detailed provisions. A Founding Regulation should have a mid- term lifespan and ensure the necessary flexibility to allow for possible future developments in the organisation without a need for a further revision. \n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe instrument will be a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council repealing and replacing the existing Regulation (EEC) 1365/75 of the Council.\n\n\n3.Results of Ex-post Evaluations, Stakeholder Consultations and Impact Assessments\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe most recent external ex-post evaluation was concluded by the Agency and  focused on the Multi-annual Work Programme 2009-2012.\n\n\nStakeholder consultations\n\n\nIn line with the requirements of Article 154 TFEU, management and labour at EU level have been consulted on both the possible direction of Union action and the content of the envisaged proposal. Both management and labour insisted in their opinion on maintaining the tripartite nature of the Agency and reflecting this in the objectives of the Agency and in the balanced representation of all groups in its governance structures. They furthermore requested to maintain a Deputy Director function as foreseen under the 1975 Regulation.  \n\n\nThe Commission has kept other relevant stakeholders informed on broad decisions concerning this revision exercise and consulted them when necessary. \n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nGiven the limited revision of the founding act, an impact assessment was not carried out.\n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nNot applicable. The proposal is not linked to REFIT.\n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n4. Budgetary Implications\n\n\nThe budgetary implications in terms of human and financial resources, as presented in more detail in the Legislative Financial Statement, are in line with Commission Communication (2013)519.\u00a0\n\n\n5.Other Elements\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n In accordance with the Common Approach, the proposal includes a provision on the evaluation of the Agency by the Commission. In addition to making this\u00a0proposal, the Commission envisages to carry out a cross-cutting evaluation to assess the Agency's objectives, mandates, governance and tasks, also in relation to other Agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills.\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\uf0b7DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe revision offers the opportunity to update Eurofound's objectives and tasks to reflect the developments within the Agency and in the context in which it operates since the adoption of the first Founding Regulation in 1975. It will allow defining more precisely the role of Eurofound in supporting the Commission, Member States and social partners in shaping and implementing policies aimed at the improvement of working and living conditions and in support of social dialogue.\n\n\nFurthermore, the revision of the Founding Regulation creates the opportunity to provide for anti-fraud measures, conflict of interest policy, evaluation and review and the establishment of a headquarters agreement. \n\n\nThe revision will also harmonise the provisions on programming and reporting with the requirements set by the revised Framework Financial Regulation. It will lead to modifying and aligning the appointment procedure of the Director (Executive Director) with the procedure provided for in the Common Approach and it will suppress the current position of Deputy Director. The role of appointing authority will be conferred to the Management Board of the Agency. The terminology for the management structure will be aligned with the Common Approach. Certain elements of the Founding Act are not being reviewed in the light of the Common Approach in the framework of this proposal, pending further evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the appointment by the Council of  the Management Board members representing the employers' and employees' organisations from each Member State, it is proposed that this is done on the basis of a list submitted by the EU social partners' organisations Business Europe and ETUC.\n\n\n\n2016/0256 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nestablishing the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound), and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2)a thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n1\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n2\n,\n\n\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound) was established by Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75\n3\n to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development.\n\n\n(2)Since its establishment in 1975 Eurofound has played an important role in supporting the improvement of living and working conditions throughout the European Union. At the same time the concepts and significance of living and working conditions have evolved under the influence of societal developments and fundamental changes in the labour markets. In this light terminological adjustments are required in describing the objectives and tasks of Eurofound as compared to Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75.\n\n\n(3)Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 has been amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should therefore be replaced and repealed in the interest of clarity.\n\n\n(4)The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012 to the extent possible. This proposal therefore does not prejudge any further amendments to the Founding Regulation of Eurofound which the Commission may wish to propose following further evaluation, as provided for in this act or on its own initiative. The Commission will evaluate the objectives, mandate, governance and tasks of all EU Agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills.\n\n\n(5)As the three so-called tripartite agencies, the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound), the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) address issues related to the labour market and working environment and vocational education and training and skills, close coordination among the three Agencies is required and ways to enhance efficiency and synergies should be exploited. In addition, where relevant, the Agency should seek to engage in efficient cooperation with the European Commission's in-house research capacities. \n\n\n(6)The financial provisions and provisions for programming and reporting set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 should be aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013.\n4\n\n\n\n(7)The provisions concerning Eurofound's staff set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 should be aligned with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (\u2018Staff Regulations\u2019) and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (\u2018CEOS\u2019), laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68.\n5\n\n\n\n(8)The Agency should take the necessary measures to ensure safe handling and processing of confidential information. Where required Eurofound will adopt security rules as set out in Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/443\n6\n and Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444.\n7\n\n\n\n(9)It is necessary to provide for transitional budgetary provisions and transitional provisions on the Management Board, Executive Director and staff to ensure continuation of activities of the Agency pending the entry into force of this Regulation,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\n\nChapter I\nObjectives and tasks of the Agency\n\n\nArticle 1 - Objectives of the agency\n\n\n1.The European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions, ('the Agency'), also referred to as 'Eurofound', is hereby established as a European Union Agency.\n\n\n2.The objectives of the Agency shall be to increase and disseminate knowledge to assist the Commission, other EU institutions and bodies, Member States and social partners in shaping and implementing policies aimed at the improvement of living and working conditions, in supporting employment policies and in promoting the dialogue between management and labour.\n\n\nArticle 2 \u2013 Tasks\n\n\n1.The Agency shall perform the following tasks with respect to the policy areas referred to in Article 1(2):\n\n\n(a)analyse developments and provide comparative analyses of policies, institutional frameworks and practices across countries;\n\n\n\n\n(b)analyse trends in living and working conditions and labour market developments;\n\n\n(c)analyse the developments in industrial relation systems and in particular social dialogue at EU level and in the Member States;\n\n\n(d)undertake or commission studies and carry out research on relevant socio-economic developments and related policy issues;\n\n\n(e)provide forums for exchange of experiences and information between stakeholders, including social partners, and support implementation of reforms and policies at national level;\n\n\n(f)manage and make available tools and datasets to policymakers, social partners, academia and other stakeholders.\n\n\n2.In carrying out its tasks, the Agency shall maintain a close dialogue particularly with specialised bodies, whether public or private, public authorities and workers' and employers\u2019 organisations.

These arrangements shall not create legal obligations incumbent on the Union and its Member States\n\n\n\n\n2.The Agency shall be open to the participation of third countries that have entered into agreements with the Union to this effect. \n\n\nUnder the relevant provisions of the agreements referred to in paragraph 1, arrangements shall be developed specifying, in particular, the nature, extent and manner in which the third countries concerned will participate in the work of the Agency, including provisions relating to the participation in the initiatives undertaken by the Agency, financial contributions and staff. As regards staff matters, those arrangements shall, in any event, comply with the Staff Regulations.\n\n\n3.The Management Board shall adopt a strategy for relations with third countries or international organisations concerning matters for which the Agency is competent.\n\n\n\nArticle 31 \u2013 Headquarters Agreement and operating conditions\n\n\n1.The necessary arrangements concerning the accommodation to be provided for the Agency in the host Member State and the facilities to be made available by that Member State together with the specific rules applicable in the host Member State to the Executive Director, members of the Management Board, Agency staff and members of their families shall be laid down in a Headquarters Agreement between the Agency and Member State where the seat is located.\n\n\n2.The Agency\u2019s host Member State shall provide the best possible conditions to ensure the functioning of the Agency, including multilingual, European-oriented schooling and appropriate transport connections. \n\n\nChapter VI\nTransitional provisions\n\n\nArticle 32 \u2013 Transitional provisions concerning the Management Board\n\n\n1.The term of office of the members of the Governing Board of the Agency as established on the basis of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of the Council  shall terminate on \u2026 [date of entry into force of this Regulation]. \n\n\n2.The Governing Board established on the basis of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of the Council  shall within the period between \u2026[date of entry into force of this Regulation] and \u2026 [date of application of this Regulation] exercise the functions of the Management Board as referred to in Article 5 of this Regulation.\n\n\nArticle 33 - Transitional provisions concerning the staff\n\n\n1.The Director of the Agency appointed on the basis of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of the Council shall, for the remaining periods of his/her term of office be assigned to the responsibilities of the Executive Director as provided for in Article 11 of this Regulation.

This tripartite approach is reflected in the structure of its Management Board (formerly named Governing Board) and constitutes a distinct added value. It is a key to the relevance of Eurofound\u2019s work and to the credibility of the input provided to policymakers.\n\n\nEurofound\u2019s main target audiences include the public authorities, social partners and those concerned with social policymaking at EU level. By linking research with policy concerns, Eurofound aims to provide information that is relevant to those who design and implement policy. Eurofound also communicates its findings to the EU citizen through its website at www.eurofound.europa.eu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurofound contributes by building upon the core areas of expertise it has developed. The Agency is known for its strong knowledge base in the area of working conditions. It is also the first port of call for comparative information on industrial relations and social dialogue in the EU and is recognised for a deep understanding of issues related to living conditions and quality of life. Another area of expertise, structural change and restructuring, has been developed since 2001, following the conclusions of the Nice European Council.\n\n\nThe Agency strives to provide the highest quality information in its fields of expertise: scientifically sound and unbiased. Eurofound\u2019s vision is that this knowledge is taken up for the development of effective policies that lead to the improvement of quality of life and work in a competitive and fair Europe.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system both ex-ante and ex-post of the multi-annual work programmes is already in place. This will be completed by the evaluation and review carried out by the Commission every five years. \n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nArt 151 TFEU: 'The Union [..] shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions\u2026.\n\n\nThe Founding Regulation of Eurofound defines its role and objectives: 'The role of Eurofound is to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development. With this aim in view, the tasks of the Foundation shall be to develop and to pursue ideas on the medium and long-term improvement of living and working conditions in the light of practical experience and to identify factors leading to change.'\n\n\nEurofound supports the work of the Commission in the areas of employment, social affairs and inclusion by carrying out research and policy analysis in these areas.  It provides long-term analysis of problems and policy initiatives with a view to identifying 'what works and what does not'.  It's surveys provide long-term analysis and information on underlying trends and developments in Working Conditions, Quality of Life and Company behaviour; it's observatories provide a repository of descriptive analysis and updated information about Industrial Relations and Working Conditions, Restructuring and Managing Change.\n\n\nEurofound also carries out work in support of European Social Dialogue (Art 154-155 TFEU) in the form of the representativeness studies of the European Social Partners, providing an independent verification of their capacity to participate in European Social Dialogue and to conclude agreements.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nEurofound advises the European Institutions and serves the information needs of policy makers in governments, in trade unions and in employer organisations. This tripartite approach is reflected in the structure of its Management Board (formerly named Governing Board) and constitutes a distinct added value. It is a key to the relevance of Eurofound\u2019s work and to the credibility of the input provided to policymakers. Eurofound's observatories and surveys provide a unique source of independent information about Europe-wide developments, which is not available anywhere else. Few national institutes of a similar nature exist in Member States, and certainly none other which provide comparative information on all Member States.  \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nEurofound has been carrying out research, observation and surveys since 1975.  Eurofound can make its most valuable contribution by building upon the core areas of expertise it has developed. The Agency is known for its strong knowledge base in the area of working conditions. It is also the first port of call for comparative information on industrial relations and social dialogue in the EU and is recognised for a deep understanding of issues related to living conditions and quality of life.\n\n\nThe Agency strives to provide the highest quality information in its fields of expertise: scientifically sound and unbiased. Eurofound\u2019s vision is that this knowledge is taken up for the development of effective policies that lead to the improvement of quality of life and work in a competitive and fair Europe.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nEurofound cooperates with other EU Agencies working in related fields. Cooperation agreements exist with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU OSHA), the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), the European Training Foundation (ETF), and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). These agreements foresee in particular the early consultation on work programme development and are complemented by yearly action plans that agree further forms of exchange and, where appropriate, joint activities. This ensures complementarity of activities and allows for synergies to be achieved. \n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission through\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2327\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2327bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209;\n\n\n\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title\u00a0V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nAll EU agencies work under a strict monitoring system involving an internal control coordinator, the Internal Audit Service of the Commission, the Governing Board, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Budgetary Authority.
