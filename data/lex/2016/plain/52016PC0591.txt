The aim of the overhaul is inter alia to ensure a more effective regulatory institutional framework in order to make the telecoms rules fit for purpose as part of the creation of the right conditions for the digital single market. These include the deployment of very high capacity connectivity networks, more coordinated management of radio spectrum for wireless networks and creating a level playing field for advanced digital networks and innovative services. The communication pointed out that the changing market and technological environment make it necessary to strengthen the institutional framework by enhancing the role of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (\u2018BEREC\u2019).\n\n\nIn its Resolution \u2018Towards a Digital Single Market Act\u2019\n2\n, the European Parliament called on the Commission to integrate further the digital single market by ensuring that a more efficient institutional framework is in place. It can do this by strengthening the role, capacity and decision-making powers of BEREC in order to allow it (i) to foster the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, (ii) to enable an efficient oversight of BEREC over the development of the single market and (iii) to help it to resolve cross-border disputes. The European Parliament also stressed, in this regard, the need to improve the financial and human resources and further enhance the governance structure of BEREC.\n\n\nThis proposal has to be read in conjunction with the proposal for Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (\u2018the Directive\u2019). That proposal entrusts BEREC with additional tasks that would help to ensure that the regulatory framework is implemented consistently. This in turn would foster the development of the electronic communications market throughout the Union. Furthermore, BEREC would also contribute to the promotion of access and take up of very high capacity data connectivity, of competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and services as well as to the promotion of the interests of the citizens of the Union. This proposal aims to strengthen the institutional role of BEREC and enhance its governance structure by turning it into an agency in order to make it fit for the purpose of carrying out its future tasks.\n\n\nSince taking up its responsibilities in 2010 and becoming fully functional in 2011, BEREC and the BEREC Office (\u2018the BEREC Office\u2019) have made a positive contribution to the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework. They have also provided valuable technical expertise to the national regulatory authorities (\u2018NRAs\u2019) and EU institutions. Regulation (EU) No\u00a02015/2120 recently set out additional tasks for BEREC. These are issuing guidelines on the fulfilment of the obligations of NRAs in relation to open internet access, as well as issuing opinions on draft implementing acts to be adopted by the Commission in relation to Union-wide roaming and certain reporting obligations. The proposal for a Directive accompanying this proposal entrusts BEREC with further new tasks, such as playing a greater role in the consultation mechanism for market regulatory remedies, providing guidelines for NRAs on geographical surveys, developing common approaches to meeting transnational end-user demand, delivering opinions on draft national measures on assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum (the radio spectrum \u2018peer review\u2019), and setting up a register on the extraterritorial use of numbers and cross-border arrangements and one on providers of electronic communications networks and services.\n\n\nBEREC and the BEREC Office have had a significantly enhanced role, in particular in cross-border matters (such as machine-to-machine (M2M) services or transnational demand for business users) and gained experience in ensuring a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework. It seems appropriate and necessary to build on this experience by turning both together into a fully fledged agency. The new agency, which will have a broader mandate, should continue the work of BEREC and continue the pooling of expertise from NRAs. Given that BEREC\u2019s brand identity is already well established and we seek t o build upon it plus in light of the not insiginificant costs of changing its name, the new agency should retain the name of BEREC.\n\n\n\nBy enhacing the role of BEREC in the field of electronic communications and by aiming to align its structure and governance, operation, programming and accountability with the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on decentralised agencies of 19\u00a0July 2012 (\u2018the Common Approach\u2019)\n3\n, we are ensuring that the proposal serves to support Union's priorities.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe clear objectives of BEREC make this proposal highly synergetic with the other initiatives included in the DSM Strategy. This is because connectivity services provided over electronic communications networks serve as the backbone for the distribution of digital products and services.\n\n\nThe proposal complements the existing sector-specific regulation. Proposed radio spectrum tasks for BEREC take into account the existing instruments in the area, in particular the Radio Spectrum Decision 676/2002/EC, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group Decision 2002/622/EC and Decision 243/2012/EU establishing a multiannual radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP).\n\n\nIt also incorporates in the BEREC Regulation the tasks assigned to BEREC in the recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, which sets out rules for ensuring open internet and abolishing roaming surcharges.\n\n\nBy the end of 2016, the Commission is expected to present a review proposal for the Directive on privacy and electronic communications\n\n\n4\n\n\n. The scope of the current proposal for a Regulation may need to be adjusted in light of the outcome of the future review proposal. \n\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to provide BEREC with an appropriate and efficient governance structure, mandate and the tools it needs to ensure a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework. In this respect, it complements other electronic communications legal and policy instruments.\n\n\n\nBEREC may carry out its tasks as necessary in cooperation with other Union bodies, agencies, offices and advisory groups, in particular the Radio Spectrum Policy Group, the European Data Protection Board, the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security; as well as with existing committees (such as the Communications Committee and the Radio Spectrum Committee).\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe DSM Strategy is one of the 10 priorities the new Commission set out in 2014. This proposal is also in line with other top priorities of the Commission, in particular other initiatives to make the internal market deeper and fairer and to stimulate investment, create jobs and foster sustainable growth.\n\n\nSome of BEREC\u2019s tasks build on and complement existing Union law in several areas. One such task is to provide opinions on draft national measures related to the internal market procedures for market regulation. These continue to be based on the principles of competition law. Another such task is to provide guidelines on geographical surveys of network deployments. These also provide useful information for State aid purposes, enhancing the coherence between the two policies.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the proposal aims at BEREC becoming a Union decentralised agency and aligns it with the principles of the Common Approach.\n\n\nConsistency with international law obligations\n\n\nIf necessary when carrying out its tasks, BEREC may cooperate with competent authorities of third countries and/or with international organisations. This cooperation should be based on working arrangements, which should respect the Union's international relations and should not create legal obligations incumbent on the Union and its Member States.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the Treaty, as it relates to the development and functioning of the internal market for electronic communications.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe Union needs to act to address inconsistencies in the application of the current framework and the shortcomings of the existing institutional set-up as well as the inconsistencies in the distribution of responsibilities among Member States, NRAs and the Commission. Market fragmentation is not solely to blame on the current regulatory set-up in the Union. However, it has become apparent over the past few years that the lack of consistency in telecoms regulation is, at least partly, due to the current institutional set-up and the way the various institutional players (mainly the NRAs, BEREC and the Commission) interact and can influence the regulatory outcome. Giving BEREC strengthened powers in the area of ex ante market regulation will enhance legal certainty and contribute to regulatory consistency.\n\n\nMarket and technological developments also mean that there are a number of cross-border aspects which required regulatory consistency across Member States. A Union body can deal better with these aspects than individual Member States. This is particularly true for services such as M2M. These services should be provided in such a way as to be able seamlessly to cross national boundaries. There are also still national barriers to the provision of cross-border business communications services. This is a significant missed opportunity for the functioning and development of the internal market.\n\n\nIt is a common and shared interest to ensure harmonised, consistent and efficient implementation of the regulatory framework with the support of BEREC. The Member States cannot therefore sufficiently achieve the objectives of this proposal. They can be achieved better at Union level. The Union may therefore adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle, in particular with regard to the objectives and tasks of BEREC. It aims to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework, thus contributing to the development of the electronic communications market throughout the Union, the promotion of access to and take-up of both fixed and mobile very high capacity data connectivity, of competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and services and of the interests of the citizens of the Union. BEREC should assist the Commission and NRAs; provide guidelines in order to ensure consistency of NRAs measures; issue opinions through efficient internal market procedures on draft national measures; keep registers of network and services providers and numbers with extraterritoriality use; adopt binding decisions on two cross-border matters: the identification of transnational markets and a contract summary template. BEREC would have quasi-binding powers in relation to the internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation (the \u2018double-lock\u2019 system) and the establishment of a single maximum termination rate for the Union.\n\n\nThe new agency should continue the work of BEREC and continue pooling the expertise of NRAs, which remain at the core of the agency\u2019s work and are members of its Management Board. NRAs will continue to do most of the work relating to the implementation of the regulatory framework.\n\n\nIn particular regarding access regulation, the NRAs remain competent to ensure that market failures are addressed with appropriate remedies and that regulation helps achieve the common policy objectives. The proposed rules provide regulators with additional tools to address the current connectivity challenges, but the way they are to be used depends on national circumstances which are for national regulators to assess. The reason for the targeted strengthening of the regulatory oversight, mainly by giving BEREC a greater role in such an oversight process, is the evident lack of consistency in the application of current rules, when consistency is crucial for the internal market to function properly.\n\n\nRadio spectrum management also remains the competence of Member States. The proposed rules provide an overall framework for coherent radio spectrum management across the Union, while Member States may apply the rules taking national circumstances into account. Given the major cross-border implications of radio spectrum management and its wider impact on connectivity in the internal market, certain coordination procedures at Union level are necessary.\n\n\nAs a regulation, the proposed instrument will apply directly in the Union. The financial and administrative burden on the Union, national governments and economic operators will therefore be minimised and proportionate to the objective of the proposal. It enhances the proportionality of the current situation in which a Union agency was set up mainly to support BEREC. It ensures that the new agency provides further added value and is aligned with Union policy priorities, in particular the DSM Strategy.\n\n\n\nIn view of its objectives and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nOnly a regulation having direct application can provide for the setting up of a Union decentralised agency and for setting out its tasks and objectives, thus providing the necessary degree of efficiency and uniformity needed to implement the regulatory framework.\n\n\nThe same legal instrument was chosen for the setting up of BEREC and the Office (Regulation (EC) 1211/2009). This regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1211/2009. Since the amendments to be made are substantial, that act should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced and repealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nThe Commission carried out an ex post evaluation (\u2018REFIT\u2019), which assessed the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value of the BEREC Regulation and of other parts of the regulatory framework. It pinpointed areas where there is potential for simplification, without undermining their objectives. A previous evaluation of BEREC and the Office\n5\n was also carried out in 2012-2013 in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) 1211/2009. Its results have been incorporated into the ex post evaluation.\n\n\n\nOverall, the staff working document accompanying the proposal and assessing the regulatory fitness of the current rules concludes that the regulatory framework for electronic communications has broadly achieved its general objective of ensuring a competitive sector providing significant end-user benefits. Its main specific objectives \u2014 promoting competition, developing the internal market and cultivating end-user interest \u2014 remain relevant. However, it appears necessary to review the regulatory framework, including the BEREC Regulation, in order to address the growing need for increased connectivity of the digital single market and to streamline provisions taking into account market and technological developments.\n\n\nThe findings, according to the specific evaluation criteria, can be summarised as follows.\n\n\nRelevance \u2014 As far as the role and functioning of other important institutional players is concerned, BEREC must, in accordance with the provisions in force, pursue the objectives of the framework. In particular, it must ensure consistent implementation of the regulatory framework in order to contribute to the development and better functioning of the internal market. With this objective and its broader mandate, BEREC\u2019s relevance is increasing, even though there was no consensus in the public consultation on how to reflect this increase in regulatory terms.\n\n\nEffectiveness \u2014 There were mixed views in the public consultation on the telecoms review as regards the effectiveness of BEREC\u2019s role in supporting consistent outcomes. Some stakeholders see BEREC\u2019s independent technical advice and its role in the market review process in a positive light. Others think that its structure as a group of NRAs without legal personality undermines BEREC\u2019s incentives to work to achieve internal market objectives as opposed to the individual or collective objectives of its national members. Respondents said that BEREC needed to be more proactive on key topics. They also said that as a result of its current institutional set-up, BEREC often opts for greater flexibility or the lowest common denominator instead of adopting a harmonised approach for the single market.\n\n\nWith regard to its current tasks, in view of the Opinion on the Review of the EU Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework\n6\n, BEREC has identified some areas in which it could play a greater role. For example, broader scope of BEREC Opinions under Article 7 and 7a, issues of a cross-border nature (such as international roaming), benchmarking the quality of internet access services at Union level, and developing technical guidelines.\n\n\nRegarding the alignment of the goals of the BEREC Office as a Union agency with current Union priorities, the evaluation concluded that, by supporting BEREC, the current functions of the BEREC Office should ultimately contribute to the development of the single market and the consistent implementation of the rules. Nonetheless, the situation is unique, in which an agency was set up to exclusively perform a support function for another regulatory body set up under Union law. This presents certain challenges because, despite its relatively limited functions, the BEREC Office has to follow the same detailed set of rules that apply to all Union decentralised agencies (financial, staff/implementing rules, procurement, reporting, etc.).\n\n\nEfficiency \u2014 It was not possible to carry out a precise cost calculation, but the evaluation has shown that the benefits of the framework \u2014 for most operators, end-users and society as a whole \u2014 greatly outweigh the costs of implementing it.\n\n\nIn many respects, the BEREC Office is not in line with the principles of the Common Approach. The limited tasks and size of the Office compared to other Union agencies have negative implications for attracting and retaining staff and for organisational aspects. The current two-tier structure also results in inefficiencies. Although it is difficult to quantify such inefficiencies, the two-tier structure complicates matters and creates an administrative burden; for example, two separate annual reports and two work programmes need to be adopted \u2014 one by the Board of Regulators for BEREC and one by the Management Committee for the Office.\n\n\nThe evaluation has identified a number of issues that could be simplified and streamlined (the delegation of appointing authority powers, longer or extendable mandates for the Chair, majority voting rules, adequate resources, streamlining of the Management Committee and longer consultation periods or a two-stage consultation process for key policy matters).\n\n\nEU added value \u2014 The EU added value of setting up BEREC, in particular in terms of its advising the EU institutions, is linked to the functioning of the internal market for electronic communications. In general, this is positively perceived, but BEREC\u2019s effectiveness is at times questioned. Being more effective would increase its added value. The added value of the Office as an Union agency that supports BEREC is another relevant aspect.\n\n\n\nCoherence \u2014 Overall, the various instruments constituting the regulatory framework have complemented each other. However, the evaluation has identified a limited number of internal inconsistencies, such as the mismatch between the tasks of the independent NRAs and BEREC\u2019s tasks. This is because BEREC is sometimes expected to issue opinions at European level in areas, for which not all its NRA members are competent at national level. The evaluation has also shown that on some occasions the coordination between BEREC and the Commission has proved challenging. This was the case with regard to giving information to and getting information from BEREC and the Office on termination rates and roaming. There is room for improvement, so that each organisation can efficiently perform its tasks.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nA 12-week open public consultation was launched on 11\u00a0September 2015 to get input for the evaluation process to assess the current rules and to seek views on possible adaptations to the framework in the light of market and technological developments. It covered a general evaluation of the current framework and a detailed evaluation and review of the specific parts of the framework. They are:\n\n\n\uf0b7network access regulation, \n\n\n\uf0b7radio spectrum management and wireless connectivity,\n\n\n\uf0b7sector-specific regulation of communications services,\n\n\n\uf0b7universal service rules, \n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7institutional set-up and governance.\n\n\nThe consultation was both broad and detailed, with extensive input from consumers, providers of electronic communications networks and services, national and EU operator associations, civil society organisations, broadcasters, technology providers, internet and online service providers, businesses relying on connectivity and wider digital economy players, national authorities at all levels, national regulators and other interested stakeholders. Input came from stakeholders affected by the policy, those who have to implement it and those with a stated interest in the policy. The consultation received a total of 244 online replies from stakeholders in all Member States and from outside the Union. Halfway through, there was a public hearing on 11\u00a0November 2015.\n\n\nIn addition to the public consultation BEREC itself contributed to the evaluation and the review process and published its opinion in December 2015\n7\n. The RSPG also gave its opinion on the DSM Strategy and the Framework Review\n8\n.\n\n\nThe following trends emerged from the consultation process.\n\n\n\uf0b7Good connectivity is perceived as a necessary condition for the digital single market. Many respondents highlighted the need for policy measures and possible adjustments to current policy and regulatory tools to support the deployment of infrastructure in line with future needs.\n\n\n\uf0b7A number of respondents said that the current regulatory framework does not benefit much the internal market. There is a general perception that the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted to the current market dynamics. Nonetheless, many respondents recognised that the liberalisation of the telecoms markets had improved matters, in particular in terms of end-user benefits and competition within most national markets.\n\n\n\uf0b7With regard to radio spectrum, respondents recognised the importance of wireless connectivity and wireless broadband. In general, industry, which is in favour of a more coordinated approach, seeks additional certainty for investments and possibilities to develop new wireless and mobile communications, including 5G, throughout the Union.\n\n\n\uf0b7While the continuing role of NRAs and radio spectrum management authorities is widely acknowledged, almost half of the respondents stressed that the institutional set-up at Union level should be adjusted to ensure better legal certainty and accountability. They advocated the following changes:\n\n\n\uf0b7a clearer division of powers between the different institutions (to avoid overlapping),\n\n\n\uf0b7making sure that institutions are politically and legally accountable for their decisions,\n\n\n\uf0b7a high level of transparency in decision-making (greater stakeholder involvement).\n\n\nAs part of the evaluation process the Commission also commissioned a number of studies. They included public workshops that allowed stakeholders to comment and provide feedback on the ongoing evaluation work.\n\n\n\uf0b7On 6\u00a0April 2016 a public workshop was held to validate the interim findings of a study done by WIK, IDATE and Deloitte on \u2018regulatory, in particular access, regimes for network investments models in Europe\u2019 (SMART 2015/0002).\n\n\n\uf0b7On 2\u00a0May 2016 a public workshop was held to validate the interim findings of a study done by WIK, CRIDS and Cullen on \u2018Substantive issues for review in the areas of market entry, management of scarce resources and general end-user issues\u2019 (SMART 2015/0003).\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission used the following external expert advice:\n\n\n\uf0b7- Policy recommendations from other EU institutions, in particular the European Parliament\n9\n\u00a0and the European Council\n10\n.\n\n\n\uf0b7- Three review studies.\n\n\n\u2013\u2018Support for the preparation of the impact assessment accompanying the review of the regulatory framework for e-communications\u2019 (SMART 2015/0005).\n\n\n\u2013\u2018Regulatory, in particular access, regimes for network investment models in Europe\u2019 (SMART 2015/0002).\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2018Substantive issues for review in the areas of market entry, management of scarce resources and general consumer issues\u2019 (SMART 2015/0003).\n\n\n\uf0b7- In addition, a number of other studies have provided input to the review processs. These studies are listed in section 6.1.4 of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n\uf0b7- A high-level expert panel as part of of study SMART 2015/0005\n11\n.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe executive summary of the Impact Assessment and the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board can be found on the Commission website\n12\n.\n\n\nThe following governance options have been examined. The preferred option is Option 3, although the alignment of the structure of BEREC with the Common Approach is also considered in Option 2\n13\n.\n\n\nOption 1 \u2014 No change \u2014 baseline scenario\n\n\nThis option is based on the current provisions. The lack of current appropriate harmonisation of NRAs\u2019 competences has an impact. This is because the legislator has given BEREC a role in areas in which competence at national level is not harmonised for its members, such as the resolution of cross-border disputes.\n\n\nOption 2 \u2014 Enhanced advisory role and strengthened competences\n\n\nThis option envisages some adjustments to the current rules on the basis of the experience of the implementation of the framework in recent years and of the REFIT exercise, in particular strengthening the role of independent NRAs by laying down a minimum set of competences for those NRAs across the Union.\n\n\nAt Union level, BEREC should extend its advisory role to the areas in which the independent NRAs are competent in order to bring its tasks into line with those of the NRAs. However, to make it more efficient and provide more stable management, BEREC\u2019s governance structure would be adapted to bring it closely into line with the Common Approach. This means that a body with legal personality would perform the regulatory functions under BEREC\u2019s aegis.\n\n\nA new Management Board would be set up to oversee the general orientations for the agency's activities, replacing the current Board of Regulators and Management Committee. A more stable governance structure is envisaged by appointing a chairperson (to be selected from amongst the members of the Management Board) for a longer term of office (currently the term is one year). The Executive Director will have more powers than the current Administrative Manager of the Office and will be selected from a list of candidates proposed by the Commission following an open selection procedure as envisaged under the Common Approach and as in other agencies.\n\n\nOption 3 \u2014 Advisory role with certain pre-normative powers and better market review process and spectrum assignment of right of use for radio spectrum\n\n\nThis option contains most aspects of Option 2, in particular the minimum set of harmonised competences (including a competence to define the regulatory and market-shaping aspects of electronic communications network and services assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum) and the alignment of NRAs\u2019 and BEREC\u2019s tasks, as well as the substantial alignment of BEREC\u2019s governance structure with the Common Approach .\n\n\nBEREC will be given some additional tasks, such as powers to adopt binding decisions on the identification of transnational markets and on a contract summary template; quasi-binding powers in relation to the internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation (the \u2018double-lock\u2019 system \u2013 see below) and the establishment of a single maximum termination rate for the Union; and the issuing of guidelines in a number of areas: geographical surveys, common approaches to meeting transnational demand, minimum criteria for reference offers, common criteria for the management of numbering resources, quality-of-service parameters, applicable measurement methods and the technical details of the cost model to be applied by NRAs when setting maximum symmetric termination rates. It will also be given the power to request information directly from operators.\n\n\nBEREC will also be in charge of setting up a register for the extraterritorial use of numbers and cross-border arrangements and another register of providers of electronic communications networks and services. It will also assist the Commission and NRAs in the area of standardisation by helping them identify a threat to end-to-end connectivity or to effective access to emergency services. This could be done by imposing existing standards and setting new standards.\n\n\nTo improve the current situation, in which the Commission and BEREC have only non-binding powers with regard to remedies, a \u2018double-lock\u2019 system is proposed. In such a system, if BEREC and the Commission agree on their position regarding the draft remedies an NRA proposes, the Commission could require the NRA to amend or withdraw the draft measure and, if necessary, to re-notify the market analysis. A \u2018peer review\u2019 system within BEREC will also be introduced as a new coordination mechanism to improve efficiency and coherence amongst Member States with regard to regulatory market aspects of assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum.\n\n\nOption 4 \u2014 EU regulator with certain implementation/execution powers\n\n\nThis option looks at setting up an EU regulator, as a reinforced agency with the necessary resources to accommodate a transfer of implementing powers, including supervision and enforcement powers. It could act with binding powers in areas in which it is necessary to ensure the uniform implementation of EU rules. One such area is new pan-EU or global services, currently largely unregulated or subject to unclear regulatory frameworks (M2M\u00a0, OTT and other areas of great importance to the Union, such as roaming or transnational markets).\n\n\n\nWith regard to radio spectrum, there would also be a preliminary peer review mechanism involving the EU regulator, possibly with a Commission veto. The EU regulator could also coordinate binding pan-European assignment procedures for specific bands. Finally, the agency would also institutionalise a good office mediation service for cross-border interference and regulatory issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe policy measures proposed under the preferred option are in line with the REFIT agenda because they aim to simplify and reduce the administrative burden in line with the findings of the evaluation of the REFIT potential of the review. Several of the proposed changes in governance and other policy areas aim to make rules clear; enable parties to easily understand their rights and obligations; and to avoid overregulation and administrative burdens.\n\n\nWith a view to having a more efficient and streamlined institutional set-up and taking the REFIT evaluation into account, the proposal contains a number of changes that would bring BEREC into line with the Common Approach and the structure of other Union agencies. The proposal that BEREC becomes a Union decentralised agency should achieve certain level of efficiency gains and synergies, in order to partly offset the need for additional resources to fulfil the new tasks entrusted to BEREC.\n\n\n- A Union decentralised agency will be set up with an appropriate structure and governance, mandate and powers. It will strengthen legal and political accountability because all decisions (regulatory, administrative, financial, etc.) will now be adopted under the aegis of a Union agency with legal personality. \n\n\n- The governance structure will be simplified by replacing the two current managing structures (the Board of Regulators for regulatory decisions and the Management Committee for administrative and financial decisions) by a single Management Board. This will reduce the administrative burden by putting an end to the current duplication of agendas, working programmes, annual reports, document registers, member appointments, etc.\n\n\n- An Executive Director will be appointed at the head of the agency, to be the legal representative of BEREC and responsible for the performance of the tasks assigned to the agency. In particular, he/she will have delegated \u2018appointing authority powers\u2019. This would make management of the staff of the agency more efficient (under the current BEREC Regulation, these powers are given to the Vice-Chair, whose term of office is one year, and they cannot be delegated/sub-delegated).\n\n\n- The Chairperson of the Management Board (four years renewable, currently one year) and the Executive Director (five years renewable, currently\u00a0three years renewable) will have longer terms of office to ensure the necessary continuity and stability.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, BEREC would be better equipped to help the Commission and the NRAs, and efficiency gains derived from the areas highlighted above would be achieved. This proposal contributes to an efficient Union system of regulatory authorities in the digital single market and should provide the necessary support for an efficient implementation of the revised telecoms framework.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal also takes full account of the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, the proposed measures, including setting up BEREC, aim to increase connectivity with a modernised set of end-user protection rules. This will in turn ensure non-discriminatory access to any content and services, including public services. It will also help promote freedom of expression and of business and enable Member States to comply with the charter at a much lower cost in the future.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nBEREC, which is to be set up on the basis of the existing BEREC and BEREC Office, is given a number of tasks which aim to ensure a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework, thus contributing to the development of the electronic communications market throughout the Union, the promotion of access to and take-up of very high capacity data connectivity by all Union citizens and businesses, of competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and services and of the interests of the citizens of the Union.\n\n\n\nThe total financial resources necessary for BEREC to fulfil its mission amount to EUR 14.135 million for the period 2019-2020\n14\n. In addition to the contribution from the Union, BEREC may collect charges for publications and other services provided, contributions from third countries or the electronic communications regulatory authorities of third countries participating in the work of BEREC and voluntary contributions from the Member States and NRAs\n15\n. \n\n\n\nThe new agency is expected to continue in the future the current service agreements with the Commission (accounting officer and using certain applications and tools) and with other Union agencies (in particular with ENISA as regards off-site storage of back-up data and the internal control coordinator), which could be even further expanded to new areas in order to achieve further efficiency gains and synergies.\n\n\nIn addition to the existing number of staff members, BEREC should calculate 11\u00a0contractual agents and 7 seconded national experts to make up a total of 44 staff members by the end of the period 2019-2020\n16\n. Based on the Impact Assessment, and without prejudging the next MFF, the total additional staff needed by BEREC in order to fulfil its new tasks under the enlarged mandate is estimated at 34 FTEs, envisioning an overall staff figure of 60 FTEs at the end of the implementation period 2019-2022.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nIn line with the Common Approach, the current proposal foresees that the Commission must perform an evaluation within five years of entry into force of this regulation, and every five years after that, to assess, in compliance with the Commission guidelines, BEREC\u2019s performance in relation to its objectives, mandate, tasks and location(s). The evaluation should, in particular, address the possible need to modify the mandate of BEREC and the financial implications of any such modification. If the Commission considers that the continuation of BEREC is no longer justified with regard to its assigned objectives, mandate and tasks, it may propose that this regulation be amended accordingly or be repealed. The Commission must report on the findings of the evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board. The findings of the evaluation must be made public.\n\n\nBEREC would also issue annual activity reports evaluating the results of its activities throughout the year. Annual activity reports must be transmitted to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Auditors and must be made public.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission will continue to ensure that the implementation of the regulatory framework is monitored on the basis of the following.\n\n\nThe European Digital Progress Report\n\n\nThe European Digital Progress Report (EDPR), covering 28\u00a0Member States, provides comprehensive data and analysis of market, regulatory and consumer developments in the digital economy. It combines the reports and all evidence published for the Digital Scoreboard\n17\n with the Telecom Implementation Report, and adds country reports. In this way, it draws on evidence from:\n\n\n\u2013Digital Scoreboard. This measures the progress of the European digital economy. It draws on data provided by the NRAs, Eurostat and additional relevant sources and includes data relating to the general situation regarding all aspects of the Digital Economy Society Index in the EU Member States\n18\n. The indicators included in the report make it possible to compare progress across European countries as well as over time.\n\n\n\u2013Telecom reports on European electronic communications regulation and markets. These provide comprehensive data and analysis of market, regulatory and consumer developments in the sector.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives).\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009 set up the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office and the tasks of each. This proposal broadens the current mandate of BEREC and turns it into a fully fledged agency equipped with the necessary tools and adequate resources to achieve its objectives and carry out its tasks.\n\n\n\n(1) Establishment, scope and objectives:\n\n\n\nChapter I \u2018Objectives and tasks\u2019\n\n\nArticle 1 sets up BEREC and provides for the scope of application of the regulation, definitions and the objectives of BEREC, which should aim to achieve the same objectives as NRAs.\n\n\nArticle 2 enumerates BEREC\u2019s tasks. It adds that BEREC may cooperate with Union bodies, agencies, offices and advisory groups, with competent authorities of third countries and/or with international organisations if necessary and should consult interested parties if appropriate.\n\n\nChapter II \u2018Administrative and Management Structure\u2019\n\n\nArticle 3 concerns the administrative and management structure of BEREC, which comprises a Management Board, an Executive Director, Working Groups and a Board of Appeal.\n\n\nArticles 4-5 stipulate that the Management Board is to be composed of the head, or a member of the collegiate body, of each NRA, and two representatives of the Commission, all with voting rights. It also sets out its functions. In particular, the Management Board should delegate relevant appointing authority powers to the Executive Director. The Executive Director should be authorised to sub-delegate those powers, defining the conditions under which this delegation of powers can be suspended.\n\n\nArticle 6 stipulates that the Management Board elects a Chairperson and a Deputy Chairperson from among its members, by a majority of two thirds and for a four-year term of office, renewable once.\n\n\nArticles 7-8 set out the minimum number of ordinary meetings a year for the Management Board (two) and its voting rules (majority by default).\n\n\nArticles 9 sets out the responsibilities of the Executive Director, who should manage the agency and be its legal representative. The Executive Director is accountable to the Management Board and shall report to the European Parliament and may be invited to report to the Council on the performance of his/her duties. \n\n\n\n\nArticles 10 sets out that the Management Board may set up working groups as necessary, which would be coordinated and moderated by a member of the BEREC staff. For the establishment of certain working groups, lists of qualified experts should be ready beforehand.\n\n\nArticles 11-14 set up the Board of Appeal and set out its composition and the appointment of its members, who should be independent and not perform any other duties within BEREC. Any natural or legal person, including NRAs, may appeal against a binding decision issued by BEREC. Such appeals should not have a suspensory effect, but the Board of Appeal may suspend the application of the decision.\n\n\nChapter III \u2018Annual and multi-annual programming\u2019\n\n\nArticle 15 sets out the procedure for the adoption of the annual and multi-annual programming document. It should include the strategy for relations with Union bodies, agencies, offices and advisory groups, with competent authorities of third countries and/or with international organisations.\n\n\nArticles 16-17 provides for the establishment of BEREC\u2019s budget and its structure in terms of revenue and expenditure.\n\n\nArticles 18-20 state that the Executive Director is responsible for implementing BEREC\u2019s budget and sets out the procedure for the presentation of accounts and discharge. The Management Board should adopt the financial rules applicable to BEREC.\n\n\nChapter IV \u2018Staff\u2019\n\n\nArticle 21 states that the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants and implementing rules adopted to give effect to them shall apply to the BEREC staff.\n\n\nArticle 22 sets out the procedure for the Management Board to appoint the Executive Director from a list of candidates proposed by the Commission, for a five-year renewable term of office, as well as for the extension of his/her term of office or his/her removal from office.\n\n\nArticle 23 states that BEREC can make use of seconded national experts or other staff not employed by BEREC, to whom the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants will not apply.\n\n\nChapter V \u2018General provisions\u2019\n\n\nArticles 24-25 stipulate that BEREC should have legal personality and be a Union body. The Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union applies to BEREC and its staff.\n\n\nArticle 26 states that, where necessary, BEREC may cooperate with competent Union bodies, agencies, offices and advisory groups; with competent authorities of third countries and/or with international organisations. This cooperation should be based on working arrangements, which should receive prior approval from the Commission. In line with the Common Approach, the Commission and the agency should conclude an appropriate working arrangement aiming at ensuring that BEREC operates within its mandate and the existing institutional framework. This article also stipulates that BEREC is open to the participation of regulatory authorities of third countries competent in electronic communications that have entered into agreements with the Union to that effect.\n\n\nArticle 27 states that Regulation (EC) No\u00a01049/2001 applies to documents BEREC holds and that the processing of personal data by BEREC will be subject to Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001. It also states that BEREC may engage in communication activities on its own initiative within its area of competence.\n\n\nArticle 28 refers to the confidentiality rules to be followed by BEREC.\n\n\nArticle 29 refers to the security rules for protecting classified and sensitive non-classified information to be adopted by BEREC.\n\n\nArticle 30 stipulates that the Commission and the NRAs give BEREC information (and vice versa). It also stipulates that, as a last resort, BEREC may request necessary information from other authorities and undertakings.\n\n\nArticle 31 stipulates the need for the members of the Management Board, the Executive Director, seconded national experts and other staff not employed by BEREC to make a declaration indicating their commitment and the absence or presence of any direct or indirect interest which might be considered prejudicial to their independence; as well as for these and experts participating in working groups to declare any interest which might be considered prejudicial to their independence in relation to the items on the agenda.\n\n\nArticle 32 stipulates that BEREC accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25\u00a0May 1999 concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) and adopt appropriate provisions applicable to all employees of BEREC.\n\n\nArticle 33 includes provisions on BEREC\u2019s contractual liability.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 34 stipulates that the activities of BEREC be subject to the inquiries of the European Ombudsman in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty.\n\n\nArticle 35 stipulates that Regulation No\u00a01/58 applies to BEREC and that the Translation Centre of the bodies of the EU provide the translation services required for the functioning of BEREC .\n\n\nArticle 36 refers to the procedure for establishing the rules of procedure of the Board of Appeal, for which the Commission is conferred implementing powers.\n\n\nChapter VI \u2018Transitional and final provisions\u2019\n\n\nArticle 37 stipulates the need for a Headquarters Agreement to be concluded between BEREC and the Member State in which they are located. BEREC\u2019s host Member State shall provide the conditions necessary to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of BEREC, including multilingual, European-oriented schooling and appropriate transport connections.\n\n\nArticle 38 stipulates that the Commission must perform an evaluation within five years of entry into force of this regulation, and every five years after that, to assess, in compliance with the Commission guidelines, BEREC\u2019s performance in relation to its objectives, mandate, tasks and location(s). The Commission must report on the findings of the evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board and they must be made public.\n\n\nArticle 39 stipulates that BEREC succeeds the Office set up under Regulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009 with regard to all ownership, agreements, legal obligations, employment contracts, financial commitments and liabilities. This article also sets out transitional provisions with regard to the Administrative Manager acting as interim Executive Director, the contract of the Administrative Manager, the composition of the Management Board and the discharge procedure.\n\n\nArticle 40 states that Regulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009 is repealed and references to it and to the BEREC Office are to be construed as references to this regulation and to BEREC.\n\n\n\nArticle 41 contains the standard clause for entry into force of the regulation and provides for the deferred application of some of its provisions.\n\n\n\n\n2016/0286 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nestablishing the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n19\n,\n\n\n\n\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions\n20\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Directive [...] of the European Parliament and of the Council\n\n\n21\n\n\n (\u2018the Directive\u2019), which establishes a number of tasks for the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (\u2018BEREC\u2019), and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n\n\n22\n\n\n aim to create an internal market for electronic communications within the Union while ensuring a high level of investment, innovation and consumer protection through enhanced competition.\n\n\n(2)Regulation (EC) No\u00a0531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n23\n complements and supports, in so far as Union-wide roaming is concerned, the rules provided for by the regulatory framework for electronic communications and establishes certain tasks for BEREC.\n\n\n(3)Regulation (EU) No\u00a02015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n24\n establishes common rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users\u2019 rights and sets up a new retail pricing mechanism for Union-wide regulated roaming services. This regulation establishes additional tasks for BEREC, in particular the issuing of guidelines on the implementation of national regulatory authorities (\u2018NRAs\u2019) obligations in relation to open internet access as well as reporting and consultation on draft implementing acts to be adopted by the Commission in relation to Union-wide roaming.\n\n\n(4)BEREC and the Office (\u2018BEREC Office\u2019) were established by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n25\n. BEREC replaced the European Regulators Group (\u2018ERG\u2019)\n26\n and was meant to contribute to the development and better functioning of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services by aiming to ensure a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. The BEREC Office was established as a Community body with legal personality to carry out the tasks referred to in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009, in particular the provision of professional and administrative support services to BEREC.\n\n\n(5)In its Communication of 6\u00a0May 2015 entitled \u2018A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\u2019\n27\n, the Commission envisaged presenting proposals in 2016 for an ambitious overhaul of the regulatory framework for electronic communications focusing inter alia on a more effective regulatory institutional framework in order to make the telecoms rules fit for purpose as part of the creation of the right conditions for the digital single market. These include the deployment of very high capacity connectivity networks, more coordinated management of radio spectrum for wireless networks and creating a level playing field for advanced digital networks and innovative services. The Communication pointed out that the changing market and technological environment make it necessary to strengthen the institutional framework by enhancing the role of BEREC.\n\n\n(6)In its Resolution of 19\u00a0January 2016 \u2018Towards a Digital Single Market Act\u2019, the European Parliament called on the Commission to integrate further the digital single market by ensuring that a more efficient institutional framework is in place. It can do this by strengthening the role, capacity and decision-making powers of BEREC in order to allow it to foster the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, to enable an efficient oversight of BEREC over the development of the single market and to help it to resolve cross-border disputes. The European Parliament also stresses, in this regard, the need to improve the financial and human resources and further enhance the governance structure of BEREC.\n\n\n(7)BEREC and the BEREC Office have made a positive contribution towards a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. Notwithstanding, there are still significant disparities between Member States as regards regulatory practice. Moreover, the governance structure of BEREC and the BEREC Office is cumbersome and gives rise to unnecessary administrative burden. In order to ensure efficiency gains and synergies and to further contribute to the development of the internal market for electronic communications throughout the Union as well as to the promotion of access to, and take-up of, very high capacity data connectivity, competition in the provision of electronic communications networks, services and associated facilities and the interests of the citizens of the Union, this regulation aims to strengthen the role of BEREC and enhance its governance structure by establishing BEREC as a Union decentralised agency. This also corresponds to the need to reflect the significantly enhanced role played by BEREC following Regulation (EC) No\u00a0531/2012 which establishes tasks for BEREC in relation to Union-wide roaming, Regulation (EU) No\u00a02015/2120 which establishes tasks for BEREC in relation to open internet access and Union-wide roaming, and the Directive which establishes a significant number of new tasks for BEREC such as issuing decisions and guidelines on several topics, reporting on technical matters, keeping registers and delivering opinions on internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation as well as on assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum. \n\n\n(8)The need for the regulatory framework for electronic communications to be consistently applied in all Member States is essential for the successful development of an internal market for electronic communications throughout the Union and the promotion of access to, and take-up of, very high capacity data connectivity, of competition in the provision of electronic communications networks, services and associated facilities and of the interests of the citizens of the Union. In view of market and technological developments, which often entails an increased cross-border dimension, and to the experience so far in ensuring a consistent implementation in the electronic communications field, it is necessary to build on the work of BEREC and the BEREC Office and further develop them into a fully-fledged agency.\n\n\n(9)The agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission of 19 July 2012 on decentralised agencies (\u2018Common Approach\u2019)\n28\n. Due to the established image of BEREC and the costs that a modification of its name would entail, the new agency should retain the name of BEREC. \n\n\n(10)BEREC, as a technical body with expertise on electronic communications and composed of representatives from NRAs and the Commission, is best placed to be entrusted with tasks such as deciding on certain issues with a cross-border dimension, contributing to efficient internal market procedures for draft national measures (both as regards market regulation and assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum), providing the necessary guidelines to NRAs in order to ensure common criteria and a consistent regulatory approach, and keeping certain registries at Union level. This is without prejudice to the tasks established for NRAs, which are closest to the electronic communications markets and their local conditions. In order to carry out its tasks, the agency would require adequate financial and human resources and would also continue the pooling of expertise from NRAs.\n\n\n(11)BEREC should be allowed if necessary to cooperate with, and without prejudice to the role of, other Union bodies, agencies, offices and advisory groups, in particular the Radio Spectrum Policy Group\n29\n, the European Data Protection Board\n30\n, the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services\n31\n and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security\n32\n; as well as with existing committees (such as the Communications Committee and the Radio Spectrum Committee). It should also be allowed to cooperate with competent authorities of third countries, in particular, regulatory authorities competent in the field of electronic communications and/or groups of those authorities, as well as with international organisations when necessary for the performance of its tasks.\n\n\n(12)Compared to the situation in the past where both a Board of Regulators and a Management Committee were running in parallel, having a single board giving general orientations for the activities of BEREC, deciding on regulatory and operational as well as on administrative and budgetary management matters should help improving the efficiency, coherence and performance of the agency. To this end, the Management Board should carry the relevant functions and should consist, in addition of two representatives of the Commission, of the Head, or otherwise a member of the collegiate body, of each NRA, who are protected by dismissal requirements.\n\n\n(13)In the past the appointing authority powers were exercised by the Vice-Chair of the Management Committee of the BEREC Office. The Management Board of the new agency should delegate relevant appointing authority powers to the Executive Director, who would be authorised to sub-delegate those powers. This would contribute to an efficient management of the BEREC staff as well as to ensuring that the Management Committee, as well as the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, can concentrate on their functions.\n\n\n(14)In the past the term of office of the Chair and of the Vice-Chairs of the Board of Regulators was one year. In view of the additional tasks assigned to BEREC and the need to ensure annual and multiannual programming for its activities, it is crucial to ensure that the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson  benefit from a stable and long-term mandate.\n\n\n(15)The Management Board should hold at least two ordinary meetings a year. In view of past experience and the enhanced role of BEREC, the Management Board may need to hold additional meetings.\n\n\n(16)The role of the Executive Director, who would be the legal representative of BEREC, is crucial for the adequate functioning of the new agency and the implementation of the tasks assigned to it. The Management Board should appoint him/her on the basis of a list drawn up by the Commission following an open and transparent selection procedure in order to guarantee a rigourous evaluation of the candidates and a high level of independence. Moreover, in the past the term of office of the Administrative Manager of the BEREC Office was three years. It is necessary that the Executive Director has a sufficiently long mandate in order to ensure stability and delivery of a long-term strategy for the agency.\n\n\n(17)Experience has shown that most of BEREC\u2019s tasks are better carried out through working groups, therefore the Management Board should be in charge of setting up working groups and appointing their members. In order to ensure a balanced approach, the working groups should be coordinated and moderated by members of the BEREC staff. Lists of qualified experts should be prepared in advance to ensure a quick set-up of certain working groups, in particular those related to internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation and on assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum, due to the time limits of those procedures.\n\n\n\n\n(18)As BEREC is competent for taking decisions with a binding effect, it is necessary to ensure that any natural or legal person subject to, or concerned by, a decision of BEREC has the right of appeal to a Board of Appeal, which is part of the agency but independent from its administrative and regulatory structure. As the decisions issued by the Board of Appeal are intended to produce legal effects towards third parties, an action for review of their legality may be brought to the General Court. In order to ensure uniform conditions as regards the rules of procedure of the Board of Appeal, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n33\n.\n\n\n(19)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No\u00a01271/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n34\n should apply to BEREC.\n\n\n(20)In order to guarantee BEREC\u2019s autonomy, it should have its own budget, most of which comes essentially from a contribution from the Union. The financing of BEREC should be subject to an agreement by the budgetary authority as set out in point 31 of the Inter-institutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management\n35\n.\n\n\n(21)BEREC should be independent as regards operational and technical matters and should enjoy legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary and appropriate that BEREC should be a body of the Union having legal personality and exercising the powers conferred upon it. \n\n\n(22)As a Union decentralised agency, BEREC should operate within its mandate and the existing institutional framework. It should not be seen as representing a Union position to an outside audience or as committing the Union to legal obligations.\n\n\n(23)In order to further extend the consistent implementation of the provisions of the regulatory framework for electronic communications within the scope of BEREC, the new agency should be open to the participation of regulatory authorities of third countries competent in the field of electronic communications that have entered into agreements with the Union to that effect, in particular those of EEA EFTA States and candidate countries.\n\n\n(24)BEREC should be allowed to engage in communication activities within its field of competence, which should not be detrimental to BEREC\u2019s core tasks and should be carried out in accordance with relevant communication and dissemination plans adopted by the Management Board. The content and implementation of BEREC\u2019s communication strategy should be coherent, relevant and coordinated with the strategies and activities of the Commission and the other institutions in order to take into consideration the broader image of the Union.\n\n\n(25)In order to carry out its tasks effectively, BEREC should have the right to request all necessary information from the Commission, the NRAs and, as a last resort, other authorities and undertakings. Requests for information should be proportionate and not impose an undue burden on the addressees. NRAs, which are closest to the electronic communications markets, should cooperate with BEREC and have a timely and accurate provision of information to ensure that BEREC is able to fulfil its mandate. BEREC should also share with the Commission and the NRAs the necessary information based on the principle of sincere cooperation.\n\n\n(26)Since the objectives of this regulation, namely the need to ensure a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications within the defined scope, in particular in relation to cross-border aspects and through efficient internal market procedures for draft national measures, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n(27)This regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Since the amendments to be made are of a substantial nature, that act should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced and therefore repealed. References to the repealed regulation should be construed as references to this regulation.\n\n\n(28)The BEREC Office, which was established as a Community body with legal personality by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01211/2009, is succeeded by BEREC as regards all ownership, agreements, legal obligations, employment contracts, financial commitments and liabilities. BEREC should take over the staff of the BEREC Office\u00a0whose rights and obligations should not be affected,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nchapter i\n\n\nobjectives and tasks\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nEstablishment and objectives\n\n\n1. The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (\u2018BEREC\u2019) is hereby established.\n\n\n2. BEREC shall act within the scope of Directive [...], Directive 2002/58/EC, Regulation (EC) No\u00a0531/2012, Regulation (EU) No\u00a02015/2120 and Decision 243/2012/EU\n36\n (Radio Spectrum Policy Programme).\n\n\nThe definitions laid down in those Directives, Regulations and Decision shall apply for the purposes of this regulation.\n\n\n3. BEREC shall pursue the same objectives as those of national regulatory authorities (\u2018NRAs\u2019) referred to in Article\u00a03 of the Directive.

Regulatory consistency has been achieved only to a limited extent, affecting the operations of cross-border providers and reducing predictability for all operators and investors.\n\n\nThe proposed measures aim at fostering the development of a true internal market for electronic communications in the Union, notably through a greater coordination of regulatory remedies and consistency in the regulation and design of access products needed to support a real pan-European telecoms market, which is of particular relevance to business end-users. Measures are also envisaged to stimulate competition to invest in very high capacity data connectivity across the Union and to ensure network deployment reaches all geographical areas to breach digital divides. Furthermore the level playing between traditional telecoms operators and internet-based communications services will be addressed and a number of new provisions are envisaged to protect end-users against certain communications-specific risks while removing redundant or overlapping rules on consumer protection.\n\n\nAn adequate and efficient institutional set-up is key to ensure a positive and coherent outcome of the overall telecoms regulatory framework and is critical for the digital single market. NRAs competences will be strengthened and harmonised and certain tasks will be better addressed at European level. The DSM strategy indicated that the changing market and technological environment calls for strengthening the institutional framework and that enhancing the role of BEREC will also be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEREC will have an important and strengthened role to play in ensuring effective implementation of the proposed legislative package with a number of additional tasks, including some \u2018pre-normative tasks\u2019 and binding powers, the provision of guidelines and report and the keeping of registers.\n\n\nBEREC, being developed into a fully-fledged agency, would therefore become a key actor to serve the objective of achieving an internal telecoms market in the Union. The call on BEREC to contribute to shaping technical and policy orientations will be increased. Therefore, the proposed measures are strengthening BEREC\u2019s structure, including giving it a legal personality and providing additional stability for its strategic management. BEREC would also receive the power to request information directly from operators.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\n\nSpecific objective No   \n\n\nBEREC is contributing to the improvement of the functioning of the internal market, for the benefit of both consumers and industry. The proposed measure, which significantly aligns the new agency with the Common Approach\n50\n, strengthens BEREC\u2019s structure and makes it the cornerstone of an efficient Union system of regulatory authorities. It also gives BEREC a coordinating role in all areas of competence of national regulatory authorities, thus strengthening its role for the internal market and ensuring an efficient implemtation and follow-up in relation to the ist various deliverables.\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nRegulatory framework for electronic communications.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe initiative is expected to bring the following impacts:\n\n\nThe aim is to transform BEREC into a fully fledged agency (in line with the Common Approach) capable of contributing to the better functioning of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services, including in particular the development of cross-border electronic communications services, and of effectively carrying out the tasks assigned to it.\n\n\nSee the accompanying Impact Assessment for more details.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact\n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\n\nThe monitoring indicators per objective are as follows:\n\n\n- number of times that BEREC assist the Commission, on request and on its own initiative\n\n\n- number of times that BEREC assist the NRAs, on request and on its own initiative\n\n\n- number of relevant binding decisions adopted by BEREC in the relevant areas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- number of opinions issued by BEREC, in particular in relation to the internal market procedures for market regulation and for radio spectrum peer review\n\n\n- number of guidelines issued by BEREC in the relevant areas\n\n\n- number of reports issued by BEREC in the relevant areas\n\n\n- number of recommendations and best practices issued by BEREC addressed to NRAs\n\n\n- number of activities with partners and stakeholders\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative\n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term\n\n\n\nWithout prejudice to the specificities of the sector, BEREC needs to be aligned with the Common Approach. In order to fulfil the overall objective of the development of consistent regulatory practice across the Union, its tasks need to encompass all areas which have an effect on the internal market, such as for instance market-shaping aspects of radio spectrum assignment procedures or general authorisation; and mirror the tasks assigned to national regulatory authorities as these will as from now be harmonised. Its administrative capacity needs to increase to match the ambition of the new tasks assigned to it.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nBEREC contributes to the development of consistent regulatory practice and the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. However the BEREC\u2019s current institutional set-up is often opting for greater flexibility or the lowest common denominator instead of focusing on a harmonised approach for the internal market. The new measures will increase the calls made upon BEREC to contribute to shaping technical and policy orientations. BEREC will have a crucial role, in the coming years, in furthering the digital single market; therefore the proposed measure is aiming at strengthening its structure, enhancing its competence and regulatory capacity and ensuring continuity of its action. BEREC work will however remain to be built on the expertise of NRAs representatives in the different working groups and the Heads of NRAs will continue to take the decisions at the Board level. The rootedness of BEREC in the NRAs is necessary in the light of the technical character of the decisions it will be called to make as well as of the current context of agencies' resource constraints.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe current architecture is made up of a body with legal personality (BEREC Office) which is the smallest agency in the Union and the BEREC Board of Regulators, without legal personality but adopting opinions in the area of its competence. This structure has proven its limits.\n\n\nIt did not prevent ambiguity in the implementation of Union rules and it has not succeeded in overcoming the administrative burden any agency despite its size is confronted with. On the contrary, it has originated unnecessary administrative burden (e.g. duplication of programming and reporting processes for BEREC and the BEREC Office, conferral of the appointing authority powers to the Vice-Chair of the Management Committee without possibility of delegating to the Administrative Manager and further sub-delegating). Furthermore it has only partially developed the necessary regulatory capacity to achieve its main objectives.\n\n\nBringing together BEREC and BEREC Office would, on the one hand, eliminate the abovementioned inefficiencies and, on the other, provide the new agency with additional resources to function with.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe proposal is part of the review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, which contributes to one of the pillars of the DSM Strategy launched in May 2015 and it is consistent : it is one of the main components of a package which is the cornerstone of Union legislation aiming at promoting competition, the internal market, end-users interest as well as at promoting the achievement of widespread access to, and take-up of, very high capacity data connectivity. It is consistent with Union competition and single market policy.\n\n\nIn the context of the proposal, efficiency gains and synergies with other existing Union agencies were analysed but discarded (see Impact Assessment for additional information).\n\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposition/initiative \u00e0 dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposition/initiative en vigueur \u00e0 partir de [JJ/MM]AAAA jusqu\u2019en [JJ/MM]AAAA\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incidence financi\u00e8re de AAAA jusqu\u2019en AAAA\n\n\n\u2611\u00a0Proposition/initiative \u00e0 dur\u00e9e illimit\u00e9e\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2019 to 2022\n51\n\n\n\n\u2013Followed by operation at cruising speed.\n\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) envisaged\n52\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2611 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u2611 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title\u00a0V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules\n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nMonitoring system\n\n\nIn accordance with the founding Regulation No 1211/2009, the Commission has an obligation to publish a report on the experience acquired as a result of the operation of BEREC and the BEREC Office within three years of the effective start of operations.\n\n\n\n53\nThe evaluation report of 2012 was focused, following the overall objectives of BEREC and the subsequent roles and tasks of BEREC and BEREC Office, on how efficiently, based on the experience so far, BEREC has succeeded in its role with a view to contributing to the development of the internal market for electronic communications. The scope of the evaluation was to provide an assessment of BEREC\u2019s and the BEREC Office\u2019s working practices, organisation and remit and if appropriate, recommendations for improvements. The evaluation was finalised in December 2012 and published. The evaluation study was also transmitted to European Parliament and Council; the European Parliament issued a Resolution containing its opinion on it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\nMore recently, in the context of the review, the Commission has commissioned three studies on \u2018Substantive issues for review in the areas of market entry, management of scarce resources and general end-users issue\u2019; on \u2018Regulatory, in particular access, regimes for network investment models in Europe\u2019\u00a0and on the \u2018Impact Assessment for the Review of the Framework for electronic communications\u2019. The last two studies also assessed the structure of BEREC, and the way it has so far carried out its main tasks.\n\n\nThe new agency will be reviewed and evaluated periodically. Within five years from the entry into force of the regulation, and then every five years thereafter, the Commission will perform an evaluation in compliance with the Commission guidelines to assess BEREC\u2019s performance in relation to its objectives, mandate, tasks and location(s). The evaluation will, in particular, address the possible need to modify the mandate of BEREC, and the financial implications of any such modification. The Commission must report on the findings of the evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board. The findings of the evaluation must be made public.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system\n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified\n\n\n\nThe risks identified are limited: a Union agency exists already but will be transformed and aligned to the Common Approach and it will get new competences and tasks. The proposal would therefore strengthen its organisational function and lead to efficiency gains. The increase of operational competences and tasks does not represent a real risk, provided adequate resources are foreseen. The significant new advisory competences relate to areas in which the national regulatory authorities have expertise, on which BEREC can build through its collaborative structure, while the decision making and pre-normative competences concern areas where BEREC already has advisory experience, albeit the scale of these tasks will increase.\n\n\nFurthermore the proposed structure, governance and operation model of the agency, as per the Common Approach, ensure that there is a sufficient control in place to make sure that BEREC works towards its objectives. The operational and financial risks of the proposed changes seem to be limited.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Control method(s) envisaged\n\n\n\nSee point 2.1 and point 2.2 above.\n\n\nThe agency's accounts will be submitted for approval of the Court of Auditors and subject to the discharge procedure and audits are envisaged. \n\n\nAlso the operations of the agency are subject to the supervision of the Ombudsman in accordance with the provisions of Article 228 of the Treaty.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities\n\n\n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe BEREC\u2019s prevention and protection measures would apply, specifically:\n\n\n- Payments for any service or studies requested are checked by the agency\u2019s staff prior to payment, taking into account any contractual obligations, economic principles and good financial or management practice. Anti-fraud provisions (supervision, reporting requirements, etc.) will be included in all agreements and contracts concluded between the agency and recipients of any payments.\n\n\n- In order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\u00a0883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) shall apply without restriction.\n\n\n- The agency shall accede, within six months form the day of entry into force of this regulation, to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25\u00a0May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate provisions applicable to all the employees of the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\n\n\n\uf0b7Existing budget lines\n\n\nIn order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading of multiannual financial framework\n\n\n\n\nBudget line\n\n\n\n\nType of \nexpenditure\n\n\n\n\nContribution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber/Description\n\n\n\n\nDiff./non-diff.\n\n(\n57\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom EFTA countries\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom candidate countries\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom third countries\n\n\n\n\nwithin the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.a Competitiveness for growth and employment\n\n\n\n\n\n09 02 04\n\n\u00a0Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) \u2014 Office \u2014 Subsidy\n\n\n\n\nDiff...\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

play in ensuring effective implementation of the proposed legislative package with a number of additional tasks. These tasks are of technical nature and will focus on areas where there is a cross-border dimension or where guidance from BEREC could help NRAs to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications.\n\n\nIn particular, BEREC will have some \u2018pre-normative tasks\u2019 (in particular, in relation to the calculation of maximum termination rates) as well as certain binding powers since it will issue decisions on the identification of transnational markets and on a contract summary template (these new tasks are included under \u2018Pre-normative tasks and binding powers\u2019, see table above).\n\n\nIt will also issue guidelines on the implementation of NRAs\u2019 obligations as regards geographical surveys of infrastructure/investment, as well as on common approaches to meet transnational end-user demand. It will also adopt guidelines on the minimum criteria for a reference offer, on cost models for setting termination rates, on numbering management requirements, and on relevant quality of service parameters and the applicable measurement methods. Furthermore, BEREC shall report on the possible threat to end-to-end connectivity between end-users or threat to effective access to emergency services, in the context of identifying the need for standards (these new tasks are included under \u2018Regulatory guidance\u2019).\n\n\nBEREC\u2019s role in relation to the internal market procedures for market regulation is reinforced. BEREC\u2019s opinion will now have an authoritative role when the Commission decides whether the NRA concerned should withdraw the draft regulatory measure. It is proposed that only where BEREC shares the serious doubts of the Commission, the latter would be allowed to take a decision requiring the NRA to withdraw the notified measures (these new tasks are included under \u2018Market review\u2019).\n\n\n\n\nBEREC will also be in charge of a new \u2018peer review\u2019 process in relation to the assignment process of right of use for radio spectrum. This concerns primarily the review of national measures when assigning radio spectrum rights of use that can affect the functioning of wireless markets or otherwise significantly shape the valuation of radio spectrum resources. BEREC will issue (non-binding) opinions on these draft measures based on a technical and economic assessment (these new tasks are included under \u2018Radio spectrum peer-review\u2019).\n\n\nBEREC will also be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping a register of undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services and a register of numbers with extraterritorial use (these new tasks are included under \u2018Registry functions\u2019).\n\n\nFurthermore, some of the tasks assigned to BEREC by Regulation No 531/2012 (Roaming Regulation) and Regulation No 2015/2120 (TSM Regulation) (i.e. issuing of guidelines on net neutrality, provision of input to draft Commission implementing acts on roaming, etc.) will now be carried out under the umbrella of the new agency and will require certain additional resources\n66\n (see\u00a0\u2018Regulatory guidance\u2019 and \u2018Assistance and advice to Commission and other EU institutions\u2019).\n\n\nAlso by establishing a fully-fledged agency some horizontal activities, which are currently mainly carried out by NRAs staff, will be to a certain extent internalised by the new agency, under (for example, the preparation of the work programme of BEREC - including regulatory activities - which is currently done by the NRA staff of the incoming Chair, preparation of working arrangements for cooperation with authorities from third countries, etc.).\n\n\nThe significant increase of tasks implies the need of allocating additional resources (including headcount) to BEREC to secure adequate functioning and the fulfilment of its tasks.\n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on Agency\u2019s human resources\n\n\n3.2.3.1.Summary\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal/initiative does not require the use of appropriations of an administrative nature\n\n\n\u2013\u2327\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal/initiative requires the use of appropriations of an administrative nature, as described below:\n\n\n\u2013Estimate to be expressed in full time equivalent units\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman resources \n\n\n\n\nBaseline\n\n2017\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline \n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmendments \n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModified baseline\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment posts in headcounts (AD/AST) \n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal personnel (FTE) \n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf which Contract Agent \n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf which Seconded National Experts\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Staff \n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n44\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff expenditure\n69\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBaseline\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment plan\n\n\nPosts (in headcounts) \n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.876\n\n\n\n\n1.876\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExernal personnel (FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Of which contract\n\n\nagents\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.910\n\n\n\n\n1.330\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Of which Seconded National Experts\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.624\n\n\n\n\n0.858\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Staff\n\n\n\n\n2.302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.410\n\n\n\n\n4.064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Staff needed by BEREC in 2020 in relation to its new tasks under the enlarged mandate\n70\n\u00a0\n\n\n(detail by task)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Staff\n\n\n(FTE)\n\n\n\n\n\nNew tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nPre-normative tasks and binding powers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory guidance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nMarket review \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nRadio spectrum peer-review \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nRegistry functions \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nInternational cooperation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nAssistance and advice to Commission and other EU institutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nManagement and administrative support \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.2.Estimated requirements of human resources for the parent DG\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal/initiative does not require the use of human resources.\n\n\n\u2013\u2327\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal/initiative requires the use of human resources, as explained below:\n\n\n\nEstimate to be expressed in full amounts (or at most to one decimal place)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Establishment plan posts (officials and temporary staff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXX 01 01 01 (Headquarters and Commission\u2019s Representation Offices)\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 External staff (in Full Time Equivalent unit: FTE)\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXX 01 02 01 (AC, END, INT from the \u2018global envelope\u2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nXX is the policy area or budget title concerned.\n\n\nThe human resources required will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints.\n\n\n\n\nDescription of tasks to be carried out:\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials and temporary staff\n\n\n\n\nRepresent the Commission in the Management Board of the agency.

However, due to several reasons (lack of overlapping mandates, increased mandates since 2007, distinct nature of tasks, different participation at Board level, etc.) a possible merger between the two agencies was discarded.\n\n\n\n(14)\nThe Legislative Financial Statement indicates the figures under the current Multinannual Financial Framework which ends in 2020. Further staffing needs of BEREC will be assessed in the framework of the Commission proposals for the post-2020. \n\n\n\n(15)\nThe option of BEREC being (fully or partly) financed by fees was discarded due to the nature of the agency functions, which are mainly of an advisory character to the NRAs and EU Institutions with the aim to ensuring greater consistency of telecoms regulation across the Union rather than addressing market players directly.\n\n\n\n(16)\nThe Legislative Financial Statement indicates the figures under the current Multinannual Financial Framework which ends in 2020.

comparison reasons and reflects the figures in the 2017 Draft Budget (BEREC Office). EUR 220.000 of this amount is assigned revenue.\n\n\n\n(61)\nThe potential efficiencies and savings for Member States, in particular as regards the enhanced powers conferred to the agency, as well as for the Commission have been analysed as part of the Impact Assesment. The new agency is expected to continue in the future the current service agreements with the Commission (accounting officer and using certain applications and tools) and with other Union agencies (with ENISA as regards off-site storage of back-up data and the internal control coordinator), which could be even further expanded to new areas.\n\n\n\n(62)\nThe 2017 baseline scenario is only provided for comparison reasons.\n\n\n\n(63)\nThe current level of DG CNECT resources is maintained. It is however expected that BEREC will require less support from its parent DG in terms of administrative tasks and compliance with EU rules for decentralised agencies and more support on the new operational areas as well as the increased level of participation at Management Board level (two representatives instead of one).\n\n\n\n(64)\nThe 2017 baseline scenario is only provided for comparison reasons. \n\n\n\n(65)\nThis table outlines only operational expenditure as per Title 3.\n\n\n\n(66)\nIn the past when new tasks were assigned to BEREC, the resources for the BEREC Office (the Union agency providing support to the Board of Regulators) were not modified.\n\n\n\n(67)\nThe 2017 baseline scenario is only provided for comparison reasons.\n\n\n\n(68)\nAs indicated under point 1.6, implementation will start in 2019 and continue until 2022 under the next MFF. Due to the current context of resource constraints, the human resources proposed for 2019-2022 are CA and SNE. Based on the Impact Assessment, the total staff needed by BEREC in order to fulfil its new tasks under the enlarged mandate is estimated at 60 FTEs at the end of the implementation period 2019-2022.\n\n\n\n(69)\nThe 2017 baseline scenario is only provided for comparison reasons. The calculation of staff expenditure for 2019 and 2020 is based on average costs of staff with 'habillage' (Ares(2015)5703479 of 9 December 2015), which would explain part of the expenditure increase from 2017 to 2019.\n\n\n\n(70)\nBased on the Impact Assessment and without prejudging the next MFF, the total additional staff needed by BEREC in order to fulfil its new tasks under the enlarged mandate is estimated at 34 FTEs, envisioning an overall staff figure of 60 FTEs at the end of the implementation period 2019-2022.\n\n\n\n(71)\nAC = Contract Staff; AL = Local Staff; END = Seconded National Expert; INT = agency staff; JED = Junior Experts in Delegations. .\n\n\n\n(72)\nSee points 19 and 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.\n\n\n\n(73)\nThe exact amount for the subsequent years will be known when the EFTA\u2019s proportionality factor will be fixed for the year concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
