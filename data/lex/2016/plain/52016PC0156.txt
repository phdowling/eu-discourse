The Agreement was later updated by the Decision of the Joint Committee No 1/2011\n2\n. The Joint Committee also adopted the Recommendation No 1/2011\n3\n which concerns the use of a technical report for coaches and buses.\n\n\nIt is now time to update the Agreement again, and to incorporate acts not so far incorporated into the Agreement, in particular acts subsequent to those covered by Joint Committee Decision No 1/2011.\n\n\nThis proposed Council Decision is intended to establish the Union's position regarding draft Decision No 1/2016 of the Joint Committee set up under Article 23 of the Interbus Agreement.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe legislative update is consistent with EU transport policy since it extends, in practice, the application of the most recent EU passenger transport legislation, relevant to the sector, to Contracting Parties other than the European Union\n4\n thus improving road safety, roadworthiness and drivers' social conditions in respect of transport operations falling under the Agreement.\n\n\nWith a view to ensuring, in the context of such operations, the application of common rules, in particular in the above-mentioned areas, it is indeed essential that EU legislation not yet incorporated be covered by the Joint Committee Decision envisaged.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposed legislative update is consistent with the EU neighbourhood policy and external relations.\n\n\nThe draft Joint Committee Decision in the Annex is fully consistent with agreements, such as the Customs Union and Pre-Accession Agreements, Association Agreements and is intended to update the regulatory environment within which EU's neighbouring countries access to the EU passenger transport market (and vice versa).\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nIn the absence of a Commission empowerment under Article 218(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\n5\n, the legal basis is Article 218(9) TFEU, in combination with the substantive legal basis, i.e. Article 91 TFEU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe position of the Union as a party to the Agreement can only be adopted by the Union itself, which is therefore exclusively competent in the matter. \n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe envisaged Joint Committee Decision is confined to incorporating existing EU legislation into the Agreement, which is necessary to adapt the rules applicable within the Agreement to EU rules, notably in respect of conditions applying to road passenger transport operators and technical conditions applying to vehicles and social provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nArticle 218(9) TFEU provides for a Council Decision as the applicable instrument.\n\n\n\n3.COLLECTION AND USE OF EXPERTISE AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT / SIMPLIFICATION\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise and impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe Commission has not carried out an impact assessment, nor used external expertise. The EU already applies the legislation that is now proposed to be incorporated into the Interbus Agreement, so as to apply to all operations carried out under that Agreement. \n\n\nThe incorporation of the existing Union acquis does not alter the existing traffic rights under the agreement. It will have a positive impact on the technical, economic and social conditions under which the relevant operations are carried out.\n\n\n\n\u2022Simplification\n\n\n\nAdaptation of the rules applicable to operations under the Agreement to the EU acquis will simplify the conduct of such operations.\n\n\nAs hitherto, operators can be SMEs with a smaller fleet of coaches or buses or larger companies with larger fleets.\n\n\nThe Joint Committee Recommendation No 1/2011 should be repealed following the inclusion in the Agreement of Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community\n6\n. That Directive contains a specimen for technical roadside inspection report incorporating a checklist similar to the one recommended by the Joint Committee in their Recommendation No 1/2011. Furthermore, some Union acts referred to in that Recommendation are outdated.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe draft Council Decision establishes the basis for the position of the Union within the Joint Committee set up under Article 23 of the Interbus Agreement.\n\n\n\nThe draft Joint Committee Decision in the Annex takes account of Union acts adopted until June 2015.\n\n\nIn particular it intends to adapt\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7the requirements concerning the social provisions referred to in Article 8 of the Agreement;\n\n\n\uf0b7the conditions applying to road passenger transport operators set out in Annex 1 to the Agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7the technical standards applying to buses and coaches set out in Articles 1 and 2 of Annex 2 to the Agreement;\n\n\n\uf0b7the model of control document for occasional services exempted from authorisation set out in Annex 3 to the Agreement;\n\n\n\uf0b7the model of authorisation for non-liberalised occasional services set out in Annex 5 to the Agreement;\n\n\n\uf0b7the model declaration concerning Article 4 and Annex 1.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it provides for the repeal of the Joint Committee Recommendation No 1/2011.\n\n\n\n2016/0085 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, regarding draft Decision No 1/2016 of the Joint Committee established under the Interbus Agreement on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular Article 91 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Interbus Agreement on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus (herein after referred to as 'the Agreement') entered into force on 1 January 2003.\n\n\n(2)The last update of Union legislation in the Interbus Agreement, which was introduced by Decision No 1/2011 of the Joint Committee\n7\n, takes into account Union acts adopted until the end of 2009. It is now timely to incorporate new measures that the Union has adopted since then.\n\n\n\n\n(3)In accordance with point (b) of Article 24(2) of the Interbus Agreement, the Joint Committee amends or adapts control documents and other models of documents established in the Annexes to the Agreement. In order to incorporate future measures taken within the Union, and in accordance with point (c) of Article 24(2) of the Interbus Agreement, the Joint Committee amends or adapts the Annexes concerning technical standards applying to buses and coaches as well as Annex 1 regarding the conditions applying to road passenger transport operators. In accordance with point (e) of Article 24(2) of the Interbus Agreement, the Joint Committee also amends or adapts the requirements concerning the social provisions. To this end the Joint Committee should act when the Agreement needs to be updated to technical and legislative progress.\n\n\n(4)Recommendation No 1/2011 of the Joint Committee\n8\n sets out a technical report used for roadside checks of coaches and buses. It has become outdated and should therefore be repealed,\n\n\n(5)The position of the Union as envisaged in this Decision should be adopted.\n\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position of the Union within the Joint Committee set up under Article 23 of the Interbus Agreement on the occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus shall be to agree to the adoption of the attached draft Decision of the Joint Committee.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nAfter its adoption, the Decision of the Joint Committee shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force the day of its adoption.\n\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 321, 26.11.2002, p. 11.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 8, 12.1.2012, p. 38.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 8, 12.2.2012, p. 46.\n\n\n\n(4)\nThe Contracting Parties of the Interbus Agreement are the EU, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\n\n\n(5)\nCf.
