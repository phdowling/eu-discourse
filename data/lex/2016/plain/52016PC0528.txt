The reasons for the revision are twofold. \n\n\nThe revision of the EU-OSHA's Founding Regulation will align certain provisions of the existing Regulation governing EU-OSHA with the Common Approach on Decentralised Agencies. Secondly, the revision offers the opportunity to update the objectives and tasks of EU-OSHA. The new objectives and tasks will be adjusted to better reflect the developments in this area as well as new needs. \n\n\nThe revision is not an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT).\n\n\nThe other two tripartite Agencies of the European Union, Eurofound and CEDEFOP will also undergo a revision of their respective Founding Regulations at the same time as EU-OSHA.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe EU-OSHA's Founding Regulation has been amended three times, in 1995, 2003, and 2005, mainly to take account of EU enlargement or Treaty changes. However, such amendments have not significantly altered the fundamentals of the Agency.\n\n\nThis revision will provide a clearer description of the role of EU-OSHA in supporting the Commission in shaping policies on health and safety at work. It will update the mandate of EU-OSHA as a centre for the technical, scientific, legal and economic information and qualified expertise of use in the field of safety and health at work.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe role of EU-OSHA is to inform and contribute towards better evidence-based policymaking in areas relevant to health and safety at work. The revision thus takes into consideration the existing EU policies on health and safety at work, and foresees complementarity with ongoing and planned research in this area carried out with EU funding, such as those financed under the Horizon 2020 programme.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe proposed legal basis is article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which covers the activities carried out by EU-OSHA in  the area of health and safety at work where it refers to measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States in Art 153(2)(a) TFEU. \n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThis proposal addresses certain aspects relating to how the EU agency operates internally and within the EU institutional framework. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal cannot be achieved by action at national level.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe revision of the Founding Regulation should be considered in terms of its impact on administrative burden and budgetary costs so as to respect the proportionality principle. A\u00a0general principle which shall guide the revision is the necessity to keep the text of the Founding Regulation simple, clear and flexible, while relying on other forms of regulation (e.g. Rules of Procedure) for detailed provisions. A Founding Regulation should have a mid- term lifespan and ensure the necessary flexibility to allow for possible future developments in the organisation without a need for a further revision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe instrument will be a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council repealing and replacing the existing Council Regulation (EC) 2062/94.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nThe most recent evaluation was conducted by the Agency in 2011 focusing on its Strategy for the period 2009-2013.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nIn line with the requirements of Article 154 TFEU, management and labour at EU level have been consulted on both the possible direction of Union action and the content of the envisaged proposal. Both management and labour insisted in their opinion on maintaining the tripartite nature of the Agency and reflecting this in the objectives of the Agency and in the representation of all groups in its governance structures. Otherwise, there were no major suggestions concerning EU-OSHA Founding Regulation. \n\n\nThe Commission has kept the other relevant stakeholders informed on broad decisions concerning this revision exercise consulted them when necessary.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\n Given the limited revision of the founding act, an impact assessment was not carried out.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot applicable. The proposal is not linked to REFIT.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe budgetary implications in terms of human and financial resources, as presented in more detail in the legislative financial statement, are in line with Commission Communication (2013)519.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Common Approach, the proposal includes a provision on the evaluation of the Agency by the Commission. In addition to making this proposal, the Commission envisages to carry out a cross-cutting evaluation to assess the Agency's objectives, mandates, governance and tasks, also in relation to other agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe revision of the Founding Regulation offers the opportunity to update EU-OSHA's objectives and tasks. In particular, it will allow to define more precisely the role of EU-OSHA in supporting the Commission and other EU institutions and bodies, the Member States, the social partners and those involved in the field in shaping and implementing policies on health and safety at work at both national and European levels.\n\n\nFurthermore, the revision creates the opportunity to provide for anti-fraud measures, conflict of interest policy, evaluation and review and the establishment of a headquarters agreement. The revision will also harmonise the provisions on programming and reporting with the requirements set by the revised Framework Financial Regulation. The terminology for the management structure will be aligned with the Common Approach. Certain elements of the Founding Act are not being reviewed in the light of the Common Approach in the framework of this proposal, pending further evaluation\n\n\n\n2016/0254 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nestablishing the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) 2062/94\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2)(a) thereof;\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission;\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n1\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n2\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94\n3\n to contribute to improvement of the working environment, as regards the protection of the safety and health of workers, through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this improvement.\n\n\n(2)Since its establishment in 1994 EU-OSHA has played an important role in supporting the improvement of health and safety at work throughout the European Union. At the same time there have been developments in the area of occupational safety and health (OSH). In this light some adjustments are required in describing the objectives and tasks of EU-OSHA as compared to the provisions in Council Regulation (EC) No. 2062/94.\n\n\n\n\n(3)Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 has been amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should therefore be replaced and repealed in the interest of clarity.\n\n\n(4)The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012, to the extent possible. This proposal does not prejudge any further amendments to the Founding Regulation of EU-OSHA which the Commission may wish to propose following further evaluation, as provided for in this act or on its own initiative. The Commission will evaluate the objectives, mandate, governance and tasks of all EU Agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills.\n\n\n(5)As the three tripartite Agencies - EU-OSHA, the European Centre for development and vocational training (Cedefop), and the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound) - address issues related to the labour market, working environment and vocational education and training and skills, close coordination among three Agencies is required and the ways to enhance efficiency and synergies should be exploited. In addition, whenever relevant, the Agency should seek to engage in efficient cooperation with the European Commission's in-house research capacities.\n\n\n(6)There are already organisations in the European Union and Member States which provide this type of information and services. In order to obtain the maximum benefit at EU level from work already carried out by these organisations, it is appropriate to maintain the existing well-functioning network set up by EU-OSHA under Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 and comprising Member States focal points and their national tripartite networks. It is also important that the Agency have very close functional links with the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work\n4\n, to ensure good coordination and synergies.\n\n\n(7)The financial provisions and provisions for programming and reporting included in Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 should be aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013\n5\n.\n\n\n(8)The provisions concerning EU-OSHA's staff included in Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 should be aligned with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (\u2018Staff Regulations\u2019) and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (\u2018CEOS\u2019), laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68\n6\n.\n\n\n(9)The Agency should take the necessary measures to ensure safe handling and processing of confidential information. Where required, EU-OSHA will adopt security rules as set out in Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/443\n7\n and Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444\n8\n.\n\n\n(10)It is necessary to provide for transitional budgetary provisions and transitional provisions on the Management Board, Executive Director and staff to ensure continuation of activities of the Agency pending the entry into force of this  Regulation.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nOBJECTIVES AND TASKS OF THE AGENCY\n\n\nArticle 1 \u2013 Establishment and Objective of the Agency\n\n\n1.The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (the \u2018Agency\u2019 also referred to as \u2018EU-OSHA\u2019, is hereby established as a European Union Agency.\n\n\n2.The objective of the Agency shall be to provide the European Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the social partners and those involved in the field of safety and health at work with the technical, scientific, legal and economic information and qualified expertise of use in that field.  \n\n\nArticle 2 \u2013Tasks\n\n\n1.The Agency shall perform the  following tasks with respect to the policy areas referred to in Article 1(2) :\n\n\n(a)collect, analyse and disseminate technical, scientific and economic information on safety and health at work in the Member States in order to pass it on to the European Union institutions and bodies, Member States and interested parties; this collection shall take place to identify risks and good practices as well as existing national priorities and programmes and provide the necessary input to the priorities and programmes of the European Union;\n\n\n(b)collect and analyse technical, scientific and economic information on research into safety and health at work and on other research activities which involve aspects connected with safety and health at work and disseminate the results of the research and research activities;\n\n\n(c)promote and support cooperation and exchange of information and experience amongst the Member States in the field of safety and health at work, including information on training programmes;\n\n\n(d)organise conferences and seminars and exchanges of expertise from the Member States in the field of safety and health at work;\n\n\n\n\n(e)supply the European Union institutions and bodies and the Member States with the objective available technical, scientific, legal and economic information and qualified expertise they require to formulate and implement judicious and effective policies designed to protect the safety and health of workers; to that end, provide the European Commission in particular with the technical, scientific, legal and economic information and  qualified expertise it requires to fulfil its tasks of identifying, preparing and evaluating legislation and measures in the area of the protection of the safety and health of workers, notably as regards the impact of legislation, the adaptation of legislation to technical, scientific or legislative progress as well as of practical implementation of legislation in enterprises, with particular reference to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises;\n\n\n(f)establish, in cooperation with the Member States, and coordinate the network referred to in Article 12, taking into account the national, EU and international bodies and organisations which provide this type of information and services;\n\n\n(g)collect and make available information on safety and health matters from and to third countries and international organisations;\n\n\n(h)provide technical, scientific and economic information on methods and tools for implementing preventive activities, identify good practices and promote preventive actions, paying particular attention to the specific problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.

EU-OSHA can make its most valuable contribution by building upon the core areas of expertise it has developed. The Agency is known for its strong knowledge base in the area of occupational safety and health.\n\n\nThe Agency strives to provide the highest quality information in its fields of expertise: scientifically sound and unbiased.
