Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\n\n\nFor this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.\n\n\n2.On 1\u00a0April 1987 the Commission decided\n1\n to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.\n\n\n3.The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December\u00a01992) confirmed this\n2\n, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\n\n\nCodification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n\n\n4.The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation\u00a0(EEC) No\u00a02930/86 of 22\u00a0September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels\n3\n. The new Regulation will supersede the two acts incorporated in it\n4\n, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to make a substantive amendment to Article\u00a05(3) of Regulation\u00a0(EEC) No\u00a02930/86, with a view to delegating powers to the Commission for adapting the requirements for the determination of continous engine power to technical progress. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.\n\n\n5.The recast proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in\u00a023\u00a0official languages, of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02930/86 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex\u00a0III to the recast Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 (adapted)\n\n\n\n2016/0145 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\ndefining characteristics for fishing vessels (recast)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a043 \u00d6\u00a0(2)\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n5\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure\n6\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02930/86\n7\n has been substantially amended\n8\n. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 recital 1\n\n\n(2)In the framework of the common fisheries policy, reference is made to the characteristics of fishing vessels, such as length, breadth, tonnage, date of entry into service and engine power.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n(3)It is essential that identical rules for determining the characteristics of fishing vessels should be used in order to unify the conditions for \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 pursuit of the activity in the \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(4)The definitions \u00d6\u00a0laid down in this Regulation\u00a0\u00d5 should be based upon initiatives already taken by specialist international organisations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 recital 4 (adapted) and 3259/94 recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(5)\u00d6\u00a0Therefore, account should be taken of\u00a0\u00d5 the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, signed in London on 23\u00a0June 1969 (1969\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Convention)\u00a0\u00d5, \u00d6\u00a0and the International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, signed in Torremolinos on 2\u00a0April 1977, both drawn up\u00a0\u00d5 under the aegis of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a03259/94 recitals 7 and 9 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(6)For smaller \u00d6\u00a0fishing\u00a0\u00d5 vessels \u00d6\u00a0less than 15\u00a0metres in length\u00a0\u00d5, the methodology laid down in Annex\u00a0I to the \u00d6\u00a01969\u00a0Convention\u00a0\u00d5 is in certain cases inappropriate. \u00d6\u00a0Therefore, for those vessels\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0a simpler definition of gross tonnage is desirable.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(7)The International Organization for Standardization has drawn up standards on internal combustion engines which are widely applied in Member States. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(8)In order to adapt certain requirements to technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of the necessary amendments in relation to the determination of the continuous engine power. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of [date]. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts,\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86 (adapted)\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nGeneral Provision\n\n\nThe definitions of characteristics of fishing vessels \u00d6\u00a0laid down in\u00a0\u00d5 this Regulation shall apply to all \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 rules concerning fisheries.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02930/86\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nLength\n\n\n1.

The engine power shall be the total of the maximum continuous power which can be obtained at the flywheel of each engine and which can, by mechanical, electrical, hydraulic or other means, be applied to vessel propulsion. However, where a gearbox is incorporated into the engine, the power shall be measured at the gearbox output flange.\n\n\nNo deduction shall be made in respect of auxiliary machines driven by the engine.\n\n\nThe unit in which engine power is expressed shall be the kilowatt (KW).\n\n\n2. The continuous engine power shall be determined in accordance with the requirements adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in its recommended International Standard ISO\u00a03046/1, 2nd edition, October\u00a01981.\n\n\n3. \u00f0\u00a0The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a07 concerning\u00a0\u00ef the amendments necessary for adapting the requirements \u00d6\u00a0referred to\u00a0\u00d5 in paragraph\u00a02 \u00d6\u00a0of this Article\u00a0\u00d5 to technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 170/83.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nDate of entry into service\n\n\nThe date of entry into service shall be the date of \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 first issue of an official safety certificate.\n\n\nIf an official safety certificate is not issued, the date of entry into service shall be the date of \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 first entry in an official register of fishing vessels.\n\n\nHowever, in the case of fishing vessels which entered \u00d6\u00a0into\u00a0\u00d5 service before \u00d6\u00a01\u00a0December 1986\u00a0\u00d5, the date of entry into service shall be the date of \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 first\u00a0entry in an official register of fishing vessels.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nExercise of the delegation\n\n\n\n\n1.
