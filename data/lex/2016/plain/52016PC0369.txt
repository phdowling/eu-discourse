An overarching objective is to provide for a clear, simple and up-to-date legal framework that is easier to implement, monitor and enforce, increasing thus the overall safety level.\n\n\nDirective 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n was put in place to attain a high level of safety and to remove barriers to trade, by setting harmonised safety standards at an appropriate level for passenger ships and craft operating domestic services. This Directive incorporates at EU level for domestic voyages the provisions of the SOLAS Convention which establishes detailed technical requirements for vessel construction, stability, fire protection and life-saving equipment. Correspondingly, it applies to ships made of steel and equivalent material, and to high-speed craft. In addition, it includes specific access and public information requirements for persons with reduced mobility or disabilities. \n\n\nDirective 2009/45/EC has brought about a common high safety level across the EU and important internal market benefits. On the other hand, the experience has shown that since the entry into force of its predecessor in 1998\n3\n, the implementation has given rise to a number of questions as regards the clarity and adequacy of some of its definitions, scope and procedures. \n\n\nFurthermore, several key safety aspects for small ships below 24 meters in length have not been harmonised, reflecting the fact that these ships are more sensitive to local operational conditions. In addition, the Directive already gave Member States the flexibility to apply national rules when they find the harmonised standards for small ships impracticable and/or unreasonable. In this regard, the fitness check showed that the Directive currently applies only to 70 out of 1950 small ships, the key safety aspects of which have been already defined by Member States. As a result, such requirements should be re-evaluated. \n\n\nMoreover, the fitness check revealed that several Member States certify aluminium ships under this Directive while few others do not. This creates an uneven situation that undermines the objective of achieving a common, high safety level for passengers sailing domestically in the EU Member States. It results from a different interpretation of the Directive's scope related to the definition of an 'equivalent material' and the applicability of the corresponding fire safety standards.\n\n\nIt is therefore proposed to clarify and simplify the safety rules and standards for passenger ships so that they are, in line with the Commission's REFIT programme, easier to update, monitor and enforce. In view of increasing legal clarity and certainty, the proposal also removes a number of outdated, redundant and inconsistent legal references. \n\n\nThe proposal amends the corresponding definitions and requirements of Directive 2009/45/EC.\n\n\nIn addition, the proposal provides for the alignment of Directive 2009/45/EC with the changes brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon in regard of the powers of the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts.\n\n\n\n1.2Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal is fully consistent with the simplification proposals amending Council Directive 98/41/EC\n4\n and the proposal replacing Council Directive 1999/35/EC\n5\n. The proposal is fully in line with the fitness check recommendations and the 2011 White Paper for the future of transport\n6\n that recognised the need to modernise the current EU passenger ship safety legislative framework.\n\n\n\n1.3Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal delivers on the Commission's Better Regulation agenda by ensuring that the existing legislation is simple and clear, does not create unnecessary burden and keeps pace with evolving political, societal and technological developments. It also delivers on the goals of the 2018 Maritime Transport Strategy\n7\n by ensuring quality ferry services in regular intra-EU passenger transport.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n2.1Legal basis\n\n\n\nGiven that the proposal replaces the current Directive, the legal base remains Article 100(2) TFEU (ex Article 80(2) TEC), providing for measures in the field of sea transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2Subsidiarity\n\n\n\nDirective 2009/45/EC has been mainly modelled and shaped on the international requirements and driven by a number of shipping casualties involving loss of human lives. Although common safety standard for ships engaged on international voyages have been set by international safety regulations such as SOLAS Convention, they do not apply to passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages. \n\n\nThe proposal ensures that the common level of safety established by Directive 2009/45/EC for ships operating on domestic voyages within EU waters is preserved, which could not be achieved by unilateral action at the level of Member States. At the same time, the proposal reiterates the need for and added value of differences in standards where local operating conditions may so require. \n\n\nIn light of the internal market objective and the freedom to provide maritime transport services within Member States, the proposal also ensures that Directive 2009/45/EC continues to facilitate the transfer of ships between national registers and to allow for the competition on domestic voyages to take place on equal footing, without compromising the safety level.\n\n\n\n2.3Proportionality\n\n\nAs evidenced by the accident statistics, the existing legislation has achieved a high level of passenger safety. The regulatory cost related to EU safety standards have not proved to be disproportionate in comparison to national standards that would have been needed otherwise. The estimated differences in regulatory costs represent merely a minor fraction compared to the total construction, operation and maintenance costs. \n\n\nBesides clarifying a number of definitions, the removal of some unnecessary requirements without compromising the high level of safety is one of the objectives of this simplification initiative.  As a result, the proposal removes ships below 24 metres in length from the scope of Directive 2009/45/EC. Given that small ships are built mainly from materials other than steel, the vast majority of this fleet is currently not covered by the harmonised EU safety standards (96%). This implies that most of vessels below 24 m are already certified under national legislation. \n\n\nFurthermore, the wide range of services that these vessels are built for (e.g. daily or overnight passages, touristic daily cruising, calling to ports with specific constrains or infrastructures) produces a very broad range of designs and technical solutions. This makes identifying a common set of detailed rules fitting such a variety of services for smaller vessels extremely challenging. \n\n\nThe current regulatory approach of Directive 2009/45/EC consisting in prescriptive standards designed primarily for steel (or aluminium) ships was therefore re-evaluated for such ships. In addition, accidents recorded for small ships outside the scope of EU standards do not demonstrate any specific safety concern (5 fatalities over the last 4 years, all of them occupational accidents). Furthermore, unlike for bigger ships, small ships tend to be operated in the same Member State until the end of their operational life and their transfer between Member States is limited. \n\n\n2.4Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, a Directive remains to be considered as the most suitable form for achieving the identified objectives. It establishes common principles and a harmonised safety level, ensures the enforcement of the rules, but leaves the choice of practical and technical procedures to be applied to each Member State. \n\n\nThe most adequate legal solution was found to be a proposal amending Directive 2009/45/EC. Alternative option of proposing a new Directive was discarded on the basis of the limited number of clearly identifiable changes to the current Directive.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n3.1Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nFitness check showed that the key objectives of the EU passenger ship safety legislation related to passenger safety and internal market are being overall met and remain highly relevant. The EU passenger ship safety legal framework resulted in a common safety level for passenger ships within the EU and a level playing field between operators as well as increased transfer of ships between Member States. The fitness check also showed that there is scope for further enhancing the level of safety as well as the efficiency and proportionality of some of the regulatory requirements. Recommendations to simplify, clarify and repeal a number of ambiguous, outdated or overlapping requirements have been made in a number of areas:\n\n\n\n(a)Exclude passenger ships below 24 m in length from the scope of the Directive 2009/45/EC and consider developing guidelines or standards for small vessels and vessels built in non-steel or equivalent materials, based on functional requirements as part of a goal based standard framework.\n\n\n(b)Clarify the scope of the Directive,  namely:\n\n\n\uf0b7Clarify that for the purposes of Directive 2009/45/EC aluminium is a material equivalent to steel and clarify the corresponding fire insulation requirements (e.g. definitions of spaces which should be additionally fire insulated).\n\n\n\uf0b7Clarify that offshore service vessel for wind-farms fall outside the scope of Directive 2009/45/EC.\n\n\n\uf0b7Clarify that traditional ships fall outside the scope of Directive 2009/45/EC and clarify their definition. \n\n\n\n\n(c)Clarify and simplify the sea areas definition in Directive 2009/45/EC while:\n\n\n\uf0b7Removing the reference to \"where the shipwreck persons can land\",\n\n\n\uf0b7Removing the notion of \"place of refuge\".\n\n\n3.2Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nGiven the technical nature of the envisaged proposals, a targeted consultation has been chosen as the most adequate tool. National experts have been consulted in the framework of the Passenger Ship Safety Expert Group. A workshop was organised where the Member States as well as industry and passenger associations were invited to participate. The envisaged measures were presented on numerous occasions. In addition, the roadmap published on the Europa website\n8\n allowed all stakeholders to provide feedback by means of an online response form.\n\n\nThe consultation summary as well as detailed feedback on comments raised during the consultation process is provided in the Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal. The envisaged simplification measures were supported by the large majority of national experts, albeit a number of comments have been made with respect to exact wording of some of the proposals. All suggestions have been therefore carefully reviewed and proposals amended as appropriate. In addition, some experts raised questions concerning practical and technical implementation aspects, which have been addressed in the Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal and are embedded in the Implementation Plan.\n\n\nIndustrial stakeholders insisted that the key principles of the current legal framework remained unchanged (highlighting the costs of safety upgrade for aluminium ships in some Member States) while the passenger association called for upgrading the safety level and warned against its dilution. The proposal therefore ensures that the existing level of safety is maintained and, to the extent possible within the simplification framework, increased (e.g. by clarifying that aluminium ships should be built according to the Directive's safety standards).\n\n\n\n3.3Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nThis review builds primarily on the data collected during the fitness check process as reported in the Commission Staff Working Document 'Adjusting course: EU Passenger Ship Safety Legislation Fitness Check', adopted on 16 October 2015\n9\n.\n\n\nIn addition to the data and consultation carried out in the framework of the fitness check, the preparation of this simplification proposal necessitated an input from technical and legal experts regarding the concrete formulation of technical definitions and a clear legal drafting. This expertise was gathered internally in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency and the Passenger Ship Safety Expert Group. It is reported on in the Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal.\n\n\n\n3.4Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe proposal is an immediate follow-up to the fitness check that identified the issues for simplification in detail and assessed the simplification potential. As highlighted in the roadmap, the envisaged measures are either not expected to generate any significant impacts (i.e. beyond those that are non-measurable such as legal clarity, certainty or simplicity) or no materially different solutions have been identified. In line with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines, a fully-fledged impact assessment has not been carried out.\n\n\nNonetheless, the simplification proposal is accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document that recalls the recommendations of the fitness check and explains the rationale of the proposed solutions from the technical as well as legal perspective. It includes a summary and a feedback on the stakeholder consultation carried out in support of this initiative. An implementation plan is also attached. \n\n\n\n3.5Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe simplification potential of this proposal primarily consists of non-measurable impacts such as legal clarity, certainty and simplicity, stemming from the clarification of the scope of the Directive and simpler definition of sea areas. \n\n\nA deadline should be set for ships built in an equivalent material and greater than 24 m in length before the entry into force of this Directive to comply with the technical requirements laid down in the Directive. Sufficient transition period should smooth the adjustment to the maximum extent possible. Concerning the sea areas, the proposal would primarily eliminate redundant or outdated criteria and influence the drawing of sea areas for Member States to the minimum extent only. \n\n\nThe proposal also increases legal clarify by eliminating a number of redundant, incorrect or inconsistent references.\n\n\n\n3.6Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the Union budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n5.1Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe proposal is accompanied by an implementation plan that lists the actions needed to implement the simplification measures and identifies the main technical, legal and time-related implementation challenges.\n\n\nAdequate monitoring and reporting arrangements have been identified, without creating new reporting obligations and administrative burdens. The key information on fleet, accidents and compliance will be collected with the assistance of EMSA, Passenger Ship Safety Expert Group and on the basis of the European Marine Casualty Information Platform (EMCIP) database. Given that the full cycle of the envisaged EMSA implementation visits is estimated to last 5 years, the evaluation cycle of the EU passenger ship safety legislation should be set at 7 yearly intervals.\n\n\n\n5.2Explanatory documents \n\n\n\nExplanatory documents are not required as the simplification measures are not of substantial or complex nature.\n\n\n\n5.3Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nDefinitions and scope\n\n\n\nArticle 2 is amended to eliminate a number of redundant, inconsistent or incorrect references, in particular related to the Intact Stability Code (missing reference added), High Speed Craft Code (reference corrected), bow height definition (redundant part deleted), port area (aligned with the definition of a sea area), place of refuge (removed as redundant in line with the simplification of sea area definitions), port State (replacing host State in line with the review of Directive 1999/35/EC), and recognised organisation (updated reference).\n\n\nArticle 2 is also amended to provide for new definitions of traditional ship (moved from Article 3 and updated to take into account definition of traditional ship in Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n), sailing ship (new definition), pleasure yacht and craft (moved from Article 3 and further aligned with SOLAS), tender (new definition), and equivalent material (moved from Annex 1 and amended to clarify that ships built from such materials have to be certified according to this Directive).\n\n\nArticle 3 is amended to exclude ships below 24 metres from the scope of the Directive, to remove incorrect reference to 'passenger' from the heading of points (a) and (b), and to clarify that the Directive does not apply to sailing ships, tenders and ships referred to in the SPS code (including offshore supply vessels).\n\n\n\nClasses of passenger ships and application\n\n\n\nArticle 4 is amended to simplify the definitions of sea areas C and D (references to the criteria of 'where the shipwrecked persons can land' and 'distance to place of refuge' removed), and to clarify that the sea areas is established by Member States in such a manner that the inner border of sea area D is clearly delimited.\n\n\nArticle 5 is amended to update the reference to the host State (replaced by port State), and to update the reference to Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n11\n and Directive 2014/90/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n12\n.\n\n\n\nSafety requirements\n\n\n\nArticle 6 is amended to update the reference to Directive 2009/15/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n, to remove the repetitive point (c), to update the reference to the host State (replaced by port State), to clarify that the conversion requirement is meant to apply to all ships (when converted in a passenger ships), not only to existing passenger ones (by transferring point (e) into a new paragraph 5), to remove redundant part of the DSC Code reference in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 4(a), to remove outdated point (f), and to insert a new date of application for ships built in equivalent material before the entry into force of this Directive.\n\n\nArticles 7 and 8 are amended to remove the outdated parts.\n\n\n\nAdditional safety requirements, equivalents, exemptions and safeguard measures\n\n\n\nArticle 9 is amended to remove the incorrect reference to Annex 1 from paragraph 2 and to facilitate the notification of measures provided for in this Article by means of a database established for such purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommittee and amendment procedure \n\n\nArticles 10 and 11 are brought in line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in regard to powers of the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts. Article 10a has been added for the same reason (exercise of delegation power).\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nArticle 13 is amended to clarify that only ships fulfilling the requirements of this Directive are provided with a Passenger ship Safety Certificate, and to clarify that this certificate has to include all measures provided for under Article 9, not only the exemptions. \n\n\nInternational dimension\n\n\nArticle 14 is amended in order to be brought in line with Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union concerning external representation. \n\n\nEvaluation provisions\n\n\nArticle 16a has been added to specify the evaluation provisions. \n\n\n2016/0170 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0100(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n14\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n15\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\n(1)To maintain a high level of safety provided by common safety standards defined by Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n and to preserve level playing field, the application of that Directive should be improved. Directive 2009/45/EC should apply only to passenger ships and craft for which its safety standards have been designed. A number of specific ship types should be therefore excluded from its scope, such as tenders, sailing ships or ships transporting trained personnel engaged in business of the ship or offshore installations.\n\n\n(2)The Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT)\n17\n has shown that not all Member States certify aluminium ships under Directive 2009/45/EC. This creates an uneven situation that undermines the objective of achieving a common, high safety level for passengers sailing domestically in the Union. To avoid the non-uniform application arising from the interpretation of the Directive's scope related to the definition of aluminium as an equivalent material and the applicability of the corresponding fire safety standards, the definition of the equivalent material should be clarified.  \n\n\n(3)In view of increasing legal clarity and consistency, a number of definitions and references should be updated and further aligned with the related international or Union rules. In doing so, special care should be taken not to alter the existing scope and level of safety provided by Directive 2009/45/EC. In particular, the definition of traditional ship should be better aligned with Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n, while preserving the current criteria of the year of built and type of material. The definition of pleasure yacht and craft should be further aligned with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS Convention).\n\n\n(4)In view of the principle of proportionality, the current prescriptive requirements derived from the SOLAS Convention have proven difficult to adapt to small passenger vessels below 24 meters in length. Furthermore, small ships are primarily built in other materials than steel and only a very limited number of such ships have been therefore certified under Directive 2009/45/EC. In the absence of specific safety concerns and adequate standards provided by the Directive, ships bellow 24 meters in length should be therefore excluded from its scope and should be subjected to specific safety standards determined by Member States that are better placed to assess the local limitations of navigation for these ships in terms of distance to coast or port and weather conditions.\n\n\n(5)To further simplify the definitions of sea areas provided for by Directive 2009/45/EC and to minimise the disturbances for Member States, the redundant or inadequate criteria should be removed. While maintaining the safety level, the definition of sea areas in which ships of Class C and D may operate should be simplified by removing the criterion of 'where the shipwrecked persons can land' and by removing the 'distance to the place of refuge' for the purpose of defining the sea areas. The appropriateness of a particular coastline as a place of refuge is a dynamic parameter that should be assessed on a case by case basis by Member States and, where necessary, any operational restrictions related to the distance from a place of refuge for a particular ship should be noted in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.\n\n\n(6)To remove unintended negative consequences of the current provisions whereby converted cargo ships may not be considered as new passenger ships, it should be clarified that the conversion requirements apply to any ship, not only existing passenger ships.\n\n\n(7)To increase the transparency and to facilitate the notification of exemptions, equivalencies and additional safety measures by Member States, a database should be established and maintained for this purpose by the Commission. It should include the notified measures in their draft and adopted form. \n\n\n(8)In view of the changes brought about by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the powers conferred on the Commission to implement Directive 2009/45/EC should be updated correspondingly. Implementing acts should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n.\n\n\n(9)In order to take account of developments at international level and experience and to increase transparency, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of excluding amendments to the international instruments from the scope of this Directive if necessary, updating the technical requirements and establishing conditions of use for the database kept by the Commission to host notifications by Member States of exemptions and requests for derogation in accordance with the present Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(10)In order to establish a level playing field for passengers ships operating on voyages from and to Union ports, irrespective of the nature of the voyages they are engaged on, the Union action in view of expediting the ongoing work within the IMO to revise the regulations of the SOLAS Convention should be brought in line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n(11)In view of the full monitoring cycle of European Maritime Safety Agency visits, the Commission should evaluate the implementation of Directive 2009/45/EC no later than [seven years after the date referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1)] and report to the European Parliament and the Council thereon. Member States should cooperate with the Commission to gather all information necessary for this evaluation.\n\n\n(12)Directive 2009/45/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\nAmendments to Directive 2009/45/EC\n\n\nDirective 2009/45/EC is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)Article 2 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"(a)\u2018International Conventions\u2019 means the following conventions together with the amendments thereto, i.e. in their up-to-date versions:\n\n\n(i)the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (the 1974 SOLAS Convention);
