"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 14.10.2016\nCOM(2016) 659 final\n2016/0323(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014, establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa and repealing Decision No 574/2007/EC entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014\n1\n.\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014\n2\n. Under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund (hereinafter referred to as 'the ISF-Borders and Visa').\n\n\nThe purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The ISF-Borders and Visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders', as set out in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis.\n\n\nArticle 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors, as the respective Association Agreements do not provide for such rules.\n\n\nThe aim of the draft Agreement with Norway is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine its contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. \n\n\nAs regards budgetary and financial controls, the Member States are subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. These obligations apply to the Member States directly and are therefore not laid down in Regulation (EU) No 515/2014. However, in application of Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, they must be extended to the associated country by means of the draft Agreement. \n\n\nIn order to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 provides for Commission staff, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to be granted suitable access to carry out controls. Article 5(9) of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 adds that cooperation agreements with third countries will expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot controls and inspections. Consequently, this is provided for in the draft Agreement. \n\n\n2.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nHaving as its aim the conclusion of arrangements between the Union and Norway on this country's contribution to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-20 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation, the present proposal for the signature of the Agreement is based on Articles 77(2) and 218(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022The necessity for the proposed decision \n\n\nOn the basis of Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 the conclusion of the Agreement with Norway is necessary for the establishment of the arrangements on this country's contribution to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-20 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation.\n\n\nIn application of Article 19(4) of the Agreement, it is necessary to apply the Agreement provisionally, with the exception of Article 5 of the Agreement, as of the day following its signature. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Outcome of the Negotiations\n\n\nThe Commission presented on 28 May 2014 a recommendation to the Council in order to authorise the Commission to open negotiations with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on an international Agreement establishing such supplementary rules.\n\n\nThe Commission received the Council authorisation to open negotiations with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on an Agreement on the modalities of these countries\u2019 participation in the Internal Security Fund-Borders and Visa on 14 July 2014.\n\n\nThe negotiations were held jointly with all associated countries. Two rounds of negotiations took place. The final text of the draft Agreement with Norway was initialled on 5 July 2016.\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft Arrangement is acceptable to the Union.\n\n\nThe Member States have been informed and consulted in the relevant Council Working Groups.\n\n\nThe final content of it can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nThe draft Agreement foresees the annual financial contribution of Norway to the budget of the Internal Security Fund-Borders and Visa by an annual sum calculated in accordance with its GDP as a percentage of GDP of all States participating in the Fund [Article 10 and Annex I]. Annual payments are specified in Article 11.\n\n\nFurthermore the draft Agreement foresees also the modalities for the designation of the Responsible Authority and for the annual reporting system.  \n\n\nThe Agreement contains as well provisions to protect the financial interests of the Union against fraud and measures to ensure compliance with the provisions relevant for the financial management and control as laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') and in Union law based on the TFEU. \n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nNot applicable, considering that the proposal is linked to the programme management and aims at signing an international agreement which was negotiated on the basis of the negotiating directives established by the Council. \n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\nArticle 10 and Annex I of the draft Agreement describe the provisions related to the annual financial contributions of the associated country to the budget of the Internal Security Fund \u2013 Borders and Visa and their possible adaptation to the situation described as per Annex I.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Territorial application\n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 515/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis. In this regard, the present Agreement with Norway also builds on the Schengen acquis.\n\n\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this decision and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application. In accordance with Article 4 of the aforementioned Protocol, Denmark will decide within six months after the Council has adopted this proposal whether it will implement the proposed decision in its national law.\n\n\nSince this proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part and will therefore not be bound or subject to its application, in accordance with Council Decisions 2000/365/EC\n3\n and 2002/192/EC\n4\n\u00a0respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nArticle 17 of the Agreement specifies the applicable reporting and monitoring arragements. By 15 February each year and until 2022 included, Norway is to submit an annual implementation report to the Commission for the previous financial year.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nNot needed. \u00a0\n\n\nIn the light of the abovementioned considerations, the Commission proposes that the Council decide that the Agreement be signed on behalf of the Union and authorise the President of the Council to appoint the person(s) duly empowered to sign on behalf of the Union;\n\n\nThe Commission has made a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the\u00a0attached Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020\n5\n. The Council shall adopt this Decision after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.\n\n\n\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/0323 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 77(2) and 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n6\n provides in its Article 5(7) that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis shall participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements shall be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the powers of audit of the Court of Auditors. \n\n\n(2)On 14 July 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Iceland, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein for an Agreement on the modalities of their participation in the Internal Security Fund - Borders and Visa. The negotiations with the Kingdom of Norway were successfully concluded with the Kingdom of Norway by the initialling of the Agreement on 5 July 2016. \n\n\n(3)In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\u00a0Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law.\n\n\n(4)This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of\u00a029\u00a0May\u00a02000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis; the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its\u00a0application\n7\n.\n\n\n(5)This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n8\n; Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n\n(6)The Agreement should be signed on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion at the later date.\n\n\n(7)In view of Article 19(4) of the Agreement, the Agreement with the exception of its Article 5 should be applied provisionally as from the day following its signature.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement between the Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020 is hereby authorised, subject

COMMISSION\nBrussels, 14.10.2016\nCOM(2016) 659 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a COUNCIL DECISION\non the signing on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of an Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nto the\n\n\nProposal for a COUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of an Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014 to 2020\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION, hereinafter referred to as 'the Union'\n\n\nand\n\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, hereinafter referred to as 'Norway',\n\n\nHereinafter referred to as 'the Parties'\n\n\nHAVING REGARD to the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n1\n ('Association Agreement with Norway'),\n\n\nWHEREAS: \n\n\n(1)The Union established the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund by Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n. \n\n\n(2)Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Association Agreement with Norway.\n\n\n(3)As Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n3\n has a direct impact on the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, thus affecting the latter's legal framework, and as the procedures set out in the Association Agreement with Norway have been applied for the adoption of Regulation (EU) 514/2014 which was notified to Norway, the Parties acknowledge that Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Association Agreement with Norway insofar as it is necessary for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014.\n\n\n(4)Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis \u2013 among which Norway \u2013 participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements should be concluded to specify financial contributions by those countries and supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. \n\n\n(5)The instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of he Internal Security Fund ('the ISF-Borders and Visa') constitutes a specific instrument in the context of the Schengen acquis designed to provide for burden sharing and financial support in the field of external borders and visa policy in Member States and associated States.\n\n\n(6)Article 60 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n4\n provides for rules on indirect management that are applicable where third countries, including associated States, are entrusted with budget implementation tasks. \n\n\n(7)   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 17(4) of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 provides for the eligibility of expenditure incurred in 2014 by a Responsible Authority not yet formally designated, thereby ensuring a smooth transition between the External Borders Fund and the Internal Security Fund. Similarly it is important that the same concern be reflected in this Agreement. Given that this Agreement did not come into force before the end of 2014, it is essential to ensure the eligibility of expenditure incurred before and until the formal designation of the Responsible Authority, provided that the management and control systems applied before are essentially the same as the ones in force after the formal designation of the Responsible Authority.\n\n\n(8)To facilitate the calculation and use of the annual contributions due by\u00a0Norway to the ISF-Borders and Visa, its contributions for the period 2014-2020 will be paid in five annual instalments from 2016 to 2020. From 2016 to 2018, the annual contributions are set in fixed amounts while the contribution due for the years 2019 and 2020 will be determined in 2019 on the basis of the gross domestic product of all States participating in the ISF-Borders and Visa taking into account the payments effectively made,  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThis Agreement sets out the supplementary rules necessary for the participation of Norway in the ISF - Borders and Visa in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 515/2014. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nFinancial management and control\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Norway shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the provisions relevant for the financial management and control which are laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') and in Union law based on the TFEU. \n\n\nThe provisions of the TFEU and of the secondary law referred to in the first sub- paragraph are the following: \n\n\n(a)Article 287(1), (2) and (3) TFEU;\n\n\n(b)Articles 30, 32 and 57, Article 58(1)(c)(i), Article 60 and Articles 79(2) and 108(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012;\n\n\n(c)Articles 32, 38, 42, 84, 88, 142 and 144 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012\n5\n;\n\n\n(d)Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96\n6\n; \n\n\n(e)Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n7\n.\n\n\nThe Parties may decide to amend this list by mutual agreement. \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Norway shall apply the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 in its territory in accordance with this Agreement. \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nRespect for the principle of sound financial management\n\n\nThe funds allocated to Norway under the ISF-Borders and Visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. \n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\n\n\nRespect for the principle on conflict of interest\n\n\nAll financial actors and any other person involved in budget implementation and management, including acts preparatory thereto, audit or control acting in the territory of Norway shall be prohibited from taking any action which may bring their own interests into conflict with those of the Union. \n\n\nArticle 5 \n\n\nEnforcement\n\n\nDecisions taken by the Commission which impose a pecuniary obligation on persons other than States shall be enforceable in the territory of Norway. \n\n\nEnforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in Norway. The order for its enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authenticity of the decision, by the national authority which the government of Norway shall designate for this purpose and shall make known to the Commission.\n\n\nWhen these formalities have been completed on application by the Commission, the Commission may proceed to enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.\n\n\nEnforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
