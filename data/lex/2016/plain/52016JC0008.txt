Negotiations began in December 2011 and were successfully concluded with the initialling of the Agreement on 5 March 2015.\n\n\nThis Agreement, similarly to those concluded by the EU with partner countries, includes binding political clauses based on the shared values of the two Parties. Accordingly, the EU and Australia declare their commitments in areas including human rights, non-proliferation and the fight against terrorism. These clauses are fully in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements. Respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations constitute the basis for cooperation under the Agreement. The Agreement also covers cooperation on economic and trade matters, including dialogues on economic, trade and investment related areas, agricultural trade, sanitary and phytosanitary issues and other sectoral issues. The Agreement equally includes cooperation in a broad range of policy areas such as health, the environment, climate change, energy, education, culture, labour, disaster management, fisheries and maritime affairs, transport, legal cooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime and corruption.\n\n\nThe Agreement contributes significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and Australia, a partnership which is based on joint values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security.\n\n\nIn accordance with the EU\u2019s Common approach on the use of political clauses, in cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe attached joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the signature and provisional application of the Agreement.\n\n\nThe choice of legal basis for the signing of the Agreement must rest on objective factors amenable to judicial review, which include the aim and content of the measure.\n\n\nThe purpose of this Agreement is \u2018to establish a strengthened Partnership between the Parties; to provide a framework to facilitate and promote cooperation across a broad range of areas of mutual interest; and to enhance cooperation to develop solutions to regional and global challenges\u2019 (Article 1 of the Agreement).\n\n\nThe content of the Agreement covers three pillars:\n\n\n- political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora;\n\n\n- cooperation on economic and trade matters, including facilitating bilateral  trade and investment flows, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as sanitary and phytosanitary issues, the reduction of technical barriers to trade, government procurement;\n\n\n- sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of research and innovation, education and culture, migration, counter terrorism, the fight against organised crime and cybercrime and judicial cooperation and intellectual property.\n\n\nAs such, the Agreement is composed of the following titles: Purpose and Basis of the Agreement (Title I), Political Dialogue and Cooperation on Foreign Policy and Security Matters (Title II), Cooperation on Global Development and Humanitarian Aid (Title III), Cooperation on Economic and Trade Matters (Title IV), Cooperation on Justice, Freedom and Security (Title V), Cooperation in the areas of Research, Innovation and the Information Society (Title VI), Cooperation in the area of Education and Culture (Title VII), Cooperation in the area of Sustainable Development, Energy and Transport (Title VIII), Institutional Framework (Title IX) and Final Provisions (Title X).\n\n\nThe provisions set out in the Agreement, in view of both their aim and content, fall within the scope of Article 37 of the Treaty on European Union and Articles 207 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\nThe Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. The Agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in the case of a violation of essential elements.\n\n\nPending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and Australia, will be provisionally applied in accordance with Article 61 of the Agreement. The scope of the provisional application is without prejudice to the division of competencies between the Union and its Member States as laid down in the Treaties. The date of provisional application will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\nThe Agreement will extend upon and replace the EU-Australia Partnership Framework adopted in 2008. It will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU\u2019s relations with Australia. All existing sector specific agreements remain in place.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe European External Action Service and the Commission services have been involved in the negotiating process.\n\n\nMember States have been consulted throughout the negotiating process at meetings of the relevant Council Working Parties. On 25 February 2014, the Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed the text of the Framework Agreement.\n\n\nThe European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations.\n\n\nThe High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and provisional application.\n\n\n2016/0113 (NLE)\n\n\nJoint Proposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 37 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 and Article 212(1), in conjunction with Article 218(5) and the second paragraph of Article 218(8) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the joint proposal from the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 10 October 2011, the Council authorised the Commission and the High Representative to open negotiations with Australia on a Framework Agreement to replace the EU-Australia Partnership Framework of 2008.\n\n\n(2)The negotiations on the Framework Agreement (\u2018the Agreement\u2019) were successfully concluded on 5 March 2015.

Should the Joint Committee at the level of senior officials be unable to resolve the situation within a period of up to 15 days from the commencement of consultations and no later than 30 days from the date of the referral of the matter to the Joint Committee, the matter shall be submitted to ministers for urgent consideration for a further period of 15 days. \n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the unlikely and unexpected event that no mutually acceptable solution has been found after 15 days from the commencement of consultations at the ministerial level and no later than\u00a045\u00a0days from the date of the referral of the matter to the Joint Committee, either Party may decide to take appropriate measures with regard to this Agreement, including the suspension of its provisions or its termination. The Parties recognise that a case of special urgency may also serve as grounds for taking appropriate measures outside this Agreement, in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under other agreements between the Parties or under general international law. In the EU, the decision to suspend would entail unanimity. In Australia, the decision to suspend would be taken by the Government of Australia in accordance with its laws and\u00a0regulations.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties agree that any decision to take appropriate measures in accordance with paragraph\u00a04 must be duly substantiated. The decision shall be notified immediately to the other Party in writing. The Parties agree that any such measures must be proportionate and must be consistent with Article 55(2) as well as with the general principles of international law.\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any measure is taken in accordance with paragraph 4, it shall be revoked as soon as the reason for taking it has been removed. The Party invoking paragraph 4 shall keep under constant review the development of the situation which prompted the decision and shall withdraw the measures taken as soon as warranted.\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties agree, for the purpose of the correct interpretation and practical application of this Agreement, that the term 'case of special urgency' means a particularly serious and substantial violation of the obligations described in Articles 2(2) and 6(2) of this Agreement by one of the Parties leading to a situation which requires an immediate reaction by the other. The Parties consider that a particularly serious and substantial violation of Article 2(2) or Article 6(2) would have to be of an exceptional sort that threatens international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases where a situation occurring in a third country could be considered equivalent in gravity and nature to a case of special urgency, the Parties shall endeavour to hold urgent consultations, at the request of either Party, to exchange views on the situation and consider possible responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nTITLE \u0425\n\n\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 58\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'the Parties' means the Union or its Member States, or the Union and its Member States, in accordance with their respective competences, on the one hand, and Australia, on the other.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 59\n\n\n\nFinancial cooperation\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When implementing aid programmes in the context of their development cooperation policies, the Parties shall cooperate to prevent and fight irregularities, fraud, corruption or any other illegal activities to the detriment of the Parties' financial interests.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this purpose, the competent authorities of the Union and of Australia shall exchange information, including personal data, in accordance with their respective legislation in force, and, at the request of one of the Parties, shall conduct consultations.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Anti-Fraud Office and the competent Australian authorities may agree on further cooperation in the field of anti-fraud, including the conclusion of operational arrangements. \n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 60\n\n\n\nDisclosure of information\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties shall give appropriate protection to information shared under this Agreement, consistent with the public interest in access to information. \n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Parties to share information, or allow access to shared information, the disclosure of which would:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cause prejudice to:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public security;\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intelligence, defence and military matters;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0international relations;\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0financial, monetary or economic policy;\n\n\n\n\n(v)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0privacy; or\n\n\n\n(vi)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0legitimate commercial interests or business affairs; or\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0be otherwise contrary to the public interest.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that information of the kind referred to in this Article is shared, the receiving Party shall only release or disclose such information with the consent of the other Party, or where it is necessary to comply with its legal obligations.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Agreement is intended to derogate from the rights, obligations or commitments of the Parties under bilateral agreements or arrangements concerning classified information exchanged between the Parties.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 61\n\n\n\nEntry Into Force, Provisional Application, Duration and termination\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Agreement shall enter into force thirty days after the date on which the Parties have notified each other of the completion of the legal procedures necessary for that purpose.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Australia and the Union may provisionally apply mutually determined provisions of this Agreement pending its entry into force. Such provisional application shall commence thirty days after the date on which both Australia and the Union have notified each other of the completion of their respective internal procedures necessary for such provisional\u00a0application.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Agreement shall be valid indefinitely.
