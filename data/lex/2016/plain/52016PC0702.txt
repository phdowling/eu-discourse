Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.\n\n\nFor this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.\n\n\n2.On 1\u00a0April\u00a01987 the Commission decided\n1\n to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.\n\n\n3.The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December\u00a01992) confirmed this\n2\n, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.\n\n\nCodification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.\n\n\nGiven that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20\u00a0December\u00a01994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.\n\n\n4.The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0207/2009 of 26\u00a0February 2009 on the European Union trade mark\n3\n. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it\n4\n; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.\n\n\n5.The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 24\u00a0official languages, of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0207/2009\u00a0and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex\u00a0III to the codified Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.1\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n2016/0345 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the \u00e81\u00a0European Union trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 (codification)\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of\u00a0\u00d5 the \u00d6\u00a0European\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0\u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, and in particular \u00d6\u00a0the first paragraph of\u00a0\u00d5 Article \u00d6\u00a0118\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n5\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No \u00d6\u00a0207/2009\u00a0\u00d5\n6\n has been substantially amended several times\n7\n. In the interests of clarity and rationality, \u00d6\u00a0that\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation should be codified.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(2)Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a040/94\n8\n, which was codified in 2009 as Regulation (EC) No\u00a0207/2009, created a system of trade mark protection specific to the Union which provided for the protection of trade marks at the level of the Union, in parallel to the protection of trade marks available at the level of the Member States according to the national trade mark systems, harmonised by Council Directive\u00a089/104/EEC\n9\n, which was codified as Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n(3)It is desirable to promote throughout the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 a harmonious development of economic activities and a continuous and balanced expansion by completing an internal market which functions properly and offers conditions which are similar to those obtaining in a national market. In order to \u00d6\u00a0establish\u00a0\u00d5 a market of this kind and make it increasingly a single market, not only \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 barriers to free movement of goods and services be removed and arrangements be instituted which ensure that competition is not distorted, but, in addition, legal conditions \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be \u00d6\u00a0laid down\u00a0\u00d5 which enable undertakings to adapt their activities to the scale of the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, whether in manufacturing and distributing goods or in providing services. For those purposes, trade marks enabling the products and services of undertakings to be distinguished by identical means throughout the entire \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, regardless of frontiers, should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 3\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(4)For the purpose of pursuing the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7's said objectives it would appear necessary to provide for \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 arrangements for trade marks whereby undertakings can by means of one procedural system obtain \u00e82\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 to which uniform protection is given and which produce their effects throughout the entire area of the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7. The principle of the unitary character of the \u00e82\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 thus stated should apply unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n(5)The barrier of territoriality of the rights conferred on proprietors of trade marks by the laws of the Member States cannot be removed by approximation of laws. In order to open up unrestricted economic activity in the whole of the internal market for the benefit of undertakings, \u00d6\u00a0it should be possible to register\u00a0\u00d5 trade marks which are governed by a uniform \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 law directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 5\n\n\n(6)The experience acquired since the establishment of the Community trade mark system has shown that undertakings from within the Union and from third countries have accepted the system which has become a successful and viable complement and alternative to the protection of trade marks at the level of the Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(7)The \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 law relating to trade marks nevertheless does not replace the laws of the Member States on trade marks. It would not in fact appear to be justified to require undertakings to apply for registration of their trade marks as \u00e82\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(8)National trade marks continue to be necessary for those undertakings which do not want protection of their trade marks at Union level, or which are unable to obtain Union-wide protection while national protection does not face any obstacles. It should be left to each person seeking trade mark protection to decide whether the protection is sought only as a national trade mark in one or more Member States, or only as an EU trade mark, or both.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 7\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\n\n(9)The rights in an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 should not be obtained otherwise than by registration, and registration should be refused in particular if the trade mark is not distinctive, if it is unlawful or if it conflicts with earlier rights.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(10)A sign should be permitted to be represented in any appropriate form using generally available technology, and thus not necessarily by graphic means, as long as the representation is clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 8\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(11)The protection afforded by an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, the function of which is in particular to guarantee the trade mark as an indication of origin, should be absolute in the case of identity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services. The protection should apply also in cases of similarity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services. An interpretation should be given of the concept of similarity in relation to the likelihood of confusion. The likelihood of confusion, the appreciation of which depends on numerous elements and, in particular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, the association which can be made with the used or registered sign, the degree of similarity between the trade mark and the sign and between the goods or services identified, should constitute the specific condition for such protection.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 (adapted)\n\n\n(12)In order to ensure legal certainty and full consistency with the principle of priority, under which a registered earlier trade mark takes precedence over later registered trade marks, it is necessary to provide that the enforcement of rights conferred by an\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark should be without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired prior to the filing or priority date of the EU trade mark. This is in conformity with Article\u00a016(1) of the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights of\u00a015\u00a0April 1994.\n\n\n(13)Confusion as to the commercial source from which the goods or services emanate may occur when a company uses the same or a similar sign as a trade name in \u00d6\u00a0such\u00a0\u00d5 a way that a link is established between the company bearing the name and the goods or services coming from that company. Infringement of an\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark should therefore also comprise the use of the sign as a trade name or similar designation as long as the use is made for the purposes of distinguishing goods or services.\n\n\n(14)In order to ensure legal certainty and full consistency with specific Union legislation, it is appropriate to provide that the proprietor of an EU trade mark should be entitled to prohibit a third party from using a sign in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising is contrary to Directive\u00a02006/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n11\n.\n\n\n(15)In order to \u00d6\u00a0ensure\u00a0\u00d5 trade mark protection and combat counterfeiting effectively, and in line with international obligations of the Union under the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in particular Article\u00a0V of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on freedom of transit and, as regards generic medicines, the \u2018Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health\u2019 adopted by the Doha WTO Ministerial Conference on 14\u00a0November 2001, the proprietor of an EU trade mark should be entitled to prevent third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Union without being released for free circulation there, where such goods come from third countries and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical or essentially identical with the EU trade mark registered in respect of such goods.\n\n\n(16)To this effect, it should be permissible for EU trade mark proprietors to prevent the entry of infringing goods and their placement in all customs situations, including transit, transhipment, warehousing, free zones, temporary storage, inward processing or temporary admission, also when such goods are not intended to be placed on the market of the Union. In performing customs controls, the customs authorities should make use of the powers and procedures laid down in Regulation (EU) No\u00a0608/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council\n12\n, also at the request of the right holders. In particular, the customs authorities should carry out the relevant controls on the basis of risk analysis criteria.\n\n\n(17)In order to reconcile the need to ensure the effective enforcement of trade mark rights with the necessity to avoid hampering the free flow of trade in legitimate goods, the entitlement of the proprietor of the EU trade mark should lapse where, during the subsequent proceedings initiated before the European Union trade mark court (\u2018EU\u00a0trade mark court\u2019) competent to take a substantive decision on whether the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark has been infringed, the declarant or the holder of the goods is able to prove that the proprietor of the EU trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.\n\n\n(18)Article\u00a028 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0608/2013 provides that a right holder is to be liable for damages towards the holder of the goods where, inter alia, the goods in question are subsequently found not to infringe an intellectual property right.\n\n\n(19)Appropriate measures should be taken with a view to ensuring the smooth transit of generic medicines. With respect to international non-proprietary names (INN) as globally recognised generic names for active substances in pharmaceutical preparations, it is vital to take due account of the existing limitations on the effect of\u00a0EU trade mark rights. Consequently, the proprietor of an EU trade mark should not have the right to prevent a third party from bringing goods into the Union without being released for free circulation there, based upon similarities between the\u00a0INN for the active ingredient in the medicines and the trade mark.\n\n\n(20)In order to enable proprietors of EU trade marks to combat counterfeiting effectively, they should be entitled to prohibit the affixing of an infringing mark to goods and preparatory acts carried out prior to the affixing.\n\n\n(21)The exclusive rights conferred by an EU trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. In order to \u00d6\u00a0ensure\u00a0\u00d5 equal conditions for trade names and EU trade marks in the event of conflicts, given that trade names are regularly granted unrestricted protection against later trade marks, such use should be only considered to include the use of the personal name of the third party. It should further permit the use of descriptive or non-distinctive signs or indications in general. Furthermore, the proprietor should not be entitled to prevent the fair and honest use of the EU trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to the goods or services as those of the proprietor. Use of a trade mark by third parties to draw the consumer's attention to the resale of genuine goods that were originally sold by or with the consent of the proprietor of the EU trade mark in the Union should be considered as being fair as long as it is at the same time in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Use of a trade mark by third parties for the purpose of artistic expression should be considered as being fair as long as it is at the same time in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Furthermore, this Regulation should be applied in a way that ensures full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the freedom of expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(22)It follows from the principle of free movement of goods that the proprietor of an\u00a0\u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 must not be entitled to prohibit its use by a third party in relation to goods which have been put into circulation in the \u00d6\u00a0European Economic Area\u00a0\u00d5, under the trade mark, by him or with his consent, save where there exist legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further commercialisation of the goods.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 22\n\n\n(23)In order to ensure legal certainty and safeguard legitimately acquired trade mark rights, it is appropriate and necessary to lay down, without prejudice to the principle that the later trade mark cannot be enforced against the earlier trade mark, that proprietors of EU trade marks should not be entitled to oppose the use of a later trade mark if the later trade mark was acquired at a time when the earlier trade mark could not be enforced against the later trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 10\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(24)There is no justification for protecting \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 or, as against them, any trade mark which has been registered before them, except where the trade marks are actually used.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 23\n\n\n(25)For reasons of equity and legal certainty, the use of an EU trade mark in a form that differs in elements which do not alter the distinctive character of that mark, in the form in which it is registered, should be sufficient to preserve the rights conferred regardless of whether the trade mark in the form as used is also registered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(26)An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is to be regarded as an object of property which exists separately from the undertakings whose goods or services are designated by it. Accordingly, it should be capable of being transferred, of being charged as security in favour of a third party and of being the subject matter of licences.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n(27)Administrative measures are necessary at \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 level for implementing in relation to every trade mark the trade mark law \u00d6\u00a0laid down\u00a0\u00d5 by this Regulation. It is therefore essential, while retaining the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, to provide for a \u00d6\u00a0European Union Intellectual Property Office\u00a0(\u2018the Office\u2019) \u00d5 which is independent in relation to technical matters and has legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To this end it is necessary and appropriate that \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 Office should be a body of the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 having legal personality and exercising the powers which are conferred on it by this Regulation, and that it should operate within the framework of \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 law without detracting from the competencies exercised by the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 institutions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 25 (adapted)\n\n\n(28)EU trade mark protection is granted in relation to specific goods or services whose nature and number determine the extent of protection afforded to the trade mark proprietor. It is therefore essential to \u00d6\u00a0lay down\u00a0\u00d5 rules for the designation and classification of goods and services in \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation and to ensure legal certainty and sound administration by requiring that the goods and services for which trade mark protection is sought are identified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the competent authorities and economic operators, on the basis of the application alone, to determine the extent of the protection applied for. The use of general terms should be interpreted as only including all goods and services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the term. Proprietors of EU trade marks, which because of the practice of the Office \u00d6\u00a0prior to 22\u00a0June 2012 were\u00a0\u00d5 registered in respect of the entire heading of a class of the \u00d6\u00a0system of classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of 15\u00a0June 1957\u00a0\u00d5, should be given the possibility to adapt their lists of goods and services in order to ensure that the content of the Register meets the requisite standard of clarity and precision in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 26 (adapted)\n\n\n(29)\u00d6\u00a0In order to avoid unnecessary delays in registering an EU trade mark,\u00a0\u00d5 it is appropriate to \u00d6\u00a0lay down a\u00a0\u00d5 regime of \u00d6\u00a0optional\u00a0\u00d5 EU and national trade mark searches \u00d6\u00a0that should be\u00a0\u00d5 flexible in terms of user needs and preferences. The optional EU and national trade mark searches should be complemented by the making available of all-encompassing, fast and powerful search engines for the use of the public free of charge within the context of cooperation between the Office and the central industrial property offices of the Member States, including the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\n(30)It is necessary to ensure that parties who are affected by decisions made by the Office are protected by the law in a manner which is suited to the special character of trade mark law. To that end, provision \u00d6\u00a0should be\u00a0\u00d5 made for an appeal to lie from decisions of the various \u00d6\u00a0decision-making instances\u00a0\u00d5 of the Office. A Board of Appeal of the Office \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 decide on \u00d6\u00a0the appeal\u00a0\u00d5. Decisions of the Boards of Appeal \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5, in turn, \u00d6\u00a0be\u00a0\u00d5 amenable to actions before the \u00d6\u00a0General\u00a0\u00d5 Court, which has jurisdiction to annul or to alter the contested decision.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 15 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(31)In order to \u00d6\u00a0ensure\u00a0\u00d5 the protection of \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 the Member States should designate, having regard to their own national system, as limited a number as possible of national courts of first and second instance having jurisdiction in matters of infringement and validity of \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 16\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n(32)Decisions regarding the validity and infringement of \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 must have effect and cover the entire area of the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, as this is the only way of preventing inconsistent decisions on the part of the courts and the Office and of ensuring that the unitary character of \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 is not undermined. The provisions of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n should apply to all actions at law relating to \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7, save where this Regulation derogates from those rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 17\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(33)Contradictory judgments should be avoided in actions which involve the same acts and the same parties and which are brought on the basis of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 and parallel national trade marks. For this purpose, when the actions are brought in the same Member State, the way in which this is to be achieved is a matter for national procedural rules, which are not prejudiced by this Regulation, whilst when the actions are brought in different Member States, provisions modelled on the rules on lis\u00a0pendens and related actions of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01215/2012 appear appropriate.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 30\n\n\n(34)With the aim of promoting convergence of practices and of developing common tools, it is necessary to establish an appropriate framework for cooperation between the Office and the industrial property offices of the Member States, including the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property, defining key areas of cooperation and enabling the Office to coordinate relevant common projects of interest to the Union and the Member States and to finance, up to a maximum amount, those projects. Those cooperation activities should be beneficial for undertakings using trade mark systems in Europe. For users of the Union regime laid down in this Regulation, the projects, particularly the databases for search and consultation purposes, should provide additional, inclusive, efficient tools that are free of charge to comply with the specific requirements arising from the unitary character of the EU trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 33\n\n\n(35)It is desirable to facilitate friendly, expeditious and efficient dispute resolution by entrusting the Office with the establishment of a mediation centre the services of which could be used by any person with the aim of achieving a friendly settlement of disputes relating to EU trade marks and Community designs by mutual agreement.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 34\n\n\n(36)The setting up of the EU trade mark system has resulted in increased financial burdens for the central industrial property offices and other authorities of the Member States. The additional costs are related to the handling of a higher number of opposition and invalidity proceedings involving EU trade marks or brought by proprietors of such trade marks; to the awareness-raising activities linked to the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark system; as well as to activities intended to ensure the enforcement of EU trade mark rights. It is, therefore, appropriate to ensure that the Office offset part of the costs incurred by Member States for the role they play in ensuring the smooth functioning of the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark system. The payment of such offsetting should be subject to the submission, by Member States, of relevant statistical data. The offsetting of costs should not be of such an extent that it would cause a budgetary deficit for the Office.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 recital 18\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n(37)In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Office, it is considered necessary to grant it an autonomous budget whose revenue comes principally from fees paid by the users of the system. However, the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 budgetary procedure remains applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 are concerned. Moreover, the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 35\n\n\n(38)In the interest of sound financial management, the accumulation by the Office of significant budgetary surpluses should be avoided. This should be without prejudice to the Office maintaining a financial reserve covering one year of its operational expenditure to ensure the continuity of its operations and the performance of its tasks. That reserve should only be used to ensure the continuity of the tasks of the Office as specified in this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 36 (adapted)\n\n\n(39)Given the essential importance of the amounts of fees payable to the Office for the functioning of the EU trade mark system and its complementary relationship as regards national trade mark systems, it is necessary to set those fee amounts directly in \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation in the form of an annex. The amounts of the fees should be fixed at a level which ensures that: first, the revenue they produce is in principle sufficient for the budget of the Office to be balanced; second, there is coexistence and complementarity between the EU trade mark and the national trade mark systems, also taking into account the size of the market covered by the EU trade mark and the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises; and third, the rights of proprietors of an EU trade mark are enforced efficiently in the Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 39 (adapted)\n\n\n(40)In order to ensure an effective, efficient and expeditious examination and registration of EU trade mark applications by the Office using procedures which are transparent, thorough, fair and equitable, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 \u00d6\u00a0of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the procedures for filing and examining an opposition and \u00d6\u00a0on the\u00a0\u00d5 procedures governing the amendment of the application.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 40 (adapted)\n\n\n(41)In order to ensure that an EU trade mark can be revoked or declared invalid in an effective and efficient way by means of transparent, thorough, fair and equitable procedures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the procedures for revocation and declaration of invalidity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 41 (adapted)\n\n\n(42)In order to allow for an effective, efficient and complete review of decisions of the Office by the Boards of Appeal by means of a transparent, thorough, fair and equitable procedure which takes into account the principles laid down in \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the formal content of the notice of appeal, the procedure for the filing and examination of an appeal, the formal content and form of the Board of Appeal's decisions, and the reimbursement of the appeal fees.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 42 (adapted)\n\n\n(43)In order to ensure a smooth, effective and efficient operation of the EU trade mark system, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the requirements as to the details on oral proceedings and the detailed arrangements for taking of evidence, the detailed arrangements for notification, the means of communication and the forms to be used by the parties to proceedings, the rules governing the calculation and duration of time limits, the procedures for the revocation of a decision or for cancellation of an entry in the Register, the detailed arrangements for the resumption of proceedings, and the details on representation before the Office.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\n(44)In order to ensure an effective and efficient organisation of the Boards of Appeal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the organisation of the Boards of Appeal.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 44 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(45)In order to ensure the effective and efficient registration of international trade marks in a manner that is fully consistent with the rules of the Protocol relating to the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of marks, \u00d6\u00a0adopted at Madrid on 27\u00a0June 1989 ('Madrid Protocol'),\u00a0\u00d5 the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\u00a0290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the procedures concerning the filing and examination of an opposition, including the necessary communications to be made to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), and the details of the procedure concerning international registrations based on a basic application or basic registration relating to a collective mark, certification mark or guarantee mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 38 (adapted)\n\n\n(46)It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level \u00d6\u00a0, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13\u00a0April 2016 on Better Law-Making\u00a0\u00d5. \u00d6\u00a0In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 45\n\n\n(47)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of specifying the details concerning applications, requests, certificates, claims, regulations, notifications and any other document under the relevant procedural requirements established by this Regulation as well as in respect of maximum rates for costs essential to the proceedings and actually incurred, details concerning publications in the European Union Trade Marks Bulletin and the Official Journal of the Office, the detailed arrangements for exchange of information between the Office and national authorities, detailed arrangements concerning translations of supporting documents in written proceedings, exact types of decisions to be taken by a single member of the opposition or cancellation divisions, details of the notification obligation pursuant to the Madrid Protocol, and detailed requirements regarding the request for territorial extension subsequent to international registration. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 recital 46\n\n\n(48)Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nEU trade mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n1. A trade mark for goods or services which is registered in accordance with the conditions contained in this Regulation and in the manner herein provided is hereinafter referred to as a \u00e81\u00a0\u2018European Union trade mark (\u201cEU trade mark\u201d)\u2019\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n2. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7: it shall not be registered, transferred or surrendered or be the subject of a decision revoking the rights of the proprietor or declaring it invalid, nor shall its use be prohibited, save in respect of the whole \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7. This principle shall apply unless otherwise provided \u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 in this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.7 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nOffice\n\n\n1. A European Union Intellectual Property Office (\u2018the Office\u2019) is established.\n\n\n2.

Paragraph\u00a01(b), (c) and (d) shall not apply if the trade mark has become distinctive in relation to the goods or services for which registration is requested in consequence of the use which has been made of it.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nRelative grounds for refusal\n\n\n1. Upon opposition by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered:\n\n\n(a)if it is identical with the earlier trade mark and the goods or services for which registration is applied for are identical with the goods or services for which the earlier trade mark is protected;\n\n\n(b)if because of its identity with, or similarity to, the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the territory in which the earlier trade mark is protected; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.\n\n\n2. For the purposes of paragraph\u00a01, \u2018earlier trade marks\u2019 means:\n\n\n(a)trade marks of the following kinds with a date of application for registration which is earlier than the date of application for registration of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, taking account, where appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of those trade marks:\n\n\n(i)\u00e82\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7;\n\n\n(ii)trade marks registered in a Member State, or, in the case of Belgium, the Netherlands or Luxembourg, at the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property;\n\n\n(iii)trade marks registered under international arrangements which have effect in a Member State;\n\n\n\n\n(iv)trade marks registered under international arrangements which have effect in the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7;\n\n\n(b)applications for the trade marks referred to in point\u00a0(a), subject to their registration;\n\n\n(c)trade marks which, on the date of application for registration of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, or, where appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application for registration of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, are well known in a Member State, in the sense in which the words \u2018well known\u2019 are used in Article\u00a06bis of the Paris Convention.\n\n\n3. Upon opposition by the proprietor of the trade mark, a trade mark shall not be registered where an agent or representative of the proprietor of the trade mark applies for registration thereof in his own name without the proprietor's consent, unless the agent or representative justifies his action.\n\n\n4. Upon opposition by the proprietor of a non-registered trade mark or of another sign used in the course of trade of more than mere local significance, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered where and to the extent that, pursuant to \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 legislation or the law of the Member State governing that sign:\n\n\n(a)rights to that sign were acquired prior to the date of application for registration of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, or the date of the priority claimed for the application for registration of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7;\n\n\n(b)that sign confers on its proprietor the right to prohibit the use of a subsequent trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.10(a)\n\n\n5.

Upon opposition by the proprietor of a registered earlier trade mark within the meaning of paragraph\u00a02, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered where it is identical with, or similar to, an earlier trade mark, irrespective of whether the goods or services for which it is applied are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered, where, in the case of an earlier EU trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Union or, in the case of an earlier national trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Member State concerned, and where the use without due cause of the trade mark applied for would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nEffects of \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.11\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nRights conferred by an EU trade mark\n\n\n1. The registration of an EU trade mark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein.\n\n\n2. Without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired before the filing date or the priority date of the EU trade mark, the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where:\n\n\n(a)the sign is identical with the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered;\n\n\n(b)the sign is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with, or similar to, the goods or services for which the EU trade mark is registered, if there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark;\n\n\n(c)the sign is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark irrespective of whether it is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the EU trade mark is registered, where the latter has a reputation in the Union and where use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark.\n\n\n3. The following, in particular, may be prohibited under paragraph\u00a02:\n\n\n(a)affixing the sign to the goods or to the packaging thereof;\n\n\n(b)offering the goods, putting them on the market, or stocking them for those purposes under the sign, or offering or supplying services thereunder;\n\n\n(c)importing or exporting the goods under the sign;\n\n\n(d)using the sign as a trade or company name or part of a trade or company name;\n\n\n(e)using the sign on business papers and in advertising;\n\n\n(f)using the sign in comparative advertising in a manner that is contrary to Directive\u00a02006/114/EC.\n\n\n4. Without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired before the filing date or the priority date of the EU trade mark, the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall also be entitled to prevent all third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Union without being released for free circulation there, where such goods, including packaging, come from third countries and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical with the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trade mark.\n\n\nThe entitlement of the proprietor of an EU trade mark pursuant to the first subparagraph shall lapse if, during the proceedings to determine whether the EU trade mark has been infringed, initiated in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0608/2013, evidence is provided by the declarant or the holder of the goods that the proprietor of the EU trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.12\n\n\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\nRight to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of packaging or other means\n\n\nWhere the risk exists that the packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices or any other means to which the mark is affixed could be used in relation to goods or services and such use would constitute an infringement of the rights of the proprietor of an\u00a0EU trade mark under Article\u00a09(2) and (3), the proprietor of that trade mark shall have the right to prohibit the following acts if carried out in the course of trade:\n\n\n(a)affixing a sign identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark on packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices or any other means to which the mark may be affixed;\n\n\n(b)offering or placing on the market, or stocking for those purposes, or importing or exporting, packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices or any other means to which the mark is affixed.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nDate from which rights against third parties prevail\n\n\n1. The rights conferred by an EU trade mark shall prevail against third parties from the date of publication of the registration of the trade mark.\n\n\n2. Reasonable compensation may be claimed in respect of acts occurring after the date of publication of an EU trade mark application, where those acts would, after publication of the registration of the trade mark, be prohibited by virtue of that publication.\n\n\n3.

Use of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 with the consent of the proprietor shall be deemed to constitute use by the proprietor.\n\n\nSECTION 4\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 as objects of property\n\n\nArticle 19\n\n\nDealing with \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7 as national trade marks\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.17\n\n\n1. Unless Articles\u00a020 to 28 provide otherwise, an EU trade mark as an object of property shall be dealt with in its entirety, and for the whole area of the Union, as a national trade mark registered in the Member State in which, according to the Register:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n(a)the proprietor has his seat or his domicile on the relevant date;\n\n\n\n\n(b)where point\u00a0(a) does not apply, the proprietor has an establishment on the relevant date.\n\n\n2. In cases which are not provided for by paragraph\u00a01, the Member State referred to in that paragraph shall be the Member State in which the seat of the Office is situated.\n\n\n3. If two or more persons are mentioned in the Register as joint proprietors, paragraph\u00a01 shall apply to the joint proprietor first mentioned; failing this, it shall apply to the subsequent joint proprietors in the order in which they are mentioned. Where paragraph 1 does not apply to any of the joint proprietors, paragraph\u00a02 shall apply.\n\n\nArticle 20\n\n\nTransfer\n\n\n1. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be transferred, separately from any transfer of the undertaking, in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered.\n\n\n2. A transfer of the whole of the undertaking shall include the transfer of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 except where, in accordance with the law governing the transfer, there is agreement to the contrary or circumstances clearly dictate otherwise. This provision shall apply to the contractual obligation to transfer the undertaking.\n\n\n3. Without prejudice to paragraph\u00a02, an assignment of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be made in writing and shall require the signature of the parties to the contract, except when it is a result of a judgment; otherwise it shall be void.\n\n\n4. On request of one of the parties a transfer shall be entered in the Register and published.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.18(b)\n\n\n5. An application for registration of a transfer shall contain information to identify the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark, the new proprietor, the goods and services to which the transfer relates, as well as documents duly establishing the transfer in accordance with paragraphs\u00a02 and 3. The application may further contain, where applicable, information to identify the representative of the new proprietor.\n\n\n6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying:\n\n\n(a)the details to be contained in the application for registration of a transfer;\n\n\n(b)the kind of documentation required to establish a transfer, taking account of the agreements given by the registered proprietor and the successor in title;\n\n\n(c)the details of how to process applications for partial transfers, ensuring that the goods and services in the remaining registration and the new registration do not overlap and that a separate file, including a new registration number, is established for the new registration.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n7. Where the conditions applicable to the registration of a transfer, as laid down in paragraphs\u00a01, 2 and 3, or in the implementing acts referred to in paragraph\u00a06, are not fulfilled, the Office shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, it shall reject the application for registration of the transfer.\n\n\n8. A single application for registration of a transfer may be submitted for two or more trade marks, provided that the registered proprietor and the successor in title are the same in each case.\n\n\n9. Paragraphs\u00a05 to 8 shall also apply to applications for EU trade marks.\n\n\n\n\n10. In the case of a partial transfer, any application made by the original proprietor pending with regard to the original registration shall be deemed to be pending with regard to the remaining registration and the new registration. Where such application is subject to the payment of fees and those fees have been paid by the original proprietor, the new proprietor shall not be liable to pay any additional fees with regard to such application.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n11. As long as the transfer has not been entered in the Register, the successor in title may not invoke the rights arising from the registration of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n12. Where there are time limits to be observed vis-\u00e0-vis the Office, the successor in title may make the corresponding statements to the Office once the request for registration of the transfer has been received by the Office.\n\n\n13. All documents which require notification to the proprietor of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 in accordance with Article 98 shall be addressed to the person registered as proprietor.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.19\n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\nTransfer of a trade mark registered in the name of an agent\n\n\n1. Where an EU trade mark is registered in the name of the agent or representative of a person who is the proprietor of that trade mark, without the proprietor's authorisation, the latter shall be entitled to demand the assignment of the EU trade mark in his favour, unless such agent or representative justifies his action.\n\n\n2. The proprietor may submit a request for assignment pursuant to paragraph\u00a01 of this Article to the following:\n\n\n(a)the Office, pursuant to Article 60(1)(b), instead of an application for a declaration of invalidity;\n\n\n(b)a European Union trade mark court (\u2018EU trade mark court\u2019) as referred to in Article\u00a0123, instead of a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity based on Article\u00a0128(1).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nRights in rem\n\n\n\n\n1.

At the request of one of the parties, the rights referred to in paragraph\u00a01 or the transfer of those rights shall be entered in the Register and published.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.20(b)\n\n\n3.

An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be levied in execution.\n\n\n2. As regards the procedure for levy of execution in respect of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, the courts and authorities of the Member States determined in accordance with Article\u00a019 shall have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n3.

The only insolvency proceedings in which an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be involved are those opened in the Member State in the territory of which the debtor has his centre of main interests.\n\n\nHowever, where the debtor is an insurance undertaking or a credit institution as defined in Directive\u00a02009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n and Directive\u00a02001/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n, respectively, the only insolvency proceedings in which an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be involved are those opened in the Member State where that undertaking or institution has been authorised.\n\n\n2. In the case of joint proprietorship of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, paragraph\u00a01 shall apply to the share of the joint proprietor.\n\n\n3.

An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be licensed for some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered and for the whole or part of the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7. A licence may be exclusive or non-exclusive.\n\n\n2. The proprietor of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may invoke the rights conferred by that trade mark against a licensee who contravenes any provision in his licensing contract with regard to:\n\n\n(a)its duration;\n\n\n(b)the form covered by the registration in which the trade mark may be used;\n\n\n(c)the scope of the goods or services for which the licence is granted;\n\n\n(d)the territory in which the trade mark may be affixed; or\n\n\n(e)the quality of the goods manufactured or of the services provided by the licensee.\n\n\n3. Without prejudice to the provisions of the licensing contract, the licensee may bring proceedings for infringement of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 only if its proprietor consents thereto. However, the holder of an exclusive licence may bring such proceedings if the proprietor of the trade mark, after formal notice, does not himself bring infringement proceedings within an appropriate period.\n\n\n4. A licensee shall, for the purpose of obtaining compensation for damage suffered by him, be entitled to intervene in infringement proceedings brought by the proprietor of the \u00e81\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n5.

The application for registration of a licence may contain a request to record a licence in the Register as one or more of the following:\n\n\n(a)an exclusive licence;\n\n\n(b)a sub-licence in the event that the licence is granted by a licensee whose licence is recorded in the Register;\n\n\n(c)a licence limited to only part of the goods or services for which the mark is registered;\n\n\n(d)a licence limited to part of the Union;\n\n\n(e)a temporary licence.\n\n\nWhere a request is made to record the licence as a licence listed in points\u00a0(c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph, the application for registration of a licence shall indicate the goods and services, the part of the Union and the time period for which the licence is granted.\n\n\n4. Where the conditions applicable to registration, as laid down in Articles\u00a022 to 25, \u00d6\u00a0in\u00a0\u00d5 paragraphs\u00a01 and 3 of this Article and in the other applicable rules adopted pursuant to this Regulation, are not fulfilled, the Office shall notify the applicant of the deficiency.

Legal acts referred to in Articles\u00a020, 22 and 25 concerning an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall have effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties in all the Member States only after entry in the Register. Nevertheless, such an act, before it is so entered, shall have effect vis-\u00e0-vis third parties who have acquired rights in the trade mark after the date of that act but who knew of the act at the date on which the rights were acquired.\n\n\n2. Paragraph\u00a01 shall not apply in the case of a person who acquires the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 or a right concerning the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 by way of transfer of the whole of the undertaking or by any other universal succession.\n\n\n3. The effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties of the legal acts referred to in Article\u00a023 shall be governed by the law of the Member State determined in accordance with Article\u00a019.\n\n\n4. Until such time as common rules for the Member States in the field of bankruptcy enter into force, the effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties of bankruptcy or \u00d6\u00a0similar\u00a0\u00d5 proceedings shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which such proceedings are first brought within the meaning of national law or of conventions applicable in this field.\n\n\nArticle 28\n\n\nThe application for an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 as an object of property\n\n\nArticles\u00a019 to 27 shall apply to applications for \u00e81\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.24\n\n\nArticle 29\n\n\nProcedure for cancelling or modifying the entry in the Register of licences and other\u00a0rights\n\n\n1.

An application for an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall contain:\n\n\n(a)a request for the registration of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7;\n\n\n(b)information identifying the applicant;\n\n\n(c)a list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.26(a)\n\n\n(d)a representation of the mark, which satisfies the requirements set out in Article\u00a04(b).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.26(b)\n\n\n2. The application for an EU trade mark shall be subject to the payment of the application fee covering one class of goods or services and, where appropriate, of one or more class fees for each class of goods and services exceeding the first class and, where applicable, the search fee.\n\n\n3. In addition to the requirements referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2, an application for an\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark shall comply with the formal requirements laid down in this Regulation and in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to it. If those conditions provide for the trade mark to be represented electronically, the Executive Director may determine the formats and maximum size of such an electronic file.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.26(c)\n\n\n4. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.27\n\n\nArticle 32\n\n\nDate of filing\n\n\nThe date of filing of an EU trade mark application shall be the date on which the documents containing the information specified in Article\u00a031(1) are filed with the Office by the applicant, subject to payment of the application fee within one month of filing those documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.28\n\n\nArticle 33\n\n\nDesignation and classification of goods and services\n\n\n1. Goods and services in respect of which trade mark registration is applied for shall be classified in conformity with the system of classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of 15\u00a0June 1957 (\u2018the Nice Classification\u2019).\n\n\n2. The goods and services for which the protection of the trade mark is sought shall be identified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the competent authorities and economic operators, on that sole basis, to determine the extent of the protection sought.\n\n\n3. For the purposes of paragraph\u00a02, the general indications included in the class headings of the Nice Classification or other general terms may be used, provided that they comply with the requisite standards of clarity and precision set out in this Article.\n\n\n4. The Office shall reject an application in respect of indications or terms which are unclear or imprecise, where the applicant does not suggest an acceptable wording within a period set by the Office to that effect.\n\n\n5. The use of general terms, including the general indications of the class headings of the Nice Classification, shall be interpreted as including all the goods or services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indication or term. The use of such terms or indications shall not be interpreted as comprising a claim to goods or services which cannot be so understood.\n\n\n6. Where the applicant requests registration for more than one class, the applicant shall group the goods and services according to the classes of the Nice Classification, each group being preceded by the number of the class to which that group of goods or services belongs, and shall present them in the order of the classes.\n\n\n7. Goods and services shall not be regarded as being similar to each other on the ground that they appear in the same class under the Nice Classification. Goods and services shall not be regarded as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that they appear in different classes under the Nice Classification.\n\n\n8. Proprietors of EU trade marks applied for before 22\u00a0June 2012 which are registered in respect of the entire heading of a Nice class may declare that their intention on the date of filing had been to seek protection in respect of goods or services beyond those covered by the literal meaning of the heading of that class, provided that the goods or services so designated are included in the alphabetical list for that class in the edition of the Nice Classification in force at the date of filing.\n\n\nThe declaration shall be filed at the Office by 24\u00a0September 2016, and shall indicate, in a clear, precise and specific manner, the goods and services, other than those clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indications of the class heading, originally covered by the proprietor's intention. The Office shall take appropriate measures to amend the Register accordingly. The possibility to make a declaration in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the application of Article\u00a018, Article\u00a047(2), Article\u00a058(1)(a), and Article\u00a064(2).\n\n\nEU trade marks for which no declaration is filed within the period referred to in the second subparagraph shall be deemed to extend, as from the expiry of that period, only to goods or services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indications included in the heading of the relevant class.\n\n\n9. Where the register is amended, the exclusive rights conferred by the EU trade mark under Article\u00a09 shall not prevent a third party from continuing to use a trade mark in relation to goods or services where and to the extent that the use of the trade mark for those goods or services:\n\n\n(a)commenced before the register was amended; and\n\n\n(b)did not infringe the proprietor's rights based on the literal meaning of the record of the goods and services in the register at that time.\n\n\nIn addition, the amendment of the list of goods or services recorded in the register shall not give the proprietor of the EU trade mark the right to oppose or to apply for a declaration of invalidity of a later trade mark where and to the extent that:\n\n\n(a)the later trade mark was either in use, or an application had been made to register the trade mark, for goods or services before the register was amended; and\n\n\n(b)the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services did not infringe, or would not have infringed, the proprietor's rights based on the literal meaning of the record of the goods and services in the register at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.29(a)\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nPriority\n\n\nArticle 34\n\n\nRight of priority\n\n\n1. A person who has duly filed an application for a trade mark in or in respect of any State party to the Paris Convention or to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, or his successors in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application for the same trade mark in respect of goods or services which are identical with or contained within those for which the application has been filed, a right of priority during a period of six months from the date of filing of the first application.\n\n\n2. Every filing that is equivalent to a regular national filing under the national law of the State where it was made or under bilateral or multilateral agreements shall be recognised as giving rise to a right of priority.\n\n\n3. By a regular national filing is meant any filing that is sufficient to establish the date on which the application was filed, whatever may be the outcome of the application.\n\n\n4. A subsequent application for a trade mark which was the subject of a previous first application in respect of the same goods or services and which is filed in or in respect of the same State shall be considered as the first application for the purposes of determining priority, provided that, at the date of filing of the subsequent application, the previous application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served as a basis for claiming a right of priority. The previous application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority.\n\n\n5. If the first filing has been made in a State which is not a party to the Paris Convention or to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, paragraphs\u00a01 to 4 shall apply only in so far as that State, according to published findings, grants, on the basis of the first filing made at the Office and subject to conditions equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation, a right of priority having equivalent effect. \u00e82\u00a0The Executive Director shall, where necessary, request the Commission to consider enquiring as to whether a State within the meaning of the first sentence accords that reciprocal treatment. If the Commission determines that reciprocal treatment in accordance with the first sentence is accorded, it shall publish a communication to that effect in the Official Journal of the European Union.\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.29(b)\n\n\n6. Paragraph\u00a05 shall apply from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the communication determining that reciprocal treatment is accorded, unless the communication states an earlier date from which it is applicable. It shall cease to apply from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of a communication of the Commission to the effect that reciprocal treatment is no longer accorded, unless the communication states an earlier date from which it is applicable.\n\n\n7. Communications as referred to in paragraphs\u00a05 and 6 shall also be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.30\n\n\nArticle 35\n\n\nClaiming priority\n\n\n\n\n1. Priority claims shall be filed together with the EU trade mark application and shall include the date, number and country of the previous application. The documentation in support of priority claims shall be filed within three months of the filing date.\n\n\n2. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the kind of documentation to be filed for claiming the priority of a previous application in accordance with paragraph\u00a01 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n3. The Executive Director may determine that the documentation to be provided by the applicant in support of the priority claim may consist of less than what is required under the specifications adopted in accordance with paragraph\u00a02, provided that the information required is available to the Office from other sources.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\u00e83\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.31(a)\n\n\nArticle 36\n\n\nEffect of priority right\n\n\nThe right of priority shall have the effect that the date of priority shall count as the date of filing of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application for the purposes of establishing which rights take precedence.\n\n\nArticle 37\n\n\nEquivalence of \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 filing with national filing\n\n\nAn \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application which has been accorded a date of filing shall, in the Member States, be equivalent to a regular national filing, where appropriate with the priority claimed for the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application.\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\nExhibition priority\n\n\nArticle 38\n\n\nExhibition priority\n\n\n1. If an applicant for an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 has displayed goods or services under the mark applied for, at an official or officially recognised international exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention \u00d6\u00a0relating to\u00a0\u00d5 international exhibitions signed at Paris on\u00a022\u00a0November 1928 and last revised on 30\u00a0November 1972, he may, if he files the application within a period of six months from the date of the first display of the goods or services under the mark applied for, claim a right of priority from that date within the meaning of Article\u00a036. \u00e83\u00a0The priority claim shall be filed together with the EU trade mark application.\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.31(b)\n\n\n2. An applicant who wishes to claim priority pursuant to paragraph\u00a01 shall file evidence of the display of goods or services under the mark applied for within three months of the filing date.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n3. An exhibition priority granted in a Member State or in a third country does not extend the period of priority laid down in Article\u00a034.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.31(c)\n\n\n4. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the type and details of evidence to be filed for claiming an exhibition priority in accordance with paragraph\u00a02 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nSECTION 4\n\n\nSeniority of a national trade mark\n\n\nArticle 39\n\n\nClaiming seniority of a national trade mark \u00d6\u00a0in an application for an\u00a0EU\u00a0trade\u00a0mark or subsequent to the filing of the application\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1. The proprietor of an earlier trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries, or registered under international arrangements having effect in a Member State, who applies for an identical trade mark for registration as an\u00a0\u00e81\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 for goods or services which are identical with or contained within those for which the earlier trade mark has been registered, may claim for the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 the seniority of the earlier trade mark in respect of the Member State in or for which it is registered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.32(a)\n\n\n2. Seniority claims shall either be filed together with the EU trade mark application or within two months of the filing date of the application, and shall include the Member State or Member States in or for which the mark is registered, the number and the filing date of the relevant registration, and the goods and services for which the mark is registered. Where the seniority of one or more registered earlier trade marks is claimed in the application, the documentation in support of the seniority claim shall be filed within three months of the filing date. Where the applicant wishes to claim the seniority subsequent to the filing of the application, the documentation in support of the seniority claim shall be submitted to the Office within three months of receipt of the seniority claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n3. Seniority shall have the sole effect under this Regulation that, where the proprietor of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 surrenders the earlier trade mark or allows it to lapse, he shall be deemed to continue to have the same rights as he would have had if the earlier trade mark had continued to be registered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.32(b)\n\n\n4. The seniority claimed for the EU trade mark shall lapse where the earlier trade mark the seniority of which is claimed is declared to be invalid or revoked. Where the earlier trade mark is revoked, the seniority shall lapse provided that the revocation takes effect prior to the filing date or priority date of that EU trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.32(c)\n\n\n5. The Office shall inform the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property or the central industrial property office of the Member State concerned of the effective claiming of seniority.\n\n\n6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the kind of documentation to be filed for claiming the seniority of a national trade mark or a trade mark registered under international agreements having effect in a Member State in accordance with paragraph\u00a02 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n7. The Executive Director may determine that the documentation to be provided by the applicant in support of the seniority claim may consist of less than what is required under the specifications adopted in accordance with paragraph\u00a06, provided that the information required is available to the Office from other sources.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 40\n\n\nClaiming seniority \u00d6\u00a0of a national trade mark\u00a0\u00d5 after registration of \u00d6\u00a0an\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0\u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n1. The proprietor of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 who is the proprietor of an earlier identical trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries or of an earlier identical trade mark, with an international registration effective in a Member State, for goods or services which are identical to those for which the earlier trade mark has been registered, or contained within them, may claim the seniority of the earlier trade mark in respect of the Member State in or for which it was registered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.33(a)\n\n\n2. Seniority claims filed pursuant to paragraph\u00a01 of this Article shall include the registration number of the EU trade mark, the name and address of its proprietor, the Member State or Member States in or for which the earlier mark is registered, the number and the filing date of the relevant registration, the goods and services for which the mark is registered and those in respect of which seniority is claimed, and supporting documentation as provided for in the rules adopted pursuant to Article\u00a039(6). \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.33(b)\n\n\n3.

Where the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application does not satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph\u00a01, the Office shall request the applicant to remedy the deficiencies or the default on payment \u00e82\u00a0within two months of the receipt of the notification\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n3. If the deficiencies or the default on payment established pursuant to paragraph\u00a01(a) are not remedied within this period, the application shall not be dealt with as an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application. If the applicant complies with the Office's request, the Office shall accord as the date of filing of the application the date on which the deficiencies or the default on payment established are remedied.\n\n\n4. If the deficiencies established pursuant to paragraph\u00a01(b) are not remedied within the prescribed period, the Office shall refuse the application.\n\n\n5. If the default on payment established pursuant to paragraph\u00a01(c) is not remedied within the prescribed period, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless it is clear which categories of goods or services the amount paid is intended to cover. \u00e83\u00a0In the absence of other criteria to determine which classes are intended to be covered, the Office shall take the classes in the order of the classification. The application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn with regard to those classes for which the class fees have not been paid or have not been paid in full.\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n6. Failure to satisfy the requirements concerning the claim to priority shall result in loss of the right of priority for the application.\n\n\n7. Failure to satisfy the requirements concerning the claiming of seniority of a national trade mark shall result in loss of that right for the application.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.34(d)\n\n\n8. Where failure to satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph\u00a01(b) and (c) concerns only some of the goods or services, the Office shall refuse the application, or the right of priority or the right of seniority shall be lost, only in so far as those goods and services are concerned.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 42\n\n\nExamination as to absolute grounds for refusal\n\n\n1. Where, under Article\u00a07, a trade mark is ineligible for registration in respect of some or all of the goods or services covered by the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application, the application shall be refused as regards those goods or services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.35(b)\n\n\n2.

To this effect, the Office shall notify the applicant of the grounds for refusing registration and shall specify a period within which he may withdraw or amend the application or submit his observations. Where the applicant fails to overcome the grounds for refusing registration, the Office shall refuse registration in whole or in part.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.36 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 43\n\n\nSearch report\n\n\n1.

Where, at the time of filing an EU trade mark application, the applicant requests that a search report be prepared by the central industrial property offices of the Member States and where the appropriate search fee has been paid within the time limit for the payment of the filing fee, the Office shall transmit without delay a copy of the EU trade mark application to the central industrial property office of each Member State which has informed the Office of its decision to operate a search in its own register of trade marks in respect of EU trade mark applications.\n\n\n3. Each of the central industrial property offices of the Member States referred to in paragraph\u00a02 shall communicate a search report which shall either cite any earlier national trade marks, national trade mark applications or trade marks registered under international agreements, having effect in the Member State or Member States concerned, which have been discovered and which may be invoked under Article\u00a08 against the registration of the EU trade mark applied for, or state that the search has revealed no such rights.\n\n\n4. The Office, after consulting the Management Board provided for in Article\u00a0153 (\u2018the\u00a0Management Board\u2019), shall establish the contents and modalities for the reports.\n\n\n5.

The amount, which shall be the same for each office, shall be fixed by the Budget Committee by means of a decision adopted by a majority of three quarters of the representatives of the Member States.\n\n\n6. The Office shall transmit to the applicant for the EU trade mark the EU search report requested and any requested national search reports received.\n\n\n7. Upon publication of the EU trade mark application, the Office shall inform the proprietors of any earlier EU trade marks or EU trade mark applications cited in the EU search report of the publication of the EU trade mark application. The latter shall apply irrespective of whether the applicant has requested to receive the EU search report, unless the proprietor of an earlier registration or application requests not to receive the notification.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\n\n\nPublication of the application\n\n\nArticle 44\n\n\nPublication of the application\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.37(a)\n\n\n1.

The submission referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall be without prejudice to the right of the Office to re-open the examination of absolute grounds on its own initiative at any time before registration, where appropriate.\n\n\n4. The observations referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall be communicated to the applicant who may comment on them.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 46\n\n\nOpposition\n\n\n1.

Opposition shall be expressed in writing, and shall specify the grounds on which it is made. It shall not be considered as duly entered until the opposition fee has been paid.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.39(c)\n\n\n4.

If the applicant so requests, the proprietor of an earlier EU trade mark who has given notice of opposition shall furnish proof that, during the five-year period preceding the date of filing or the date of priority of the EU trade mark application, the earlier EU trade mark has been put to genuine use in the Union in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered and which he cites as justification for his opposition, or that there are proper reasons for non-use, provided \u00d6\u00a0that\u00a0\u00d5 the earlier EU trade mark has at that date been registered for not less than five years. In the absence of proof to this effect, the opposition shall be rejected. If the earlier EU trade mark has been used in relation to only part of the goods or services for which it is registered it shall, for the purposes of the examination of the opposition, be deemed to be registered in respect only of that part of the goods or services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n3.

The Office may, if it thinks fit, invite the parties to make a friendly settlement.\n\n\n5. If examination of the opposition reveals that the trade mark may not be registered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application has been made, the application shall be refused in respect of those goods or services. Otherwise the opposition shall be rejected.\n\n\n6. The decision refusing the application shall be published upon becoming final.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.41 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 48\n\n\nDelegation of powers\n\n\nThe Commission \u00d6\u00a0is\u00a0\u00d5 empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0208 specifying the details of the procedure for filing and examining an opposition set out in Articles\u00a046 and 47.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nSECTION 5\n\n\nWithdrawal, restriction, amendment and division of the\u00a0application\n\n\nArticle 49\n\n\nWithdrawal, restriction and amendment of the application\n\n\n1. The applicant may at any time withdraw his \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application or restrict the list of goods or services contained therein. Where the application has already been published, the withdrawal or restriction shall also be published.\n\n\n2. In other respects, an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application may be amended, upon request of the applicant, only by correcting the name and address of the applicant, errors of wording or of copying, or obvious mistakes, provided that such correction does not substantially change the trade mark or extend the list of goods or services. Where the amendments affect the representation of the trade mark or the list of goods or services and are made after publication of the application, the trade mark application shall be published as amended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.42 (adapted)\n\n\n3. The Commission \u00d6\u00a0is\u00a0\u00d5 empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0208 specifying the details of the procedure governing the amendment of the application.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nArticle 50\n\n\nDivision of the application\n\n\n1.

The goods or services in the divisional application shall not overlap with the goods or services which remain in the original application or those which are included in other divisional applications.\n\n\n2. The declaration of division shall not be admissible:\n\n\n(a)if, where an opposition has been entered against the original application, such a divisional application has the effect of introducing a division amongst the goods or services against which the opposition has been directed, until the decision of the Opposition Division has become final or the opposition proceedings are finally terminated otherwise;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.43(a)\n\n\n(b)before the date of filing referred to in Article\u00a032 has been accorded by the Office and during the opposition period provided for in Article\u00a046(1).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n3.

Where the Office finds that the requirements laid down in paragraph\u00a01 and in the rules adopted pursuant to paragraph\u00a09(a) are not fulfilled, it shall invite the applicant to remedy the deficiencies within a period to be specified by the Office. If the deficiencies are not remedied before the time limit expires, the Office shall refuse the declaration of division.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\n\n5. The division shall take effect on the date on which it is recorded in the files kept by the Office concerning the original application.\n\n\n6.

The fees for the original application which have been duly paid prior to the date on which the declaration of division is received shall not be refunded.\n\n\n7. The divisional application shall preserve the filing date and any priority date and seniority date of the original application.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.43(d)\n\n\n8. Where the declaration of division relates to an application which has already been published pursuant to Article\u00a044, the division shall be published. The divisional application shall be published. The publication shall not open a new period for the filing of oppositions.\n\n\n9. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying:\n\n\n(a)the details to be contained in a declaration of the division of an application made pursuant to paragraph\u00a01;\n\n\n(b)the details as to how to process a declaration of the division of an application, ensuring that a separate file, including a new application number, is established for the divisional application;\n\n\n(c)the details to be contained in the publication of the divisional application pursuant to paragraph\u00a08.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nSECTION 6\n\n\nRegistration\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.44\n\n\nArticle 51\n\n\nRegistration\n\n\n1. Where an application meets the requirements set out in this Regulation and where no notice of opposition has been given within the period referred to in Article\u00a046(1) or where any opposition entered has been finally disposed of by withdrawal, rejection or other disposition, the trade mark and the particulars referred to in Article\u00a0111(2) shall be recorded in the Register. The registration shall be published.\n\n\n\n\n2. The Office shall issue a certificate of registration. That certificate may be issued by electronic means.

Registration may be renewed in accordance with Article\u00a053 for further periods of\u00a010\u00a0years.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.45\n\n\nArticle 53\n\n\nRenewal\n\n\n1. Registration of the EU trade mark shall be renewed at the request of the proprietor of the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark or any person expressly authorised by him, provided that the fees have been paid.\n\n\n2. The Office shall inform the proprietor of the EU trade mark, and any person having a registered right in respect of the EU trade mark, of the expiry of the registration at least six\u00a0months before the said expiry. Failure to give such information shall not involve the responsibility of the Office and shall not affect the expiry of the registration.\n\n\n3. The request for renewal shall be submitted in the six-month period prior to the expiry of the registration. The basic fee for the renewal and, where appropriate, one or more class fees for each class of goods or services exceeding the first one shall also be paid within this period. Failing this, the request may be submitted and the fees paid within a further period of six\u00a0months following the expiry of registration, provided that an additional fee for late payment of the renewal fee or late submission of the request for renewal is paid within this further period.\n\n\n4. The request for renewal shall include:\n\n\n(a)the name of the person requesting renewal;\n\n\n(b)the registration number of the EU trade mark to be renewed;\n\n\n\n\n(c)if the renewal is requested for only part of the registered goods and services, an indication of those classes or those goods and services for which renewal is requested, or those classes or those goods and services for which renewal is not requested, grouped according to the classes of the Nice classification, each group being preceded by the number of the class of that classification to which that group of goods or services belongs, and presented in the order of classes of that classification.\n\n\nIf the payment referred to in paragraph\u00a03 is made, it shall be deemed to constitute a request for renewal provided that it contains all necessary indications to establish the purpose of the payment.\n\n\n5. Where the request is submitted or the fees paid in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the EU trade mark is registered, registration shall be renewed for those goods or services only. Where the fees paid are insufficient to cover all the classes of goods and services for which renewal is requested, registration shall be renewed if it is clear which class or classes are to be covered. In the absence of other criteria, the Office shall take the classes into account in the order of classification.\n\n\n6. Renewal shall take effect from the day following the date on which the existing registration expires. The renewal shall be registered.\n\n\n7. Where the request for renewal is filed within the periods provided for in paragraph\u00a03, but the other conditions governing renewal provided for in this Article are not satisfied, the Office shall inform the applicant of the deficiencies found.\n\n\n8. Where a request for renewal is not submitted or is submitted after the expiry of the period provided for in paragraph\u00a03, or where the fees are not paid or are paid only after the period in question has expired, or where the deficiencies referred to in paragraph\u00a07 are not remedied within that period, the Office shall determine that the registration has expired and shall notify the proprietor of the EU trade mark accordingly. Where the determination has become final, the Office shall cancel the mark from the register. The cancellation shall take effect from the day following the date on which the existing registration expired. Where the renewal fees have been paid but the registration is not renewed, those fees shall be refunded.\n\n\n9. A single request for renewal may be submitted for two or more marks, upon payment of the required fees for each of the marks, provided that the proprietors or the representatives are the same in each case.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 54\n\n\nAlteration\n\n\n1. The \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall not be altered in the Register during the period of registration or on renewal thereof.\n\n\n2. Nevertheless, where the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 includes the name and address of the proprietor, any alteration thereof not substantially affecting the identity of the trade mark as originally registered may be registered at the request of the proprietor.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.46(a)\n\n\n3. The request for alteration shall include the element of the mark to be altered and that element in its altered version.\n\n\nThe Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in the request for alteration. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.46(b)\n\n\n\n\n4. The request shall be deemed not to have been filed until the required fee has been paid. If the fee has not been paid or has not been paid in full, the Office shall inform the applicant accordingly. A single request may be made for the alteration of the same element in two or more registrations of the same proprietor. The required fee shall be paid in respect of each registration to be altered. If the requirements governing the alteration of the registration are not fulfilled, the Office shall communicate the deficiency to the applicant. If the deficiency is not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the request.\n\n\n5. The publication of the registration of the alteration shall contain a representation of the\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark as altered. Third parties whose rights may be affected by the alteration may challenge the registration thereof within the period of three months following publication. Articles\u00a046 and 47 and rules adopted pursuant to Article\u00a048 shall apply to the publication of the registration of the alteration. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.47\n\n\nArticle 55\n\n\nChange of the name or address\n\n\n1. A change of the name or address of the proprietor of the EU trade mark which is not an alteration of the EU trade mark pursuant to Article\u00a054(2) and which is not the consequence of a whole or partial transfer of the EU trade mark shall, at the request of the proprietor, be recorded in the Register.\n\n\nThe Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in a request for the change of name or address pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n2. A single request may be made for the change of the name or address in respect of two or more registrations of the same proprietor.\n\n\n3. If the requirements governing the recording of a change are not fulfilled, the Office shall communicate the deficiency to the proprietor of the EU trade mark. If the deficiency is not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the request.\n\n\n4. Paragraphs\u00a01, 2 and 3 shall also apply to a change of the name or address of the registered representative.\n\n\n5. Paragraphs\u00a01 to 4 shall apply to applications for EU trade marks.

The proprietor of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may divide the registration by declaring that some of the goods or services included in the original registration will be the subject of one or more divisional registrations. The goods or services in the divisional registration shall not overlap with the goods or services which remain in the original registration or those which are included in other divisional registrations.\n\n\n2. The declaration of division shall not be admissible:\n\n\n\n\n(a)if, where an application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity has been entered at the Office against the original registration, such a divisional declaration has the effect of introducing a division amongst the goods or services against which the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity is directed, until the decision of the Cancellation Division has become final or the proceedings are finally terminated otherwise;\n\n\n(b)if, where a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity has been entered in a case before an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7, such a divisional declaration has the effect of introducing a division amongst the goods or services against which the counterclaim is directed, until the mention of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7's judgment is recorded in the Register pursuant to Article\u00a0128(6).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.48(a) (adapted)\n\n\n3. If the requirements laid down in paragraph\u00a01 and pursuant to the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 8 are not fulfilled, or the list of goods and services which form the divisional registration overlap with the goods and services which remain in the original registration, the Office shall invite the proprietor of the EU trade mark to remedy the deficiencies within such period as it may specify. If the deficiencies are not remedied before the period expires, the Office shall refuse the declaration of division.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n4. The declaration of division shall be subject to a fee. The declaration shall be deemed not to have been made until the fee has been paid.\n\n\n5. The division shall take effect on the date on which it is entered in the Register.\n\n\n6. All requests and applications submitted and all fees paid with regard to the original registration prior to the date on which the Office receives the declaration of division shall be deemed also to have been submitted or paid with regard to the divisional registration or registrations. The fees for the original registration which have been duly paid prior to the date on which the declaration of division is received shall not be refunded.\n\n\n7. The divisional registration shall preserve the filing date and any priority date and seniority date of the original registration.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.48(b)\n\n\n8. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying:\n\n\n(a)the details to be contained in a declaration of the division of a registration pursuant to paragraph\u00a01;\n\n\n(b)the details as how to process a declaration of the division of a registration, ensuring that a separate file, including a new registration number, is established for the divisional registration.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nSURRENDER, REVOCATION AND INVALIDITY\n\n\nSECTION 1\n\n\nSurrender\n\n\nArticle 57\n\n\nSurrender\n\n\n1. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.49(a)\n\n\n2. The surrender shall be declared to the Office in writing by the proprietor of the trade mark. It shall not have effect until it has been entered in the Register. The validity of the surrender of an EU trade mark which is declared to the Office subsequent to the submission of an application for revocation of that trade mark pursuant to Article\u00a063(1) shall be conditional upon the final rejection or withdrawal of the application for revocation.\n\n\n3. Surrender shall be entered only with the agreement of the proprietor of a right relating to the EU trade mark and which is entered in the Register. If a licence has been registered, surrender shall be entered in the Register only if the proprietor of the EU trade mark proves that he has informed the licensee of his intention to surrender. The entry of the surrender shall be made on expiry of the three-month period after the date on which the proprietor satisfies the Office that he has informed the licensee of his intention to surrender, or before the expiry of that period, as soon as he proves that the licensee has given his consent.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.49(b)\n\n\n4. If the requirements governing surrender are not fulfilled, the Office shall communicate the deficiencies to the declarant. If the deficiencies are not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the entry of surrender in the Register.\n\n\n5. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in a declaration of surrender pursuant to paragraph\u00a02 of this Article and the kind of documentation required to establish a third party's agreement pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\n\n\nGrounds for revocation\n\n\nArticle 58\n\n\nGrounds for revocation\n\n\n1. The rights of the proprietor of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be declared to be revoked on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings:\n\n\n(a)if, within a continuous period of five years, the trade mark has not been put to genuine use in the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use; however, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application or counterclaim, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed; the commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application or counterclaim which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application or counterclaim may be filed;\n\n\n(b)if, in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, the trade mark has become the common name in the trade for a product or service in respect of which it is registered;\n\n\n(c)if, in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor of the trade mark or with his consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, the trade mark is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.\n\n\n2. Where the grounds for revocation of rights exist in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is registered, the rights of the proprietor shall be declared to be revoked in respect of those goods or services only.\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\nGrounds for invalidity\n\n\nArticle 59\n\n\nAbsolute grounds for invalidity\n\n\n1. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings:\n\n\n(a)where the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 has been registered contrary to the provisions of Article\u00a07;\n\n\n(b)where the applicant was acting in bad faith when he filed the application for the trade mark.\n\n\n2. Where the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 has been registered in breach of the provisions of Article\u00a07(1)(b), (c) or (d), it may nevertheless not be declared invalid if, in consequence of the use which has been made of it, it has after registration acquired a distinctive character in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered.\n\n\n3. Where the ground for invalidity exists in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is registered, the trade mark shall be declared invalid as regards those goods or services only.\n\n\nArticle 60\n\n\nRelative grounds for invalidity\n\n\n1. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings:\n\n\n\n\n(a)where there is an earlier trade mark as referred to in Article\u00a08(2) and the conditions set out in paragraph\u00a01 or paragraph 6 of that Article are fulfilled;\n\n\n(b)where there is a trade mark as referred to in Article\u00a08(3) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled;\n\n\n(c)where there is an earlier right as referred to in Article\u00a08(4) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled;\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.50(a)\n\n\n(d)where there is an earlier designation of origin or geographical indication as referred to in Article\u00a08(5) and the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.50(b)\n\n\nAll the conditions referred to in the first subparagraph shall be fulfilled at the filing date or the priority date of the EU trade mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n2. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall also be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings where the use of such trade mark may be prohibited pursuant to another earlier right under the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 legislation or national law governing its protection, and in particular:\n\n\n(a)a right to a name;\n\n\n(b)a right of personal portrayal;\n\n\n(c)a copyright;\n\n\n(d)an industrial property right.\n\n\n3. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 may not be declared invalid where the proprietor of a right referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 or 2 consents expressly to the registration of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 before submission of the application for a declaration of invalidity or the counterclaim.\n\n\n4. Where the proprietor of one of the rights referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 or 2 has previously applied for a declaration that an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is invalid or made a counterclaim in infringement proceedings, he may not submit a new application for a declaration of invalidity or lodge a counterclaim on the basis of another of the said rights which he could have invoked in support of his first application or counterclaim.\n\n\n\n\n5. Article\u00a059(3) shall apply.\n\n\nArticle 61\n\n\nLimitation in consequence of acquiescence\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.51\n\n\n1. Where the proprietor of an EU trade mark has acquiesced, for a period of five successive years, in the use of a later EU trade mark in the Union while being aware of such use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of the earlier trade mark to apply for a declaration that the later trade mark is invalid in respect of the goods or services for which the later trade mark has been used, unless registration of the later EU trade mark was applied for in bad faith.\n\n\n2. Where the proprietor of an earlier national trade mark as referred to in Article\u00a08(2) or of another earlier sign referred to in Article\u00a08(4) has acquiesced, for a period of five successive years, in the use of a later EU trade mark in the Member State in which the earlier trade mark or the other earlier sign is protected while being aware of such use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of the earlier trade mark or of the other earlier sign to apply for a declaration that the later trade mark is invalid in respect of the goods or services for which the later trade mark has been used, unless registration of the later EU trade mark was applied for in bad faith.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.52(a)\n\n\n3. In the cases referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2, the proprietor of a later \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall not be entitled to oppose the use of the earlier right, even though that right may no longer be invoked against the later \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\nSECTION 4\n\n\nConsequences of revocation and invalidity\n\n\nArticle 62\n\n\nConsequences of revocation and invalidity\n\n\n1. The \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be deemed not to have had, as from the date of the application for revocation or of the counterclaim, the effects specified in this Regulation, to the extent that the rights of the proprietor have been revoked. An earlier date, on which one of the grounds for revocation occurred, may be fixed in the decision at the request of one of the parties.\n\n\n2. The \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be deemed not to have had, as from the outset, the effects specified in this Regulation, to the extent that the trade mark has been declared invalid.\n\n\n3. Subject to the national provisions relating either to claims for compensation for damage caused by negligence or lack of good faith on the part of the proprietor of the trade mark, or to unjust enrichment, the retroactive effect of revocation or invalidity of the trade mark shall not affect:\n\n\n(a)any decision on infringement which has acquired the authority of a final decision and been enforced prior to the revocation or invalidity decision;\n\n\n\n\n(b)any contract concluded prior to the revocation or invalidity decision, in so far as it has been performed before that decision; however, repayment, to an extent justified by the circumstances, of sums paid under the relevant contract may be claimed on grounds of equity.\n\n\nSECTION 5\n\n\nProceedings in the Office in relation to revocation or invalidity\n\n\nArticle 63\n\n\nApplication for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity\n\n\n1. An application for revocation of the rights of the proprietor of an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 or for a declaration that the trade mark is invalid may be submitted to the Office:\n\n\n(a)where Articles\u00a058 and 59 apply, by any natural or legal person and any group or body set up for the purpose of representing the interests of manufacturers, producers, suppliers of services, traders or consumers, which under the terms of the law governing it has the capacity in its own name to sue and be sued;\n\n\n(b)where Article\u00a060(1) applies, by the persons referred to in Article\u00a046(1);\n\n\n(c)where Article\u00a060(2) applies, by the owners of the earlier rights referred to in that provision or by the persons who are entitled \u00e82\u00a0under Union legislation or the law of the Member State concerned\u00a0\u00e7 to exercise the rights in question.\n\n\n2. The application shall be filed in a written reasoned statement. It shall not be deemed to have been filed until the fee has been paid.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.52(b)\n\n\n3. An application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity shall be inadmissible where an application relating to the same subject matter and cause of action, and involving the same parties, has been adjudicated on its merits, either by the Office or by an EU trade mark court as referred to in Article\u00a0123, and the decision of the Office or that court on that application has acquired the authority of a final decision.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nArticle 64\n\n\nExamination of the application\n\n\n1. On the examination of the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity, the Office shall invite the parties, as often as necessary, to file observations, within a period to be fixed by the Office, on communications from the other parties or issued by itself.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.53 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n2. If the proprietor of the EU trade mark so requests, the proprietor of an earlier EU trade mark, being a party to the invalidity proceedings, shall furnish proof that, during the period of five years preceding the date of the application for a declaration of invalidity, the earlier EU\u00a0trade mark has been put to genuine use in the Union in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered and which the proprietor of that earlier trade mark cites as justification for his application, or that there are proper reasons for non-use, provided \u00d6\u00a0that\u00a0\u00d5 the earlier EU trade mark has at that date been registered for not less than five years. If, at the date on which the EU trade mark application was filed or at the priority date of the EU trade mark application, the earlier EU trade mark had been registered for not less than five years, the proprietor of the earlier EU trade mark shall furnish proof that, in addition, the conditions set out in Article\u00a047(2) were satisfied at that date. In the absence of proof to this effect, the application for a declaration of invalidity shall be rejected. If the earlier EU trade mark has been used only in relation to part of the goods or services for which it is registered, it shall, for the purpose of the examination of the application for a declaration of invalidity, be deemed to be registered in respect of that part of the goods or services only.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n3. Paragraph\u00a02 shall apply to earlier national trade marks referred to in Article\u00a08(2)(a), by substituting use in the Member State in which the earlier national trade mark is protected for use in the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n4. The Office may, if it thinks fit, invite the parties to make a friendly settlement.\n\n\n5. If the examination of the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity reveals that the trade mark should not have been registered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered, the rights of the proprietor of the\u00a0\u00e82\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be revoked or it shall be declared invalid in respect of those goods or services. Otherwise the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity shall be rejected.\n\n\n6. A record of the Office's decision on the application for revocation of rights or for a declaration of invalidity shall be entered in the Register once it has become final.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.54 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 65\n\n\nDelegation of powers\n\n\nThe Commission \u00d6\u00a0is\u00a0\u00d5 empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0208 specifying the details of the procedures governing the revocation and declaration of invalidity of an EU trade mark as referred to in Articles\u00a063 and 64, as well as the transfer of an EU trade mark registered in the name of an agent as referred to in Article\u00a021.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAPPEALS\n\n\nArticle 66\n\n\nDecisions subject to appeal\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.55\n\n\n1. An appeal shall lie from decisions of any of the decision-making instances of the Office listed in points\u00a0(a) to (d) of Article\u00a0159, and, where appropriate, point\u00a0(f) of that Article. Those decisions shall take effect only as from the date of expiration of the appeal period referred to in Article\u00a068. The filing of the appeal shall have suspensive effect.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n2. A decision which does not terminate proceedings as regards one of the parties can only be appealed together with the final decision, unless the decision allows separate appeal.\n\n\nArticle 67\n\n\nPersons entitled to appeal and to be parties to appeal proceedings\n\n\nAny party to proceedings adversely affected by a decision may appeal. Any other parties to the proceedings shall be parties to the appeal proceedings as of right.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.56\n\n\nArticle 68\n\n\nTime limit and form of appeal\n\n\n1. Notice of appeal shall be filed in writing at the Office within two months of the date of notification of the decision.

Within four months of the date of notification of the decision, a written statement setting out the grounds of appeal shall be filed.\n\n\n2. In inter\u00a0partes proceedings, the defendant may, in his response, seek a decision annulling or altering the contested decision on a point not raised in the appeal. Such submissions shall cease to have effect should the appellant discontinue the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nArticle 69\n\n\nRevision of decisions in ex parte cases\n\n\n1. If the party which has lodged the appeal is the sole party to the procedure, and if the department whose decision is contested considers the appeal to be admissible and well founded, the department shall rectify its decision.\n\n\n\n\n2. If the decision is not rectified within one month after receipt of the statement of grounds, the appeal shall be remitted to the Board of Appeal without delay, and without comment as to its merit.\n\n\nArticle 70\n\n\nExamination of appeals\n\n\n1. If the appeal is admissible, the Board of Appeal shall examine whether the appeal is allowable.\n\n\n2. In the examination of the appeal, the Board of Appeal shall invite the parties, as often as necessary, to file observations, within a period to be fixed by the Board of Appeal, on communications from the other parties or issued by itself.\n\n\nArticle 71\n\n\nDecisions in respect of appeals\n\n\n1. Following the examination as to the allowability of the appeal, the Board of Appeal shall decide on the appeal. The Board of Appeal may either exercise any power within the competence of the department which was responsible for the decision appealed or remit the case to that department for further prosecution.\n\n\n2. If the Board of Appeal remits the case for further prosecution to the department whose decision was appealed, that department shall be bound by the ratio\u00a0decidendi of the Board of Appeal, in so far as the facts are the same.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.58\n\n\n3. The decisions of the Board of Appeal shall take effect only as from the date of expiry of the period referred to in Article\u00a072(5) or, if an action has been brought before the General Court within that period, as from the date of dismissal of such action or of any appeal filed with the Court of Justice against the decision of the General Court.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\nArticle 72\n\n\nActions before the Court of Justice\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.59(a)\n\n\n1. Actions may be brought before the General Court against decisions of the Boards of Appeal in relation to appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n2. The action may be brought on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\u00a0\u00d5, \u00d6\u00a0infringement\u00a0\u00d5 of this Regulation or of any rule of law relating to their application or misuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.59(b)\n\n\n3. The General Court shall have jurisdiction to annul or to alter the contested decision.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n4.

A \u00e81\u00a0European Union collective mark (\u2018EU collective mark\u2019)\u00a0\u00e7 shall be an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 which is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of the members of the association which is the proprietor of the mark from those of other undertakings. Associations of manufacturers, producers, suppliers of services, or traders which, under the terms of the law governing them, have the capacity in their own name to have rights and obligations of all kinds, to make contracts or accomplish other legal acts and to sue and be sued, as well as legal persons governed by public law, may apply for \u00e81\u00a0EU collective marks\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n2. In derogation from Article\u00a07(1)(c), signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the geographical origin of the goods or services may constitute \u00e81\u00a0EU collective marks\u00a0\u00e7 within the meaning of paragraph\u00a01. \u00d6\u00a0An EU\u00a0\u00d5 collective mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using in the course of trade such signs or indications, provided \u00d6\u00a0that\u00a0\u00d5 he uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters; in particular, such a mark may not be invoked against a third party who is entitled to use a geographical name.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.63\n\n\n3.

The regulations governing use shall specify the persons authorised to use the mark, the conditions of membership of the association and, where they exist, the conditions of use of the mark, including sanctions. The regulations governing use of a mark referred to in Article\u00a074(2) must authorise any person whose goods or services originate in the geographical area concerned to become a member of the association which is the proprietor of the mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.64(b)\n\n\n3.

The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the maximum rates for costs essential to the proceedings and actually incurred by the successful party. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\nWhen specifying such amounts with respect to travel and subsistence costs, the Commission shall take into account the distance between the place of residence or business of the party, representative or witness or expert and the place where the oral proceedings are held, the procedural stage at which the costs have been incurred, and, as far as costs of representation within the meaning of Article\u00a0120(1) are concerned, the need to ensure that the obligation to bear the costs may not be misused for tactical reasons by the other party. Subsistence expenses shall be calculated in accordance with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Union, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No\u00a0259/68\n18\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe losing party shall bear the costs for one opposing party only and, where applicable, one representative only.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n3. However, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, or if reasons of equity so dictate, the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal shall decide a different apportionment of costs.\n\n\n4. The party who terminates the proceedings by withdrawing the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application, the opposition, the application for revocation of rights, the application for a declaration of invalidity or the appeal, or by not renewing registration of the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 or by surrendering the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, shall bear the fees and the costs incurred by the other party as stipulated in paragraphs\u00a01 and 3.\n\n\n5. Where a case does not proceed to judgment the costs shall be at the discretion of the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal.\n\n\n6. Where the parties conclude before the Opposition Division, Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal a settlement of costs differing from that provided for in paragraphs\u00a0\u00d6\u00a01 to 5\u00a0\u00d5, the department concerned shall take note of that agreement.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.78(c)\n\n\n7. The Opposition Division or Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal shall fix the amount of the costs to be paid pursuant to paragraphs\u00a01 to 6 of this Article when the costs to be paid are limited to the fees paid to the Office and the representation costs. In all other cases, the registry of the Board of Appeal or a member of the staff of the Opposition Division or Cancellation Division shall fix, on request, the amount of the costs to be reimbursed. The request shall be admissible only for the period of two months following the date on which the decision for which an application was made for the costs to be fixed becomes final and shall be accompanied by a bill and supporting evidence. For the costs of representation pursuant to Article\u00a0120(1), an assurance by the representative that the costs have been incurred shall be sufficient. For other costs, it shall be sufficient if their plausibility is established. Where the amount of the costs is fixed pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, representation costs shall be awarded at the level laid down in the act adopted pursuant to paragraph\u00a02 of this Article and irrespective of whether they have been actually incurred.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.78(d)\n\n\n8. The decision on the fixing of costs, stating the reasons on which it is based, may be reviewed by a decision of the Opposition Division or Cancellation Division or Board of Appeal on a request filed within one month of the date of notification of the awarding of costs. It shall not be deemed to be filed until the fee for reviewing the amount of the costs has been paid. The Opposition Division, the Cancellation Division or the Board of Appeal, as the case may be, shall take a decision on the request for a review of the decision on the fixing of costs without oral proceedings.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.79\n\n\nArticle 110\n\n\nEnforcement of decisions fixing the amount of costs\n\n\n1. Any final decision of the Office fixing the amount of costs shall be enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n2. Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. \u00e81\u00a0Each Member State shall designate a single authority responsible for verifying the authenticity of the decision referred to in paragraph\u00a01 and shall communicate its contact details to the Office, the Court of Justice and the Commission. The order for the enforcement of the decision shall be appended to the decision by that authority, with the verification of the authenticity of the decision as the sole formality.\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\n3. When these formalities have been completed on application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.\n\n\n4. Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court of Justice. However, the courts of the country concerned shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.\n\n\nSECTION 3\n\n\nInformation which may be made available to the public and of the authorities of the Member States\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.80\n\n\nArticle 111\n\n\nRegister of EU trade marks\n\n\n1.

Inspection of the files of EU trade mark applications and of registered EU trade marks shall be of the original document, or of copies thereof, or of technical means of storage if the files are stored in this way.

The EU trade mark court with which a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity of the EU trade mark has been filed shall not proceed with the examination of the counterclaim, until either the interested party or the court has informed the Office of the date on which the counterclaim was filed.

The Office or any other interested party may request information about such transmission. The Office shall mention the judgment in the Register and shall take the necessary measures to comply with its operative part.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.3\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n7. The \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 hearing a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity may stay the proceedings on application by the proprietor of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 and after hearing the other parties and may request the defendant to submit an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity to the Office within a time limit which it shall determine. If the application is not made within the time limit, the proceedings shall continue; the counterclaim shall be deemed withdrawn. Article\u00a0132(3) shall apply.\n\n\nArticle 129\n\n\nApplicable law\n\n\n1. The \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark courts\u00a0\u00e7 shall apply the provisions of this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.94\n\n\n2.

Unless otherwise provided \u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 in this Regulation, an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 shall apply the rules of procedure governing the same type of action relating to a national trade mark in the Member State in which the court is located.\n\n\nArticle 130\n\n\nSanctions\n\n\n1. Where an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 finds that the defendant has infringed or threatened to infringe an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, it shall, unless there are special reasons for not doing so, issue an order prohibiting the defendant from proceeding with the acts which infringed or would infringe the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7. It shall also take such measures in accordance with its national law as are aimed at ensuring that this prohibition is complied with.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.95\n\n\n2. The EU trade mark court may also apply measures or orders available under the applicable law which it deems appropriate in the circumstances of the case.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.3\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\nArticle 131\n\n\nProvisional and protective measures\n\n\n1.

An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 whose jurisdiction is based on Article\u00a0125(1), (2), (3) or (4) shall have jurisdiction to grant provisional and protective measures which, subject to any necessary procedure for recognition and enforcement pursuant to Chapter\u00a0III of Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a01215/2012, are applicable in the territory of any Member State. No other court shall have such jurisdiction.\n\n\nArticle 132\n\n\nSpecific rules on related actions\n\n\n1. An \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 hearing an action referred to in Article\u00a0124 other than an action for a declaration of non-infringement shall, unless there are special grounds for continuing the hearing, of its own motion after hearing the parties or at the request of one of the parties and after hearing the other parties, stay the proceedings where the validity of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is already in issue before another \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 on account of a counterclaim or where an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity has already been filed at the Office.\n\n\n2. The Office, when hearing an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity shall, unless there are special grounds for continuing the hearing, of its own motion after hearing the parties or at the request of one of the parties and after hearing the other parties, stay the proceedings where the validity of the \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 is already in issue on account of a counterclaim before an \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7. However, if one of the parties to the proceedings before the \u00e81\u00a0EU trade mark court\u00a0\u00e7 so requests, the court may, after hearing the other parties to these proceedings, stay the proceedings. The Office shall in this instance continue the proceedings pending before it.\n\n\n\n\n3.

The court which would be required to decline jurisdiction may stay its proceedings if the jurisdiction of the other court is contested;\n\n\n(b)the court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings where the trade marks concerned are identical and valid for similar goods or services and where the trade marks concerned are similar and valid for identical or similar goods or services.\n\n\n2.

Every year the Office shall offset the costs incurred by the central industrial property offices of the Member States, by the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property and by any other relevant authority to be nominated by a Member State, as the result of the specific tasks which they carry out as functional parts of the EU trade mark system in the context of the following services and procedures:\n\n\n\n\n(a)opposition and invalidity proceedings before the central industrial property offices of the Member States and the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property involving EU\u00a0trade marks;\n\n\n(b)provision of information on the functioning of the EU trade mark system through helpdesks and information centres;\n\n\n(c)enforcement of EU trade marks, including action taken pursuant to Article\u00a09(4).\n\n\n5. The overall offsetting of the costs identified in paragraph\u00a04 shall correspond to 5\u00a0% of the yearly revenue of the Office. Without prejudice to the third subparagraph of this paragraph, on a proposal by the Office and after having consulted the Budget Committee, the Management Board shall determine the distribution key on the basis of the following fair, equitable and relevant indicators:\n\n\n(a)the annual number of EU trade mark applications originating from applicants in each Member State;\n\n\n(b)the annual number of national trade mark applications in each Member State;\n\n\n(c)the annual number of oppositions and applications for a declaration of invalidity submitted by proprietors of EU trade marks in each Member State;\n\n\n(d)the annual number of cases brought before the EU trade mark courts designated by each Member State in accordance with Article\u00a0123.\n\n\nFor the purpose of substantiating the costs referred to in paragraph\u00a04, Member States shall submit to the Office by 31\u00a0March of each year, statistical data demonstrating the figures referred to in points\u00a0(a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph for the preceding year, which shall be included in the proposal to be made to the Management Board.\n\n\nOn grounds of equity, the costs incurred by the bodies referred to in paragraph\u00a04 in each Member State shall be deemed to correspond to at least 2\u00a0% of the total offsetting provided for under this paragraph.\n\n\n6. The obligation by the Office to offset the costs referred to in paragraph\u00a04 and incurred in a given year shall only apply to the extent that no budgetary deficit occurs in that year.\n\n\n7. In the event of a budgetary surplus, and without prejudice to paragraph\u00a010, on a proposal by the Office and after having consulted the Budget Committee, the Management Board may increase the percentage laid down in paragraph\u00a05 to a maximum of 10\u00a0% of the yearly revenue of the Office.\n\n\n8. Without prejudice to paragraphs\u00a04 to 7 and paragraph\u00a010 of this Article and to Articles\u00a0151 and 152, where a substantive surplus is generated over five consecutive years, the Budget Committee, upon a proposal from the Office and in accordance with the annual work programme and multiannual strategic programme referred to in Article\u00a0153(1)(a) and\u00a0(b), shall decide by a two-thirds majority on the transfer to the budget of the Union of a surplus generated from 23\u00a0March 2016.\n\n\n9. The Office shall prepare on a biannual basis a report for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on its financial situation, including on the financial operations performed under Article\u00a0152(5) and (6), and Article\u00a0172(5) and (7).

The Commission may attach an opinion on the estimate along with an alternative estimate.\n\n\n3. The Budget Committee shall adopt the budget, which shall include the Office's list of posts.

In order to facilitate combating fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities under Regulation\u00a0(EU, Euratom) No\u00a0883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n28\n, the Office shall accede to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25\u00a0May 1999 concerning internal investigations by OLAF, and adopt the appropriate provisions applicable to all the employees of the Office using the template set out in the Annex to that Agreement.\n\n\n2.

The Court of Auditors shall examine them in accordance with Article\u00a0248 \u00d6\u00a0TFEU\u00a0\u00d5.\n\n\n2. The Budget Committee shall give a discharge to the \u00e81\u00a0Executive Director\u00a0\u00e7 in respect of the implementation of the budget.\n\n\nArticle 177\n\n\nFinancial provisions\n\n\nThe Budget Committee shall, after consulting the Court of Auditors and the Commission, adopt internal financial provisions specifying, in particular, the procedure for establishing and implementing the Office's budget. As far as is compatible with the particular nature of the Office, the financial provisions shall be based on the financial regulations adopted for other bodies set up by the \u00e82\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.123\n\n\nArticle 178\n\n\nFees and charges and due date\n\n\n1. The Executive Director shall lay down the amount to be charged for any services rendered by the Office other than those set out in Annex I, as well as the amount to be charged for the European Union Trade Marks Bulletin, the Official Journal of the Office and any other publications issued by the Office. The amounts of charges shall be set in euros and shall be published in the Official Journal of the Office. The amount of each charge shall not exceed what is necessary to cover the costs of the specific service rendered by the Office.\n\n\n2. Fees and charges in respect of which the due date is not specified in this Regulation shall be due on the date of receipt of the request for the service for which the fee or the charge is incurred.\n\n\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may determine which of the services mentioned in the first subparagraph are not to be dependent upon the advance payment of the corresponding fees or charges.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.124\n\n\nArticle 179\n\n\nPayment of fees and charges\n\n\n\n\n1. Fees and charges due to the Office shall be paid by payment or transfer to a bank account held by the Office.\n\n\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may establish which specific methods of payment other than those set out in the first subparagraph, in particular by means of deposits in current accounts held with the Office, may be used.\n\n\nDeterminations made pursuant to the second subparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\n\n\nAll payments, including by any other method of payment established pursuant to the second subparagraph, shall be made in euros.\n\n\n2. Every payment shall indicate the name of the person making the payment and shall contain the necessary information to enable the Office to establish immediately the purpose of the payment. In particular, the following information shall be provided:\n\n\n(a)when the application fee is paid, the purpose of the payment, namely \u2018application fee\u2019;\n\n\n(b)when the opposition fee is paid, the file number of the application and the name of the applicant for the EU trade mark against which opposition is entered, and the purpose of the payment, namely \u2018opposition fee\u2019;\n\n\n(c)when the revocation fee and the invalidity fee are paid, the registration number and the name of the proprietor of the EU trade mark against which the application is directed, and the purpose of the payment, namely \u2018revocation fee\u2019 or \u2018invalidity fee\u2019.\n\n\n3. If the purpose of the payment referred to in paragraph\u00a02 cannot immediately be established, the Office shall require the person making the payment to notify it in writing of this purpose within such period as it may specify. If the person does not comply with this request in due time, the payment shall be considered not to have been made. The amount which has been paid shall be refunded.\n\n\nArticle 180\n\n\nDeemed date of payment\n\n\n1. In the cases referred to in the first subparagraph of Article\u00a0179(1), the date on which the payment shall be considered to have been made to the Office shall be the date on which the amount of the payment or of the transfer is actually entered in a bank account held by the Office.\n\n\n2. Where the methods of payment referred to in the second subparagraph of Article\u00a0179(1) may be used, the Executive Director shall establish the date on which such payments are to be considered to have been made.\n\n\n3. Where, under paragraphs\u00a01 and 2, payment of a fee is not considered to have been made until after the expiry of the period in which it was due, it shall be considered that this period has been observed if evidence is provided to the Office that the persons who made the payment in a Member State, within the period within which the payment should have been made, duly gave an order to a banking establishment to transfer the amount of the payment, and paid a surcharge of 10\u00a0% of the relevant fee or fees, but not exceeding EUR\u00a0200. No surcharge shall be payable if the relevant order to the banking establishment has been given not later than 10\u00a0days before the expiry of the period for payment.\n\n\n4. The Office may request the person who made the payment to produce evidence as to the date on which the order to the banking establishment as referred to in paragraph\u00a03 was given and, where required, to pay the relevant surcharge within a period to be specified by it. If the person fails to comply with that request or if the evidence is insufficient, or if the required surcharge is not paid in due time, the period for payment shall be considered not to have been observed.\n\n\nArticle 181\n\n\nInsufficient payments and refund of insignificant amounts\n\n\n1. A time limit for payment shall, in principle, be considered to have been observed only if the full amount of the fee has been paid in due time. If the fee is not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded after the period for payment has expired.\n\n\n2. The Office may, however, in so far as is possible within the time remaining before the end of the period, give the person making the payment the opportunity to pay the amount lacking or, where this is considered justified, overlook any small amounts lacking, without prejudice to the rights of the person making the payment.\n\n\n3. With the consent of the Budget Committee, the Executive Director may waive action for the enforced recovery of any sum due where the sum to be recovered is minimal or where such recovery is too uncertain.\n\n\n\n\n4. Where an excessive sum is paid to cover a fee or a charge, the excess shall not be refunded if the amount is insignificant and the party concerned has not expressly requested a refund.\n\n\nWith the consent of the Budget Committee the Executive Director may determine the amount below which an excessive sum paid to cover a fee or a charge shall not be refunded.\n\n\nDeterminations pursuant to the second subparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the Office.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.125\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e83\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\u00e84\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.126(a)\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTRATION OF MARKS\n\n\nSECTION I\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\nArticle 182\n\n\nApplication of provisions\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, this Regulation and \u00e81\u00a0the acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation\u00a0\u00e7 shall apply to applications for international registrations under the Protocol \u2018international applications\u2019 and \u2018the Madrid Protocol\u2018 respectively), based on an application for an \u00e82\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 or on an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 and to registrations of marks in the international register maintained by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (hereafter referred to as \u2018international registrations\u2018 and \u2018the International Bureau\u2019, respectively) designating the \u00e83\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\nInternational registration on the basis of applications for an\u00a0\u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 and of \u00e82\u00a0EU trade marks\u00a0\u00e7\n\n\nArticle 183\n\n\nFiling of an international application\n\n\n\n\n1. International applications pursuant to Article 3 of the Madrid Protocol based on an application for an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 or on an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 shall be filed at the Office.\n\n\n2. Where an international application is filed before the mark on which the international registration is to be based has been registered as an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7, the applicant for the international registration must indicate whether the international registration is to be based on an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 application or registration. Where the international registration is to be based on an \u00e82\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 once it is registered, the international application shall be deemed to have been received at the Office on the date of registration of the\u00a0\u00e82\u00a0EU\u00a0trade mark\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\nArticle 184\n\n\nForm and contents of the international application\n\n\n1.

Where the international application is filed in a language other than one of the languages allowed under the Madrid Protocol for the filing of international applications, the applicant may provide a translation of the list of goods or services and of any other textual elements forming part of the international application in the language in which the international application is to be submitted to the International Bureau pursuant to paragraph\u00a02. If the application is not accompanied by such translation, the applicant shall authorise the Office to include that translation in the international application. Where the translation has not yet been established in the course of the registration procedure for the EU trade mark application on which the international application is based, the Office shall, without delay, arrange for the translation.\n\n\n4. The filing of an international application shall be subject to the payment of a fee to the Office. Where the international registration is to be based on an EU trade mark once it is registered, the fee shall be due on the date of registration of the EU trade mark. The application shall be deemed not to have been filed until the required fee has been paid. Where the fee has not been paid, the Office shall inform the applicant accordingly. In the event of electronic filing, the Office may authorise the International Bureau to collect the fee on its behalf.\n\n\n5. Where the examination of the international application reveals any of the following deficiencies, the Office shall invite the applicant to remedy those deficiencies within such period as it may specify:\n\n\n(a)the international application has not been filed using the form referred to in paragraph 1, and does not contain all the indications and information required by that form;\n\n\n(b)the list of goods and services contained in the international application is not covered by the list of goods and services appearing in the basic EU trade mark application or basic EU trade mark;\n\n\n(c)the mark which is subject to the international application is not identical with the mark as it appears in the basic EU trade mark application or basic EU trade mark;\n\n\n(d)an indication in the international application as to the trade mark, other than a disclaimer or a colour claim, does not also appear in the basic EU trade mark application or basic EU trade mark;\n\n\n(e)where colour is claimed in the international application as a distinctive feature of the mark, the basic EU trade mark application or basic EU trade mark is not in the same colour or colours; or\n\n\n(f)according to the indications made in the international form, the applicant is not eligible to file an international application through the Office in accordance with Article\u00a02(1)(ii) of the Madrid Protocol.\n\n\n6. Where the applicant has failed to authorise the Office to include a translation as provided for in paragraph\u00a03, or where it is otherwise unclear on which list of goods and services the international application is to be based, the Office shall invite the applicant to make the required indications within such period as it may specify.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.126(c)\n\n\n\n\n7.

The Office shall publish the date of registration of a mark designating the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 pursuant to Article\u00a03(4) of the Madrid Protocol or the date of the subsequent designation of the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 pursuant to Article\u00a03ter(2) of the Madrid Protocol, the language of filing of the international application and the second language indicated by the applicant, the number of the international registration and the date of publication of such registration in the Gazette published by the International Bureau, a reproduction of the mark and the numbers of the classes of the goods or services in respect of which protection is claimed.\n\n\n2. If no refusal of protection of an international registration designating the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 has been notified in accordance with Article\u00a05(1) and (2) of the Madrid Protocol or if any such refusal has been withdrawn, the Office shall publish this fact, together with the number of the international registration and, where applicable, the date of publication of such registration in the Gazette published by the International Bureau.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.129\n\n\nArticle 191\n\n\nSeniority claimed in an international application\n\n\n1. The applicant for an international registration designating the Union may claim, in the international application, the seniority of an earlier trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries, or registered under international arrangements having effect in a Member State, as provided for in Article\u00a039.\n\n\n2. The documentation, as specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article\u00a039(6), in support of the seniority claim shall be submitted within three months of the date on which the International Bureau notifies the international registration to the Office. In this regard, Article\u00a039(7) shall apply.\n\n\n3. Where the holder of the international registration is obliged to be represented before the Office pursuant to Article\u00a0119(2), the communication as referred to in paragraph\u00a02 of this\u00a0Article shall contain the appointment of a representative within the meaning of Article\u00a0120(1).\n\n\n4. Where the Office finds that the seniority claim under paragraph\u00a01 of this Article does not comply with Article\u00a039, or does not comply with the other requirements laid down in this\u00a0Article, it shall invite the applicant to remedy the deficiencies. If the requirements referred to in the first sentence are not satisfied within the time limit specified by the Office, the right of seniority in respect of that international registration shall be lost. If the deficiencies concern only some of the goods and services, the right of seniority shall be lost only in so far as those goods and services are concerned.\n\n\n5. The Office shall inform the International Bureau of any declaration of a loss of the right of seniority pursuant to paragraph\u00a04. It shall also inform the International Bureau of any withdrawal or restriction of the seniority claim.\n\n\n6. Article\u00a039(5) shall apply, unless the right of seniority is declared lost pursuant to paragraph\u00a04 of this Article.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.130\n\n\nArticle 192\n\n\nSeniority claimed before the Office\n\n\n1. The holder of an international registration designating the Union may, as from the date of publication of the effects of such registration pursuant to Article\u00a0190(2), claim at the Office the seniority of an earlier trade mark registered in a Member State, including a trade mark registered in the Benelux countries, or registered under international arrangements having effect in a Member State, as provided for in Article\u00a040.\n\n\n2. When the seniority is claimed before the date referred to in paragraph\u00a01, the seniority claim shall be deemed to have been received by the Office on that date.\n\n\n3. A seniority claim under paragraph 1 of this Article shall fulfil the requirements referred to in Article\u00a040 and shall contain information to enable its examination against those requirements.\n\n\n4. If the requirements governing the claiming of seniority referred to in paragraph\u00a03 and specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph\u00a06 are not fulfilled, the Office shall invite the holder of the international registration to remedy the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied within a period to be specified by the Office, the Office shall reject the claim.\n\n\n\n\n5. Where the Office has accepted the seniority claim, or where a seniority claim has been withdrawn or cancelled by the Office, the Office shall inform the International Bureau accordingly.\n\n\n6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in a seniority claim under paragraph\u00a01 of this Article and the details of the information to be notified pursuant to paragraph\u00a05 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.131\n\n\nArticle 193\n\n\nDesignation of goods and services and examination as to absolute grounds for refusal\n\n\n1. International registrations designating the Union shall be subject to examination as to their conformity with Article\u00a033(2), (3) and (4) and to absolute grounds for refusal in the same way as applications for EU trade marks.\n\n\n2. Where an international registration designating the Union is found to be ineligible for protection pursuant to Article\u00a033(4) or Article\u00a042(1) of this Regulation for all or any part of the goods and services for which it has been registered by the International Bureau, the Office shall issue an ex\u00a0officio provisional notification of refusal to the International Bureau, in accordance with Article\u00a05(1) and (2) of the Madrid Protocol.\n\n\n3. Where the holder of an international registration is obliged to be represented before the Office pursuant to Article\u00a0119(2), the notification referred to in paragraph\u00a02 of this Article shall contain an invitation to appoint a representative within the meaning of Article\u00a0120(1).\n\n\n4. The notification of provisional refusal shall state the reasons on which it is based, and shall specify a time period by which the holder of the international registration may submit his observations and, if appropriate, shall appoint a representative. The time period shall start on the day on which the Office issues the provisional refusal.\n\n\n5. Where the Office finds that the international application designating the Union does not contain the indication of a second language pursuant to Article\u00a0206 of this Regulation, the Office shall issue an ex\u00a0officio provisional notification of refusal to the International Bureau pursuant to Article\u00a05(1) and (2) of the Madrid Protocol.\n\n\n6. Where the holder of an international registration fails to overcome the ground for refusing protection within the time limit or, if appropriate, to appoint a representative or to indicate a second language, the Office shall refuse the protection in whole or for part of the goods and services for which the international registration is registered. The refusal of protection shall take the place of a refusal of an EU trade mark application. The decision shall be subject to appeal in accordance with Articles\u00a066 to 72.\n\n\n7. Where, as of the start of the opposition period referred to in Article\u00a0196(2), the Office has not issued an ex\u00a0officio provisional notification of refusal pursuant to paragraph\u00a02 of this Article, it shall send a statement to the International Bureau, indicating that the examination of absolute grounds of refusal pursuant to Article\u00a042 has been completed but that the international registration is still subject to oppositions or observations of third parties. This interim statement shall be without prejudice to the right of the Office to re-open the examination of absolute grounds on its own initiative any time before the final statement of grant of protection has been issued.\n\n\n8. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the details to be contained in the notification of ex\u00a0officio provisional refusal of protection to be sent to the International Bureau and in the final communications to be sent to the International Bureau on the final grant or refusal of protection. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a0207(2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.132 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 194\n\n\nCollective and certification marks\n\n\n1. Where an international registration is based on a basic application or basic registration relating to a collective mark, certification mark or guarantee mark, the international registration designating the Union shall be dealt with as an EU collective mark or as an\u00a0EU\u00a0certification mark, whichever is applicable.\n\n\n2. The holder of the international registration shall submit the regulations governing the use of the mark, as provided for in Articles\u00a075 and 84, directly to the Office within two months of the date on which the International Bureau notifies the international registration to the Office.\n\n\n\n\n3. The Commission \u00d6\u00a0is\u00a0\u00d5 empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\u00a0208 specifying the details of the procedure concerning international registrations based on a basic application or basic registration relating to a collective mark, certification mark or guarantee mark.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0207/2009\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.5\n\n\n\u00e82\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.133(a)\n\n\n\u00e83\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.133(b)\n\n\n\u00e84\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.2\n\n\n\u00e85\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.133(c)\n\n\nArticle 195\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n1. Once the Office has received a notification of an international registration designating the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, it shall draw up a \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 search report as provided for in Article\u00a043(1) \u00e82\u00a0provided that a request for a search report, pursuant to Article 43(1), is made to the Office within one month of the date of notification\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n2. As soon as the Office has received a notification of an international registration designating the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7, the Office shall transmit a copy thereof to the central industrial property office of each Member State which has informed the Office of its decision to operate a search in its own register of trade marks as provided for in Article\u00a043(2) \u00e83\u00a0provided that a request for a search report, pursuant to Article\u00a043(2), is made to the Office within one month of the date of notification and the search fee is paid within the same period\u00a0\u00e7.\n\n\n3.

International registration designating the \u00e81\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00e7 shall be subject to opposition in the same way as published \u00e84\u00a0EU trade mark\u00a0\u00e7 applications.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02424/2015 Art. 1.134(a)\n\n\n2.
