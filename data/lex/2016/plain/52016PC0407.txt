The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle for the following reason. \u00a0\n\n\nThe objective of this proposal, namely to ensure the homogeneity of the Internal Market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the effects, be better achieved at Union level. \n\n\nThe process of incorporation of the EU acquis into the EEA Agreement is conducted in conformity with the Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area which confirms the approach taken. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objective \u2013 to ensure the homogeneity of the Internal Market.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nIn conformity with Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the chosen instrument is the EEA Joint Committee decision. The EEA Joint Committee shall ensure the effective implementation and operation of the EEA Agreement. To this end, it shall take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nIn the framework of the preparation of the legislation in question, several studies had been conducted by the Commission on consumer alternative dispute resolution and addressed issues linked to online dispute resolution tools.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nIn the framework of the preparation of the legislation in question the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment, analysing a range of policy options for both \"Alternative dispute resolution coverage, information and quality\" and \"On-line dispute resolution for cross-border e-commerce transactions\".\n\n\n\nThe attached EEA Joint Committee Decision aims to extend the current system to the EEA EFTA States.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nIncorporation of this legislation into the EEA Agreement has minor budgetary implications. However, these costs are already covered by the appropriations already foreseen under the financial programming of the \"Consumer programme\" (Budget line 33.04.01) in which Iceland and Norway participate. No additional appropriations are foreseen.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe proposal foresees that the Commission and Iceland shall endeavour to improve the translation functions provided by the On-line-Dispute Resolution platform (hereafter \"ODR platform\") as regards the Icelandic language to ensure comparable quality of all functions to that offered for the other languages and shall regularly inform the EEA Joint Committee of their progress. \n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe ODR platform shall be accessible in all the languages referred to in Article 129(1) of the EEA Agreement, which includes Norwegian and Icelandic. \n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 5(4)(e) of the ODR Regulation, the ODR platform\u2019s translation functions into and from the Icelandic language shall initially be available only as regards the result of an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure transmitted by an ADR entity. \n\n\n\n\nSpecific transitional modalities need to be established for the other exchanges on the ODR platform until the quality of translations of the automated translation tool used by the ODR platform is comparable to that of other languages.  \n\n\nIceland shall ensure that users of the ODR platform may obtain the translation of all other information into and from the Icelandic language through its ODR contact point, where that information is necessary for the resolution of the dispute and is exchanged through the ODR platform in another language. Information on these modalities as regards the Icelandic language shall be provided on the homepage of the ODR platform.\n\n\nThe Commission and Iceland shall endeavour to improve the translation functions provided by the ODR platform as regards the Icelandic language to ensure comparable quality of all functions to that offered for the other languages and shall regularly inform the EEA Joint Committee of their progress. When the translation functions ensure comparable quality as regards the Icelandic language to that offered for the other languages, the EEA Joint Committee shall without undue delay take a decision to terminate the transitional modalities in the attached EEA Joint Committee Decision \n\n\n2016/0189 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the
