It provides a clear distinction between acts of a quasi-legislative nature, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, acts which implement the provisions of a basic act. It also provides an entirely different legal framework for each type of act.\n\n\nThe two provisions in question are Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter \u201cTFEU\u201d), as introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon that entered into force on 1 December 2009\n1\n. They entail substantial modifications of the procedures known so far as the \u201ccomitology procedures\u201d. \n\n\nIn terms of the wording, the definition of delegated acts in Article 290(1) is very similar to that of acts which, under Decision 1999/468/EC\n2\n, as amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC, (\"the Comitology Decision\"), are subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) established in Article 5a of that Decision. In both cases, the acts in question are of general application and seek to amend or supplement certain non-essential elements of the legislative instrument.\n\n\nFor this reason, the revision of the Comitology Decision by Regulation 182/2011\n3\n (\"the Comitology Regulation\"), which was adopted on the basis of Article 291(3) TFEU on implementing powers, left out of its scope Article 5a of the Comitology Decision. Article 5a establishing the RPS had therefore to be provisionally maintained for the purposes of existing basic acts referring to this Article. \n\n\nConsequently, the RPS still appears in the 168 existing basic acts covered by this proposal and continues to apply (in line with Article 5a of the Comitology Decision) in those acts until they are formally amended and adapted to the Lisbon Treaty. \n\n\nAt the time of adoption of Regulation 182/2011 the Commission made a commitment to review the provisions attached to this procedure, in order to adapt them in due course according to the criteria laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n4\n. In line with this commitment the Commission made three horizontal alignment legislative proposals in 2013 (Omnibus I, II and III)\n5\n\u00a0. \n\n\nThe European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on these proposals on 25 February 2014\n6\n, proposing a number of amendments to Omnibus I and III, but broadly agreeing with the proposals by the Commission. The Council in contrast did not support the Commission proposals, in particular because the approach to foresee an automatic alignment from RPS to delegated acts was rejected in the absence of stronger guarantees that Member State experts would be systematically consulted in the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\nDue to the stagnation of the interinstitutional negotiations on these files, the Commission, as announced in its 2015 Work Programme\n7\n, withdrew them\n8\n. \n\n\nThe question of the alignment was taken up again in the discussions on the revision of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making\n9\n. All institutions acknowledged the need for the alignment and the Commission committed to submit by the end of 2016 a new proposal for the alignment of legislative acts which still contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The present proposal responds to this commitment. \n\n\nAt the same time, the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Common Understanding on delegated acts annexed to it also improve the framework for delegated acts and thereby respond to the key concern that often prevented acceptance of delegated acts on the Council side, namely the consultation of Member State experts. The Agreement now provides for a clear commitment to a systematic consultation of experts from the Member States in the preparation of delegated acts, including on the draft text, thereby fulfilling a key condition for a successful second attempt to align the old RPS provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. This commitment is now explicitly included in the new standard clauses that are to be used in the drafting of empowerments for the Commission. The Agreement also clearly recognises the important role of early cooperation and exchange of views with the European Parliament in relation to delegated acts. It confirms that the European Parliament must receive all documents at the same time as Member State experts, including the draft delegated acts, and provides for systematic and facilitated access of European Parliament experts to the meetings of Commission expert groups preparing delegated acts. Finally, the Agreement envisages that the Commission may be invited to meetings in the European Parliament (or the Council) in order to have further exchange of views in the preparation of delegated acts.  \n\n\n\n2. METHOD OF THE Alignment and main elements of the proposal\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe starting point for determining the scope of this proposal is the legal acts covered in the three legislative alignment proposals adopted by the Commission in 2013. Acts on which individual legislative proposals have been made in the meantime are not included in the present proposal\n10\n. In one case an act which was not covered by the 2013 proposal, but which requires alignment, has been added to this proposal. \n\n\nThis proposal does not concern eight pieces of legislation in the area of pesticides and food\n11\n. As these basic acts are currently structured, alignment to delegated acts as the Commission had proposed in 2013 would be the correct approach. The Commission has not however at this stage included these acts in the present proposal as it is reflecting on whether there is a more appropriate way to structure these acts as concerns individual authorisations/setting of values/listing of specific substances based on the specific criteria set out in the act, bearing in mind the improved approach recently adopted by the co-legislators in the novel food legislation\n12\n and the ongoing REFIT review of the pesticides basic acts, as well as pending work to assess the democratic legitimacy of existing procedures for the adoption of certain secondary acts (as announced in the Commission Work Programme 2017). \n\n\nIn the 2013 alignment proposals, the legislative approach chosen was not to amend the basic acts in question individually, but to generally provide that the references to the RPS contained in the basic acts are to be read as references to Article 290, respectively Articles 290 or 291. Under this approach each individual basic act would have always had to be read together with the relevant Omnibus regulation, had it been adopted. \n\n\nGiven the difficulties that notably the Council had with that technique, the approach chosen in this proposal is different. It is now proposed to amend each basic act concerned. This is similar to the approach chosen when the RPS provisions were introduced in a similar exercise in 2007\n13\n. Accordingly, to each basic act a number of amendments are made. The empowering provision, i.e. the text containing the substantive empowerment for the RPS, is reworded and follows the wording agreed in the standard clauses for articles delegating powers. The standard article on the exercise of the delegation, so the procedural article, is inserted in each basic act and references to the RPS are deleted. It is for each act explicitly mentioned if the empowerment allows for an amendment of the basic act. The new standard clauses providing for consultation of Member State experts in the preparation of delegated acts are now included in each basic act. No empowerments provide for amendments of other acts.\n\n\nAs regards the choice between delegated and implementing acts empowerments, the 2013 alignment proposals started from the assumption that the measures covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny in principle correspond to those which can be covered by delegations of power as referred to in Article 290 TFEU. Only in a few cases in Omnibus III, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment carried out at the time, the alignment to Article 291 instead of Article 290 was proposed. \n\n\nThe general assumption underlying the new proposal is that the assessment made in the 2013 Omnibus proposals remains valid. Neither the negotiations on the 2013 Omnibus, nor the case-law on the topic\n14\n, nor the outcome of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making resulted in new criteria that would have called for a global reassessment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of alignment to implementing acts an introductory remark is added. In addition to the cases in which already in 2013 alignment to implementing acts was proposed only few further cases are added in this proposal. This concerns empowerments for determining formats in the field of statistics. \n\n\nTable 1: Overview of acts for which alignment to implementing acts is proposed for certain empowerments

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY \n\n\n\nThis proposal is based on the legal bases of all the basic acts amended. \n\n\nThis initiative exclusively relates to the procedures to be applied at Union level in adopting acts based on conferred powers.   \n\n\n\n2016/0400 (COD)\n\n\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nadapting a number of legal acts providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article  33, Article 43(2), Article 53(1), Article 62, Article 64(2), Article 91, Article 100(2), Article 114, Article 153(2)(b), Article 168(4) (a), Article 168(4)(b), Article 172, Article 192(1), Article 207, Article 214(3), and Article 338(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n15\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n16\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts).\n\n\n(2)The measures which may  be covered by delegations of powers, as referred to in Article 290(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC\n17\n. \n\n\n(3)Earlier proposals relating to the alignment of legislation referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny with the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty\n18\n were withdrawn\n19\n due to the stagnation of the interinstitutional negotiations. \n\n\n(4) The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016\n20\n and acknowledged the need to align all existing legislation to the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts which still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. The Commission gave a commitment to prepare a proposal for that alignment by the end of 2016.\n\n\n(5)The majority of empowerments in basic acts which provide for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny fulfil the criteria in Article 290(1) TFEU and should be adapted to that provision. \n\n\n(6)Other empowerments in basic acts which provide for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny fulfil the criteria in Article 291(2) of the TFEU and should be adapted to that provision.\n\n\n(7)Where implementing powers are conferred on the Commission, those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n. \n\n\n(8)In a few basic acts which currently provide for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny certain empowerments have become obsolete and should therefore be deleted.\n\n\n\n\n(9)This Regulation should not affect pending procedures in which the committee has already delivered its opinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC before the entry into force of this Regulation.\n\n\n(10)Since the adaptations and amendments to be made concern procedures at Union level only, they do not, in the case of directives, need to be transposed by the Member States. \n\n\n(11)The acts concerned should therefore be amended accordingly. \n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe acts listed in the Annex are amended as set out therein. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Regulation shall not affect pending procedures in which a committee has already delivered its opinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the  day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\nFor the European Parliament\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\nThe President\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ C 306, 17.12.2007\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13.\n\n\n\n(4)\nOJ L 55 of 28.2.2011, p. 19.  \n\n\n\n(5)\nCOM(2013) 451 final, COM(2013) 452 final and COM(2013) 751 final\n\n\n\n(6)\nA7-0010/2014, P7_TA-PROV(2014)0114, A7-0011/2014, P7_TA-PROV(2014)0112\n\n\n\n(7)\nCOM(2014) 910 final\n\n\n\n(8)\n(2015/C 80/08), OJ C 80 of 7.02.2015, p. 17.\n\n\n\n(9)\nOJ L 123, 12.05.2016, p.1.\n\n\n\n(10)\nThose acts are listed for information under point 3.\n\n\n\n(11)\nRegulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1);
