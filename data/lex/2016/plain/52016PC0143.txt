"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 22.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 143 final\n2016/0079(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol thereto\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nOn the basis of the relevant negotiating directives\n1\n, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of the Cook Islands with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European Union and the Cook Islands. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 21 October 2015. They cover a period of eight years and four years respectively from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the date of their signature, as laid down in Article 16 of the Agreement and Article 12 of the Protocol.\n\n\nThe new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Cook Islands.\n\n\nThe main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Cook Islands fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the conservation and management measures of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission based its position in part on the results of a forward-looking assessment, carried out by external experts, of whether a new Agreement and Protocol should be concluded. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Cook Islands to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Cook Islands\u2019 fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.\n\n\nThe Protocol provides for fishing opportunities for 4 tuna seiners.\n\n\nThe Commission accordingly proposes that the Council authorise the signing and provisional application of the new Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 3(1d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the conservation of marine biological resources falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle does not apply as Member States are not entitled to negotiate fisheries agreements with third countries.\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the new Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto is Article 43(2) TFEU in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof.\n\n\nThis procedure is being carried out in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council Decision on the conclusion, with the consent of the European Parliament, of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol thereto and to the Council Regulation on the allocation of fishing opportunities between the EU Member States.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe interested parties were consulted during the ex-ante evaluation on a possible Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol between the European Union and the Cook Islands. The evaluation report has been published in its entirety on the European Commission's Europa website. Experts from the Member States and industry were also consulted in technical meetings. The evaluation and these consultations led to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for the EU and the Cook Islands to conclude a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Implementation Protocol thereto.\n\n\nIn accordance with the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, the Agreement includes a provision concerning the respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law (Article 3, paragraph 4). The Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto also provide for the possibility of their suspension (Articles 13 and 6 respectively) or termination (Articles 14 and 7 respectively) in the event of a breach by either one of the Parties of the respect for human rights. \n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe annual financial contribution is EUR\u00a0735\u00a0000 for the first and the second year, and EUR\u00a0700\u00a0000 for the third and fourth year, on the basis of:\n\n\n(a) a reference tonnage of 7\u00a0000 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR\u00a0385\u00a0000 for the first and the second year, and EUR\u00a0350\u00a0000 for the third and fourth year; and\n\n\n(b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Cook Islands, amounting to EUR\u00a0350\u00a0000 for the first, second, third and fourth years. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the Cook Islands\u2019 needs in relation to scientific research, artisanal fisheries as well as fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance and the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n2016/0079 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol thereto\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The European Union and the Cook Islands have negotiated a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agreement\u2019) and an Implementation Protocol thereto, granting Union vessels fishing opportunities in the waters over which the Cook Islands has sovereignty or jurisdiction in respect of fisheries. \n\n\n(2)The Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto were initialled at the end of the negotiations on 21 October 2015.\n\n\n(3)Article 16 of the Agreement and Article 12 of the Implementation Protocol thereto provide for their respective provisional application from the date of their signature.\n\n\n(4)Therefore, the Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto should be signed, subject to their conclusion.\n\n\n(5)In order to ensure an expeditious start to fishing activities of Union vessels, the Agreement and the Implementation Protocol thereto should be applied provisionally, pending completion of the procedures necessary for their entry into force,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Sustainable

proposal/initiative relates to the extension of an existing action\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0The proposal/initiative relates to an action redirected towards a new action\u00a0\n\n\n1.4.Objective(s)\n\n\n1.4.1.The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\n\n\nThe negotiation and conclusion of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) with third countries meets the general objective of giving EU fishing vessels access to the fishing zones of third countries and developing a partnership with those countries with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside EU waters.\n\n\nSFPAs also ensure consistency between the principles governing the Common Fisheries Policy and the commitments made under other European policies (sustainable use of third-country resources, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, integration of partner countries into the global economy and better political and financial governance of fisheries).\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective: \n\n\nTo contribute to sustainable fishing in non-EU waters, maintain a European presence in distant-water fisheries and protect the interests of the European fisheries sector and consumers by negotiating and concluding SFPAs with coastal states, consistent with other European policies.\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nMaritime affairs and fisheries, to establish a governance framework for fishing activities carried out by European Union fishing vessels in third country waters (SFAs) (budget line 11.0301).\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the Agreement enables the establishment of a strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and the Cook Islands. The conclusion of the Protocol will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Cook Islands' fishing zone.\n\n\nThe Protocol will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular as regards monitoring and combating illegal fishing.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nRates of utilisation of fishing opportunities (annual uptake of fishing authorisations as a percentage of availability under the Protocol);\n\n\nGathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the Agreement;\n\n\nContribution to employment and to added value in the EU and to stabilising the EU market (in aggregate with other SFPAs);\n\n\nNumber of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThere has never been an SFPA or Protocol between the European Union and the Cook Islands. A forward looking assessment, carried out by external experts, concluded that a new SFPA and Protocol between the EU and the Cook Islands would be beneficial for both parties.\n\n\nIt is intended that the new Agreement and Protocol will apply provisionally from the date of their signature in order not to delay the start of fishing operations.\n\n\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European fleet in the Cook Islands' fishing zone and will authorise European vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in that zone. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and the Cook Islands, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It provides, in particular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch data. The sectoral support available under the Protocol will help the Cook Islands with its national fisheries strategy, including the fight against IUU fishing.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nAs regards this new Agreement and Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow the emergence of private agreements which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The EU also hopes that this Agreement and Protocol will strengthen the bilateral cooperation as regards the fight against illegal fishing.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nAn analysis of catches within the framework of similar protocols in the region, as well as the assessments and scientific advice available, led the parties to set a reference tonnage for tuna and tuna-like species of 7 000 tonnes a year with fishing opportunities for 4 purse seiners. Sectoral support has been set at a an adequate level to take into account requirements in terms of building the capacity of the Cook Islands fisheries authorities and the priorities of the national fisheries strategy.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nFunds paid out under SFPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third-country partners. However, allocating some of those funds for implementing measures as part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition for the conclusion and monitoring of SFPAs. These financial resources are compatible with other sources of funding from other providers of international funding for carrying out projects and/or programmes at national level in the fisheries sector.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\nX\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013X\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from 2016 to 2020\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from 2016 to 2020\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nX\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013X by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Commission (DG MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries counsellor based in the region) will ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, particularly as regards the use by operators of fishing opportunities and catch data. \n\n\nThe SFPA Agreement provides for at least one annual meeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the Cook Islands review the implementation of the Agreement and Protocol and, if necessary, adjust the programming and, if applicable, the financial contribution.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThere is some risk in setting up a new fisheries Agreement and Protocol, particularly with regard to the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming).\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nExtensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral policy laid down in the Agreement and the Protocol. Joint analysis of results, as referred to in Article 3 of the Protocol, also forms part of these control methods.\n\n\nIn addition, the Agreement and the Protocol contain specific clauses for their suspension, on certain conditions and in given circumstances.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\nThe Commission undertakes to establish political dialogue and regular coordination with the Cook Islands with a view to improving the management of the Agreement and the Protocol and strengthening the EU\u2019s contribution to the sustainable management of resources. In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under an SFPA is subject to the Commission's standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries into which the financial contribution is paid. For this particular Protocol, Article 2 (7) stipulates that all elements of the financial contribution must be paid into a Government bank account and inscribed in the national budgetary law.\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\n\uf0b7Existing budget
