These acts remain formally in force even if their legal effects have been exhausted.\n\n\nEliminating acts that are no longer applicable or relevant permits a more user-friendly presentation and more efficient and time-saving scrutiny of tools that facilitate access to Union law: CELEX, EUR-Lex and the Directory of Legislation in force (e.g. search results would no longer show obsolete acts alongside those which are applicable). Improving the transparency of Union law is an essential element of the Better Regulation agenda that the Union Institutions are pursuing also under the new Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\n1\n. The 2014 REFIT Communication\n2\n announced that the Commission will prepare repeals of legislation, inter alia, in relation to standardized reporting in the area of environment. Moreover, the 2015 Better Regulation Communication\n3\n called for a broad review of reporting in several policy areas including the environment. Given these links, the repeal of Council Directive 91/692/EEC of 23 December 1991 standardizing and rationalizing reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment (\"Directive 91/692/EEC\") is now being addressed. This is also linked to a wider Fitness Check for environmental monitoring and reporting. That Fitness Check is now underway, as set out in the Commission's Work Programme 2016\n4\n, which mentioned the proposal for repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC and the related water questionnaire Decision 95/337/EEC under repeal initiatives in Annex V.\u00a0\n\n\nThe repeal package consists of four proposed initiatives related to the repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC and Decision 95/337/EEC: \n\n\n1.A Communication which declares the obsolescence of 11 implementing acts adopted by the Commission to establish questionnaires for environmental reporting including Decision 95/337/EEC. \n\n\n2.Two proposals for Commission Decisions repealing 2 of the implementing decisions (via comitology procedures), namely Commission Decision 2011/92/EU of 10 February 2011\n5\n and Commission Decision 2010/681/EU of 9 November 2010\n6\n that have exhausted their legal effect, but for procedural reasons will be repealed via a later comitology procedure by the Commission.\n\n\n3.Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision, which will repeal and amend provisions of the 6 legal acts referring to Directive 91/692/EEC.\n\n\nTo prepare these initiatives, the Commission has undertaken an analysis and looked into the consequences of keeping or repealing the various obligations. The result of this work is summarised below and is presented in more detail in a supporting study which is published separately.\n7\n As the aim is to repeal obsolete provisions and legal acts, it is considered that there is no need for a formal impact assessment to be carried out. It is important to highlight that there are no real economic benefits expected to be harvested as a result of the repeal exercise. Main benefits will be mainly linked to have a clearer set of rules on reporting resulting from this clean-up exercise.\n\n\nShortcomings of Directive 91/692/EEC \n\n\nThe Directive 91/692/EEC (SRD) aimed at streamlining the reporting obligations of all EU environmental legislation in effect at the time of its adoption. However in practice, not all environmental reporting requirements were harmonized by Directive 91/692/EEC. For instance Directives 91/271/EEC\n8\n and 91/676/EEC\n9\n were excluded from scope. It can be also observed that the implementation of the Directive was burdensome and ineffective from the outset. One main problem was that the directive was adopted prior to the widespread use of information technology (IT). Furthermore, many of the individual instruments for which Directive 91/692/EEC set out reporting requirements were subsequently replaced by instruments which disregarded its reporting provisions. For example, the Directive 2000/60/EC\n10\n repealed seven pieces of water legislation and hence the related water questionnaire 95/337/EEC adopted under Directive 91/692/EEC became redundant. Instruments such as the Directive 2000/60/EC and the Directive 2010/75/EC\n11\n (and its predecessor, Directive 96/61/EC)\n12\n introduced independent reporting obligations. \n\n\nWith the successful development of the European Environmental Agency's (EEA) Reportnet and sectoral initiatives on streamlining of reporting (e.g. the Water Information System for Europe), the need and effectiveness of a horizontal instrument on reporting was increasingly put into question. Finally, the adoption of the INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC), and the related development of the Shared Environment Information System (SEIS),\n13\n introduced a more modern and effective, horizontal approach to information management and reporting related to EU environmental policy. \n\n\nThe Commission concluded at the time that \"[\u2026] a key step in implementing SEIS, and especially to trigger the expected simplification benefits, will be to modernise the legal provisions relating to the way in which information required by environmental legislation is made available. It is expected that this will be done by revising the Standardised Reporting directive 91/692/EC, which needs to be updated and brought into line with the SEIS principles. To this end, the Commission intends to come forward with a relevant legislative proposal in 2008, including a repeal of outdated provisions in the current standardised reporting directive.\"\n14\n\u00a0In the end, the Commission decided not to come forward with a new legal instrument on reporting but to pursue this agenda through a non-legal approach (see EU Shared Environmental Information System-Implementation Outlook\n15\n) combined with coordinated action in the different environmental policy areas (such as water, air, nature, etc.). \n\n\nSummary of current scope and relevance of Directive 91/692/EEC\n\n\nDirective 91/692/EEC refers to 28 environmental acts covered by its provisions. A number of further acts make use of Directive 91/692/EEC. Currently due to subsequent repeals of these acts (see overview in table 2), 1 regulation, 9 directives (see overview in table 1) (two directives remain subject to its provisions, namely Directive 86/278/EEC and Directive 87/217/EEC) and\u00a023 decisions remain in force that still make reference to those provisions (see overview in table 3).\n\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of the original obligations set out in Directive 91/692/EEC have become obsolete and have no legal effect anymore As a result, the proposal for a repeal has been made to ensure legal certainty, improve transparency, reduce administrative burden and ensure that EU legislation is \"fit for purpose\" in line with the Better Regulation agenda. \n\n\nProposed actions to repeal Directive 91/692/EEC and related acts\n\n\nThe first action is a proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council removing requirements for standardized reporting. It is also proposed that references to the old comitology rules are replaced by Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers as required by Article 13 thereof on transitional measures.\n\n\n\n\nThe second action aims at adoption of a Communication on declaring obsolescence of the implementing Decisions under Directive 91/692/EEC still in force. The Communication identifies the Decisions that have become obsolete and whose legal basis was repealed. \n\n\nThe third action will aim to repeal two implementing decisions, that still have a valid legal basis but in the meantime have exhausted their legal effects.\n16\n\n\n\nAs part of the preparatory analysis, several options were considered to ensure an effective repeal whilst maintaning the legal effects, where necessary. The findings of this analysis are presented in the supporting study\n17\n that recommends the complete repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC provisions and removal of obsolete provisions, while making reference to new rules on implementing acts. This option consisting of the above-mentioned three actions was identified as most effective in cutting red tape and enhancing legal clarity.\n\n\nPre-existing directives referred to by Directive 91/692/EEC\n\n\nAs noted above, only Directives 86/278/EEC and 87/217/EEC (see overview in table 1) remain from the 28 instruments (see overview in table 2) originally mentioned in Directive 91/692/EEC. \n\n\nIt is proposed to maintain the reporting provisions of Directives 86/278/EEC, while aligning it with the new rules for implementing acts established by the TFEU. \n\n\nThe reporting requirements of Directive 87/217/EEC are not being used, mainly due to discontinuation of the use of asbestos across the EU Member States as a consequence of the phasing out of the production and use of raw asbestos and of products containing asbestos in the EU, through REACH (1907/2006/EC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Overview of directives and regulations covered by the proposed decision repealing

already took place in preparation of the Communication for a Shared Environment Information System (SEIS)\n95\n. Since then, the underlying analysis was updated and a detailed background paper was prepared.\n96\n This provided sufficient evidence for the repeal proposal and made an additional impact assessment unnecessary. \n\n\nThe chosen instruments to achieve the objectives, the two Decisions and one Communication, would not alter reporting in practice. The reason for this is that the proposed repeal package will result in greater legal clarity by removing already obsolete provisions and will streamline a number of reporting obligations through 'Lisbonisation'\n97\n of procedures. The efficiency gains are expected to be achieved through the simplification of the EU acquis, meaning that it would not generate economic benefits, but rather technical, legal ones. However, no quantitative figures for costs and/or benefits could be obtained that could be directly related to the repeal mostly because a large proportion of the original obligations under the Directive are, in practice, obsolete already. \n\n\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nSummary of the proposed measures\n\n\nThe repeal proposal for in the field of environmental reporting have identified legal measures that are obsolete, or as appropriate have replaced existing provisions with appropriate references to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. \n\n\nLegal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for adopting the repeal Decision is Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU)\n\n\nPrinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality\n\n\nThe measures concerned by this proposal are obsolete, either because their content has been taken up by subsequent acts or because they are no longer relevant due to their temporary nature. Therefore, it is in line with the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality to repeal those measures. It is for the Union legislator to adopt the necessary measures to that effect.\n\n\nMain legal provisions of the proposed Decision\n\n\nArticle 1 \n\n\nEnacts an amendment to Article 21 (1) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, by inserting a reference to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nEnacts an amendment to Article 27(1) of Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide by inserting a reference to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and adapts Article 29 of Directive 2009/31/EC, which provides for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, to Article 290 of the TFEU.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nEnacts an amendment to Articles 13, 15, 17and introducing a new Article 15a of Council Directive 86/278/EEC of 12 June 1986 on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture by inserting references to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nEnacts an amendment to Article 13 of Directive 87/217/EEC of 19 March 1987 on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos, by deleting the first paragraph thereof. \n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nEnacts an amendment to Article 21 (2) of Regulation 1257/2013/EU on ship recycling. \n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nEnacts an amendment to European Parliament and Council Directive 94/63/EC of 20 December 1994 on the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions resulting from the storage of petrol and its distribution from terminals to service stations by amnding Articles 4 (4) and 6 (4) and deleting the first sentence of Article 9 on monitoring and reporting.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 7 and Article 8\n\n\nEnacts the repeal of the Directive and the date of entry into force and application of the repealing legal act. Entry into force shall be aligned with the Circular Economy proposal\n98\n covering provisions of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives, Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles, Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste and European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste and with the Proposal for a Directive amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments.\n99\n\n\n\nChoice of instrument\n\n\nProposed instrument: European Parliament and Council Decision.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\n\nThe proposal has no budgetary impact.\n\n\n2016/0394 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Directive 87/217/EEC of the Council, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directive 86/278/EEC and Council Directive 94/63/EC as regards procedural rules in the field of environmental reporting and repealing Council Directive 91/692/EEC \n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n100\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n101\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas: \n\n\n(1)Council Directive 86/278/EEC\n102\n and Council Directive 87/217/EEC\n103\n are based on Articles 100 and 235 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, now Articles 115 and 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Amendments to those Directives are related to Union policy on environment and are a direct consequence of the repeal of Council Directive 91/692/EEC\n104\n on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU. It is therefore appropriate to amend Directives 86/278/EEC and 87/217/EEC on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU. \n\n\n(2)European Parliament and Council Directive 94/63/EC\n105\n is based on Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European Community, now Article 114 TFEU. Amendments to that Directive are related to Union policy on environment and are a direct consequence of the repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU. It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 94/63/EC on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU.\n\n\n\n\n(3)Directive 91/692/EEC\u00a0was adopted to rationalize and improve on a sectoral basis the provisions on the transmission of information and the publication of reports concerning certain Directives on the protection of the environment. To achieve that objective, Directive 91/692/EEC amended several Directives to introduce uniform reporting requirements.\n\n\n(4)The implementation of the reporting requirements introduced by Directive 91/692/EEC is burdensome and ineffective. Many Union acts amended by Directive 91/692/EEC are replaced and no longer contain reporting requirements as introduced by Directive 91/692/EEC. For example, Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n106\n repealed seven Union acts in the field of water policy and did not take over the reporting system introduced by Directive 91/692/EEC. Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n107\n contains no reference to Directive 91/692/EEC and provides for a separate system of reporting.\n\n\n(5)Directive 91/692/EEC also does not provide for use of electronic tools. With the successful development of the European Environmental Agency's Reportnet and sectoral initiatives on streamlining of reporting, for example, the Water Information System for Europe, the need and effectiveness of a horizontal instrument on reporting has increasingly been put into question. Finally, the adoption of Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n108\n and the related development of the Shared Environment Information System\n109\n, introduced a more modern and effective, horizontal approach on information management and reporting related to Union environmental policy.\n\n\n(6)Directive 91/692/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n\n\n(7)(Most of the Directives amended by Directive 91/692/EEC are no longer in force. However, Directive 87/217/EEC and Directive 86/278/EEC are still in force.\n\n\n(8)Directive 86/278/EEC requires Member States to provide a report on the implementation of that Directive on the basis of a questionnaire or outline drafted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 91/692/EEC. In order to avoid legal vacuum due to the repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC, it is necessary to replace reference to Directive 91/692/EEC by reference to the procedure referred to in Directive 86/278/EEC.\n\n\n(9)Reporting under Directive 87/217/EEC is no longer necessary. In Member States following adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n110\n which provides for phasing out of the production and use of raw asbestos and of products containing asbestos in the Union. It is therefore appropriate to delete the reporting requirements set out in Directive 87/217/EEC.\n\n\n(10)After the adoption of Directive 91/692/EC, the following Regulations and Directives included a reference to Directive 91/692/EC: European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC\n111\n, Directive 94/63/EC, Council Directive 1999/31/EC\n112\n, Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n113\n, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n114\n, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n115\n, Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n116\n, and Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n117\n.\n\n\n(11)As part of an EU action plan for the Circular Economy\n118\n the Commission proposed to amend Directives 2008/98/EC, 94/62/EC, 1999/31/EC and 2000/53/EC in order to replace the reference to Directive 91/692/EEC. In order to ensure that there is no legal vacuum due to the repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC, this Decision should apply from the same date as the acts proposed in the framework of the Circular Economy package.\n\n\n(12)Directives 2009/31/EC and 2003/87/EC require Member States to provide a report on the implementation of those Directives on the basis of a questionnaire or outline drafted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Directive 91/692/EEC. In order to avoid legal vacuum due to the repeal of Directive 91/692/EEC, it is necessary to replace reference to Directive 91/692/EEC by reference to the procedure referred to in the relevant Directive. \n\n\n(13)In order to ensure that certain provisions of Annexes to Directive 86/278/EEC are up to date, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adaptation of those provisions to technical and scientific progress. In order to ensure that the Annexes to Directive 2009/31/EC are up to date, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adaptation of those Annexes to technical and scientific progress. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(14)Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 contains reference to Directive 91/692/EEC. The relevant provision relates to the first reporting exercise, which has already ended. The relevant provision should therefore be deleted. \n\n\n(15)Reporting requirement set out in Directive 94/63/EC is no longer necessary for the purposes of monitoring implementation of Directive 94/63/EC. The relevant provision should therefore be deleted. \n\n\n(16)Directives 87/217/EEC, 2003/87/EC and 2009/31/EC, Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 and Directives 86/278/EEC and 94/63/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\nAmendment to Directive 2003/87/EC\n\n\nIn Article 21(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC the fourth sentence is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"The report shall be drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire or outline adopted by the Commission in the form of implementing acts.
