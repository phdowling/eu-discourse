The context\n\n\nThe European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (\u201cthe Agency\u201d) was set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\n1\n (\u201cthe Regulation\u201d). \n\n\nAccording to Article 2 of the Regulation, the Agency's objective is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and its Member States when implementing Union law with assistance and expertise relating to fundamental rights.\n\n\nPursuant to Article 28(1) of the Regulation, the Agency shall be open to the participation of candidate countries as observers. Article 28(2) of the Regulation provides that the participation and the respective modalities shall be determined by a decision of the relevant Association Council. The decision shall indicate in particular the nature, extent and manner of the country's participation in the Agency's work, within the framework set in Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation. Upon the decision of the Association Council, the Agency will be able to deal with fundamental rights issues in the candidate country in question within the scope of Article 3(1) of the Regulation, to the extent necessary for the gradual alignment of the country to Union law.\n\n\n2. The proposed Decision\n\n\nThe Commission proposes to the Council the adoption of a decision on a Union position in the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council pertaining to the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the Agency's work and its modalities. The proposed sole article decision provides that the Union position is the one laid down in the draft decision of the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council (\"the draft Decision), annexed to the Council decision. A proposal for such a draft Decision is also attached to the Commission's proposal. It complies with the requirements of Article 28 of the Regulation. \n\n\nIn conformity with one of the basic principles underpinning the Regulation (i.e. the Agency works on the basis of a thematic, as opposed to country-specific, approach) the draft Decision enables the Agency to carry out in the Republic of Serbia the tasks set within the framework of Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation. \n\n\nThe draft Decision also lays down that the Republic of Serbia shall appoint an observer and alternate observer to the Management Board of the Agency. These persons should comply with the criteria laid down in Article 12(1) of the Regulation. They shall participate in the work of the Management Board on equal footing with the members and alternate members appointed by Member States, but without a right to vote.\n\n\nThe draft Decision includes provisions relating to the Republic of Serbia's financial contribution and to staff (annex I). The draft Decision is accompanied by a financial statement. \n\n\nThe draft Decision is in line with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (\"Staff Regulations\") and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (\"CEOS\"), laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68\n2\n.\n\n\n2016/0066 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non a Union position in the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities, within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 352 in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\n(1)The Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 made participation in Union agencies a way of stepping up the pre-accession strategy. The European Council's conclusions provide that the Union \"agencies in which applicant countries will be able to participate will be determined on a case-by-case basis\".\n\n\n(2)Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (\u201cthe Regulation\u201d) provides that the Agency shall be open to the participation of candidate countries as observers. \n\n\n(3)The Republic of Serbia shares the aims and objectives laid down for the Agency in the Regulation and subscribes to the tasks of the Agency and its areas of activity as per Articles 4 and 5 thereof.\n\n\n(4)The Republic of Serbia's ultimate objective is to become a member of the European Union, and its participation in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights will help the Republic of Serbia to achieve this objective.\n\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nSole Article\n\n\nThe position to be taken by the European Union in the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities thereof are laid down in the draft Decision of the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council annexed to this Decision. \n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, JO L 53 of 22.2.2007, p.1.\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ L 56, 4.3.1968, p. 1, as last amended by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1023/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013, OJ L 287, 29.10.2013, p.15.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 7.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 119 final\nANNEX\nDecision on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities, within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\nAccompanying\nCouncil Decision\non a Union position in the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities, within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nDecision on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities, within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\n\n\nAccompanying\n\n\nCouncil Decision\n\n\non a Union position in the EU-the Republic of Serbia Stabilisation and Association Council on the participation of the Republic of Serbia as an observer in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights' work and the respective modalities, within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007\n\n\n\nTHE EU-THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA STABILISATION AND ASSOCIATION COUNCIL, \n\n\nHaving regard to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union, on the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, on the other part,\n\n\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and in particular Article 28 thereof,\n\n\nWhereas\n\n\n(1) The Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 made participation in Union agencies a way of stepping up the pre-accession strategy.

For the following years the contribution will be in accordance with the table under point 2. As from year four, the contribution will be adapted in the light of any increase or decrease of the Agency\u2019s subsidy in order to maintain the analogy between the contribution for the Republic of Serbia and the Agency\u2019s budget for the EU-28. The contribution may also be reviewed in the following financial years on the basis of the latest statistical data published by the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat).\n\n\n7.This contribution shall be expressed in euro and paid into a euro bank account of the Commission of the European Union. \n\n\n8.The Republic of Serbia will pay its contribution according to the call for funds for its own part at the latest 30 days after the call for funds is sent by the Commission.\n\n\n9.Any delay in the payment of the contribution shall give rise to the payment of interest by the Republic of Serbia on the outstanding amount from the due date.

The indicators set in the Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) are used to measure the Agency\u2019s overall performance. The PMF contains project level indicators describing the planned output of each intervention and short term, long term and aspirational indicators, most of which are measured after the completion of the inteventions and specifically of the planned initiative. Importantly, the PMF is linked to both the Strategic plan and Annual Work Programmes. The Agency\u2019s PMF includes an intervention logic and a list of the performance indicators along with the corresponding objective, judgment criteria, measures and sources and tools. The PMF brings all performance-related information and data under a logical framework. The Agency\u2019s PMF is organised in a way which supports the analysis of performance (i.e. monitoring and evaluation as well as reporting activities) at different levels of the Agency, i.e. project, activity, thematic area and at strategic levels and will be used to monitor the implementation of the initiative. In particular, indicators are differentiated by level of achievements (i.e. output, short term, long term and aspirational impacts) as per the levels of activities depicted in the logic model. They are identified annually (also for the relevant ABM/ABB activity concerned by the initiative) in the Agency's operational programmes of work (Programming Document) and performance monitoring and assessment is included in the relevant reporting document (Consolidated Annual Activity Report).\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or

EU Agency for Fundamental Rights carried out PHARE projects in different candidate countries (in 2003 in those 10 candidate countries which joined the EU in 2004, as well as in RO, BG, TR and HR) which proved very positive for both candidate countries and the EUMC.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nPart of the cost of the participation of
