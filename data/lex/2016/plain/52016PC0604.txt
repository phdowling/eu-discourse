However, as these challenges persist, the Union's continued capacity to react swiftly in emergency situations is at stake.\n\n\nAgainst this background, the European Parliament called for bold steps to enhance the Union budget's flexibility\n3\n, whilst informal Council discussions also pointed at the need to enhance the ability of the current MFF to respond to unforeseen events\n4\n. \n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS AND CONTENT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\nThe present proposal is based on Article 2 of the MFF Regulation which provides that the mid-term review of the MFF shall, as appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal for the revision of this Regulation. Such a revision shall not reduce the pre-allocated national envelopes, without prejudice to the adjustment of the cohesion policy envelopes made in accordance with Article 7 of the MFF Regulation\n5\n.\n\n\nTaking into account the use made of special instruments since the beginning of the MFF period and the new challenges the Union has been and continues to be confronted with, the Commission proposes to amend the MFF Regulation in order to increase the annual maximum amounts set for the Emergency Aid Reserve (Article 9) and the Flexibility Instrument (Article 11) and to introduce a new special instrument for setting up a European Union Crisis Reserve financed from de-committed appropriations to allow the Union to react rapidly to crises, such as the current migration crisis, as well as to events with serious humanitarian or security implications.\u00a0In parallel with the present proposal, the Commission proposes to amend the Interinstitutional Agreement on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management\n6\n in order to provide for the mobilisation procedure of the new Crisis Reserve.\n\n\nFurthermore, it is proposed to remove the limitations in time and scope of the Global margin for commitments (Article 14). \n\n\nConcerning the Global margin for payments, it is proposed to remove the annual caps set for 2018-2020 (Article 5.2) to allow for the full mobilisation, in the later years of the MFF, of the large margins in payments left unused in 2016 and 2017 should it prove necessary, and therefore ensure specific and maximum flexibility. \n\n\n\n3.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe present proposal has no immediate budgetary implications. Special instruments are mobilised and appropriations entered in the annual budget subject to the procedures laid down in the MFF Regulation, the relevant basic acts (see Article 3, paragraph 2 of that Regulation) and the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management.\n\n\n\n2016/0283 (APP)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\namending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 312 thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament, \n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Special instruments have been extensively used in the first years of implementation of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework (MFF) set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013\n7\n\u00a0to address new challenges which arose in the European neighbourhood and called for swift and comprehensive Union action to deal with their far-reaching humanitarian and security implications.\n\n\n(2)The circumstances which occasioned those extraordinary measures and the need to take further action persist, as shown by the recourse made, again, under the draft budget for the year 2017 to margins and special instruments, which reduces the budgetary availabilities to confront such situations in the remaining period of the MFF.\n\n\n(3)In order to implement specific and maximum possible flexibility and to ensure the sufficiency of payment ceilings to allow the Union to fulfil its obligations in compliance with Article 323 of the Treaty, the limitations set for the adjustment of payment ceilings for the years 2018-2020 need to be removed.\n\n\n(4)The Emergency Aid Reserve and the Flexibility Instrument need to be reinforced and the restrictions regarding the Global margins for commitments and payments removed in order to maintain a sufficient capacity for the Union to react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\n(5)A new special instrument establishing a European Union Crisis Reserve financed from de-committed appropriations needs to be provided for in order to allow the Union to react rapidly to crises, such as the current migration crisis, as well as to events with serious humanitarian or security implications. \n\n\n(6)Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)In Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n(2)\"2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The special instruments provided for in Articles\u00a09 to\u00a015 shall ensure the flexibility of the MFF and shall be laid down in order to allow the budget procedure to run smoothly.
