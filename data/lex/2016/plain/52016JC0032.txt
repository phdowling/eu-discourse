The EU\u2019s main LAC interlocutor between 1999 and 2012 was the \u2018Rio Group\u2019 of countries. As from 2012, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was designated by its member countries to replace the Rio Group as the EU\u2019s counterpart for the region-to-region summit process and strategic partnership.\n\n\nSince 1999, the two regions have worked together to promote shared interests and values, as confirmed at summits in Madrid (2002), Guadalajara (2004), Vienna (2006), Lima (2008), Madrid (2010), Santiago de Chile (2013) and Brussels (2015). The successive summits have ensured a steady intensification of political dialogue and progress on jointly tackling a wide range of issues, including climate change, migration, the fight against illicit drugs, the promotion of human rights and gender equality, education and cultural issues, and in the fields of science and technology.\n\n\nObjectives of the EU-LAC International Foundation and consistency with relevant policies\n\n\nAt the Fifth EU-LAC Summit (Lima, 2008), leaders of both regions decided to consider the creation of a bi-regional foundation to foster debate on common strategies and action to strengthen the partnership and enhance its visibility. At the Sixth Summit (Madrid, 2010), the heads of state and government decided that an EU-LAC Foundation should be established, with the following objectives:\n\n\n\uf0b7to contribute to the strengthening of the EU-CELAC partnership process through the participation and inputs of civil society and other social actors;\n\n\n\uf0b7to encourage further acquaintance and understanding between the regions; and\n\n\n\uf0b7to enhance mutual visibility between the regions and the visibility of the partnership itself.\n\n\nThat decision must be seen in the context of the EU\u2019s existing foundations to promote relations with Asia (the Asia-Europe Foundation \u2013 ASEF) and the Euro-Mediterranean region (the Anna Lindh Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures). The EU-LAC Foundation was conceived as an instrument to help strengthen bi-regional relations between the EU and LAC, in line with priorities and strategies set out in relevant summit declarations and successive Commission Communications, such as A stronger partnership between the EU and Latin America (2005)\n1\n and EU-Latin America: global players in partnership (2009)\n2\n. Both the European Parliament (April 2006) and the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (December 2007) adopted resolutions in favour of creating the Foundation.\n\n\nThe EU-LAC Foundation was formally established in Hamburg in 2011 as a German civil law body, pending the possible conclusion of an international constituent agreement to convert it into an international organisation. It was tasked with:\n\n\n\uf0b7promoting and coordinating result-oriented activities in support of bi-regional relations, focusing on the implementation of priorities identified at EU-LAC summits; \n\n\n\uf0b7encouraging debate on common strategies for delivering on those priorities by stimulating research and studies; and \n\n\n\uf0b7fostering fruitful exchange and new networking opportunities among civil society and other stakeholders involved with, or potentially interested in, the biregional relationship. \n\n\nThe Foundation can launch initiatives in association with public and private institutions, LAC and EU governments, the European Commission and other EU institutions and agencies, and international and regional institutions. In its first four years, the Foundation has undertaken a range of activities in this framework.\n\n\nCouncil Decision 2012/493/EU authorised the Commission to open negotiations for an international agreement on the creation of the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation, with the EU, its Member States and the LAC countries as members. Negotiations started in December 2012 and were conducted on the EU side by the European External Action Service (EEAS) on behalf of the Commission. Member States have been consulted throughout the negotiating process at meetings of the Council\u2019s Working Party on Latin America and the Caribbean (COLAC). The European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations. At the Seventh EULAC/First EU-CELAC Summit (Santiago de Chile, 2013), the heads of state and government called for the early conclusion of the negotiations, which duly came to a close in January 2015.\n\n\nAt the Second EU-CELAC Summit (Brussels, June 2015), the heads of state and government welcomed the initialling of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation and looked forward to \u2018its swift signature and early entering into force\u2019. The High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met, and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and conclusion. It is the shared aim of CELAC and the EU that the Agreement be signed during a meeting of the foreign ministers from the two regions on 25-26 October in the Dominican Republic. This will be the culmination of a decade-long process during which the leaders of the 61 countries concerned have worked to establish and consolidate the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation that can help strengthen the partnership process and improve mutual understanding and visibility.\n\n\nObjective of this proposal\n\n\n\n\nThe present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument that authorises the signing of the Agreement on behalf of the EU. Establishing the Foundation as an international organisation will improve its capacity to obtain funding from its member countries, many of which are unable to make financial contributions to it while it remains established under German civil law. By acquiring the status of an international organisation, the Foundation will also be able to reduce certain costs, benefit from privileges and immunities under international law and make better use of its financial and human resources. This, in turn, will allow it to maintain and develop further its activities in support of the partnership.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS\n\n\nThe joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the signing of the Agreement. \n\n\n\nThe choice of legal basis for the signing of the Agreement must rest on objective factors amenable to judicial review, which include the aim and content of the measure. \n\n\nThe aim of the Agreement is to establish the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation with legal personality under public international law. The Foundation will help to strengthen the EU-CELAC partnership, encourage mutual understanding and enhance mutual visibility between the regions. The Foundation can be seen as an instrument of EU common foreign policy because its activities contribute to the convergence of Member States' actions towards the Latin American and Caribbean region, ensuring that the EU is able to assert its interests and values in the framework of the partnership between the two regions. Specific activities of the Foundation contribute to the political dialogue between the EU and CELAC in areas such as global governance and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Relevant past activities of the Foundation include studies and seminars on the strategic partnership itself\u00a0 and on the collaboration of EU and LAC as partners in global governance (e.g. studies on \u201cThe EU and CELAC: Reinvigorating a strategic partnership\u201d and \u201cSummit Diplomacy: Challenges and opportunities of the new regionalisms\u201d; a panel on \u201cThe EU and LAC: Powers in a Multipolar World or partners in Global Governance?\u201d; and a seminar on \u201cChina, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the European Union: A Triangular Relationship?\u201d). Similar activities will be undertaken once the Foundation becomes an international organisation. In this sense, the Agreement pursues CFSP-related objectives. \n\n\nThe Foundation will also strengthen cooperation between the EU and LAC regions, fostering intercultural exchange, notably by facilitating and promoting participation by, and inputs from, civil society and other social actors. Taking into account that some of the LAC member countries have already graduated from development assistance, while others remain eligible, the Foundation will:\n\n\n\n\uf0b7support EU-CELAC policy dialogue and cooperation involving some or all LAC countries in key areas of common interest, such as research, sustainable development, climate change, competitiveness, jobs and growth, and gender equality;\n\n\n\uf0b7conduct or support analysis and research on themes of interest for the partnership; and \n\n\n\uf0b7develop and support bi-regional networks and foster exchanges of knowledge and best practices between them. \n\n\n\nIn view of its aim and content, the Agreement falls within the scope of Article 37 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The procedural legal bases for the signing of the Agreement are Articles 218(5) and (8), second subparagraph, TFEU.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nNumerous preparatory documents and terms of reference were prepared from 2008 onwards, when the idea of an EU-LAC Foundation was being considered and its objectives and structure were being defined. These initial documents were discussed in successive meetings of the COLAC and of senior EU officials, and in bi-regional senior officials\u2019 meetings, and the broader political framework was established at successive summits. Relevant lessons learned from similar experiences in other regions (e.g.\u00a0in the context of the ASEF and the Anna Lindh Foundation) were taken on board. Since the EU-LAC Foundation was established as a civil law body under German law, its Board of Governors has met regularly and received reports on its activities.\n\n\nStakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThe decision to establish the Foundation and negotiate an agreement to upgrade it to an international organisation has been in the public domain for some years. It has been mentioned in declarations by the heads of state and government at successive summits, posted on the EEAS\u2019s and other EU institutions\u2019 websites, and reported by the media in both regions. Civil society organisations in the two regions, some of which are actively involved in the partnership and have organised and/or taken part in preparatory events prior to the successive summits, have referred to the Foundation in their activities and have had their details entered in the Foundation\u2019s database of civil society organisations.\n\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\n\n\nAs a decision to sign the Agreement will not have a significant economic, environmental or social impact on the EU or its citizens, no impact assessment was deemed necessary. The Foundation\u2019s Board of Governors will monitor the specific impact(s) of the entry into force of the Agreement in its bi-annual meetings.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe signing of the Agreement will have no direct budgetary implications, as it does not oblige the EU or other signatories to make financial contributions to the Foundation. These will be voluntary. As host country granting privileges and immunities on the basis of a headquarters agreement, Germany will provide (at its own expense) appropriately furnished premises suitable for use by the Foundation, along with maintenance, utilities and security.\n\n\nThe Commission has made financial contributions to the Foundation since it was established under German civil law in 2011, most recently (through the Partnership Instrument) the sum of EUR\u00a03\u00a0million for the two years from October 2015. Some LAC and EU countries, including Germany as host country, have contributed financially on one or more occasions. Others are unable to contribute until the Foundation becomes an international organisation, so the signing and entry into force of the Agreement will help to improve its financial sustainability.\n\n\n2016/0216 (NLE)\n\n\n\n\nJoint Proposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing on behalf of the EU of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International
