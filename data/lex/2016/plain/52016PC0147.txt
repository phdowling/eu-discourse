The Agreement provides a legal framework covering issues from regular political dialogue to sectoral cooperation. It underlines the EU's determination to engage with the Republic of Korea and to take bilateral relations to a higher level.\n\n\nThe Agreement strengthens the cooperation across a wide spectrum of policy fields, including inter alia human rights, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism,  the fight against corruption and organised crime, trade, migration, environment, energy, climate change, transport, science and technology, employment and social affairs, education, agriculture,  development assistance, culture, etc.. \n\n\nAccording to Article 44 of the Agreement, a Joint Committee was established, composed of representatives of the members of the Council of the European Union and representatives of the European Commission, on the one hand, and representatives of the Republic of Korea, on the other hand. Consultations will be held in the Joint Committee to facilitate the implementation and to further the general aims of the Agreement, to maintain the overall coherence in the relations and to ensure the proper functioning of any other agreement between the Parties. \n\n\nIn order to assist the Joint Committee in the performance of its tasks and with a view to facilitating for expert level discussions on some key areas falling within the scope of application of the Agreement, it is suggested to establish two specialised working groups, designated as follows: (1) specialised working group on energy, environment, climate change; (2) specialised working group on counterterrorism. Additional specialised working groups may be established at a later stage, following agreement of the Parties. \n\n\nBoth sides have committed to an effective implementation of the Agreement. The aim of this proposal is therefore to establish the position to be adopted by the European Union within the Joint Committee set up under Article 44 of the Agreement in relation to (i) the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, and (ii) the establishment of specialised working groups and the adoption of their terms of reference. The position of the European Union shall be based on the draft Decisions of the Joint Committee, attached to this proposal.\n\n\n2016/0080 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the Union position to be adopted in the Joint Committee established by the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, in relation to the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, and the establishment of specialised working groups and the adoption of their terms of reference\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in particular its Articles 207, 212 and 218 (9),\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, (hereafter referred to as 'the Agreement') entered into force on 1 June 2014.\n\n\n(2)In order to contribute to the effective implementation of the Agreement, its institutional framework should be completed as soon as possible through the adoption by the Joint Committee of its own rules of procedure.\n\n\n(3)According to Article 44 of the Agreement a Joint Committee was established, in order to ensure, inter alia, the proper functioning and implementation of the Agreement.\n\n\n(4)In order to contribute to the effective implementation of the Agreement, the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee should be adopted.\n\n\n\n\n(5)The position of the Union within the Joint Committee as regards the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee should be based on the attached draft Decisions of the Joint Committee. \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n1.The position to be adopted by the European Union within the Joint Committee set up under Article 44 of the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, in relation to: \n\n\n\uf0b7the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, and\n\n\n\uf0b7the establishment of specialised working groups and the adoption of their terms of reference,\n\n\nshall be based on the draft Decisions of the Joint Committee, attached to this Decision.\n\n\n2.Minor changes to the draft Decisions may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Joint Committee without further decision of the Council. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 16.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 147 final\nANNEXES\nto the\nProposal for aCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Union position to be adopted in the Joint Committee established by the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part, in relation to the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, and the establishment of specialised working groups and the adoption of their terms of reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 1\n\n\nDECISION No 1/[2016] OF THE EU-REPUBLIC OF KOREA JOINT COMMITTEE\nof \u2026 \nadopting its rules of procedure\n\n\n\n\nTHE EU-REPUBLIC OF KOREA JOINT COMMITTEE, \n\n\nHaving regard to the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agreement\u2019), and in particular Article 44 thereof,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n1.The Agreement entered into force on 1 June 2014,\n\n\n2.In order to contribute to the effective implementation of the Agreement, the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee should be adopted.\n\n\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: \n\n\nSole Article\n\n\nThe rules of procedure of the Joint Committee, as set out in Annex A, are hereby adopted.\n\n\n\nDone at \u2026, \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the EU-Republic of Korea Joint\n\n\nCommittee\n\n\nThe Chair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX A \n\n\nRules of Procedure of the Joint Committee\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nComposition and Chair\n\n\n1.The Joint Committee, established in accordance with Article 44 of the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Korea, on the other part ('the Agreement'), shall perform its tasks as provided for in Article 44 of the Agreement.\n\n\n2.The Joint Committee shall be composed of representatives of both Parties at the appropriate level. \n\n\n3.The Joint Committee shall be chaired alternately by each of the Parties, for a period of one calendar year.
