"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 8.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 122 final\n2016/0067(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an agreement in the form of a Declaration on the expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe \"Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products\", known as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), was concluded by 29 WTO Member States at the Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996\n1\n. The ITA entered into force in the European Union in 1997\n2\n.Today, the ITA counts 82 participants, or half of WTO Members, and covers 97% of trade in this sector. \n\n\nThe ITA requires that each participant eliminates and binds customs duties at zero on a Most Favoured Nation basis for all information technology (IT) products covered. The ITA covers about 200 tariff lines, including computers, telephones, but also inputs, components and machinery for the production of IT goods. The duty free treatment given by the ITA participants has played an important role in the enormous development and expansion of trade that the IT sector has experienced over the close to 20 years of application of the ITA. Trade in the sector has quadrupled. However, during this time span technological progress has changed the IT sector beyond recognition, while the coverage of the ITA remained the same.\n\n\nThe above-mentioned ITA Ministerial Declaration establishes in paragraph 3 of the Annex that participants \u201cshall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council on Trade in Goods to review the product coverage specified in the Attachments, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products, and to consult on non-tariff barriers to trade in information technology products. Such consultations shall be without prejudice to rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement\u201d. \n\n\nIn May 2012, several countries proposed to expand the product coverage of the ITA. On 24 July 2015, the text of the \"Declaration on the Expansion of Trade on Information Technology Products\" was agreed, with a view to bind and eliminate customs duties on an additional list of 201 IT products. \n\n\nSubsequently, in accordance with paragraph 5 therein, the participants agreed on the staging commitments for each product listed in document G/MA/W/117. There are currently 25 participating members (or 53 counting EU MS) in the expansion of the ITA, which cover 90% of trade in the items on the list. Annual trade in these 201 products is valued at over USD 1.3 trillion per year, and accounts for approximately 10% of total global trade today.\n\n\nThe agreement in the form of a Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA (and the schedules containing the staging commitments of the participants) was adopted by the Ministers of the participant countries on 16 December 2015 (\"Ministerial Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products\"), during the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi. \n\n\nThe Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA will enter into force in the European Union once it is accepted. The objective of this proposal is the approval by the European Union of the agreement in the form of a Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS\n\n\nThe objective of the ITA expansion is to eliminate duties on IT goods not included in the original ITA. Therefore the ITA expansion covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy. The legal basis of this proposal is Article 207(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in conjunction with point (v) of Article 218(6)(a) thereof.\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. As a result, the principle of subsidiarity does not apply.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nBefore the start of the negotiations DG Enterprise conducted an SME survey on the expansion of the ITA. The survey was conducted via an established DG Enterprise SME network and its aim was to gauge the response of SMEs involved in production and/or sales of ICT products to the likely removal of tariffs on a series of products as a result of an expansion of the ITA. A questionnaire was submitted together with a semantic list of products. \n\n\nThe majority of companies replied that the elimination of customs duties on the ICT goods on the list would have an effect on the company activity. The majority also replied that lower import prices would mean increased profitability and/or allow the company to better compete in the EU market. Some companies also replied that they would be more competitive on their export market, but others thought that lower import prices for products similar to those produced by the company would increase domestic competition. \n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nDuring the negotiations the Commission kept in close touch with EU industry associations in the sectors covered, such as Digital Europe, the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) and individual EU-based companies. These associations provided the Commission with valuable information on which IT related products were priorities, and which ones sensitive for EU industry. Member States also regularly provided the Commission with this type of information, coming from national industry associations and individual companies. \n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\n\n\nAn economic assessment was made by an external company before the negotiations started. This assessment can be consulted at the following link \n\nhttp://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/april/tradoc_147791.pdf\n\n. The authors assessed the trade and economic impacts of extending the product coverage of the ITA based on a defined list of products proposed by the Commission. The estimation of changes in EU trade flows covered (EUR 55 billion more exports covered per year, and EUR 40 billion more imports) was well below the final outcome (see figures below). However, on the basis of these figures the consultants found that European exports and imports would both increase and that by lowering the price of these new ITA products and increasing consumption, extending the scope of the ITA product list will benefit EU companies and improve their possibility for doing business. They also found that extending the ITA to cover more products will benefit consumers of these products since they will face lower prices and a wider set of products to choose from. Combining all these benefits in one single number, they found that there is a welfare gain for the EU economy of around EUR 45 million from eliminating tariffs on the extended list of products. Consumer welfare would increase by EUR 520 million (consumer surplus). As covered exports and imports ended up significantly higher than the estimations, economic effects can also be expected to be larger in reality. \n\n\nWith the final results of the negotiations now known, the Commission has made its own in-house assessment, of which the following three elements are the most important findings: \n\n\n\uf0b7EUR 74-150 billion of EU exports are covered by the agreement. This is admittedly a wide range, but this is on account of ex-outs which do not allow assessing with certainty how much of the affected tariff lines will actually be liberalized.\n\n\n\uf0b7EU exporters will save EUR 0.8-2.1 billion in duty payments upon their extra EU exports\n\n\n\uf0b7As the products under negotiation are crucial intermediates in many EU exports significant value chain effects can be expected. A general equilibrium simulation points to overall exports of goods that may increase by about 0.7% to 1.4% of their baseline value. In terms of current extra EU exports of goods, this amounts to EUR 12-24\u00a0billion.\n\n\nThe Commission will also issue its findings in a short report to the Council, which will be presented independently from the memorandum.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nIn total the European Union is expected to lose EUR 1.5 billion in duties on IT goods. However, this loss will be spread out over a total of 7 years. Most low duties will be eliminated at entry into force, representing 25% of duty value. After 3 years more than 60% of duty will have been phased out, while 30% will only be eliminated after 7 years.\n\n\n2016/0067 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an agreement in the form of a Declaration on the expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with point (v) of Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n3\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products adopted in Singapore on 13 December of 1996 (commonly described as Information Technology Agreement (\"ITA\")) specifies, in paragraph 3 of its annex, that Participants shall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council on Trade in Goods of the WTO to review the product coverage, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the Harmonized System nomenclature.\n\n\n(2)The Council authorised the Commission on 8 July 2009 to negotiate a review of the ITA, including the expansion of its product coverage to reflect technological developments and convergence.\u00a0\n\n\n(3)Negotiations on the expansion of the ITA have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established under Article 207(3) of the Treaty.\n\n\n\n\n(4)On 28 July 2015, the participants in the negotiations issued a Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (the \"Declaration on the expansion of the ITA\"), which records the results of the negotiations.\n\n\n(5)During the 10th WTO Ministerial conference held in Nairobi on 15-18 December 2015, the participants in the negotiations issued a Ministerial Declaration on the expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products of 16 December 2015 (WT/MIN 15/25) (the \"Ministerial Declaration\") which endorses and opens for acceptance the Declaration on the ITA expansion, in accordance with paragraph 9 thereof. The Ministerial Declaration also records the agreement of the participants in the negotiations with the draft schedules submitted by each of them pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Declaration on the expansion of the ITA, which is contained in WTO document G/MA/W/117. \n\n\n(6)The agreement in the form of a Declaration on the expansion of the ITA should be approved on behalf of the Union, together with the EU's schedule and the schedules submitted by other participants in the negotiations and which are contained in the WTO document G/MA/W/117.\n\n\n(7)In accordance with the Declaration on the expansion of the ITA, the Union should submit to the WTO the necessary modifications to its schedule to the GATT 1994, as set out in the EU-schedule CLXXIII (G/MA/TAR/RS/357/corr.1),\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products of 28 July 2015 (\"Declaration on the expansion of the ITA\"), endorsed and opened for acceptance by the Ministerial declaration of 16 December 2015, together with the schedules submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the first declaration and contained in the WTO document G/MA/W/117, are hereby approved on behalf of the European Union.\n\n\nThe text of the Declaration on the expansion of the ITA, including its Attachments, is attached to this decision. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe Commission is hereby authorized to submit to the World Trade Organisation the necessary modifications to the European Union's Schedule annexed to the GATT 1994 as set out in the EU-schedule CLXXIII (G/MA/TAR/RS/357/corr.1). \n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instrument of acceptance, as specified in paragraph 9 of the Declaration on the expansion of the ITA, in order to express the consent of the Union to be bound by that declaration.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThe Declaration on the expansion of the ITA shall not be construed as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly invoked in courts of the European Union or a Member State.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nThis Decision enters into force on the day of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR PROPOSALS HAVING A BUDGETARY IMPACT EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO THE REVENUE SIDE\n\n\n\n\n1.NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an agreement in the form of a Declaration on the expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA)\n\n\n2.BUDGET LINES:\n\n\nChapter: Chapter 12 \u2013 Customs\u00a0duties and other duties\n\n\n3.FINANCIAL IMPACT \n\n\n\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial implications\n\n\n\u2611\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue \u2013 the effect is as follows:\n\n\n(\u20ac million to one decimal place)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget line\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n12 month period, starting 01/07/2016\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1 2 0 \n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on own resources\n\n\n\n\n437,7\n\n\n\n\n218,9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation following action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1 2 0 \n\n\n\n\n\n302,9\n\n\n\n\n168,0\n\n\n\n\n168,0\n\n\n\n\n112,7\n\n\n\n\n57,4\n\n\n\n\n\n4.ANTI-FRAUD\u00a0MEASURES\n\n\nGeneral anti-fraud measures associated with EU customs administration will apply.\n\n\n5.OTHER REMARKS\n\n\nThe total amount of duty lost is estimated at \u20ac1.5 billion, or \u20ac1.125 billion without the 25% collection cost. This will be spread out over a total of 7 years (8 cuts). The duty on the majority of lines will be eliminated as part of the first cut on 1 July. The loss over the first calendar year (2016) should be cut in two as it will apply only from 1 July. The same applies for the following years, as 1 July is the implementation date rather than 1 January. On the remaining lines linear cuts will be made over 3 years (4 cuts), with duty on some sensitive lines eliminated after 5 or 7 years, in 6 or 8 equivalent cuts.\n\n\nHowever, the exact schedule of cuts will be included only in the Commission regulation that will implement the Council decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nWT/MIN (96)/16\n\n\n\n(2)\nCouncil Decision 97/359/EC of 24 March 1997 concerning the elimination of duties on information technology products (OJ L 155, 12.6.1997, p. 1).\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(4)\nRegarding traditional own resources (agricultural duties, sugar levies, customs duties) the amounts indicated must be net amounts, i.e. gross amounts after deduction of 25 % of collection costs\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 8.3.2016\nCOM(2016) 122 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of an agreement in the form of a Declaration on the expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\n\n\nDECLARATION ON THE EXPANSION OF TRADE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS\n\n\nThe following Members of the World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") which have agreed on the expansion of world trade in information technology products (\"parties\").\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbania\n\n\n\n\nMalaysia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\n\nMontenegro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosta Rica\n\n\n\n\nPhilippines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuatemala\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Kong, China \n\n\nIceland\n\n\n\n\nSeparate Customs Territory of Taiwan,\n\n\nPenghu, Kinmen and Matsu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael \n\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n\nThailand \n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclare as follows: \n\n\n1.Each party shall bind and eliminate customs duties and other duties and charges of any kind, within the meaning of Article II:1(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, as set forth below, with respect to the following: \n\n\n(a)all products classified with Harmonized System (\"HS\") 2007 sub-headings listed in Attachment A to this Declaration; and \n\n\n(b)all products specified in Attachment B to this Declaration, whether or not they are included in Attachment A. \n\n\nStaging\n\n\n2.The parties shall apply three year staging in four equal annual reductions of customs duties, beginning in 2016 and concluding in 2019, as standard staging, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, recognizing that extended staging of reductions may be necessary in limited circumstances. The reduced rate should in each stage be rounded off to the first decimal. Each party shall incorporate commitments on staging for each product into its Schedule of Concessions to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (\"Schedule of Concessions\"). \n\n\nImplementation\n\n\n3.Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and subject to the completion of domestic procedural requirements, each party shall eliminate all customs duties and other duties and charges of any kind on products listed in the Attachments as follows: \n\n\n(a)elimination of customs duties in equal steps, the first such rate reduction effective no later than 1 July 2016, the second such rate reduction no later than 1\u00a0July\u00a02017, the third such rate reduction no later than 1 July 2018, and the elimination of customs duties shall be completed effective no later than 1\u00a0July\u00a02019; and \n\n\n(b)elimination of such other duties and charges of any kind, within the meaning of Article\u00a0II:1(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 1994, shall be completed by 1 July 2016. \n\n\nAccelerated implementation\n\n\n4.The parties encourage autonomous immediate elimination of customs duties or accelerated implementation prior to the dates set out in paragraph 3 above, for instance for products with relatively low customs duties. \n\n\nScheduling timeframe\n\n\n5.As early as possible, and no later than 30 October 2015, each party shall provide all other parties with a draft schedule containing (a) the details concerning how the appropriate duty treatment shall be provided in its Schedule of Concessions and (b) a list of detailed HS subheadings involved for products specified in Attachment B, which shall also include a headnote stating that such products shall be provided duty-free treatment wherever they are classified in the HS. Each draft schedule shall be reviewed and approved by the parties on a consensus basis taking into account the concerns expressed by the parties in the negotiations. This review process should be completed no later than 4 December 2015. \n\n\n6.After this review process has been completed for any such draft schedule of a party, that party shall submit its approved schedule, subject to the completion of domestic procedural requirements, as a modification to its Schedule of Concessions, in accordance with the Decision of 26 March 1980 on Procedures for Modification and Rectification of Schedules of Tariff Concessions (BISD 27S/25). \n\n\n\n\n7.Each party shall implement paragraphs 3 and 6 of this Declaration once the parties review and approve on a consensus basis draft schedules that represent approximately 90 per cent of world trade\n2\n in the products covered by this Declaration. \n\n\nFormat of draft schedules of concessions \n\n\n8.In order to implement its binding and elimination of customs duties and other duties and charges of any kind on products listed in the Attachments, each party\u2019s modifications to its Schedule of Concessions shall: \n\n\n(a)in the case of products classified with HS 2007 subheadings listed in Attachment A, create, where appropriate, sub-divisions in its Schedule of Concessions at the national tariff line level; and \n\n\n(b)in the case of the products specified in Attachment B, attach an annex to its Schedule of Concessions including all products in Attachment B, which is to specify the detailed tariff classification for those products at either the national tariff line level or the HS 6-digit level. \n\n\nAcceptance \n\n\n9.The Declaration shall be open for acceptance by all WTO Members. Acceptance shall be notified in writing to the WTO Director-General who shall communicate it to all parties. \n\n\nNon-tariff barriers \n\n\n10.The parties agree to intensify consultations concerning non-tariff barriers in the information technology sector. To this effect, the parties support the possible development of an upgraded work programme on non-tariff barriers. \n\n\nFinal considerations \n\n\n11.Parties shall meet periodically, and at least one year prior to regular amendments to the Harmonized System nomenclature by the World Customs Organization, and no later than January\u00a02018, to review the product coverage specified in the Attachments and consider whether, in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be updated to incorporate additional products. \n\n\n12.The parties recognize that the results of these negotiations involve concessions that should be taken into account in ongoing multilateral non-agricultural market access negotiations within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda. \n\n\nAttachments to this Declaration: \n\n\n\uf0b7Attachment A lists the HS 2007 subheadings or parts thereof to be covered by this Declaration. \n\n\n\uf0b7Attachment B lists specific products to be covered by this Declaration wherever they are classified in the HS 2007. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nATTACHMENT
