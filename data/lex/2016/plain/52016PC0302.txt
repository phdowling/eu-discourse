The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe provisions of the Agreement supersede or complement the existing provisions in ten bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe Agreement will serve a fundamental objective of the external aviation policy of the Union by bringing existing bilateral air services agreements in line with Union law.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArt. 100(2), 218(5) TFEU\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe proposal is entirely based on the \u201chorizontal authorisation\u201d granted by the Council taking into account the issues covered by Union law and bilateral air services agreements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe Agreement will amend or complement provisions in bilateral air services agreements only to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Union law.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe Agreement between the Union and the Republic of the Philippines is the most efficient instrument to bring all existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of the Philippines into conformity with Union law.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nIn line with Article 218(4) TFEU, the Commission has conducted the negotiations in consultation with a special committee. Industry has equally been consulted during the negotiations. Comments made in this process have been taken into account. The Member States concerned verified the accuracy of the references to the bilateral air services agreements. Industry underlined the importance of a sound legal basis for their commercial operations.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe proposal provides for simplification of legislation. The relevant provisions of bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of the Philippines will be superseded or complemented by provisions in one single agreement.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nPending its entry into force, the Agreement shall be applied provisionally from the first day of the month following the date on which the parties have notified each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose.\n\n\n\nExplanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\nDetailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nInternational aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, the annexes to such agreements and other related bilateral or multilateral arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, traditional designation clauses in Member States\u2019 bilateral air services agreements infringe Union law. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against EU air carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State.\n\n\nThere are further issues, such as aviation fuel taxation, or obligatory commercial agreements between airlines where compliance with Union law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries.\n\n\nIn accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the \u201dhorizontal authorisation\u201d, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Republic of the Philippines that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of the Philippines. Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union.\n\n\nThe negotiations on the Agreement having been successfully concluded, it should be signed on behalf of the European Union. A decision to this effect is proposed herewith.\n\n\nPending its entry into force, it is also proposed to have the Agreement provisionally applied from the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose. \n\n\n\n2016/0155 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on certain aspects of air services\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)By its Decision of 5 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with an agreement at Union level.\n\n\n(2)Accordingly, on behalf of the Union, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on certain aspects of air services (the Agreement). The negotiations were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Agreement on 10 February 2016.\n\n\n(3)The objective of the Agreement is to bring bilateral air services agreements between ten Member States and the Republic of the Philippines in line with Union law.\n\n\n(4)Therefore, the Agreement should be signed on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n\n\n(5)In order to bring about the benefits of the Agreement as soon as possible, it should be applied provisionally.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\n\nThe signing of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on certain aspects of air services (the Agreement) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of the said Agreement.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2 \n\n\nThe Council Secretariat General shall establish the instrument of full powers to sign the Agreement, subject to its conclusion, for the person(s) indicated by the negotiator of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nPending its entry into force, the Agreement shall be applied provisionally from the first day of the month following the date on which the parties have notified each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose. \n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the Union, to give the notification provided for in Article 8(2) of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 27.5.2016\nCOM(2016) 302 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on certain aspects of air services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nto the\n\n\nProposal for a Council Decision\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on certain aspects of air services\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n\n\nof the one part, and \n\n\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES\n\n\n\n(hereinafter referred to as The Philippines)\n\n\n\nof the other part\n\n\n\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\")\n\n\n\nNOTING that bilateral air service agreements have been concluded between some Member States of the European Union and The Philippines containing provisions contrary to the law of the European Union,\n\n\n\nNOTING that the European Union has exclusive competence with respect to several aspects that may be included in bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Union and third countries,\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTING that under European Union law air carriers of Member States of the European Union established in a Member State of the European Union have the right to non-discriminatory access to air routes between the Member States of the European Union and third countries,\n\n\n\nHAVING REGARD to the agreements between the European Union and certain third countries providing for the possibility for the nationals of such third countries to acquire ownership in air carriers licensed in accordance with the law of the European Union,\n\n\n\nRECOGNISING that certain provisions of the bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Union and The Philippines, which are contrary to European Union law, must be brought into conformity with it in order to establish a sound legal basis for air services between the European Union and The Philippines and to preserve the continuity of such air services,\n\n\n\nNOTING that under European Union law air carriers may not, in principle, conclude agreements which may affect trade between Member States of the European Union and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition,\n\n\n\nRECOGNISING that provisions in bilateral air service agreements concluded between Member States of the European Union and The Philippines, which i) require or favour the adoption of agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes; or ii) reinforce the effects of any such agreement, decision or concerted practice; or iii) delegate to air carriers or other private economic operators the responsibility for taking measures that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes may render ineffective the competition rules applicable to undertakings,\n\n\n\nNOTING that it is not the purpose of the European Union, as part of this Agreement, to increase the total volume of air traffic between the European Union and The Philippines, to affect the balance between air carriers of Member States of the European Union and air carriers of The Philippines or to negotiate amendments to the provisions of existing bilateral air service agreements concerning traffic rights.\n\n\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: \n\n\n\nARTICLE 1\n\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Member

\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall supersede the corresponding provisions in the articles listed in Annex 2 (a) and (b) respectively, in relation to the designation of an air carrier by a Member State, its authorisation and permissions granted by The Philippines and the refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of the authorisations or permissions of the air carrier, respectively. \n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On receipt of a designation by a Member State, The Philippines shall grant the appropriate authorisations and permissions with minimum procedural delay, provided that:\n\n\n\ni.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the air carrier is established, under the EU Treaties, in the territory of the designating Member State and has a valid Operating Licence in accordance with European Union law; and\n\n\n\nii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effective regulatory control of the air carrier is exercised and maintained by the Member State responsible for issuing its Air Operator\u2019s Certificate and the relevant aeronautical authority is clearly identified in the designation; and\n\n\n\niii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the air carrier is owned, directly
