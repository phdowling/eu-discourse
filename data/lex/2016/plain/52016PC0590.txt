Market structures have evolved, with monopolistic market power becoming increasingly limited, and at the same time connectivity has become a widely pervasive feature of economic life. Consumers and businesses are increasingly relying on data and internet access services instead of telephony and other traditional communication services. This evolution has brought formerly unknown types of market players to compete with traditional telecom operators (e.g. so called over-the-top -players (OTTs): service providers offering a wide variety of applications and services, including communications services, over the internet). At the same time, it has also increased the demand for high-quality fixed and wireless connectivity with the rise in the number and popularity of online content services, such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine communication (M2M) etc. Electronic communications networks have evolved as well. The main changes include: (i) the ongoing transition to an all-IP environment, (ii) the possibilities provided by new and enhanced underlying network infrastructures that support the practically unlimited transmission capacity of fibre optical networks, (iii) the convergence of fixed and mobile networks towards seamless service offers to the end-users regardless of location or device used and (iv) the development of innovative technical network management approaches, in particular Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). These usage and operational changes expose the current rules to new challenges that are likely to increase in importance in the medium and long term, and therefore must be factored into a review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. \n\n\nThis\u00a0review needs to be seen in light of the Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy for Europe\n1\n. The DSM strategy recognised the importance of the paradigm shifts that the digital sector is undergoing and stated that individuals and businesses should be able to seamlessly access and conduct online activities under conditions of fair competition. Furthermore, it announced that \u2018the Commission will present proposals in 2016 for an ambitious overhaul of the regulatory framework focusing on (i) a consistent single market approach to spectrum policy and management (ii) delivering the conditions for a true single market by tackling regulatory fragmentation to allow economies of scale for efficient network operators and service providers and effective protection of consumers, (iii) ensuring a level playing field for  market players and consistent application of the rules, (iv) incentivising investment in high-speed broadband networks (including a review of the Universal Service Directive) and (v) a more effective regulatory institutional framework.\u2019\n\n\nPursuant to this commitment and in line with \u2018Better Regulation\u2019 requirements\n2\n, the Commission carried out an ex post evaluation. It assessed the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added-value of the Union regulatory framework, and pinpointed areas where there is potential for simplification, without undermining the objectives of the framework.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nAs connectivity services provided over electronic communications networks constitute the backbone for digital products and services, this proposal presents a high degree of synergy with the other initiatives included in the DSM strategy.\n\n\nThe proposal also complements existing sector-specific regulation. In particular, the proposal is fully coherent with Directive 2014/61/EU (Broadband Cost Reduction Directive) with which it provides a comprehensive set of rules facilitating the roll-out of broadband infrastructures. Alongside the recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 ensuring an open internet and abolishing roaming surcharges, the current proposal  ensures a high level of end-user protection in other areas requiring sector-specific rules. The proposed rules on spectrum management build on current instruments in this area, most notably the Radio Spectrum Decision No 676/2002/EC, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group Decision 2002/622/EC and Decision 243/2012/EU establishing a multiannual radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP). Finally, it also paves the way for the review of Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications announced as part of the DSM strategy.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nWhile this proposal addresses regulatory issues arising from the specificities of the electronic communications sector as a network industry, it builds on and complements existing EU law in several areas. In the domain of market regulation, the proposals remain based on the principles of EU Competition Law, like the existing regulatory framework. It further sets out measures, such as mapping of network deployments, that also provide useful information for State aid purposes and thereby enhances the coherence of the two policies.\n\n\nOn end-user protection, the proposed rules complement horizontal consumer protection law by addressing the specificities of the sector on the one hand, while streamlining the current sector-specific rules in areas where the former has evolved since the last review in 2009 on the other. In this way, the proposal avoids overlaps in areas where horizontal rules alone can ensure an adequate level of protection for end-users. \n\n\nCohesion policy and European structural and investment funds are an important tool to fill the connectivity gaps in market failure areas and should be allocated in a way that allows the resources available to be maximised. The proposal contributes to this objective by providing appropriate conditions for private investments so that public funds can be focused where they are most needed.  \n\n\nThe proposal maintains the current complementarity between electronic communications and audiovisual media services policy by continuing to ensure that the framework remains without prejudice to measures taken at Union or national level, in accordance with EU law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular relating to content regulation and audiovisual policy. The distinction between the regulation of broadcasting signal transmission and the regulation of content does not prevent the links between them from being considered, in particular in order to guarantee media pluralism, cultural diversity and consumer protection.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with international law obligations\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with existing international law obligations, including GATS and the GATS Annex on Telecommunications and the GATS Reference Paper.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as it aims to achieve the internal market for electronic communications and ensure its functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nAs the proposal constitutes a review of the existing framework, the subsidiarity analysis below focuses on: the new objective of ubiquitous and unconstrained connectivity, the harmonisation of the competences of national regulatory authorities (NRAs), the harmonisation of spectrum-related issues and revised rules on services.\n\n\nUbiquitous and unconstrained connectivity\n\n\nWithout ubiquitous, very high capacity connectivity the single market cannot tap into a significant part of its human capital. This impairs both territorial cohesion and the ability of businesses to produce efficiently and to provide innovative and competitive services. Connectivity can play an essential socioeconomic role in preventing isolation and depopulation and in linking peripheral with central regions of the EU The situation of Member States with regard to connectivity differs quite significantly. There are very important discrepancies, which may not be explained solely by the different landscape, population, GDP or purchasing power, but are the result of different policy choices made today and in the past. Absence of EU action to pursue ubiquitous and unconstrained connectivity as a separate objective of the framework would only perpetuate this patchwork with negative effects on the single market and consumer interests.\u00a0\n\n\nThe harmonisation of NRAs competences\n\n\n The institutional set-up allows for a high degree of flexibility for national regulatory authorities and Member States which allows for regulation to be tailored to meet specific national or local circumstances. However, this system carries significant weakness in areas where consistency is essential or would better serve the common European interest. Some areas of regulation require a more coordinated, or harmonised, approach at EU level. This can be achieved, inter alia, by ensuring that the tasks of the NRAs, which then participate in the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), as the pillars of the institutional set-up, are harmonised. The harmonisation of NRA tasks should not result in a reduction of their political independence, but on the contrary to an extension of the protection against instructions to all new areas of competence.\n\n\nHarmonisation of spectrum related issues\n\n\nSpectrum, like other resources such as numbers and to some extent land, is a scarce resource that belongs to the Member States, and whose management and assignment needs to consider national specificities and needs. At the same time, there is a need for a more convergent and consistent EU regulation for market entry to eliminate the obstacles that appear due to undue divergent conditions for the assignment of individual rights of use for spectrum, numbers or land. Consistent EU level rules are necessary to (i) enable providers to expand their services to other Member States; (ii) create a sufficient market scale effect allowing front running Member States to benefit from it ; (iii) give timely access to state of the art wireless capacities and services for EU citizens and businesses to benefit from the digital environment, innovative services and applications and be able to commercially develop and underpin the benefits of the digital economy that is constantly evolving towards the \"mobile\" economy, where spectrum policy has an important role; (iv) allow countries which are lagging behind to catch up and participate in the DSM, thereby also allowing more advanced Member States to further increase citizens' and commercial exchanges within their borders; and, (v) treat all spectrum users in a coherent way throughout the Union. Lastly, in order for the EU to lead the rest of the world on new and enhanced services, such as 5G, equipment manufacturers and providers of communications services need sufficient scale. This means not only technical harmonisation, but most importantly an internal market developing in a broadly aligned fashion, for services and devices to benefit from stable and harmonised rules.\n\n\nServices\n\n\nIn services, competition between local providers of electronic communications services that bundle network access with services and global providers of services over the top of the networks reinforces the right of the EU to act to ensure a level playing field. Action is also needed at EU level to reduce fragmentation of end-user protection rules, which raises administrative costs for cross-border service providers and hinders development of innovative services, while resulting in an uneven and sub-optimal level of consumer protection across the Union.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union because it will not go beyond what is necessary for the achievement of the objectives. It makes targeted adjustments to the current framework in order to respond to the market and technology changes and in particular to the need to address at Union level the need for availability and widespread take-up of very high capacity networks as a basis for a fully functioning digital single market.\n\n\nRegarding access regulation, the national regulatory authorities remain competent in ensuring that market failures are addressed with appropriate remedies and that regulation contributes to the common policy objectives. The proposed rules provide regulators with additional tools to address the current connectivity challenge, but the way they are to be used depends on national circumstances which are for national regulators to assess. The reasons for targeted strengthening of regulatory oversight mainly through an enhanced role of BEREC is justified on the basis of evidence of a lack of consistency in the implementation of regulation, which is key for promoting the internal market.\n\n\nEqually, spectrum is a shared competence between the Commission and Member States. The proposed rules provide an overall framework for coherent spectrum management across the EU while Member States have the necessary discretion to implement and apply the rules corresponding to national circumstances. Due to the important cross-border implications of spectrum management and its wider impact on connectivity in the internal market certain co-ordination procedures at the Union level are necessary.\n\n\nThe end-user protection rules introduce full harmonisation with targeted exceptions (e.g. regarding maximum contract duration), but harmonisation is limited to the areas covered by the proposal.\n\n\nMoreover, the choice of the legal form of a Directive will leave as a result certain discretion to Member States to adapt the implementation to their national law.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe proposal for a European Electronic Communications Code consists of a horizontal recasting\n3\n of the four existing Directives (Framework, Authorisation, Access and Universal Service), bringing them all under a single Directive.\u00a0Each of the Directives contains measures applicable to electronic communications networks and to electronic communications service providers. The review offers an occasion to simplify the current structure, with a view to reinforcing its coherence and accessibility, consistently with the regulatory fitness objective. It offers also the possibility to adapt the structure to the new market reality, where the provision of communications services is no longer necessarily bundled to the provision of a network.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX\u00a0POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal and assessing the regulatory fitness of the current rules concludes that the regulatory framework for electronic communications has broadly achieved its general objective of ensuring a competitive sector providing significant end-user benefits. Nevertheless, while its main specific objectives \u2014 promoting competition, developing the internal market, and promoting end-user interest \u2014 remain relevant, a review of the regulatory framework seems necessary in order to address the growing need for increased connectivity of the Digital Single Market and to streamline provisions taking into account market and technological developments.\n\n\nMore specifically, regarding the specific evaluation criteria, the findings can be summarised as follows: \n\n\nRelevance - Generally speaking, the evaluation has shown that the specific objectives of the framework \u2014 promoting competition, realising the single market and protecting consumer interests \u2014 remain as valid as ever, with an increased relevance for the single market objective. Effective and sustainable competition drives efficient investment and fuels the development of the internal market. It ultimately serves the interests of end-users, by inducing innovation and providing maximum benefit in terms of choice, price and quality.\n\n\nAt the same time, connectivity has emerged as the underlying driving force for the digital society and economy, underpinned by technological changes and evolving consumer and market demands \u2013 it is key to the political commitment of the Juncker Commission to deliver the Digital Single Market. It is therefore necessary to consider adjusting the current policy objectives and regulatory tools to further support the deployment of infrastructure and widespread take-up of corresponding connectivity services in line with future needs.\n\n\nMost regulatory areas remain as relevant as in 2009, if not more so \u2014 in particular spectrum management, given the role of spectrum as an essential but scarce input for the deployment of current and next-generation mobile and fixed wireless networks, along with access regulation as a means of addressing the enduring entry barriers in the networks. For instance, while the relevance of certain specific components of the universal service rules is being called into question by market developments, the concept of a safety net ensuring that all citizens are included in a fully developed digital society is gaining even greater importance in a digital single market. Similarly, while specific provisions under the end-user protection objective might have to be adjusted in view of technological, market or legislative changes, the basic end-user protection needs to which the provisions respond remain relevant and their specific objectives remain central.\n\n\nEffectiveness - It is widely recognised that the regulatory framework has been effective in delivering a competitive sector overall. This, in turn, has generated significant end-user benefits, such as widely available (basic) broadband, a significant decrease in prices, and increased choice.  \n\n\nAccess and spectrum regulation in particular, but also market entry provisions, have contributed to higher levels of competition. Nevertheless, access regulation has delivered competition more at service level than at network level, and while investments in very high capacity networks have advanced, they have not taken place across all Member States at the pace envisaged by the public policy agendas and corresponding to expected future needs. Importantly, although the release of a significant amount of spectrum for wireless broadband is a notable achievement, progress in spectrum management did not meet the expectations of the last review, resulting in a delayed and fragmented 4G network roll-out and take-up. \n\n\nEfforts to achieve the Single Market objective have reached rather modest results. Regulatory consistency has been achieved only to a limited extent, affecting the operations of cross-border providers and reducing predictability for all operators and their investors. The current framework harmonises very few competences assigned to national regulatory authorities responsible for ex ante market regulation and allows Member States to assign tasks under the framework to other authorities which do not meet the same independence requirements. The result is a patchwork since, other than ex ante market regulation, there is no other competence for which all 28 national regulatory authorities that are members of BEREC are also competent. \n\n\nMore importantly, the cooperation and consistency tools available have led to a situation where the best regulatory solutions have not always been followed, which has had an impact on end-user outcomes. EU-level consistency checks, through the current governance structure, contribute to the predictability of access regulation throughout the EU; however their influence is significantly restricted as regards draft regulatory remedies. Similarly, the lack of consistency in spectrum management and the absence of an institutional set-up for the coordination of spectrum assignments has had negative consequences for end-users such as the delayed 4G deployment in most parts of the EU. \n\n\nThe achievements of the framework in protecting end-users and in ensuring a safety net (universal service) are significant \u2014 albeit progress in consumer satisfaction is relatively slow. It is also clear that not all sector-specific end-user protection provisions are still fit for purpose in the context of technological, market and wider legislative developments. \n\n\nEfficiency - While a precise cost calculation has not been possible, the evaluation has shown that the benefits of the framework \u2014 for most operators, end-users and society as a whole - greatly outweigh the costs resulting from its implementation. However, while a certain level of complexity might be necessary in order to ensure well calibrated intervention (e.g. appropriate access regulation), several areas have been identified where the administrative burden could be reduced without compromising \u2013 in some cases even improving - the effectiveness of the provisions. Examples are longer ex ante market regulation cycles, simplified procedures for imposing remedies in termination markets, streamlining certain overlapping consumer protection provisions. \n\n\nEU added value - The regulatory framework has been instrumental in delivering competition on the single market, that, to an extent, would not have been possible or likely at national level. It has levelled up national regulatory practice in the sector, promoting - with different degrees of success for specific regulation areas -\u2018best in class\u2019 models across the European Union. EU action has also contributed to a more comprehensive, if not homogeneous, end-user protection than would otherwise be the case.  \n\n\nCoherence \u2013 Overall, the various instruments making up the regulatory framework for electronic communications have reinforced each other in the pursuit of their objectives. Two issues however merit specific attention in the review process: the coherence between (i)  regulation aimed at incentivising competitive network roll-out and (ii) the EU financing and state aid rules in the sector, as well as the potential overlaps between certain sector-specific provisions and horizontal consumer interest legislation.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nA dedicated 12-week open public consultation was launched on 11 September 2015 that gathered inputs for the evaluation process in order to assess the current rules and to seek views on possible adaptations to the framework in light of market and technological developments. It covered a general evaluation of the current framework as well as a more detailed evaluation and review of the specific elements of the framework: (i) network access regulation, (ii) spectrum management and wireless connectivity, (iii) sector-specific regulation for electronic communications services, (iv) universal service rules and (v) institutional set-up and governance.\n\n\nThe consultation was both broad and detailed, eliciting extensive inputs from consumers, providers of electronic communications networks and services, national and EU operator associations, civil society organisations, broadcasters, technology providers, internet and online service providers, undertakings relying on connectivity and wider digital economy players, national authorities at all levels, national regulators and other interested stakeholders. Inputs provided include those from stakeholders affected by the policy, those who have to implement it and those with a stated interest in the policy. The consultation attracted 244 online replies from stakeholders in all Member States as well as from outside the Union. The consultation was complemented with a public hearing on 11 November 2015, halfway through the public consultation.\n\n\nIn addition to the public consultation BEREC provided input to the evaluation and the review process and published its opinion in December 2015\n4\n. The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) had also provided its opinion on the DSM and the Framework Review\n5\n.\n\n\nThe following trends emerged from the consultation process:\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Connectivity is broadly recognised as the underlying driving force for the digital society and economy, underpinned by technological changes and evolving consumer and market demands.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Good connectivity is perceived as a necessary condition to achieve the Digital Single Market. Many respondents pointed to the need for policy measures and possible adjustments to current policy and regulatory tools to support the deployment of infrastructure in line with future needs.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0A number of inputs asserted that the current regulatory framework does not sufficiently advance the internal market. There is a general perception that the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted to current market dynamics. Many respondents however acknowledged the achievements ushered in by the liberalisation of the telecom markets, in particular in terms of end-user benefits and competition within most national markets.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0On spectrum, the importance of wireless connectivity and wireless broadband are acknowledged. In general, industry is supportive of a more coordinated approach and seeks additional certainty for investments and possibilities to develop throughout the EU new wireless and mobile communications including 5G. A more flexible access to and use of spectrum was identified as increasingly important.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Member States\u2019 authorities generally underline the achievements in the field of technical harmonisation, and the need for additional coordination to be bottom-up and voluntary; some of them call for a better balance between harmonisation and flexibility. There is general recognition of the importance of more flexible access and use of spectrum in the future.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0The administrations of several Member States see the need for updating the telecoms rules, for reasons varying from the need to promote investment in next-generation infrastructures to the need to respond to technological and market changes. There are also calls for greater flexibility and simplification of those rules.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Whereas traditional telecom companies consider that short-term economic gains have been preferred to long-term investment and innovation, alternative operators, BEREC, and consumer organisations consider that the framework has largely delivered on its current objectives.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Telecom users are generally in favour of the current access regulation, while some consider that the emphasis should be put on service competition rather than on the underlying infrastructure, and that the sharing of infrastructure should be emphasised.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0The vast majority of respondents consider that the review should be the opportunity to reconsider the universal service regime completely. The administrations of the Member States see the need to maintain universal service, with flexibility at Member State level on funding and application to broadband. BEREC supports maintaining the current range of universal service obligation instruments.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0While administrations of several Member States, the regulatory community and consumer organisations still see a need for a sector-specific end-user protection based on high-level minimum harmonisation, the telecom sector calls for more reliance on horizontal legislation and full harmonisation, especially for services. The telecom sector in general but also some administrations argue that the same rules should apply to similar services while other administrations, so-called \u2018over-the-top\u2019 players, software and equipment vendors, cable operators and\u00a0 some broadcasters are of the view that the concept of electronic communications services as currently defined has proven robust.\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0While the continuing role of national regulatory authorities and spectrum management authorities is widely acknowledged, a large group of respondents highlights that the institutional set-up at EU level should be revised to improve legal certainty and accountability.\n\n\nAs part of the evaluation process, the Commission has also contracted a number of studies. Implementation of these studies encompassed public workshops that allowed stakeholders to comment and provide feedback to the ongoing evaluation work: \n\n\non 6 April 2016 a public workshop was held to validate the interim findings of a study SMART 2015/002 conducted by WIK, IDATE and Deloitte on \u2018regulatory, in particular access, regimes for network investments models in Europe\u2019, and \n\n\non 2 May 2016, a public workshop was held to validate the interim findings of study SMART 2015/003 conducted by WIK, CRIDS and Cullen on \u2018Substantive issues for review in the areas of market entry, management of scarce resources and general end-user issues\u2019. \n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission relied on the following external expert advice:\n\n\nPolicy recommendations from other EU institutions, in particular the European Parliament\n6\n and the European Council\n7\n.\n\n\nThree dedicated review studies:\n\n\n\u2018Support for the preparation of the impact assessment accompanying the review of the regulatory framework for e-communications\u2019 (SMART 2015/0005),\n\n\n\u2018Regulatory, in particular access, regimes for network investment models in Europe\u2019 (SMART 2015/0002), \n\n\n\u2018Substantive issues for review in the areas of market entry, management of scarce resources and general consumer issues\u2019 (SMART 2015/0003). \n\n\n\uf0b7In addition, a number of other studies have provided input to the review processs. These studies are listed in section 6.1.4 of the impact assessment. \n\n\n\n\nA high-level expert panel conducted in the framework of study SMART 2015/0005\n8\n.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe executive summary of the impact assessment and the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board can be found on the website of the Commission: \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/impact/ia_carried_out/cia_2016_en.htm\n\n.\n\n\nA number of options, as outlined in the impact assessment, were examined and the following options were retained:\n\n\n\nAccess Regulation\n\n\nNGA+ Focusing regulation on high-quality connectivity \n\n\nThis option considers that while the key principles of the framework remain valid, significant adjustments are necessary to provide necessary incentives for both incumbents and competitors to make economically viable investments or co-investments in future networks that are in principle capable of providing very high capacity connectivity to every citizen and business in Europe.\n\n\nSpectrum\n\n\n\nBinding and enforceable rules for enhancing coordination of spectrum management in the EU with greater focus on adapting spectrum rules to the future 5G challenges  \n\n\nThis aims at adapting the framework to the developments in terms of ubiquitous connectivity and 5G deployment and to ensure greater consistency with regard to Member States\u00b4 measures, notably those affecting competitive market conditions and economic regulation. It seeks to do this by means of greater adaptations of the framework, legally enforceable instruments and a peer review mechanism allowing BEREC, the Commission and national regulatory authorities to review elements of individual Member States\u2019 planned national assignment procedures which have more impact on market and business developments. Moreover, this option will place greater emphasis on the investment environment for dense 5G networks.  \n\n\nUniversal service \n\n\nIncremental adaptation to trends with the focus on voice and broadband affordability\n\n\nThis option focuses the universal service EU obligation on the affordability aspect, including the provision of affordable voice communications and basic broadband in the EU in its scope as well as a right to contract for consumers benefiting from special universal tariffs. At the EU level, broadband would be defined by referring to a functional internet access connection defined on the basis of a minimum list of online services which enable end-users\u2019 participation in civil society, which Member States shall further define at national level. Affordability should be ensured for these services provided at a fixed location, notably via direct support, but Member States have the possibility to include affordability measures for mobile services for the most vulnerable end-users\u2019 where lack of such affordability is demonstrated. Availability of these services will be primarily promoted by other policy tools (incentives to private investment, state aid, spectrum-related coverage obligations, etc.) and can only exceptionally be included at national level if duly demonstrated. Taking into account a broader range of beneficiaries (beyond the telecom sector) of universal broadband, this option relies on financing though the general budget as a more equitable and the least distortive way of funding the provision of universal service. \n\n\nServices\n\n\nInternet Access Services (IAS) and regulatory obligations for electronic communications services mainly linked to the use of numbering resources\n\n\nThis option builds on other options. It proposes, on top of the regulation of IAS, to apply a limited set of sector-specific rules to interpersonal communications services, provided either traditionally (voice telephony or SMS), or via the IAS. In particular, the option determines those areas which still require sector-specific protection by reason of their characteristics and proposes to apply the relevant rules equally to all providers of services that are functionally equivalent. In many cases this will be IAS plus interpersonal communications services using numbers (\u2018use\u2019 being understood as provision of numbers to the service\u2019s own subscribers, or provision of a service that enables communication with other providers\u2019subscribers via such numbers). In key areas such as security and the power to impose interoperability, the relevant rules should apply to all interpersonal communications services. It is proposed that end-user rules be subject to full harmonisation to the extent possible, instead of the current minimum harmonisation approach, in order to lessen the compliance burden and to avoid distorting market conditions across the Member States. In order to reduce regulatory burden, it is proposed to lift regulatory obligations where they are no longer needed or are adequately covered by general consumer protection law. One key example is the repeal of the power of NRAs to directly impose retail price regulation.\n\n\nAs regards regulatory obligations applicable to interpersonal communications services, most of them would be linked to the use of public numbering resources \u2014 confirming an approach that has been identified by regulators\n9\n since at least the last review of the framework but which is widely contested by the relevant service providers and has not been widely applied in practice. The scope of access to emergency services is redefined using the concept of number-based interpersonal communications services, but taking account of the inability of certain online services to assure quality of service of such calls. Rules that would apply to number-based\u00a0interpersonal communications services cover inter alia contract duration, transparency, information on quality of service, number portability led by the receiving provider, consumption monitoring tools, comparison tools for both prices and quality of service or switching rules for bundles to avoid lock-in effects.\n\n\nAdditionally, in certain areas public policy interests such as security, require applying regulatory obligations to all interpersonal communications services, i.e. also to those that are provided over the IAS but do not use numbering resources. \n\n\n\u2018Must carry\u2019 and electronic programme guides (EPG)\n\n\n\n\nMaintain Member States\u2019 possibility to impose \u2018must carry\u2019 and EPG obligations\n\n\nThis option would keep the current \u2018must carry\u2019 and EPG rules in place. However, it clarifies that the transmission obligations may include data complementary to radio and TV channels which supports connected TV services and EPGs. \n\n\nNumbering\n\n\nAdapting the EU framework on numbering to address competition issues on the market\n\n\nUnder this option the framework is adapted to allow Member States the assignment of numbers to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications services or networks. This option would allows extraterritorial use of certain numbering resources within the EU, subject to appropriate safeguards to protect end-users in all Member States where the numbers are used.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nAdvisory role for BEREC/RSPG with certain normative powers for BEREC and improved process for market review and spectrum assignment \n\n\nThis option envisages, in particular, a minimum set of harmonised competences for NRAs and the alignment of NRAs\u2019 and BEREC\u2019s tasks, as well as the substantial alignment of BEREC\u2019s governance structure with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies.\n\n\nFurthermore, BEREC will be given additional tasks, such as powers to adopt binding decisions on the identification of transnational markets and on a contract summary template; quasi-binding powers in relation to the internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation (the \u2018double-lock\u2019 system \u2013 see below) and the establishment of a single maximum termination rate for the EU; and the issuing of guidelines in a number of areas: geographical surveys, common approaches to meeting transnational demand, minimum criteria for reference offers, common criteria for the management of numbering resources, quality-of-service parameters, applicable measurement methods and the technical details of the cost model to be applied by NRAs when setting maximum symmetric termination rates. It will also be given the power to request information directly from operators.\n\n\nBEREC will also be in charge of setting up a register for the extraterritorial use of numbers and cross-border arrangements and another EU register of providers of electronic communications networks and services. In addition, it will be asked to assist the Commission and NRAs in the area of standardisation by helping them identify a lack of interoperability or a threat to end-to-end connectivity or to effective access to emergency services. \n\n\nAs regards remedies, a 'double-lock' system is proposed whereby, in cases where BEREC and the Commission agree on their position regarding the draft remedies proposed by an NRA, the NRA could be required by the Commission to amend or withdraw the draft measure and, if necessary, to re-notify the market analysis. BEREC will receive some additional normative and advisory tasks.\n\n\nAs regards spectrum, NRAs will gain decision-making competences concerning only the regulatory and market shaping conditions of spectrum assignment for electronic communications networks and services. Furthermore, a 'peer review' system within BEREC is introduced as a new coordination mechanism. This mechanism will require NRAs to notify their draft measures in regard to these aspects of spectrum assignment for review by BEREC and issuance of a non-binding opinion.\n\n\nMoreover, additional general normative powers are be accorded to the Commission with regard to laying down criteria for defining certain spectrum assignments elements, taking the utmost account of the advice of RSPG and based on adoption through comitology (Cocom) \u2013 to guide individual NRAs, and the \u2018peer review\u2019 within BEREC. The RSPG will remain an advisory body and will provide opinions to the Commission before adopting the implementing measures by comitology.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe policy measures proposed under the preferred option bundle support the REFIT agenda and address the objective of simplification and reduction of administrative burden in line with the findings of the evaluation exercise on the REFIT potential of the review. Several of the proposed changes under access, spectrum, universal service, services/end-users, numbering  and governance policy areas aim to make rules clear; allow parties to easily understand their rights and obligations; and to avoid overregulation and administrative burdens. \n\n\nThe proposed changes include specifically: streamlining and geographic targeting of access regulation; the use (wherever possible) of general authorisation in preference to individual licences for spectrum; fostering secondary markets for spectrum; the removal of redundant universal service obligations such as requirements to ensure the provision of payphones and physical directories; narrowing of the scope of universal service availability obligations and ending of the sectorial sharing mechanism; clarifying the scope of the Regulatory Framework and the removal of redundant consumer protection obligations where these are already addressed through horizontal legislation or met by the market; harmonisation and clarification of rules and governance of numbering in the M2M context; and aligning the remit of NRAs with BEREC.\n\n\nThe simplification measures in the preferred options have also a single market coherence dimension as they will ensure greater consistency in access remedies and in spectrum assignment processes, which at the moment tend to generate complexity for operators wanting to use spectrum in various Member States, and can also (in case of divergent timetables) cause interference in border areas.\u00a0Equally the introduction of standardised wholesale remedies for example in relation to business access facilitates businesses operating in more than one Member State and the lengthening of the spectrum  licences fosters  the creation of a pan-European secondary market for spectrum as well as a more investment-friendly environment for holders of such licences.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal also takes full account of the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, the proposed measures aim at achieving higher levels of connectivity with a modernised set of end-user protection rules. This will in turn ensure non-discriminatory access to any contents and services, including public services, and help promote freedom of expression and of business, and enable Member States to comply with the Charter at a much lower cost in the future.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU budget.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nMonitoring of the implementation will continue to be assured by the Commission on the basis of:\n\n\n\uf0b7The European Digital Progress Report\n\n\nThe European Digital Progress Report covers 28 Member States and provides comprehensive data and analysis of market, regulatory and consumer developments in the digital economy, including: \n\n\nDigital Scoreboard\n10\n, which measures progress of the European Digital Economy. It is fed by data conveyed by the national regulatory authorities, Eurostat and additional relevant sources and includes data about the general situation of all dimensions of the Digital Economy Society Index in the EU Member States\n11\n. The indicators included in the report allow a comparison of progress across European countries as well as over time. \n\n\nTelecom reports on European electronic communications regulation and markets, which provide comprehensive data and analysis of market, regulatory and consumer developments in the sector.  \n\n\n\uf0b7Eurobarometer annual household survey\n\n\nThe current Eurobarometer survey provides insights into how the e-comms market performed for end-users and on consumer attitudes in relation to service platforms uptake and usage of services, as well as on a number of consumer protection-related issues.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal amends the current framework with the following substantive changes:\n\n\nAmendments to policy objectives:\n\n\nArticle 3 streamlines the presentation of current objectives and complements them with a new objective of widespread access to and take-up of very high capacity connectivity across the EU alongside the existing objectives of promotion of competition, of the internal market and of end-user interests. \n\n\nAmendments related to access regulation:\n\n\nAmendments related to access regulation aim at reinforcing and improving the SMP access regime currently in place, to further promote infrastructure competition and network deployment by all operators and to sustain the deployment of very high capacity networks throughout the Union\u2019s territory.\n\n\nIn the first and second category (the reinforcement of the SMP regime and the promotion of infrastructure competition and network deployment by all operators), the following provisions and changes are relevant:\n\n\nArticles 61 and 65 amend the market analysis procedures, codifying current best practices and aiming at more focused and legally certain access regulation, as well as tightening its geographical focus, to ensure that access obligations are imposed only when and where necessary to address retail market failures and to assure end-user outcomes. The rules also lay down an obligation for regulators to take into consideration commercial access agreements in their market analyses, as well as any other regulatory obligations already imposed, for example symmetrical obligations. Furthermore, the article extends the current maximum three-year market review period to five years, which will allow operators longer term planning, and will provide national regulators with greater flexibility as regards the timing of market reviews. Article 66 reflects these objectives by updating and amending the corresponding rules for the imposition and revision of regulatory obligations, for example when market conditions change.\n\n\nArticle 70 supports greater infrastructure competition by ensuring access to civil infrastructure, such as ducts, poles etc., where these are held by operators with SMP.\n\n\nAlso with a view to supporting infrastructure competition, Article 59 clarifies the conditions under which obligations can be imposed on all operators (symmetric obligations), to ensure access to non-replicable network assets, such as in-house wiring and cables. To protect investment incentives, such access is limited to the first concentration point from the end-user, but can be expanded beyond it in limited circumstances, to facilitate alternative network deployment in the most difficult and less densely populated areas.\n\n\n\n\nArticles 63 and 64 empower BEREC to identify transnational markets, as well as to identify transnational demand even where markets remain national or sub-national. BEREC can adopt guidelines for national regulators to adopt common approaches when imposing remedies that can help such transnational demand to be met. Article 64 also empowers the Commission, with the support of BEREC, to establish harmonised technical specifications for certain wholesale access products to meet the demand for cross-border communications, in particular from business users, in cases where the absence of such harmonised products hinders the internal market.\n\n\nArticle 73 introduces an EU-level process for determining a binding methodology for setting voice termination rates, a stable market which is similarly regulated across most Member States. In addition, it creates a mechanism for establishing maximum termination rates at EU level, with a view to alleviating the administrative burden for national regulators, allowing them to focus their efforts on the analysis of the most complex broadband markets. \n\n\nFinally, to sustain the deployment of very high capacity networks throughout the Union territory the following changes are proposed:\n\n\nArticle 22 requires national regulators to survey the state of broadband networks and investment plans across their national territory, to enable them to better take geographic specificities into account in market analyses. National regulators must also identify so called \u2018digital exclusion areas\u2019 where no operator or public authority has deployed or plans to deploy a very high capacity network or has upgraded or extended their legacy network to a performance of at least 100 Mbps download speeds, or is planning to do so. They can publish the designated digital exclusion areas and organise a call for interest therein with a view to promote very high capacity network deployment in these difficult areas.\n\n\nArticle 72 clarifies the circumstances in which pricing flexibility can be granted to SMP operators, without compromising competition. Pricing flexibility can be beneficial to investors in new networks, provided it does not impede downstream competition.   \n\n\nArticle 74, together with Annex IV, introduces provisions to facilitate commercial co-investment in new infrastructures and to draw the necessary regulatory consequences. The sharing of new network elements between an SMP network owner and access seekers entails a greater degree of risk sharing compared to traditional access products, and also can give a more durable basis for sustainable competition if appropriate conditions on the design of the co-investment are met. This should allow adaptation of regulated access, enabling all co-investors to benefit from first-mover advantages relative to other undertakings. The continued availability of regulated access products to non-participating undertakings, up to the capacity that was available prior to the investment, may still be appropriate.\n\n\nArticle 77 offers a simplified regulatory model for wholesale-only networks with significant market power, limited to fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access rules and subject to dispute resolution as necessary. The provisions require strict conditions for a network to be seen as truly \u2018wholesale-only\u2019, and may be particularly appropriate for local very high capacity networks, which might nevertheless be considered to have significant market power in the future. Article 76 provides clarifications on the process for voluntary separation, introducing legal certainty by way of commitments provided by the operator undergoing a process of separation.\n\n\nFinally, Article 78 clarifies the role of national regulators in accompanying SMP operators that migrate from legacy to new networks (e.g. when switching off legacy copper networks), as a means to further support the transition to new networks.\n\n\nAmendments related to spectrum management:\n\n\nArticle 45 provides a clarification of the general objectives and principles to guide Member States when managing spectrum at national level. These address consistency and proportionality in authorisation procedures, the importance of ensuring appropriate coverage, timing considerations when making spectrum available, the prevention of cross-border or harmful interference, establishing the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019principle and fostering shared spectrum use as well as spectrum trading and leasing. The article also provides a mechanism for allowing temporary alternative use for harmonised spectrum subject to clearly defined conditions.\n\n\nArticle 46 gives more prominence to general authorisations vs. individual licences as well as to shared use of spectrum in line with Union law, in order to ensure that national authorities prospectively develop the authorisation models most appropriate to 5G developments. It also provides for Commission powers to adopt binding measures to achieve consistency within different types of authorisation regimes.\n\n\nArticle 47 defines authorisation conditions attached to a general authorisation for radio frequencies and their rights of use and provides for Commission implementing measures to achieve consistency as regards certain conditions, such as the criteria for defining and measuring coverage obligations, whose importance is strengthened as part of spectrum efficiency. It also puts an emphasis on obligations such as sharing infrastructure to improve end-users\u00b4 connectivity especially in less dense areas.\n\n\nArticles 48-54 target key aspects of spectrum authorisation with a view to enhancing consistency in Member States practice, such as (i) minimum licence durations (25 years); (ii) clear and simpler process for spectrum trading and leasing, (iii) objective criteria for consistent application based on competition law principles for measures to promote competition, such as spectrum caps, spectrum reservation for new entrants and wholesale access obligations; (iv) processes to improve consistency and predictability when granting and renewing individual spectrum usage rights; (v) clearer conditions for the restriction or withdrawal of existing rights, including by means of the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 solution and strengthened enforcement roles for national authorities. These articles\u00a0also\u00a0provide for Commission powers to adopt measures to set common maximum deadlines for authorising the use of harmonised spectrum in all Member States and for coordinating the major elements of selection processes and setting criteria for their design.\n\n\nArticles 55 and 56 simplify conditions for access to Wi-Fi, to meet the exponential demand for connectivity and for the deployment and provisions of low-power wireless broadband access (small cells) to reduce costs of deploying very dense networks.\n\n\nArticle 28 sets out a coordination obligation between Member States to address cross-border interferences problems, with the involvement of RSPG, accompanied by implementing powers for the Commission to adopt binding measures to resolve cross-border disputes taking the utmost account of the RSPG\u2019s advice.\n\n\nThe proposal confers on national regulators competences in respect of market and economic regulatory aspects of spectrum assignment for electronic communications services. They are also made competent for deciding on the imposition of exceptional measures on network/spectrum sharing and national roaming with a view to cover white connectivity spots. Natioanal regulators must base their action in this field on a sound economic and competitive analysis of the markets. In order to ensure the consistent application across the Union of assignment conditions which have an impact on economic, market and competitive conditions and thus on market functioning, Article 35 creates a peer review mechanism for BEREC to review the market and economic regulatory aspects of national draft spectrum assignments and issue non-binding opinions. \n\n\nArticle 37 introduces a framework for Member States to facilitate voluntary pan-EU or multi-country assignment procedures.\n\n\nAmendments to the universal service regime:\n\n\nThe proposal aims at modernising the universal service regime by removing the mandatory inclusion at EU level of legacy services (public payphones, comprehensive directories and directory enquiry services) from the scope and focusing on the basic universal service broadband, which would be defined by reference to a dynamic basic list of online services usable over a broadband connection. Member State intervention should focus on affordability of available connectivity rather than on the deployment of networks, for which better tools exist. \n\n\nAffordability of universal service must be ensured at least at a fixed location but Member States will have flexibility to extend affordability measures to mobile services too, for the most vulnerable users. \n\n\n\n\nArticle 79 lays down an obligation for Member States to ensure affordable access to all end-users to functional broadband internet access and voice communications services at least at a fixed location. In order to ensure affordability, Article 80 empowers Member States to require undertakings to have special tariff options for end-users identified as having low incomes or special social needs and/or to provide those end-users direct support and establishes a right to contract for consumers benefiting from special universal tariffs.\n\n\nWhile Member State intervention should focus on the affordability of available connectivity rather than on the deployment of networks, Article 81 allows a Member State to include the provision of connection at fixed location (availability) in the scope if it demonstrates that such connection cannot be ensured under normal commercial circumstances or through other public policy tools at its disposal.\n\n\nIn recognition of the need for flexibility to tackle different national circumstances, Article 82 allows Member States to continue mandating at national level services that currently fall within the EU universal service obligation, such as pay phones, directories and directory inquiry services, if the need is duly demonstrated provided they adapt the financing regime too.\n\n\nArticle 85 establishes that the universal service should be financed through the general budget and no longer through sectoral funding.\n\n\nAmendments to the services and end-user protection rules:\n\n\nIn order to reflect the market and regulatory developments over the past years and the continued need for sector-specific rules, Article 2(4) redefines the term \u2018electronic communications service\u2019. It contains three types of service categories: (i) internet access service , (ii) interpersonal communications service, encompassing two sub-categories: i.e. one that is number-based and one that is number-independent, and (iii) services consisting wholly or mainly of the conveyance of signals, such as transmission services used for M2M communications and for broadcasting. Many end-user provisions will only apply to internet access services and to number-based interpersonal communications services.\n\n\nNumber-independent interpersonal communications services will be subject only to obligations, where public policy interests require applying specific regulatory obligations to be applied to all types of interpersonal communications services, regardless of whether they use numbers. This relates in particular to security provisions (Article 40). Additionally, in the event of an actual threat to end-to-end connectivity or to effective access to emergency services, the Commission may identify a need for measures to ensure interoperability, for instance through the launch of a standardisation process. Such standards could be imposed by NRAs where necessary (Article 59)\n\n\nThe proposal reduces the regulatory burden by lifting regulatory obligations where they are no longer needed or are adequately covered by general consumer law. One key example is the repeal of the power of national regulators to directly impose retail price regulation on SMP operators (repeal of article 17 of the Universal Service Directive). Also certain provisions on contracts, transparency, equivalence of access by disabled users, directory services and interoperability of consumer digital television equipment have been streamlined and partly deleted because of overlap with horizontal rules or other redundancies (Articles 95 -98, 103- 105).\n\n\nA limited number of new provisions are envisaged to address new challenges, e.g. better readability of contracts through a short-form summarising the essential contract information, the provision of consumption control tools to inform end-users about their current communications usage, enhanced provisions on price and quality comparison tools, switching rules for the rapidly increasing number of bundles to avoid lock-in effects (key sector-specific provisions, such as maximum contract duration and rights to contract termination, would apply to the entire bundle) and a provision prohibiting discrimination based on nationality or the country of residence (Articles 92, 95, 96, 98,- and 100).\n\n\nWhile there is a general maximum service contract period of 2 years, longer separate agreements with end-users are allowed as a means to facilitate reimbursement of contributions to the deployment of a physical connection and to support network roll-out through instalment-based contributions to network capital costs (the \u2018demand aggregation\u2019 approach), (Article\u00a098). \n\n\nAmendments to numbering provisions:\n\n\nIn order to address competition issues in the M2M market (most importantly, the lock-in with a given operator), the proposal allows national regulators to assign numbers to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks and services, without however requiring them to do so (Article 88). The same article also requires national regulators to determine certain numbering resources for the extraterritorial use of national numbers within the EU, as a means of responding to the increasing demand for such extraterritorial use of numbering resources in particular for M2M applications. \n\n\nAs regards the rules for harmonised numbers for services of social value, the focus remains on the effective implementation of the missing children hotline (Article 90) while the overall framework for 116 numbers continues to be based on Commission Decision 2007/116/EC. Due to the lack of demand for the European Telephone Numbering Space over the past years the corresponding provision has been deleted (Article 27 of the Universal Service Directive).\n\n\nAmendments to emergency communications provisions:\n\n\nLegal clarity is brought about regarding access to emergency services by all number-based interpersonal communications service providers. The proposed provisions replace the existing Commission mandate to impose technical implementing measures by the power to adopt delegated acts to ensure effective access to the single European emergency number 112 with regards to caller location, call routing to the \u2018public safety answering points\u2019 and access for disabled end-users in a coherent way EU-wide. Such an approach ensures cross-border deployment and functioning of technical solutions for emergency communications (Article 102).\n\n\n\nAmendments to governance:\n\n\n\nArticles 5, 6 and 8 strengthen the role of independent national regulators by establishing a minimum set of competences for those regulators across the EU and enhance their independence requirements, by providing for appointment requirements and reporting obligations. \n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 12 introduces some changes as regards the procedure for general authorisation. Providers should submit notifications to BEREC, which should act as a single contact point and forward the notifications to relevant national regulatory authorities. BEREC should establish a register at EU level.\n\n\n\nArticle 27 provides a procedure for resolution of cross-border disputes between undertakings, reinforcing BEREC's role by obliging national regulatory authority to consult BEREC.\n\n\n\nArticle 33 provides a \u2018double-lock\u2019 system, in cases where BEREC and the Commission agree on their position regarding the draft remedies proposed by a national regulator and notified to the Commission and BEREC under Article 32. In such cases, the regulator could be required by the Commission to amend or withdraw the draft measure and, if necessary, to re-notify its market analysis to them.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC (adapted)\n\n\n2016/0288 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0establishing the European Electronic Communications Code \u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n(Recast)\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 , and in particular Article 95\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0114\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n12\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n13\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\n\n\n(1)Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n, Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n, Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n\u00a0\u00a0and Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n have been substantially amended.

In that communication, the Commission reviewed the existing regulatory framework for telecommunications, in accordance with its obligation under Article 8 of Council Directive 90/387/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the establishment of the internal market for telecommunications services through the implementation of open network provision\n18\n. It also presented a series of policy proposals for a new regulatory framework for electronic communications infrastructure and associated services for public consultation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea 2002/21/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\nOn 26 April 2000 the Commission presented a communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the results of the public consultation on the 1999 communications review and orientations for the new regulatory framework. The communication summarised the public consultation and set out certain key orientations for the preparation of a new framework for electronic communications infrastructure and associated services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea 2002/21/EC recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\nThe Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 highlighted the potential for growth, competitiveness and job creation of the shift to a digital, knowledge-based economy. In particular, it emphasised the importance for Europe's businesses and citizens of access to an inexpensive, world-class communications infrastructure and a wide range of services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(2) The functioning of the five directives comprising\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0which are part of \u00d5\u00a0the existing regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7\u00a0March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)\n19\n, Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7\u00a0March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)\n20\n, Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 7\u00a0March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)\n21\n, Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive)\n22\n and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(Directive on privacy and electronic communications)\n23\n\u00a0(together referred to as \u2018the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives\u2019)) is subject to periodic review by  the Commission, with a view, in particular, to determining the need for modification in the light of technological and market developments\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0\n24\n\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(3)In the Digital Single Market strategy, the Commission outlined that the review of the telecoms framework will focus on measures that aim at incentivising investment in high-speed broadband networks, bring a more consistent single market approach to spectrum policy and management, deliver conditions for a true single market by tackling regulatory fragmentation, ensure a level playing field for all market players and consistent application of the rules, as well as provide a more effective regulatory institutional framework. \n\n\n(4)This Directive is part of a \"Regulatory Fitness\" exercise the scope of which includes four of the Directives (Framework, Authorisation, Access and Universal Service Directive) and a Regulation (BEREC Regulation\n25\n). Each of the Directives currently contains measures applicable to providers of electronic communications networks and of electronic communications services, consistently with the regulatory history of the sector under which undertakings were vertically integrated i.e. active in both the provision of networks and of services. The review offers an occasion to recast the four directives in order to simplify the current structure, with a view to reinforcing its coherence and accessibility, consistently with the REFIT objective. It offers also the possibility to adapt the structure to the new market reality, where the provision of communications services is not any more necessarily bundled to the provision of a network. As provided in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts, recasting consists in the adoption of a new legal act which incorporates in a single text both the substantive amendments which it makes to an earlier act and the unchanged provisions of that act. The proposal for recasting deals with the substantive amendments which it makes to an earlier act, and on a secondary level, it includes the codification of the unchanged provisions of the earlier act with those substantive amendments.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(5)The objective of\u00a0tThis Directive is to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should \u00d5 create a legal framework to ensure the freedom to provide electronic communications networks and services, subject only to the conditions laid down in this Directive and to any restrictions in conformity with Article 46\u00a0\u00d6\u00a052\u00a0\u00d5 (1) of the Treaty, in particular measures regarding public policy, public security and public health.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 7 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(6)The provisions of this Directive and the Specific Directives are without prejudice to the possibility for each Member State to take the necessary measures \u00f0\u00a0justified on grounds set out in Articles 87 and\u00a045 of the Treaty\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union, \u00ef to ensure the protection of its essential security interests, to safeguard public policy\u00f0, public morality\u00ef and public security, and to permit the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(7)The convergence of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors means \u00d6\u00a0that\u00a0\u00d5 all transmission\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0electronic communications\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0networks and services should be covered \u00d6\u00a0to the extent possible\u00a0\u00d5 by a single \u00d6\u00a0European Electronic Communications Code established by a single Directive, with the exception of matters better dealt with through directly applicable rules established through regulations\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0regulatory framework.

It is necessary to separate the regulation of transmission\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0electronic communications networks and services\u00a0\u00ef from the regulation of content. This framework\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0 Code\u00a0\u00d5 does not therefore cover the content of services delivered over electronic communications networks using electronic communications services, such as broadcasting content, financial services and certain information society services, and is therefore without prejudice to measures taken at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or national level in respect of such services, in compliance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, in order to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and to ensure the defence of media pluralism. The content of television programmes is covered by Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities\n30\nDirective 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n31\n. \u00f0\u00a0The regulation of audiovisual policy and content aims at achieving general interest objectives, such as freedom of expression, media pluralism, impartiality, cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion, consumer protection and the protection of minors.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0The separation between the regulation of transmission\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0electronic communications\u00a0\u00ef and the regulation of content does not prejudice the taking into account of the links existing between them, in particular in order to guarantee media pluralism, cultural diversity and consumer protection.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 8\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(8)This Directive does not cover equipment within the scope of Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\n32\n\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0affect the application to radio equipment of Directive 2014/53/EU\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0, but does cover consumer equipment used for digital television. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 11  (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(9) In order to allow national regulatory authorities to meet the objectives set out in the Framework\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive and the Specific Directives, in particular concerning end-to-end interoperability, the scope of the Framework Directive should be extended to cover certain aspects of radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment as defined in Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\n33\n\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n34\n\u00a0\u00d5 and consumer equipment used for digital television, in order to facilitate access for disabled users.\u00a0\u00f0 It is important for regulators to encourage network operators and equipment manufacturers to cooperate in order to facilitate access by disabled users to electronic communications services.

Most of these activities are not covered by the scope of this Directive because they do not consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks.\u00a0\u00f0 Certain electronic communications services under this Directive could also fulfil the definition of \u2018information society service\u2019 in Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services. The provisions governing Information Society Services apply to those electronic communications services to the extent that there are not more specific provisions applicable to electronic communications services in this Directive or in other Union acts.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0However, electronic communications services such as\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Vvoice telephony,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0messaging services\u00a0\u00ef and electronic mail conveyance services are covered by this Directive. The same undertaking, for example an Internet service provider, can offer both an electronic communications service, such as access to the Internet, and services not covered under this Directive, such as the provision of web-based \u00f0\u00a0and not communications-related\u00a0\u00ef content.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 20\n\n\n\n(11)The same undertaking, for example a cable operator, can offer both an electronic communications service, such as the conveyance of television signals, and services not covered under this Directive, such as the commercialisation of an offer of sound or television broadcasting content services, and therefore additional obligations can be imposed on this undertaking in relation to its activity as a content provider or distributor, according to provisions other than those of this Directive, without prejudice to the list of conditions laid in the Annex\u00a0I to this Directive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(12)The regulatory framework should cover the use of radio spectrum by all electronic communications networks, including the emerging self-use of radio spectrum by new types of networks consisting exclusively of autonomous systems of mobile radio equipment that is connected via wireless links without a central management or centralised network operator, and not necessarily within the exercise of any specific economic activity. In the developing fifth generation mobile communications environment, such networks are likely to develop in particular outside buildings and on the roads, for transport, energy, R&D, eHealth, public protection and disaster relief, Internet of Things, machine-to-machine  and connected cars. As a result, the application by Member States, based on Article 7 of Directive 2014/53/EU, of additional national requirements regarding the putting into service or use of such radio equipment, or both, in relation to the effective and efficient use of spectrum and avoidance of harmful interference should reflect the principles of the internal market. \n\n\n(13)The requirements concerning the capabilities of electronic communications networks are constantly increasing. While in the past the focus was mainly on growing bandwidth available overall and to each individual user, other parameters like latency, availability and reliability are becoming increasingly important. The current response towards this demand is bringing optical fibre closer and closer to the user and future 'very high capacity networks' will require performance parameters which are equivalent to what a network based on optical fibre elements at least up to the distribution point at the serving location can deliver. This corresponds in the fixed-line connection case to network performance equivalent to what is achievable by an optical fibre installation up to a multi-dwelling building, considered as the serving location, and in the mobile connection case to network performance similar to what is achievable based on an optical fibre installation up to the base station, considered as the serving location. Variations in end-users' experience which are due to the different characteristics of the medium by which the network ultimately connects with the network termination point should not be taken into account for the purposes of establishing whether or not a wireless network could be considered as providing similar network performance. In accordance with the principle of technological neutrality, other technologies and transmission media should not be excluded, where they compare with this baseline scenario in terms of their capabilities. The roll-out of such 'very high capacity networks' will further increase the capabilities of networks and pave the way for the roll-out of future mobile network generations based on enhanced air interfaces and a more densified network architecture.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(14)Definitions need to be adjusted so as to conform to the principle of technology neutrality and to keep pace with technological development. \u00f0\u00a0Technological and market evolution has brought networks to move to internet protocol technology, and enabled end-users to choose between a range of competing voice service providers. Therefore, the term 'publicly available telephone service', exclusively used in Directive 2002/22/EC and widely perceived as referring to traditional analogue telephone services should be replaced by the more current and technological neutral term 'voice communications'.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0In particular,cConditions for the provision of a service should be separated from the actual definitional elements of a publicly available telephone\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0voice communications\u00a0\u00d5 service, i.e. an electronic communications service made available to the public for originating and receiving, directly or indirectly, national or national and international calls through a number or numbers in a national or international telephone numbering plan, whether such a service is based on circuit switching or packet switching technology. It is the nature of such a service that it is bidirectional, enabling both the parties to communicate. A service which does not fulfil all these conditions, such as for example a \u2018click-through\u2019 application on a customer service website, is not \u00d6\u00a0such\u00a0\u00d5 a publicly available telephone service. Publicly available telephone\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Voice communications\u00a0\u00d5 services also include means of communication specifically intended for disabled end-users using text relay or total conversation services.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(15)The services used for communications purposes, and the technical means of their delivery, have evolved considerably. End-users increasingly substitute traditional voice telephony, text messages (SMS) and electronic mail conveyance services by functionally equivalent online services such as Voice over IP, messaging services and web-based e-mail services. In order to ensure that end-users are effectively and equally protected when using functionally equivalent services, a future-oriented definition of electronic communications services should not be purely based on technical parameters but rather build on a functional approach. The scope of  necessary regulation should be appropriate to achieve its public interest objectives. While \"conveyance of signals\" remains an important parameter for determining the services falling into the scope of this Directive, the definition should cover also other services that enable communication. From an end-user's perspective it is not relevant whether a provider conveys signals itself or whether the communication is delivered via an internet access service. The amended definition of electronic communications services should therefore contain three types of services which may partly overlap, that is to say internet access services according to the definition in Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, interpersonal communications services as defined in this Directive, and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The definition of electronic communications service should eliminate ambiguities observed in the implementation of the previous definition and allow a calibrated provision-by-provision application of the specific rights and obligations contained in the framework to the different types of services. The processing of personal data by electronic communications services, whether as remuneration or otherwise, must be in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC which will be replaced by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) on 25 May 2018\n37\n.\u00a0\n\n\n(16)In order to fall within the scope of the definition of electronic communications service, a service needs to be provided normally in exchange for remuneration. In the digital economy, market participants increasingly consider information about users as having a monetary value. Electronic communications services are often supplied against counter-performance other than money, for instance by giving access to personal data or other data. The concept of remuneration should therefore encompass situations where the provider of a service requests and the end-user actively provides personal data, such as name or email address, or other datadirectly or indirectly to the provider. It should also encompass situations where the provider collects information without the end-user actively supplying it, such as personal data, including the IP address, or other automatically generated information, such as information collected and transmitted by a cookie). In line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union on Article 57 TFEU\n38\n, remuneration exists within the meaning of the Treaty also if the service provider is paid by a third party and not by the service recipient. The concept of remuneration should therefore also encompass situations where the end-user is exposed to advertisements as a condition for gaining access to the service, or situations where the service provider monetises personal data it has collected.\n\n\n(17)Interpersonal communications services are services that enable interpersonal and interactive exchange of information, covering services like traditional voice calls between two individuals but also all types of emails, messaging services, or group chats. Interpersonal communications services only cover communications between a finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons which is determined by the sender of the communication. Communications involving legal persons should be within the scope of the definition where natural persons act on behalf of those legal persons or are involved at least on one side of the communication. Interactive communication entails that the service allows the recipient of the information to respond. Services which do not meet those requirements, such as linear broadcasting, video on demand, websites, social networks, blogs, or exchange of information between machines, should not be considered as interpersonal communications services. Under exceptional circumstances, a service should not be considered as an interpersonal communications service if the interpersonal and interactive communication facility is a purely ancillary feature to another service and for objective technical reasons cannot be used without that principal service, and its integration is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules governing electronic communications services. An example for such an exception could be, in principle, a communication channel in online games, depending on the features of the communication facility of the service.\n\n\n(18)Interpersonal communications services using numbers from a national and international telephone numbering plan connect with the public (packet or circuit) switched telephone network. Those number-based interpersonal communications services comprise both services to which end-users numbers are assigned for the purpose of ensuring end-to-end connectivity and services enabling end-users to reach persons to whom such numbers have been assigned. The mere use of a number as an identifier should not be considered equivalent to the use of a number to connect with the public switched telephone network, and should therefore, in itself, not be considered sufficient to qualify a service as a number-based interpersonal communications service. Number-independent interpersonal communications services should be subject only to obligations, where public interests require applying specific regulatory obligations to all types of interpersonal communications services, regardless of whether they use numbers for the provision of their service. It is justified to treat number-based interpersonal communications services differently, as they participate in and hence also benefit from a publicly assured interoperable ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(19)The network termination point represents a boundary for regulatory purposes between the regulatory framework for electronic communication\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0communications\u00a0\u00d5 networks and services and the regulation of telecommunication terminal equipment. Defining the location of the network termination point is the responsibility of the national regulatory authority, where necessary on the basis of a proposal by the relevant undertakings. \u00a0\u00f0\u00a0 In the light of the practice of national regulatory authorities, and given the variety of fixed and wireless topologies, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (\u02bbBEREC\u02bc) should, in close cooperation with the Commission, adopt guidelines on how to identify the network termination point, in accordance with this Directive, in various concrete circumstances.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(20)Technical developments make it possible for end-users to access emergency services not only by voice calls but also by other interpersonal communications services. The concept of emergency communication should therefore cover all those interpersonal communications services that allow such emergency services access. It builds on the emergency system elements already enshrined in Union legislation, namely 'Public Safety Answering Point' ('PSAP') and 'most appropriate PSAP'\n39\n, and on 'emergency services'\n40\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(21)National regulatory \u00f0\u00a0and other competent \u00ef authorities should have a harmonised set of objectives and principles to underpin \u00d6\u00a0their work\u00a0\u00d5 , and should, where necessary, coordinate their actions with the regulatory authorities of other Member States \u00f0\u00a0and with BEREC\u00a0\u00ef in carrying out their tasks under this regulatory framework.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 17 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(22)The activities of national regulatory\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities established under this Directive and the Specific Directives contribute to the fulfilment of broader policies in the areas of culture, employment, the environment, social cohesion and town and country planning.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(23)In order to translate the political aims of the Digital Single Market strategy into regulatory terms, the framework should, in addition to the existing three primary objectives of promoting competition, internal market and end-user interests,  pursue an additional connectivity objective, articulated in terms of outcomes: widespread access to and take-up of very high capacity fixed and mobile connectivity for all Union citizens and businesses on the basis of reasonable price and choice, enabled by effective and fair competition, by efficient investment and open innovation, by efficient use of spectrum, by common rules and predictable regulatory approaches in the internal market and by the necessary sector-specific rules to safeguard the interests of citizens. For the Member States, the national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities and the stakeholders, that connectivity objective translates on the one hand into aiming for the highest capacity networks and services economically sustainable in a given area, and on the other hand into pursuing territorial cohesion, in the sense of convergence in capacity available in different areas.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(24)The requirement for\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0principle that\u00a0\u00d5 Member States to\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0should apply EU law in a technologically neutral fashion\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0ensure that national regulatory authorities take the utmost account of the desirability of making regulation technologically neutral, that is to say that \u00d6\u00a0a national regulatory\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0or other competent\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0authority\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0it neither imposes nor discriminates in favour of the use of a particular type of technology, does not preclude the taking of proportionate steps to promote certain specific services where this is justified in \u00f0\u00a0order to attain the objectives\u00a0of the regulatory framework \u00ef , for example digital television as a means for increasing spectrum efficiency. \u00f0\u00a0Furthermore, it does not preclude taking into account that certain transmission media have physical characteristics and architectural features that can be superior in terms of quality of service, capacity, maintenance cost, energy efficiency, management flexibility, reliability, robustness and scalability, and ultimately in terms of performance, which can be reflected in actions taken in view of pursuing the various regulatory objectives.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 53\n\n\n(25)Both efficient investment and competition should be encouraged in tandem, in order to increase economic growth, innovation and consumer choice.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 54\n\n\n\n\n(26)Competition can best be fostered through an economically efficient level of investment in new and existing infrastructure, complemented by regulation, wherever necessary, to achieve effective competition in retail services.

The Internet of Things is an illustration of how the radio signal conveyance underpinning electronic communications continues to evolve and shape societal and business reality. To derive the greatest benefit from those developments, the introduction and accommodation of new wireless communications technologies and applications in spectrum management is essential. As other technologies and applications relying on spectrum are equally subject to growing demand, and can be enhanced by integration of or combination with electronic communications, spectrum management should adopt, where appropriate, a cross-sectorial approach to improve spectrum usage efficiency.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 28 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(30)Although spectrum management remains within the competence of the Member States,\u00a0sStrategic planning, coordination and, where appropriate, harmonisation at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level can help ensure that spectrum users derive the full benefits of the internal market and that EU\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 interests can be effectively defended globally.

Moreover,\u00a0the conditions for access to, and use of, radio frequencies\u00a0may vary according to the type of operator, while electronic services provided by these operators increasingly overlap, thereby creating tensions between rights holders, discrepancies in the cost of access to spectrum, and potential distortions in the functioning of the internal market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 33 (adapted)\n\n\nNational borders are increasingly irrelevant in determining optimal radio spectrum use. Fragmentation of the management of access to spectrum rights limits investment and innovation and does not allow operators and equipment manufacturers to realise economies of scale, thereby hindering the development of an internal market for electronic communications networks and services using radio spectrum.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 30 (adapted)\n\n\n(32)The spectrum management provisions of this Directive should be consistent with the work of international and regional organisations dealing with radio spectrum management, such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), so as to ensure the efficient management of and harmonisation of the use of spectrum across the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and between the Member States and other members of the ITU.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(33)In accordance with the principle of the separation of regulatory and operational functions, Member States should guarantee the independence of the national regulatory authority or\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and other competent\u00a0\u00ef  authorities with a view to ensuring the impartiality of their decisions. This requirement of independence is without prejudice to the institutional autonomy and constitutional obligations of the Member States or to the principle of neutrality with regard to the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership laid down in Article 295 of the Treaty. National regulatory \u00f0\u00a0and other competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities should be in possession of all the necessary resources, in terms of staffing, expertise, and financial means, for the performance of their tasks.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(34)It is necessary to provide for a list of tasks that Member States may assign only to bodies which they designate as national regulatory authorities whose political independence and regulatory capacity is guaranteed, as opposed to other regulatory tasks which they can assign either to the national regulatory authorities or to other competent authorities. Hence, where this Directive provides that a Member State should assign a task to or empower a competent authority, the Member State can assign the task either to a national regulatory authority, or to another competent authority. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(35)The independence of the national regulatory authorities should be\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0was\u00a0\u00d5 strengthened in \u00d6\u00a0the 2009 review in\u00a0\u00d5 order to ensure a more effective application of the regulatory framework and to increase their authority and the predictability of their decisions. To this end, express provision should\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0had to\u00a0\u00d5 be made in national law to ensure that, in the exercise of its tasks, a national regulatory authority responsible for ex-ante market regulation or for resolution of disputes between undertakings is protected against external intervention or political pressure liable to jeopardise its independent assessment of matters coming before it. Such outside influence makes a national legislative body unsuited to act as a national regulatory authority under the regulatory framework. For that purpose, rules should\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0had to\u00a0\u00d5 be laid down at the outset regarding the grounds for the dismissal of the head of the national regulatory authority in order to remove any reasonable doubt as to the neutrality of that body and its imperviousness to external factors. \u00f0\u00a0In order to avoid arbitrary dismissals, the dismissed member should have the right to request that the competent courts verify the existence of a valid reason to dismiss, among those foreseen in this Directive. Such dismissal should relate only to the personal or professional qualifications of the head or member.\u00a0\u00ef It is important that national regulatory authorities responsible for ex ante market regulation should have their own budget allowing them, in particular, to recruit a sufficient number of qualified staff. In order to ensure transparency, this budget should be published annually.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Within the limits of their budget, they should have autonomy in managing their resources, human and financial. In order to ensure impartiality, Member States who retain ownership of or control undertakings contributing to the budget of the national regulatory authority or other competent authorities through administrative charges should ensure that there is effective structural separation of activities associated with the exercise of ownership or control from the exercise of control over the budget.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(36)There is a need to further reinforce the independence of the national regulatory authorities to ensure the imperviousness of its head and members to external pressure, by providing minimum appointment qualifications, and a minimum duration for their mandate. Furthermore, the limitation of the possibility to renew more than once their mandate and the requirement for an appropriate rotation scheme for the board and the top management would address the risk of regulatory capture, ensure continuity, and enhance independence.\n\n\n(37)National regulatory authorities should be accountable for and should be required to report on the way they are exercising their tasks. That obligation should take the form of an annual reporting obligation, rather than ad hoc reporting requests, which if disproportionate could limit their independence or hinder them in the exercise of their tasks. Indeed, according to recent case law\n42\n, extensive or unconditional reporting obligations may indirectly affect the independence of an authority.\n\n\n\n\n(38)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States should notify to the Commission the identity of the national regulatory and other competent authorities. For authorities competent for granting rights of way, the notification requirement may be fulfilled by a reference to the single information point established pursuant to Article 7(1) of Directive 2014/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n43\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 4\n\n\nThis Directive covers authorisation of all electronic communications networks and services whether they are provided to the public or not. This is important to ensure that both categories of providers may benefit from objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate rights, conditions and procedures.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 5\n\n\nThis Directive only applies to the granting of rights to use radio frequencies where such use involves the provision of an electronic communications network or service, normally for remuneration. The self-use of radio terminal equipment, based on the non-exclusive use of specific radio frequencies by a user and not related to an economic activity, such as use of a citizen's band by radio amateurs, does not consist of the provision of an electronic communications network or service and is therefore not covered by this Directive. Such use is covered by the Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\n44\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\nProvisions regarding the free movement of conditional access systems and the free provision of protected services based on such systems are laid down in Directive 98/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 1998 on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access\n45\n. The authorisation of such systems and services therefore does not need to be covered by this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 7\n\n\n(39)The least onerous authorisation system possible should be used to allow the provision of electronic communications networks and services in order to stimulate the development of new electronic communications services and pan-European communications networks and services and to allow service providers and consumers to benefit from the economies of scale of the single market.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(40)Those aims\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0The benefits of the single market to service providers and end-users\u00a0\u00ef can be best achieved by general authorisation of \u00f0\u00a0electronic communications networks and of electronic communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0all electronic communications networks and services without requiring any explicit decision or administrative act by the national regulatory authority and by limiting any procedural requirements to \u00f0\u00a0a declaratory \u00ef notification only. Where Member States require notification by providers of electronic communication\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0communications\u00a0\u00d5 networks or services when they start their activities, \u00f0\u00a0this notification should be submitted to BEREC which acts as a single contact point. Such notification should not entail administrative cost for the providers and could be made available via an entry point at the website of the national regulatory authorities. BEREC should forward in good time the notifications to the national regulatory authority in all Member States in which the providers of electronic communications networks or services intend to provide electronic communications networks or services. Member States can also require proof that notification was made by means of any legally recognised postal or electronic acknowledgement of receipt of the notification to BEREC. Such acknowledgement should in any case not consist of or require an administrative act by the national regulatory authority, or any other authority\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0they may also require proof of such notification having been made by means of any legally recognised postal or electronic acknowledgement of receipt of the notification. Such acknowledgement should in any case not consist of or require an administrative act by the national regulatory authority to which the notification must be made.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(41)The notification to BEREC should entail a mere declaration of the provider's intention to commence the provision of electronic communications networks and services. A provider may only be required to accompany such declaration by the information set out in Article 12 of this Directive. Member States should not impose additional or separate notification requirements.\n\n\n\n\n(42)Contrary to the other categories of electronic communications networks and services as defined in this Directive, number-independent interpersonal communications services do not benefit from the use of public numbering resources and do not participate in a publicly assured interoperable ecosystem. It is therefore not appropriate to subject these types of services to the general authorisation regime\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 21 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(43)When granting rights of use for radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef , numbers or rights to install facilities, the relevant\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0competent\u00a0\u00d5 authorities may\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 inform the undertakings to whom they grant such rights of the relevant conditions in the general authorisation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(44)The\u00a0gGeneral authorisation\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0authorisations\u00a0\u00d5 should only contain conditions which are specific to the electronic communications sector. It should not be made subject to conditions which are already applicable by virtue of other existing national law which is not specific to the electronic communications sector. Nevertheless,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0For instance,\u00a0\u00ef the national regulatory authorities may inform network operators and service providers about \u00f0\u00a0applicable environmental and town and country planning requirements\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0other legislation concerning their business, for instance through references on their websites.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 73\n\n\n(45)The conditions that may be attached to authorisations should cover specific conditions governing accessibility for users with disabilities and the need of public authorities and emergency services to communicate between themselves and with the general public before, during and after major disasters. Also, considering the importance of technical innovation, Member States should be able to issue authorisations to use spectrum for experimental purposes, subject to specific restrictions and conditions strictly justified by the experimental nature of such rights.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n(46)It is necessary to include the rights and obligations of undertakings under general authorisations explicitly in such authorisations in order to ensure a level playing field throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 and to facilitate cross-border negotiation of interconnection between public communications networks.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(47)The general authorisation entitles undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services to the public to negotiate interconnection under the conditions of \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communication networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)\n46\n.

Rights to numbers may also be allocated from a European numbering plan, including for example the virtual country code \u20183883\u2019 which has been attributed to member countries of the European Conference of Post and Telecommunications (CEPT). Those rights of use should not be restricted except where this is unavoidable in view of the scarcity of radio frequencies and the need to ensure the efficient use thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 16\n\n\n\n(48)In the case of electronic communications networks and services not provided to the public it is appropriate to impose fewer and lighter conditions than are justified for electronic communications networks and services provided to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 17 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n\n(49)Specific obligations which may be imposed on providers of electronic communications networks and \u00f0\u00a0electronic communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services \u00a0\u00ef\u00a0services in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law by virtue of their significant market power as defined in \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)\n47\n should be imposed separately from the general rights and obligations under the general authorisation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 25\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(50)Providers of electronic communications networks and services may need a confirmation of their rights under the general authorisation with respect to interconnection and rights of way, in particular to facilitate negotiations with other, regional or local, levels of government or with service providers in other Member States. For this purpose the national regulatory authoritie\u00a0\u00f0 BEREC, which receives the notification to provide public or private communications networks or services, \u00ef should provide declarations to undertakings either upon request or alternatively as an automatic response to a notification under the general authorisation. Such declarations should not by themselves constitute entitlements to rights nor should any rights under the general authorisation or rights of use or the exercise of such rights depend upon a declaration.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 30\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(51)Administrative charges may be imposed on providers of electronic communications services in order to finance the activities of the national regulatory authority \u00f0\u00a0or other competent authority\u00a0\u00ef in managing the authorisation system and for the granting of rights of use. Such charges should be limited to cover the actual administrative costs for those activities. For this purpose transparency should be created in the income and expenditure of national regulatory authorities \u00f0\u00a0and of other competent authorities\u00a0\u00ef by means of annual reporting about the total sum of charges collected and the administrative costs incurred. This will allow undertakings to verify that administrative costs and charges are in balance.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 31 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(52)Systems for administrative charges should not distort competition or create barriers for entry into the market. With a general authorisation system it will no longer be possible to attribute administrative costs and hence charges to individual undertakings except for the granting of rights to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0of\u00a0\u00d5 use \u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 numbers, radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef and for rights to install facilities. Any applicable administrative charges should be in line with the principles of a general authorisation system. An example of a fair, simple and transparent alternative for these charge attribution criteria could be a turnover related distribution key. Where administrative charges are very low, flat rate charges, or charges combining a flat rate basis with a turnover related element could also be appropriate. \u00f0\u00a0To the extent that the general authorisation system extends to undertakings with very small market shares, such as community-based network providers, or to service providers whose business model generates very limited revenues even in case of significant market penetration in terms of volumes, Member States should assess the possibility to establish an appropriate de minimis threshold for the imposition of administrative charges.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 33\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(53)Member States may need to amend rights, conditions, procedures, charges and fees relating to general authorisations and rights of use where this is objectively justified. Such changes should be duly notified to all interested parties in good time, giving them adequate opportunity to express their views on any such amendments. \u00f0\u00a0Taking into account the need to ensure legal certainty and to promote regulatory predictability, any restriction or withdrawal of existing rights of use for radio spectrum or to install facilities should be subject to predictable and transparent procedures; hence stricter requirements or a notification mechanism could be imposed where rights of use have been assigned pursuant to competitive or comparative procedures. Unnecessary procedures should be avoided in case of minor amendments to existing rights to install facilities or to use spectrum when such amendments do not impact on third parties' interests. The change in the use of spectrum as a result of the application of technology and service neutrality principles should not be considered a sufficient justification for a withdrawal of rights since it  does not constitute the granting of a new right.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 34\n\n\nThe objective of transparency requires that service providers, consumers and other interested parties have easy access to any information regarding rights, conditions, procedures, charges, fees and decisions concerning the provision of electronic communications services, rights of use of radio frequencies and numbers, rights to install facilities, national frequency usage plans and national numbering plans. The national regulatory authorities have an important task in providing such information and keeping it up to date. Where such rights are administered by other levels of government the national regulatory authorities should endeavour to create a user-friendly instrument for access to information regarding such rights.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 35\n\n\nThe proper functioning of the single market on the basis of the national authorisation regimes under this Directive should be monitored by the Commission.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 36\n\n\nIn order to arrive at a single date of application of all elements of the new regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector, it is important that the process of national transposition of this Directive and of alignment of the existing licences with the new rules take place in parallel. However, in specific cases where the replacement of authorisations existing on the date of entry into force of this Directive by the general authorisation and the individual rights of use in accordance with this Directive would lead to an increase in the obligations for service providers operating under an existing authorisation or to a reduction of their rights, Member States may avail themselves of an additional nine months after the date of application of this Directive for alignment of such licences, unless this would have a negative effect on the rights and obligations of other undertakings.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 37\n\n\nThere may be circumstances under which the abolition of an authorisation condition regarding access to electronic communications networks would create serious hardship for one or more undertakings that have benefited from the condition. In such cases further transitional arrangements may be granted by the Commission, upon request by a Member State.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 38\n\n\nSince the objectives of the proposed action, namely the harmonisation and simplification of electronic communications rules and conditions for the authorisation of networks and services cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

The information exchanged should be limited to that which is relevant and proportionate to the purpose of such an exchange.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(60)Electronic communications broadband networks are becoming increasingly diverse in terms of technology, topology, medium used and ownership, therefore, regulatory intervention must rely on detailed information and forecasts regarding network roll-out in order to be effective and to target the areas where it is needed. That information should include plans regarding both deployment of very high capacity networks, as well as significant upgrades or extensions of existing copper or other networks which might not match the performance characteristics of very high capacity networks in all respects, such as roll-out of fibre to the cabinet coupled with active technologies like vectoring. The level of detail and territorial granularity of the information that national regulatory authorities should gather should be guided by the specific regulatory objective, and should be adequate for the regulatory purposes that it serves. Therefore, the size of the territorial unit will also vary between Member States, depending on the regulatory needs in the specific national circumstances, and on the availability of local data. Level 3 in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is unlikely to be a sufficiently small territorial unit in most circumstances. National regulatory authorities should be guided by BEREC guidelines on best practice to approach such a task, and such guidelines will be able to rely on the existing experience of national regulatory authorities in conducting geographical surveys of networks roll-out. National regulatory authorities should make available tools to end-users as regards quality of service to contribute towards the improvement of their awareness of the available connectivity services.\n\n\n(61)In the case of specific and well defined digital exclusion areas, national regulatory authorities should have the possibility to organise a call for declarations of interest with the aim of identifying undertakings that are willing to invest in very high capacity networks. In the interests of predictable investment conditions, national regulatory authorities should be able to share information with undertakings expressing interest in deploying very high-speed networks on whether other types of network upgrades, including those below 100 Mbps download speed, are present or foreseen in the area in question.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 15 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(62)It is important that national regulatory\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and other competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities consult all interested parties on proposed decisions,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0give them sufficient time  to the complexity of the matter to provide their comments\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0, and take account of their comments before adopting a final decision. In order to ensure that decisions at national level do not have an adverse effect on the single market or other Treaty objectives, national regulatory authorities should also notify certain draft decisions to the Commission and other national regulatory authorities to give them the opportunity to comment. It is appropriate for national regulatory authorities to consult interested parties on all draft measures which have an effect on trade between Member States. The cases where the procedures referred to in Articles  6\u00a0\u00d6\u00a024\u00a0\u00d5 and 7\u00a0\u00d6\u00a034\u00a0\u00d5 apply are defined in this Directive and in the Specific Directives. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 49 (adapted)\n\n\n(63)In order to overcome existing shortcomings in terms of consumer consultation and to appropriately address the interests of citizens, Member States should put in place an appropriate consultation mechanism. Such a mechanism could take the form of a body which would, independently of the national regulatory authority and service providers, carry out research into consumer-related issues, such as consumer behaviour and mechanisms for changing suppliers, and which would operate in a transparent manner and contribute to the existing mechanisms for stakeholder consultation. Furthermore, a mechanism could be established for the purpose of enabling appropriate cooperation on issues relating to the promotion of lawful content.

Member States should take all necessary measures to avoid cross-border and harmful interference and cooperate with each other to that end. Upon request of one or more Member States or of the Commission, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group should be tasked with supporting the necessary cross-border coordination. Building on RSPG's proposed solution, an implementing measure may be required in some circumstances to definitively resolve cross-border interferences or to enforce under Union law a coordinated solution agreed by two or several Member States in bilateral negotiations.\n\n\n(68)The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) is a Commission high-level advisory group which was created by Commission Decision 2002/622/EC\n48\n to contribute to the development of the internal market and to support the development of a Union-level radio spectrum policy, taking into account economic, political, cultural, strategic, health and social considerations, as well as technical parameters. It should be composed of the heads of the bodies that have overall political responsibility for strategic spectrum policy. It should advise the Commission in developing strategic objectives, priorities and roadmaps for spectrum policy. This should further increase the visibility of spectrum policy in the various EU policy areas and help to ensure cross-sectorial coherence at national and Union level. It should also provide advice to the European Parliament and the Council upon their request. Moreover, the RSPG should also be the forum for the coordination of implementation by Member States of their obligations related to radio spectrum under this Directive and should play a central role in fields essential for the internal market such as cross-border coordination or standardisation. Technical or expert working groups could also be created to assist plenary meetings, at which strategic policy is framed through senior-level representatives of the Member States and the Commission.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 47 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(69)In the context of a competitive environment, the views of interested parties, including users and consumers, should be taken into account by national regulatory authorities when dealing with issues related to end-users' rights. \u00f0\u00a0Out-of-court dispute settlement procedures may constitute a fast and cost-efficient way end-users to enforce their rights, in particular for consumers and micro and small enterprises.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0For consumer disputes,\u00a0\u00d5 effective \u00f0\u00a0, non-discriminatory and inexpensive\u00a0\u00ef procedures \u00d6\u00a0to settle their\u00a0\u00d5 should be available to deal with disputes between consumers,  on the one hand, and undertakings providing\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0with providers of\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0publicly available \u00d6\u00a0electronic\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0communications services, on the other\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0are already ensured by Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n49\n in so far as relevant contractual disputes are concerned and the consumer is resident and the undertaking is established within the Union\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0. \u00f0\u00a0As many Member States have established dispute resolution procedures also for end-users other than consumers, to whom Directive 2013/11/EU does not apply, it is reasonable to maintain the sector-specific dispute resolution procedure for both consumers and, where Member States extend it, also for other end-users, in particular micro and small enterprises.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Member States should take full account of Commission Recommendation 98/257/EC of 30 March 1998 on the principles applicable to the bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes\n50\n.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0In view of the deep sectorial expertise of national regulatory authorities, Member States should enable the national regulatory authority to act as dispute settlement entity, through a separate body within that authority which should not be subject to any instructions.

Enforcement conditions should include the application of a \"use it or lose it\" solution to counter-balance long duration of rights. For that purpose, trading and leasing of spectrum should be considered as modalities which ensure effective use by the original right holder.

That includes for example the parameters for economic valuation of spectrum in compliance with this Directive, the specification of the regulatory and market-shaping measures such as the use of spectrum caps or reservation of spectrum or the imposition of wholesale access obligations, or the means to define the coverage conditions attached to rights of use.  A more convergent use and definition of such elements would be favoured by a coordination mechanism whereby BEREC, the Commission and the national regulatory authorities of the other Member States would review draft measures in advance of the granting of rights of use by a given Member Statein parallel to the national public consultation. The measure determined by the national regulatory authority can only be a subset of a wider national measure, which may more broadly consist of the granting, trade and lease, duration, renewal or the amendment of rights of use for radio spectrum as well as of the selection procedure or the conditions attached to the rights of use. Therefore, when notifying a draft measure, national regulatory authorities may provide information on other draft national measures related to the relevant selection procedure for limiting rights of use for radio spectrum which are not covered by the peer review mechanism. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 24 (adapted)\n\n\n(85)Where the harmonised assignment of radio frequencies to particular undertakings has been agreed at European level, Member States should strictly implement such agreements in the granting of rights of use of\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 radio frequencies from the national frequency usage plan.\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n\n(86)Member States should be encouraged to consider joint authorisations as an option when issuing rights of use where the expected usage covers cross-border situations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 58\n\n\n(87)Any Commission decision under Article 19(1)40(1)\u00a0of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) should be limited to regulatory principles, approaches and methodologies.

At national level, Member States are subject to the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC\u00a02015/1535/EU. Directive 95/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the use of standards for the transmission of television signals\n52\n did not mandate any specific digital television transmission system or service requirement. Through the Digital Video Broadcasting Group, European market players have developed a family of television transmission systems that have been standardised by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and have become International Telecommunication Union recommendations. Any decision to make the implementation of such standards mandatory should follow a full public consultation. Standardisation procedures under this Directive are without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC, Council Directive 73/23/EEC of 19 February 1973 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits\n53\n and Council Directive 89/336/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility\n54\nthe Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU, the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU and the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive 2014/30/EU.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 31\n\n\nInteroperability of digital interactive television services and enhanced digital television equipment, at the level of the consumer, should be encouraged in order to ensure the free flow of information, media pluralism and cultural diversity. It is desirable for consumers to have the capability of receiving, regardless of the transmission mode, all digital interactive television services, having regard to technological neutrality, future technological progress, the need to promote the take-up of digital television, and the state of competition in the markets for digital television services. Digital interactive television platform operators should strive to implement an open application program interface (API) which conforms to standards or specifications adopted by a European standards organisation. Migration from existing APIs to new open APIs should be encouraged and organised, for example by Memoranda of Understanding between all relevant market players. Open APIs facilitate interoperability, i.e. the portability of interactive content between delivery mechanisms, and full functionality of this content on enhanced digital television equipment. However, the need not to hinder the functioning of the receiving equipment and to protect it from malicious attacks, for example from viruses, should be taken into account.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(90)Providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services, or of both, should be required to take measures to safeguard the security of their networks and services, respectively. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures should ensure a level of security of networks and services appropriate to the risks posed. Security measures should take into account, as a minimum, all the relevant aspects of the following elements: as regards security of networks and facilities: physical and environmental security, security of supplies, access control to networks and integrity of networks; as regards incident handling: incident-handling procedures, incident detection capability, incident reporting and communication; as regards business continuity management: service continuity strategy and contingency plans, disaster recovery capabilities; and as regards monitoring, auditing and testing: monitoring and logging policies, exercise contingency plans, network and service testing, security assessments and compliance monitoring;  and compliance with international standards.\n\n\n(91)Given the growing importance of number-independent interpersonal communications services, it is necessary to ensure that they are also subject to appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific nature and economic importance. Providers of such services should thus ensure a level of security commensurate with the degree of risk posed to the security of the electronic communications services they provide. Given that providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services normally do not exercise actual control over the transmission of signals over networks, the degree of risk for such services can be considered in some respects lower than for traditional electronic communications services. Therefore, whenever it is justified by the actual assessment of the security risks involved, the security requirements for number-independent interpersonal communications services should be lighter. In that context, the providers should be able to decide about the measures they consider appropriate to manage the risks posed to the security of their services. The same approach should apply mutatis mutandis to interpersonal communications services which make use of numbers and which do not exercise actual control over signal transmission.\n\n\n(92)Competent authorities should ensure that the integrity and availability of public communications networks are maintained. The European Network and Information Security Agency ('ENISA') should contribute to an enhanced level of security of electronic communications by, amongst other things, providing expertise and advice, and promoting the exchange of best practices. The competent authorities should have the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers to request the information necessary to assess the level of security of networks or services. They should also have the power to request comprehensive and reliable data about actual security incidents that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services. They should, where necessary, be assisted by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) established under Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148/EU\n55\n. In particular, CSIRTs may be required to provide competent authorities with information about risks and incidents affecting public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services and recommend ways to address them.\n\n\n(93)Where the provision of electronic communications relies on public resources whose use is subject to specific authorisation, Member States may grant the authority competent for issuance thereof the right to impose fees to ensure optimal use of those resource, in accordance with the procedures envisaged in this Directive, In line with the case-law of the Court of Justice, Member States cannot levy any charges or fees in relation to the provision of networks and electronic communications services other than those provided for by this Directive. In that regard, Member States should have a coherent approach in establishing those charges or fees in order not to provide an undue financial burden linked to the general authorisation procedure or rights of use for undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 32\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(94)\u00f0\u00a0To ensure optimal use of resources, fees should reflect the economic and technical situation of the market concerned as well as any other significant factor determinaning their value. At the same time, fees should be set in a manner that enables innovation in the provision of networks and services as well as competition in the market. Member States should therefore ensure that fees for rights of use are established on the basis of a mechanism which provides for appropriate safeguards against outcomes whereby the value of the fees is distorted as a result of revenue maximisation policies, anticompetitive bidding or equivalent behaviour.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0 In addition to administrative charges, usage fees may be levied for the use of radio frequencies and numbers as an instrument to ensure the optimal use of such resources. Such fees should not hinder the development of innovative services and competition in the market.This Directive is without prejudice to the purpose for which fees for rights of use \u00f0\u00a0and rights to install facilities\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0are employed. Such fees may for instance be used to finance activities of national regulatory authorities \u00f0\u00a0and competent authorities\u00a0\u00ef that cannot be covered by administrative charges. Where, in the case of competitive or comparative selection procedures, fees for rights of use for radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef consist entirely or partly of a one-off amount, payment arrangements should ensure that such fees do not in practice lead to selection on the basis of criteria unrelated to the objective of ensuring optimal use of radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef . The Commission may publish on a regular basis benchmark studies \u00f0\u00a0and other guidance as appropriate\u00a0\u00ef with regard to best practices for the assignment of radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef, the assignment of numbers or the granting of rights of way.  \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(95)In line with their role of ensuring optimal use of radio spectrum, fees linked to rights of use for radio spectrum can influence decisions about whether to seek such rights and put into use radio spectrum resources. When setting reserve prices as a means to determine the minimum valuation ensuring optimal use, Member States should therefore ensure that such prices, irrespective of the type of selection procedure used, also reflect the additional costs associated with the fulfilment of authorisation conditions imposed to further policy objectives that would not reasonably be expected to be met pursuant to normal commercial standards, such as territorial coverage conditions. In doing so, regard should also be had to the competitive situation of the market concerned.\n\n\n(96)Optimal use of radio spectrum resources depends on the availability of appropriate networks and associated facilities. In that regard, fees for rights of use for radio spectrum and for rights to install facilities should take into consideration the need to facilitate continuous infrastructure development with a view to achieving the most efficient use of the resources. Member States should therefore provide for modalities for payment of the fees for rights of use for radio spectrum linked with the actual availability of the resource in a manner that facilitates the investments necessary to promote such development. The modalities should be specified in an objective, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory manner before opening procedures for the granting of rights of use for spectrum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 22\n\n\n(97) It should be ensured that procedures exist for the granting of rights to install facilities that are timely, non-discriminatory and transparent, in order to guarantee the conditions for fair and effective competition. This Directive is without prejudice to national provisions governing the expropriation or use of property, the normal exercise of property rights, the normal use of the public domain, or to the principle of neutrality with regard to the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 42\n\n\n(98)Permits issued to undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services allowing them to gain access to public or private property are essential factors for the establishment of electronic communications networks or new network elements. Unnecessary complexity and delay in the procedures for granting rights of way may therefore represent important obstacles to the development of competition. Consequently, the acquisition of rights of way by authorised undertakings should be simplified. National regulatory authorities should be able to coordinate the acquisition of rights of way, making relevant information accessible on their websites.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(99)It is necessary to strengthen the powers of the Member States as regards holders of rights of way to ensure the entry or roll-out of a new network in a fair, efficient and environmentally responsible way and independently of any obligation on an operator with significant market power to grant access to its electronic communications network. Improving facility sharing can significantly improve competition and lower the overall financial and environmental cost of deploying electronic communications infrastructure for undertakings, particularly of new access networks\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and serve public health, public security and meet town and country planning objectives\u00a0\u00ef . National regulatory\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities should be empowered to require that the holders\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0undertakings which have benefitted from\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0of the rights to install facilities on, over or under public or private property share such facilities or property (including physical co-location) in order to encourage efficient investment in infrastructure and the promotion of innovation, after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties should be given the opportunity to state their views \u00f0 , in the specific areas where such general interest reasons impose such sharing. That can be the case for instance where the subsoil is highly congested or where a natural barrier needs to be crossed. \u00ef\u00a0Such sharing or coordination arrangements may include rules for apportioning the costs of the facility or property sharing and should ensure that there is an appropriate reward of risk for the undertakings concerned. National regulatory\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities should in particular be able to impose the sharing of network elements and associated facilities, such as ducts, conduits, masts, manholes, cabinets, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions, buildings or entries into buildings, and a better coordination of civil works \u00f0\u00a0on environmental or other public-policy grounds. On the contrary, it should be for national regulatory authorities to define rules for apportioning the costs of the facility or property sharing, to ensure that there is an appropriate reward of risk for the undertakings concerned \u00ef. \u00d6\u00a0In the light of the obligations imposed by Directive 2014/61/EU,\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Tthe competent authorities, particularly local authorities, should also establish appropriate coordination procedures, in cooperation with national regulatory authorities, with respect to public works and other appropriate public facilities or property which may include procedures that ensure that interested parties have information concerning appropriate public facilities or property and ongoing and planned public works, that they are notified in a timely manner of such works, and that sharing is facilitated to the maximum extent possible. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 23\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nFacility sharing can be of benefit for town planning, public health or environmental reasons, and should be encouraged by national regulatoryauthorities on the basis of voluntary agreements. In cases where undertakings are deprived of access to viable alternatives, compulsory facility or property sharing may be appropriate. It covers inter alia: physical co-location and duct, building, mast, antenna or antenna system sharing. Compulsory facility or property sharing should be imposed on undertakings only after full public consultation.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 24\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(100)Where mobile operators are required to share towers or masts for environmental reasons, such mandated sharing may lead to a reduction in the maximum transmitted power levels allowed for each operator for reasons of public health, and this in turn may require operators to install more transmission sites to ensure national coverage. \u00f0\u00a0Competent authorities should seek to reconcile the environmental and public health considerations in question, taking due account of the precautionary approach set out in Council Recommendation No 1999/519/EC.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 29\n\n\n\n\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to Member States' obligations to provide any information necessary for the defence of Communityinterests within the context of international agreements.

Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision)\n56\n establishes a framework for harmonisation of radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0, and action taken under this Directive should seek to facilitate the work under that Decision. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 25 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(102)Radio spectrum policy activities in the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 should be without prejudice to measures taken, at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 or national level, in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular with regard to content regulation and audiovisual and media policies, and the right of Member States to organise and use their radio spectrum for the purposes of public order, public security and defence.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0As use of spectrum for military and other national public security purposes impacts on the availability of spectrum for the internal market, radio spectrum policy should take into account all sectors and aspects of Union policies and balance their respective needs, while respecting Member States' rights.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(103)Ensuring ubiquitous connectivity in each Member State is essential for economic and social development, participation in public life and social and territorial cohesion. As connectivity becomes an integral element to European society and welfare, EU-wide coverage should be achieved by relying on imposition by Member States of appropriate coverage requirements, which should be adapted to each area served and limited to proportionate burdens in order not to hinder deployment by service providers. Coverage of the territory as well as connectivity across Member States should be maximised and reliable, with a view to promote in-border and cross-border services and applications such as connected cars and e-health. Therefore, in order to increase regulatory certainty and predictability of investment needs and to guarantee  proportionate and equitable connectivity for all citizens, application by competent authorities of coverage obligations should be coordinated at Union level. Considering national specificities, such coordination should be limited to general criteria to be used to define and measure coverage obligations, such as population density or topographical and topological features. \n\n\n(104)The need to ensure that citizens are not exposed to electromagnetic fields at a level harmful to public health should be approached in a consistent way across the Union, having particular regard to the precautionary approach taken in Council Recommendation No 1999/519/EC\n57\n, in order to ensure consistent deployment conditions.\n\n\n(105) Spectrum harmonisation and coordination and equipment regulation supported by standardisation are complementary need to be coordinated closely to meet their joint objectives effectively, with the support of the RSPG. Coordination between the content and timing of mandates to CEPT under the Radio Spectrum Decision and standardisation requests to standardisation bodies, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, including with regard to radio receivers parameters,  should facilitate the introduction of future systems, support spectrum sharing opportunities and ensure efficient spectrum management.\n\n\n(106)The demand for harmonised radio spectrum is not uniform in all parts of the Union. In cases where there is lack of demand for a harmonised band at regional or national level, Member States could exceptionally be able to allow an alternative use of the band as long as such lack of demand persists and provided that the alternative use does not prejudice the harmonised use of the said band by other Member States and that it ceases when demand for the harmonised use materialises.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 34 (adapted)\n\n\n(107)Flexibility in spectrum management and access to spectrum \u00d6\u00a0has been established\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0should be increased through technology and service-neutral authorisations to allow spectrum users to choose the best technologies and services to apply in frequency bands declared available for electronic communications services in the relevant national frequency allocation plans in accordance with \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Community law (the \u2018principles of technology and service neutrality\u2019).

On the other hand, measures should be allowed which require the provision of a specific service to meet clearly defined general interest objectives such as safety of life, the need to promote social, regional and territorial cohesion, or the avoidance of the inefficient use of spectrum to be permitted where necessary and proportionate. Those objectives should include the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism as defined by Member States in conformity with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law. Except where necessary to protect safety of life or, exceptionally, to fulfil other general interest objectives as defined by Member States in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, exceptions should not result in certain services having exclusive use, but should rather grant them priority so that, in so far as possible, other services or technologies may coexist in the same band.

This basic concept of harmful interference should therefore be properly defined to ensure that regulatory intervention is limited to the extent necessary to prevent such interference,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0having regard also to the need for network equipment and end-user devices to incorporate resilient receiver technology. Transport has a strong cross-border element and its digitalisation brings challenges. Vehicles (metro,  bus, cars, trucks, trains, etc) are becoming more and more autonomous and connected. In an EU single market, vehicles travel beyond national borders more easily.

Shared use of spectrum increasingly ensures its effective and efficient use by allowing several independent users or devices to access the same frequency band under various types of legal regimes so as to make additional spectrum resources available, raise usage efficiency and facilitate spectrum access for new users. Shared use can be based on general authorisations or licence-exempt use allowing, under specific sharing conditions, several users to access and use the same spectrum in different geographic areas or at different moments in time. It can also be based on individual rights of use under arrangements such as licenced shared access where all users (with an existing user and new users) agree on the terms and conditions for shared access, under the supervision of the competent authorities, in such a way as to ensure a minimum guaranteed radio transmission quality. When allowing shared use under different authorisation regimes, Member States should not set widely diverging durations for such use under different authorisation regimes.\n\n\n(114)In order to ensure predictability and preserve legal certainty and investment stability, Member States should define in advance appropriate criteria to determine compliance with the objective of efficient use of spectrum by right holders when implementing the conditions attached to individual rights of use and general authorisations. Interested parties should be involved in the definition of such conditions and informed in a transparent manner about how the fulfilment of their obligations will be assessed.\n\n\n(115)Considering the importance of technical innovation, Member States should be able to provide for rights  to use spectrum for experimental purposes, subject to specific restrictions and conditions strictly justified by the experimental nature of such rights.\n\n\n(116)Network infrastructure sharing, and in some instances spectrum sharing, can allow for a more efficient and effective use of radio spectrum and ensure the rapid deployment of networks, especially in less densely populated areas. When defining the conditions to be attached to rights of use for radio spectrum, competent authorities should also consider authorising forms of sharing or coordination between undertakings with a view to ensure effective and efficient use of spectrum or compliance with coverage obligations, in compliance with competition law principles.\n\n\n\n\n(117)Market conditions as well as the relevance and number of players can differ amongst Member States. While the need and opportunity to attach conditions to rights of use for radio spectrum can be subject to national specificities which should be duly accommodated, the modalities of the application of such obligations should be coordinated at EU level through Commission implementing measures to ensure a consistent approach in addressing similar challenges across the EU.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recitals 12 and 13 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(118)\u00f0\u00a0The requirements of service and technology neutrality in granting rights of use, together with the possibility to transfer rights between undertakings, underpin\u00a0 the freedom and means to deliver electronic communications services to the public, thereby also facilitating the achievement of general interest objectives.\u00a0\u00ef This Directive does not prejudice whether radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0is\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0are assigned directly to providers of electronic communications networks or services or to entities that use these networks or services.

Where such information is not provided, the application for the right to use a radio frequency may be rejected.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(119)Member States should only impose, prior to the granting of right, the verification of elements that can reasonably be demonstrated by an applicant exercising ordinary care, taking due account of the important public and market value of radio spectrum as a scarce public resource. This is without prejudice to the possibility for subsequent verification of the fulfilment of eligibility criteria, for example through milestones, where criteria could not reasonably be met initially. To preserve effective and efficient use of radio spectrum, Member States should not grant rights where their review indicates applicants' inability to comply with the conditions, without prejudice to the possibility of facilitating time-limited experimental use.Sufficiently long duration of authorisations for the use of spectrum should increase investment predictability to contribute to faster network roll-out and better services, as well as stability to support spectrum trading and leasing. Unless use of spectrum is authorised for an unlimited period of time, such duration should both take account of the objectives pursued and be sufficient to facilitate recoupment of the investments made. While a longer duration can ensure investment predictability, measures to ensure effective and efficient use of radio spectrum, such as the power of the competent authority to amend or withdraw the right in case of non-compliance with the conditions attached to the rights of use, or the facilitation of radio spectrum tradability and leasing, will serve to prevent inappropriate accumulation of radio spectrum and support greater flexility in distributing spectrum ressources. Greater recourse to annualised fees is also a means to ensure a continuous assessment of the use of the spectrum by the holder of the right. \n\n\n(120)In deciding whether to renew already granted rights of use for radio spectrum, competent authorities should take into account the extent to which renewal would further the objectives of the regulatory framework and other objectives under national and Union law. Any such decision should be subject to an open, non-discriminatory and transparent procedure and based on a review of how the conditions attached to the rights concerned have been fulfilled. When assessing the need to renew rights of use, Member States should weigh the competitive impact of extending already assigned rights against the promotion of more efficient exploitation or of innovative new uses that might result if the band were opened to new users. Competent authorities may make their determination in this regard by allowing for only a limited extension in order to prevent severe disruption of established use. While decisions on whether to extend rights assigned prior to the applicability of this Directive should respect any rules already applicable, Member States should equally ensure that they do not prejudice the objectives of this Directive.\n\n\n(121)When renewing existing rights of use, Member States should, together with the assessment of the need to renew the right, review the fees attached thereto with a view to ensuring that those fees continue to promote optimal use, taking account amongst other things, of the stage of market and technological evolution. For reasons of legal certainty, it is appropriate for any adjustments to the existing fees to be based on the same principles as those applicable to the award of new usage rights. \n\n\n(122)Effective management of radio spectrum can be ensured by  facilitating the continued efficient use of spectrum that has already been assigned. In order to ensure legal certainty to rights holders, the possibility of renewal of rights of use should be considered within an appropriate time-span prior to the expiry of the rights concerned. In the interest of continuous resource management, competent authorities should be able to undertake such consideration at their own initiative as well as in response to a request from the assignee. The renewal of the right to use may not be granted contrary to the will of the assignee.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 39 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(123)\u00f0\u00a0Transfer of spectrum usage rights can be an effective means of increasing the efficient use of spectrum.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0In the interests\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0For the sake\u00a0\u00d5 of flexibility and efficiency, \u00f0\u00a0and to allow valuation of spectrum by the market,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0national regulatory authorities may\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Member States should by default\u00a0\u00ef allow spectrum users freely to transfer or lease their \u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef usage rights to third parties  \u00f0\u00a0following a simple procedure and subject to the conditions attached to such rights and to competition rules, under the supervision of the national regulatory authorities responsible\u00a0\u00ef .

Spectrum assignment conditions can influence the competitive situation in electronic communications markets and conditions for entry. Limited access to spectrum, in particular when spectrum is scarce, can create a barrier to entry or hamper investment, network roll-out, the provision of new services or applications, innovation and competition.  New rights of use, including those acquired through transfer or leasing, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can also influence existing competition. Where unduly applied, certain conditions used to promote competition,  can have other effects; for example, spectrum caps and reservations can create artificial scarcity, wholesale access obligations can unduly constrain business models in the absence of market power, and limits on transfers can impede the development of secondary markets. Therefore, a consistent and objective competition test for the imposition of such conditions is necessary and should be applied consistently. The use of such measures should therefore be based on a thorough and objective assessment, by national regulatory authorities, of the market and the competitive conditions thereof.\n\n\n(125)Building on opinions from the RSPG, the adoption of a common deadline for allowing the use of a band which has been harmonised under the Radio Spectrum Decision can be necessary to avoid cross-border interferences and beneficial to ensure release of the full benefits of the related technical harmonisation measures for equipment markets and for the deployment of very high capacity electronic communications networks and services. In order to significantly contribute to the objectives of this framework and facilitate coordination, the establishment of such common deadlines should  be subject to Commission implementing  acts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recitals 21 and 22 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(126)Where the demand for \u00d6\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d5radio frequencies in a specific\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0range\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0band\u00a0\u00d5 exceeds their availability \u00f0\u00a0and, as a result, a Member State concludes that the  rights of use for radio spectrum must be limited\u00a0\u00ef , appropriate and transparent procedures should be followed\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0apply\u00a0\u00d5 for the assignment\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0granting\u00a0\u00d5 of such frequencies\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0rights\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0in order to avoid any discrimination and optimise \u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 use of those\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the\u00a0\u00d5 scarce resources. \u00f0\u00a0Such limitation should be justified, proportionate and based on a thorough assessment of market conditions, giving due weight to the overall benefits for users and to national and internal market objectives. The objectives governing any limitation procedure should be clearly defined in advance. When considering the most appropriate selection procedure, and in compliance with coordination measures taken at Union level, Member States should timely and transparently consult all interested partieson the justification, objectives and conditions of the procedure.\u00a0\u00ef Member States may use, inter alia, competitive or comparative selection procedures for the assignment of radio frequencies\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0as well as\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0or for\u00a0\u00d5 numbers with exceptional economic value.

It would therefore not be contrary to this Directive if the application of objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate selection criteria to promote the development of competition would have the effect of excluding certain undertakings from a competitive or comparative selection procedure for a particular radio frequency. A Member State may find that further rights can be made available in a band. In this case it should start the process of making such rights available.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(127)Massive growth in radio spectrum demand, and in end-user demand for wireless broadband capacity, calls for solutions allowing alternative, complementary, spectrally efficient access solutions, including low-power wireless access systems with a small-area operating range such as radio local area networks (RLAN) and networks of low-power small-size cellular access points. Such complementary wireless access systems, in particular publicly accessible RLAN access points, increase access to the internet for end-users and mobile traffic off-loading for mobile operators. RLANs use harmonised radio spectrum without requiring an individual authorisation or spectrum usage right. Most RLAN access points are so far used by private users as  local wireless extension of their fixed broadband connection. End-users, within the limits of their own internet subscription, should not be prevented from sharing access to their RLAN with others, so as to increase the number of available access points, particularly in densely populated areas, maximise wireless data capacity through radio spectrum re-use and create a cost-effective complementary wireless broadband infrastructure accessible to other end-users. Therefore, unnecessary restrictions to the deployment and interlinkage of RLAN access points should also be removed. Public authorities or public service providers, who use RLANs  in their premises for their personnel, visitors or clients, for example to facilitate access to e-Government services or for information on public transport or road traffic management, could also provide access to such access points for general use by citizens as an ancillary service to services they offer to the public on such premises, to the extent allowed by competition and public procurement rules. Moreover, the provider of such local access to electronic communications networks within or around a private property or a limited public area on a non-commercial basis or as an ancillary service to another activity that is not dependant on such access (such as RLAN hotspots made available to customers of other commercial activities or to the general public in that area) can be subject to compliance with general authorisations for rights of use for radio spectrum but should not be subject to any conditions or requirements attached to general authorisations applicable to providers of public communications networks or services or to obligations regarding end-users or interconnection. However, such provider should remain subject to the liability rules of Article 12 of Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce\n58\n. Further technologies such as LiFi are emerging that will complement current radio spectrum capabilities of RLANs and wireless access point to include optical visible light-based access points and lead to hybrid local area networks allowing optical wireless communication. \n\n\n(128)Since low power small-area wireless access points are very small and make use of unobtrusive equipment similar to that of domestic RLAN routers and considering their positive impact on the use of spectrum and on the development of wireless communications, their technical characteristics - such as power output- should be specified at Union level in a proportionate way for local deployment and their use should be subject to general authorisations only \u2013 to the exception of RLAN  which should not be subject to any authorisation requirement beyond what is necessary for the use of radio spectrum - and any additional restrictions under individual planning or other permits should be limited to the greatest extent possible.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(129)Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)\n59\n lays down the objectives of a regulatory framework to cover electronic communications networks and services in the Community, including fixed and mobile telecommunications networks, cable television networks, networks used for terrestrial broadcasting, satellite networks and Internet networks, whether used for voice, fax, data or images. Such networks may have been authorised by Member States under Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)\n60\n or have been authorised under previous regulatory measures. The provisions of this Directive \u00d6\u00a0as regards access and interconnection\u00a0\u00d5 apply to those networks that are used for the provision of publicly available electronic communications services. This Directive covers access and interconnection arrangements between service suppliers. Non-public networks do not have \u00d6\u00a0access or interconnection\u00a0\u00d5 obligations under this Directive except where, in benefiting from access to public networks, they may be subject to conditions laid down by Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 2\n\n\nServices providing content such as the offer for sale of a package of sound or television broadcasting content are not covered by the common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n(130)The term \u2018access\u2019 has a wide range of meanings, and it is therefore necessary to define precisely how that term is used in  this Directive, without prejudice to how it may be used in other Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 measures. An operator may own the underlying network or facilities or may rent some or all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 5\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(131)In an open and competitive market, there should be no restrictions that prevent undertakings from negotiating access and interconnection arrangements between themselves, in particular on cross-border agreements, subject to the competition rules of the Treaty. In the context of achieving a more efficient, truly pan-European market, with effective competition, more choice and competitive services to consumers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef , undertakings which receive requests for access or interconnection \u00f0\u00a0from other undertakings which are subject to general authorisation in order to provide electronic communications networks or services to the public\u00a0\u00ef should in principle conclude such agreements on a commercial basis, and negotiate in good faith.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(132)In markets where there continue to be large differences in negotiating power between undertakings, and where some undertakings rely on infrastructure provided by others for delivery of their services, it is appropriate to establish a framework to ensure that the market functions effectively. National regulatory authorities should have the power to secure, where commercial negotiation fails, adequate access and interconnection and interoperability of services in the interest of end-users. In particular, they may\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0can\u00a0\u00d5 ensure end-to-end connectivity by imposing proportionate obligations on undertakings that \u00f0\u00a0are subject to the general authorisation and that\u00a0\u00ef control access to end-users. Control of means of access may entail ownership or control of the physical link to the end-user (either fixed or mobile), and/or the ability to change or withdraw the national number or numbers needed to access an end-user's network termination point. This would be the case for example if network operators were to restrict unreasonably end-user choice for access to Internet portals and services.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(133)In the light of the principle of non-discrimination, national regulatory authorities should ensure that all operators, irrespective of their size and business model, whether vertically integrated or separated, can interconnect on reasonable terms and conditions, with the view to providing end-to-end connectivity and access to the global Internet.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 7\n\n\n(134)National legal or administrative measures that link the terms and conditions for access or interconnection to the activities of the party seeking interconnection, and specifically to the degree of its  investment in network infrastructure, and not to the interconnection or access services provided, may cause market distortion and may therefore not be compatible with competition rules.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 8\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(135)Network operators who control access to their own customers do so on the basis of unique numbers or addresses from a published numbering or addressing range. Other network operators need to be able to deliver traffic to those customers, and so need to be able to interconnect directly or indirectly to each other. The existing\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0It is therefore appropriate to lay down\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0rights and obligations to negotiate interconnection should therefore be maintained. It is also appropriate to maintain the obligations formerly laid down in Directive 95/47/EC requiring fully digital electronic communications networks used for the distribution of television services and open to the public to be capable of distributing wide-screen television services and programmes, so that users are able to receive such programmes in the format in which they were transmitted.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 9\n\n\n\n\n(136)Interoperability is of benefit to end-users and is an important aim of this regulatory framework. Encouraging interoperability is one of the objectives for national regulatory authorities as set out in this framework, which also provides for the Commission to publish a list of standards and/or specifications covering the provision of services, technical interfaces and/or network functions, as the basis for encouraging harmonisation in electronic communications. Member States should encourage the use of published standards and/or specifications to the extent strictly necessary to ensure interoperability of services and to improve freedom of choice for users.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(137)Currently both end-to-end connectivity and access to emergency services depend on end-users adopting number-based interpersonal communications services. Future technological developments or an increased use of number-independent interpersonal communications services could entail a lack of sufficient interoperability between communications services. As a consequence significant barriers to market entry and obstacles to further onward innovation could emerge and appreciably threaten both effective end-to-end connectivity between end-users and effective access to emergency services. \n\n\n(138)In case such interoperability issues arise, the Commission may request a BEREC report which should provide a factual assessment of the market situation at the Union and Member States level. On the basis of the BEREC report and other available evidence and taking into account the effects on the internal market, the Commission should decide whether there is a need for regulatory intervention by national regulatory authorities. If the Commission considers that such regulatory intervention should be considered by National Regulatory Authorities, it may adopt implementing measures specifying the nature and scope of possible regulatory interventions by NRAs, including in particular measures to impose the mandatory use of standards or specifications on all or specific providers. The terms 'European standards' and 'international standards' are defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01025/2012.\n61\n National regulatory authorities should assess, in the light of the specific national circumstances, whether any intervention is necessary and justified to ensure end-to-end-connectivity or access to emergency services, and if so, impose proportionate obligations in accordance with the Commission implementing measures.\n\n\n(139)In situations where undertakings are deprived of access to viable alternatives to non-replicable assets up to the first distribution point, national regulatory authorities should be empowered to impose access obligations to all operators, without prejudice to their respective market power. In this regard, national regulatory authorities should take into consideration all technical and economic barriers to future replication of networks. The mere fact that more than one such infrastructure already exists should not necessarily be interpreted as showing that its assets are replicable. The first distribution point should be identified by reference to objective criteria. \n\n\n(140)It could be justified to extend access obligations to wiring and cables beyond the first concentration point in areas with lower population density, while confining such obligations to points as close as possible to end-users, where it is demonstrated that replication would also be impossible beyond that first concentration point \n\n\n(141)In such cases, in order to comply with the principle of proportionality, it can be appropriate for national regulatory authorities to exclude certain categories of owners or undertakings, or both, from obligations going beyond the first distribution point, on the grounds that an access obligation not based on significant market power would risk compromising their business case for recently deployed network elements. Structurally separated undertakings should not be subject to such access obligations if they offer an effective alternative access on a commercial basis to a very high capacity network.\n\n\n(142)Sharing of passive or active infrastructure used in the provision of wireless electronic communications services, or the joint roll-out of such infrastructures, in compliance with competition law principles can be particularly useful to maximise very high capacity connectivity throughout the Union, especially in less dense areas where replication is impracticable and end-users risk being deprived of such connectivity. National regulatory authorities should, exceptionally, be enabled to impose such sharing or joint roll-out, or localised roaming access, in compliance with Union law, if they demonstrate the benefits of such sharing or access in terms of overcoming very significant barriers to replication and of addressing otherwise severe restrictions on end-user choice or quality of service, or both, or on territorial coverage, and taking into account several elements, including in particular the need to maintain infrastructure roll-out incentives.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 65 (adapted)\n\n\n(143)While it is appropriate in some circumstances for a national regulatory authority to impose obligations on operators that do not have significant market power in order to achieve goals such as end-to-end connectivity or interoperability of services, it is however necessary to ensure that such obligations are imposed in conformity with the EU regulatory framework and, in particular, its notification procedures.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(144)Competition rules alone may not be sufficient to ensure cultural diversity and media pluralism in the area of digital television. Directive 95/47/EC provided an initial regulatory framework for the nascent digital television industry which should be maintained, including in particular the obligation to provide conditional access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, in order to make sure that a wide variety of programming and services is available. Technological and market developments make it necessary to review these obligations \u00f0\u00a0to provide conditional access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms\u00a0\u00ef on a regular basis, either by a Member State for its national market or the Commission for the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , in particular to determine whether there is justification for extending obligations to new gateways, such as electronic programme guides (EPGs) and application programme interfaces (APIs), to the extent that is necessary to ensure accessibility for end-users to specified digital broadcasting services. Member States may specify the digital broadcasting services to which access by end-users must be ensured by any legislative, regulatory or administrative means that they deem necessary.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 11\n\n\n(145)Member States may also permit their national regulatory authority to review obligations in relation to conditional access to digital broadcasting services in order to assess through a market analysis whether to withdraw or amend conditions for operators that do not have significant market power on the relevant market. Such withdrawal or amendment should not adversely affect access for end-users to such services or the prospects for effective competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\nIn order to ensure continuity of existing agreements and to avoid a legal vacuum, it is necessary to ensure that obligations for access and interconnection imposed under Articles 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 14 of Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of open network provision (ONP)\n62\n, obligations on special access imposed under Article 16 of Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 1998 on the application of open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment\n63\n, and obligations concerning the provision of leased line transmission capacity under Council Directive 92/44/EEC of 5 June 1992 on the application of open network provision to leased lines\n64\n, are initially carried over into the new regulatory framework, but are subject to immediate review in the light of prevailing market conditions. Such a review should also extend to those organisations covered by Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop\n65\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 13 (adapted)\n\n\nThe review should be carried out using an economic market analysis based on competition law methodology. The aim is to reduce ex ante sector specific rules progressively as competition in the market develops. However the procedure also takes account of transitional problems in the market such as those related to international roaming and of the possibility of new bottlenecks arising as a result of technological development, which may require ex ante regulation, for example in the area of broadband access networks. It may well be the case that competition develops at different speeds in different market segments and in different Member States, and national regulatory authorities should be able to relax regulatory obligations in those markets where competition is delivering the desired results. In order to ensure that market players in similar circumstances are treated in similar ways in different Member States, the Commission should be able to ensure harmonised application of the provisions of this Directive. National regulatory authorities and national authorities entrusted with the implementation of competition law should, where appropriate, coordinate their actions to ensure that the most appropriate remedy is applied. The Community and its Member States have entered into commitments on interconnection of telecommunications networks in the context of the World Trade Organisation agreement on basic telecommunications and these commitments need to be respected.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 14 (adapted)\n\n\nDirective 97/33/EC laid down a range of obligations to be imposed on undertakings with significant market power, namely transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation, access, and price control including cost orientation. This range of possible obligations should be maintained but, in addition, they should be established as a set of maximum obligations that can  be applied to undertakings, in order to avoid over-regulation. Exceptionally, in order to comply with international commitments or Community law, it may be appropriate to impose obligations for access or interconnection on all market players, as is currently the case for conditional access systems for digital television services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 25 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(146)There is a need for ex ante obligations in certain circumstances in order to ensure the development of a competitive market,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0the conditions of which favour the deployment and take-up of very high capacity connectivity and the maximisation of end-user benefits\u00a0\u00ef. The definition of significant market power in the Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the  principles of open network provision (ONP)\n66\nhas proved effective in the initial stages of market opening as the threshold for ex ante obligations, but now needs to be adapted to suit more complex and dynamic markets. For this reason, the definition used in this Directive is equivalent to the concept of dominance as defined in the case law of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of the European Communities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 26\n\n\n(147)Two or more undertakings can be found to enjoy a joint dominant position not only where there exist structural or other links between them but also where the structure of the relevant market is conducive to coordinated effects, that is, it encourages parallel or aligned anti-competitive behaviour on the market.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 27 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(148) It is essential that ex ante regulatory obligations should only be imposed \u00f0\u00a0on a wholesale market\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0where there is not effective competition, i.e. in markets where there are one or more undertakings with significant market power, \u00f0\u00a0with a view to ensure sustainable competition on a related retail market\u00a0\u00ef, and where national and Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 competition law remedies are not sufficient to address the problem. It is necessary therefore for\u00a0tThe Commission \u00d6\u00a0has\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0to drawn up guidelines at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level in accordance with the principles of competition law for national regulatory authorities to follow in assessing whether competition is effective in a given market and in assessing significant market power. National regulatory authorities should analyse whether a given product or service market is effectively competitive in a given geographical area, which could be the whole or a part of the territory of the Member State concerned or neighbouring parts of territories of Member States considered together. An analysis of effective competition should include an analysis as to whether the market is prospectively competitive, and thus whether any lack of effective competition is durable. Those guidelines will\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 also address the issue of newly emerging markets, where de facto the market leader is likely to have a substantial market share but should not be subjected to inappropriate obligations. The Commission should review the guidelines regularly,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0in particular on the occasion of a review of the existing legislation, taking into account evolving case law, economic thinking and actual market experience and with a view\u00a0\u00ef to ensureing that they remain appropriate in a rapidly developing market. National regulatory authorities will need to cooperate with each other where the relevant market is found to be transnational.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 28 (adapted)\n\n\n(149)In determining whether an undertaking has significant market power in a specific market, national regulatory authorities should act in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law and take into the utmost account the Commission guidelines\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on market analysis and the assessment of significant market power\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(150)National regulatory authorities should define relevant geographic markets within their territory taking into utmost account the Commission Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets adopted in accordance with this Directive and taking into account national and local circumstances. Therefore, national regulatory authorities should at least analyse the markets that are contained in the Recommendation, including those markets that are listed but no longer regulated in the specific national or local context. National regulatory authorities should also analyse markets that are not contained in that Recommendation, but are regulated within the territory of their jurisdiction on the basis of previous market analyses, or other markets, if they have sufficient grounds to consider that the three criteria test provided in this Directive may be met.\n\n\n(151)Transnational markets can be defined when it is justified by the geographic market definition, taking into account all supply-side and demand-side factors in accordance with competition law principles. BEREC is the most appropriate body to undertake such analysis, benefiting from the extensive collective experience of national regulatory authorities when defining markets on a national level. If transnational markets are defined and warrant regulatory intervention, concerned national regulatory authorities should cooperate to identify the appropriate regulatory response, including in the process of notification to the Commission. They can also cooperate in the same manner where transnational markets are not identified but on their territories market conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to benefit from a coordinated regulatory approach, such as for example in terms of similar costs, market structures or operators or in case of transnational or comparable end-user demand.\n\n\n(152)In some circumstances geographic markets are defined as national or sub-national, for example due to the national or local nature of network roll-out which determines the boundaries of undertakings' potential market power in respect of wholesale supply, but there still is a significant transnational demand from one or more categories of end-users. That can in particular be the case for demand from business end-users with multisite facility operations in different Member States. If that transnational demand is not sufficiently met by suppliers, for example if they are fragmented along national borders or locally, a potential internal market barrier arises. Therefore, BEREC should be empowered to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities on common regulatory approaches to ensure that transnational demand can be met in a satisfactory way, permitting efficiencies and economies of scale despite the fragmented supply side. BEREC's guidelines should shape the choices of national regulatory authorities in pursuing the internal market objective when imposing regulatory obligations on SMP operators at the national level.\n\n\n(153)If national regulatory authorities have not followed the common approach recommended by BEREC to meet the identified transnational demand, with the consequence that transnational end-user demand is not efficiently met, and that avoidable barriers to the internal market arise, it could be necessary to harmonise the technical specifications of wholesale access products capable of meeting a given transnational demand, taking into account the BEREC guidelines.\n\n\n(154)The objective of any ex ante regulatory intervention is ultimately to produce benefits for end-users in terms of price, quality and choice by making retail markets effectively competitive on a sustainable basis. It is likely that national regulatory authorities will gradually be able to find many retail markets to be competitive even in the absence of wholesale regulation, especially taking into account expected improvements in innovation and competition. \n\n\n(155)For national regulatory authorities the starting point for the identification of wholesale markets susceptible to ex ante regulation is the analysis of corresponding retail markets. The analysis of effective competition at the retail and at the wholesale level is conducted from a forward-looking perspective over a given time horizon, and is guided by competition law, including the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice, as appropriate. If it is concluded that a retail markets would be effectively competitive in the absence of ex ante wholesale regulation on the corresponding relevant market(s), this should lead the national regulatory authority to conclude that regulation is no longer needed at the relevant wholesale level. \n\n\n(156)During the gradual transition to deregulated markets, commercial agreements between operators will gradually become more common, and if they are sustainable and improve competitive dynamics, they can contribute to the conclusion that a particular wholesale market does not warrant ex ante regulation. A similar logic would apply in reverse, to unforeseeable termination of commercial agreements on a deregulated market. The analysis of such agreements should take into account that the prospect of regulation can be a motive for network owners to enter into commercial negotiations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a view to ensure adequate consideration of the impact of regulation imposed on related markets when determining whether a given market warrants ex ante regulation, national regulatory authorities should ensure markets are analysed in a coherent manner and where possible, at the same time or as close as possible to each other in time.\n\n\n(157)When assessing wholesale regulation to solve problems at the retail level, national regulatory authorities should take into account that several wholesale markets can provide wholesale upstream inputs for a particular retail market, and conversely, one wholesale market can provide wholesale upstream inputs for a variety of retail markets.\u00a0 Furthermore, competitive dynamics in a particular market can be influenced by markets that are contiguous but not in a vertical relationship, such as can be the case between certain fixed and mobile markets. National regulatory authorities should conduct that assessment for each individual wholesale market considered for regulation, starting with remedies for access to civil infrastructure, as such remedies are usually conducive to more sustainable competition including infrastructure competition, and thereafter analysing any wholesale markets considered susceptible to ex ante regulation in order of their likely suitability to address identified competition problems at retail level. \u00a0When deciding on the specific remedy to be imposed, national regulatory authorities should assess its technical feasibility and carry out a cost-benefit analysis, having regard to its degree of suitability to address the identified competition problems at retail level. National regulatory authorities should consider the consequences of imposing any specific remedy which, if feasible only on certain network topologies, could constitute a disincentive for the deployment of very high capacity networks in the interest of end-users. At each stage of the assessment, before the national regulatory authority determines whether any additional remedy should be imposed on the significant market power operator, it should seek to determine whether the retail market concerned would be effectively competitive in the light of any relevant commercial arrangements or other wholesale market circumstances, including other types of regulation already in force, such as for example general access obligations to non-replicable assets or obligations imposed pursuant to Directive 2014/61/EU, and of any regulation already deemed appropriate by the national regulatory authority for an operator with significant market power. Even if such differences do not result in the definition of distinct geographic markets, they may justify differentiation in the appropriate remedies imposed in the light of the diferring intensity of competitive constraints.\n\n\n(158)Ex ante regulation imposed at the wholesale level, which is in principle less intrusive than retail regulation, is considered sufficient to tackle potential competition problems on the related downstream retail market or markets. The advances in the functioning of competition since the regulatory framework for electronic communications has been in place are demonstrated by the progressive deregulation of retail markets across the Union. Further, the rules relating to the imposition of ex ante remedies on undertakings with significant market power should be simplified and be made more predictable, where possible.  Therefore, the power of imposition of ex ante regulatory controls based on significant market power in retail markets should be repealed. \n\n\n(159)When a national regulatory authority withdraws wholesale regulation it should define an appropriate period of notice to ensure a sustainable transition to a de-regulated market. In defining such period, the national regulatory authority should take into account the existing agreements between access providers and access seekers that have been entered into on the basis of the imposed regulatory obligations. In particular, such agreements can provide a contractual legal protection to access seekers for a determined period of time. The national regulatory authority should also take into account the effective possibility for market participants to take up any commercial wholesale access or co-investment offers which can be present in the market and the need to avoid an extended period of possible regulatory arbitrage. Transition arrangements established by the national regulatory authority should consider the extent and timing of regulatory oversight of pre-existing agreements, once the notice period starts.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 48\n\n\n(160)In order to provide market players with certainty as to regulatory conditions, a time limit for market reviews is necessary. It is important to conduct a market analysis on a regular basis and within a reasonable and appropriate time frame. The time frame should take account of whether the particular market has previously been subject to market analysis and duly notified. Failure by a national regulatory authority to analyse a market within the time limit may jeopardise the internal market, and normal infringement proceedings may not produce their desired effect on time. Alternatively, the national regulatory authority concerned should be able to request the assistance of BEREC to complete the market analysis. For instance, this assistance could take the form of a specific task force composed of representatives of other national regulatory authorities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 49 (adapted)\n\n\n(161)Due to the high level of technological innovation and highly dynamic markets in the electronic communications sector, there is a need to adapt regulation rapidly in a coordinated and harmonised way at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level, as experience has shown that divergence among the national regulatory authorities in the implementation of the EU regulatory framework may create a barrier to the development of the internal market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(162)However, in the interest of greater stability and predictability of regulatory measures, the maximum period allowed between market analyses should be extended from three to five years, provided market changes in the intervening period do not require a new analysis. In determining whether a national regulatory authority has complied with its obligation to analyse markets and notified the corresponding draft measure at a minimum every five years, only a notification including a new assessment of the market definition and of significant market power will be considered as starting a new five-year market cycle. A mere notification of new or amended regulatory remedies, imposed on the basis of a previous and unrevised market analysis will not be considered to have satisfied that obligation. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 15\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(163)The imposition of a specific obligation on an undertaking with significant market power does not require an additional market analysis but a justification that the obligation in question is appropriate and proportionate in relation to the nature of the problem identified \u00f0\u00a0on the market in question, and on the related retail market\u00a0\u00ef .\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 56\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(164)When assessing the proportionality of the obligations and conditions to be imposed, national regulatory authorities should take into account the different competitive conditions existing in the different areas within their Member States \u00f0\u00a0having regard in particular to the results of the geographical survey conducted in accordance with this Directive\u00a0\u00ef .\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 57 (adapted)\n\n\n(165)When \u00d6\u00a0considering whether to\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0imposeing remedies to control prices,\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0and if so in what form\u00a0\u00d5 , national regulatory authorities should seek to allow a fair return for the investor on a particular new investment project. In particular, there may be risks associated with investment projects specific to new access networks which support products for which demand is uncertain at the time the investment is made.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(166)Reviews of obligations imposed on operators designated as having significant market power during the timeframe of a market analysis should allow national regulatory authorities  to take into account the impact on competitive conditions of new developments, for instance of newly concluded voluntary agreements between operators, such as access and co-investment agreements, thus providing the flexibility which is particularly necessary in the context of longer regulatory cycles. A similar logic should apply in case of unforeseeable termination of commercial agreements. If such termination occurs in a deregulated market, a new market analysis may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n(167)Transparency of terms and conditions for access and interconnection, including prices, serve to speed up negotiation, avoid disputes and give confidence to market players that a service is not being provided on discriminatory terms. Openness and transparency of technical interfaces can be particularly important in ensuring interoperability. Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to make information public, it may also specify the manner in which the information is to be made available, covering for example the type of publication (paper and/or electronic) and whether or not it is free of charge, taking into account the nature and purpose of the information concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(168)In light of the variety of network topologies, access products and market circumstance that have arisen since 2002, the objectives of Annex II of the Directive 2002/19/EC, concerning local loop unbundling, and access products for providers of digital television and radio services, can be better achieved and in a more flexible manner, by providing guidelines on the minimum criteria for a reference offer to be developed by and periodically updated by BEREC. Annex II of the Directive 2002/19/EC should therefore be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 17\n\n\n\n(169)The principle of non-discrimination ensures that undertakings with market power do not distort competition, in particular where they are vertically integrated undertakings that supply services to undertakings with whom they compete on downstream markets.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(170)In order to address and prevent non-price related discriminatory behaviour, equivalence of inputs (EoI) is in principle the surest way to achieve effective protection from discrimination. On the other hand, providing regulated wholesale inputs on an EoI basis is likely to trigger higher compliance costs than other forms of non-discrimination obligations. Those higher compliance costs should be measured against the benefits of more vigorous competition downstream, and of the relevance of non-discrimination guarantees in circumstances where the operator with significant market power is not subject to direct price controls. In particular, national regulatory authorities might consider that the provision of wholesale inputs over new systems on an EoI basis is more likely to create sufficient net benefits, and thus be proportionate, given the comparatively lower incremental compliance costs to ensure that newly built systems are EoI-compliant. On the other hand, national regulatory authorities should also weigh up possible disincentives to the deployment of new systems, relative to more incremental upgrades, in the event that the former would be subject to more restrictive regulatory obligations. In Member States with a high number of small-scale SMP operators, the imposition of EoI on each of these operators can be disproportionate.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 18\n\n\n(171)Accounting separation allows internal price transfers to be rendered visible, and allows national regulatory authorities to check compliance with obligations for non-discrimination where applicable. In this regard the Commission published Recommendation 98/322/EC of 8 April 1998 on interconnection in a liberalised telecommunications market (Part 2 \u2014 accounting separation and cost accounting)\n67\n\u00a02005/698/EC of 19 September 2005 on accounting separation and cost accounting systems.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(172)Civil engineering assets that can host an electronic communications network are crucial for the successful roll-out of new very high capacity networks because of the high cost of duplicating them, and the significant savings that can be made when they can be reused. Therefore, in addition to the rules on physical infrastructure laid down in Directive 2014/61/EU, a specific remedy is necessary in those circumstances where civil engineering assets are owned by an operator designated with significant market power. Where civil engineering assets exist and are reusable, the positive effect of achieving effective access to them on the roll-out of competing infrastructure is very high, and it is therefore necessary to ensure that access to such assets can be used as a self-standing remedy for the improvement of competitive and deployment dynamics in any downstream market, to be considered before assessing the need to impose any other potential remedies, and not just as an ancillary remedy to other wholesale products or services or as a remedy limited to undertakings availing of such other wholesale products or services. National regulatory authorities should value reusable legacy civil engineering assets on the basis of the regulatory accounting value net of the accumulated depreciation at the time of calculation, indexed by an appropriate price index, such as the retail price index, and excluding those assets which are fully depreciated, over a period of not less than 40 years, but still in use.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 55 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(173)National regulatory authorities should, when imposing obligations for access to new and enhanced infrastructures, ensure that access conditions reflect the circumstances underlying the investment decision, taking into account, inter alia, the roll-out costs, the expected rate of take up of the new products and services and the expected retail price levels. Moreover, in order to provide planning certainty to investors, national regulatory authorities should be able to set, if applicable, terms and conditions for access which are consistent over appropriate review periods. \u00f0\u00a0In the event that price controls are deemed appropriate,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0sSuch terms and conditions \u00d6\u00a0can\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0may include pricing arrangements which depend on volumes or length of contract in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law and provided they have no discriminatory effect. Any access conditions imposed should respect the need to preserve effective competition in services to consumers and businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 19\n\n\n(174)Mandating access to network infrastructure can be justified as a means of increasing competition, but national regulatory authorities need to balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure for its own benefit, and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(175)In geographic areas where two access networks can be expected on a forward-looking basis, end-users are more likely to benefit from improvements in network quality, by virtue of infrastructure-based competition, than in areas where only one network persists. The adequacy of competition on other parameters, such as price and choice, is likely to depend on the national and local competitive circumstances. Where at least one of the network operators offers wholesale access to any interested undertaking on reasonable commercial terms permitting sustainable competition on the retail market, national regulatory authorities are unlikely to need to impose or maintain SMP-based wholesale access obligations, beyond access to civil infrastructure, thereforereliance can be placed on the application of general competition rules. This applies a fortiori if both network operators offer reasonable commercial wholesale access. In both such cases, it may be more appropriate for national regulatory authorities to rely on specific monitoring on an ex post basis. Where on a forward-looking basis, three access network operators are present or are expected to be present and to sustainably compete in the same retail and wholesale markets (e.g. as can be the case for mobile, and as can occur in some geographic areas for fixed-line networks, especially where there is effective access to civil infrastructure and/or co-investment, such that three or more operators have effective control over the necessary access network assets to meet retail demand), national regulatory authorities will be less likely to identify an operator as having SMP,  unless they  make a finding of collective dominance, or if each of the undertakings in question has significant market power in distinct wholesale markets, such as in the case of voice call termination markets. The application of general competition rules in such markets characterised by sustainable and effective infrastructure-based competition should be sufficient.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 19 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(176)Mandating access to network infrastructure can be justified as a means of increasing competition, but national regulatory authorities need to balance the rights of an infrastructure owner to exploit its infrastructure forits own benefit, and the rights of other service providers to access facilities that are essential for the provision of competing services.\u00a0Where obligations are imposed on operators that require them to meet reasonable requests for access to and use of networks elements and associated facilities, such requests should only be refused on the basis of objective criteria such as technical feasibility or the need to maintain network integrity. Where access is refused, the aggrieved party may submit the case to the dispute resolutions procedure referred to in Articles 20\u00a027\u00a0and 21\u00a028\u00a0of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). An operator with mandated access obligations cannot be required to provide types of access which are\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0it is\u00a0\u00d5 not within its powers to provide. The imposition by national regulatory authorities of mandated access that increases competition in the short term should not reduce incentives for competitors to invest in alternative facilities that will secure more \u00f0\u00a0sustainable\u00a0\u00ef competition \u00d6\u00a0and/or higher performance and end-user benefits\u00a0\u00d5 in the long-term. The Commission has published a Notice on the application of the competition rules to access agreements in the telecommunications sector\n68\n which addresses these issues. National regulatory authorities may impose technical and operational conditions on the provider and/or beneficiaries of mandated access in accordance with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law. In particular the imposition of technical standards should comply with Directive\u00a01535/2015/EU\u00a098/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules of Information Society Services\n69\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 20 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(177)Price control may be necessary when market analysis in a particular market reveals inefficient competition. The regulatory intervention may be relatively light, such as an obligation that prices for carrier selection are reasonable as laid down in Directive 97/33/EC, or much heavier such as an obligation that prices are cost oriented to provide full justification for those prices where competition is not sufficiently strong to prevent excessive pricing. In particular, operators with significant market power should avoid a price squeeze whereby the difference between their retail prices and the interconnection \u00d6\u00a0and/or access\u00a0\u00d5 prices charged to competitors who provide similar retail services is not adequate to ensure sustainable competition. When a national regulatory authority calculates costs incurred in establishing a service mandated under this Directive, it is appropriate to allow a reasonable return on the capital employed including appropriate labour and building costs, with the value of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the current valuation of assets and efficiency of operations. The method of cost recovery should be appropriate to the circumstances taking account of the need to promote efficiency,\u00a0and sustainable competition\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and deployment of very high capacity networks\u00a0\u00ef and \u00d6\u00a0thereby\u00a0\u00d5 maximise consumer\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-user\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0benefits,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0and should take in account the need to have predictable and stable wholesale prices for the benefit of all operators seeking to deploy new and enhanced networks, in accordance with Commission guidance\n70\n.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(178)Due to uncertainty regarding the rate of materialisation of demand for the provision of next-generation broadband services it is important in order to promote efficient investment and innovation to allow those operators investing in new or upgraded networks a certain degree of pricing flexibility. To prevent excessive prices in markets where there are operators designated as having significant market power, pricing flexibility should be accompanied by additional safeguards to protect competition and end-user interests, such as strict non-discrimination obligations, measures to ensure technical and economic replicability of downstream products, and a demonstrable retail price constraint resulting from infrastructure competition or a price anchor stemming from other regulated access products, or both. Those competitive safeguards do not prejudice the identification by national regulatory authorities of other circumstances under which it would be appropriate not to impose regulated access prices for certain wholesale inputs, such as where high price elasticity of end-user demand makes it unprofitable for the operator with significant market power to charge prices appreciably above the competitive level.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 21\n\n\n(179)Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to implement a cost accounting system in order to support price controls, it may itself undertake an annual audit to ensure compliance with that cost accounting system, provided that it has the necessary qualified staff, or it may require the audit to be carried out by another qualified body, independent of the operator concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(180)The charging system in the Union for wholesale voice call termination is based on Calling Party Network Pays. An analysis of demand and supply substitutability shows that currently or in the foreseeable future, there are as yet no substitutes at wholesale level which might constrain the setting of charges for termination in a given network. Taking into account the two-way access nature of termination markets, further potential competition problems include cross-subsidisation between operators. These potential competition problems are common to both fixed and mobile voice call termination markets. Therefore, in the light of the ability and incentives of terminating operators to raise prices substantially above cost, cost orientation is considered the most appropriate intervention to address this concern over the medium term. \n\n\n(181)In order to reduce the regulatory burden in addressing the competition problems relating to wholesale voice call termination coherently across the Union, this Directive should lay down a common approach as a basis for setting price control obligations, to be completed by a binding common methodology to be determined by the Commission and by technical guidance which should be developed by BEREC. \n\n\n(182)In order to simplify their setting and facilitate their imposition where appropriate, wholesale voice call termination rates in fixed and mobile markets in the Union shall be set by means of a delegated act. This Directive should lay down the detailed criteria and parameters on the basis of which the values of voice call termination rates are set. In applying that set of criteria and parameters, the Commission should take into account, inter alia, that only those costs which are incremental to the provision of wholesale call termination service should be covered; that spectrum fees are subscriber- and not traffic-driven and should therefore be excluded and that additional spectrum is mainly allocated for data and therefore not relevant for the call termination increment; that it is recognised that while in mobile networks a minimum efficient scale is estimated at the level of at least 20% market share, in the fixed networks smaller operators can achieve the same efficiencies and produce at the same unit costs as the efficient operator, independently of their size. When setting the exact maximum rate, the Commission should include appropriate weighting to take into account the total number of end-users in each Member State, where this is required on account of remaining cost divergences. When the Commission determines that rate, the experience of BEREC and the national regulatory authorities in building suitable cost models will be invaluable and should be taken into account. \n\n\n(183)This Directive sets maximum wholesale voice call termination rates for fixed and mobile networks below which the initial delegated act will establish the exact rate to be applied by national regulatory authorities. The initial rate will be further updated. Based on the bottom-up pure LRIC models applied by national regulators to date and applying the above criteria the voice termination rates currently vary from 0.4045 \u20accent per minute to 1.226 \u20accent per minute in mobile networks and between 0.0430 \u20accent per minute and 0.1400 \u20accent per minute in fixed networks in the most local layer of interconnection (calculated as a weighted average between peak and off-peak rates). The variation in rates is due to different local conditions and relative price structures currently existing as well as to the different timing of the model calculations across Member States. In addition, in fixed networks the level of cost efficient termination rates depends also on the network layer where the termination service is provided. \n\n\n(184)Due to current uncertainty regarding the rate of materialisation of demand for very high capacity broadband services as well as general economies of scale and density, co-investment agreements offer significant benefits in terms of pooling of costs and risks, enabling smaller-scale operators to invest on economically rational terms and thus promoting sustainable, long-term competition, including in areas where infrastructure-based competition might not be efficient. Where an operator with significant market power makes an open call for co-investment on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms in new network elements which significantly contribute to the deployment of very high capacity networks, the national regulatory authority should typically refrain from imposing obligations pursuant to this Directive on the new network elements, subject to further review in subsequent market analyses.  Provided due account is taken of the prospective pro-competitive effects of the co-investment at wholesale and retail level, national regulatory authorities can still consider it appropriate, in light of the existing market structure and dynamics developed under regulated wholesale access conditions, and in the absence of a commercial offer to that effect, to safeguard the rights of access seekers who do not participate in a given co-investment through the maintenance of existing access products or \u2013 where legacy network elements are dismantled in due course \u2013 through imposition of access products with comparable functionality to those previously available on the legacy infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 61\n\n\n(185)The purpose of functional separation, whereby the vertically integrated operator is required to establish operationally separate business entities, is to ensure the provision of fully equivalent access products to all downstream operators, including the operator\u2019s own vertically integrated downstream divisions. Functional separation has the capacity to improve competition in several relevant markets by significantly reducing the incentive for discrimination and by making it easier to verify and enforce compliance with non-discrimination obligations. In exceptional cases, functional separation may be justified as a remedy where there has been persistent failure to achieve effective non-discrimination in several of the markets concerned, and where there is little or no prospect of infrastructure competition within a reasonable time frame after recourse to one or more remedies previously considered to be appropriate. However, it is very important to ensure that its imposition preserves the incentives of the concerned undertaking to invest in its network and that it does not entail any potential negative effects on consumer welfare. Its imposition requires a coordinated analysis of different relevant markets related to the access network, in accordance with the market analysis procedure set out in Article 6716\u00a0of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). When undertaking the market analysis and designing the details of this remedy, national regulatory authorities should pay particular attention to the products to be managed by the separate business entities, taking into account the extent of network roll-out and the degree of technological progress, which may affect the substitutability of fixed and wireless services. In order to avoid distortions of competition in the internal market, proposals for functional separation should be approved in advance by the Commission.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 62\n\n\n(186)The implementation of functional separation should not prevent appropriate coordination mechanisms between the different separate business entities in order to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company are protected. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 64 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(187)Where a vertically integrated undertaking chooses to transfer a substantial part or all of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership or by establishing a separate business entity for dealing with access products, the national regulatory authority should assess the effect of the intended transaction,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0including any access commitments offered by this undertaking\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0, on all existing regulatory obligations imposed on the vertically integrated operator in order to ensure the compatibility of any new arrangements with \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive2002/19/EC (Access Directive) and Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive) . The national regulatory authority concerned should undertake a new analysis of the markets in which the segregated entity operates, and impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations accordingly. To this end, the national regulatory authority should be able to request information from the undertaking.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(188)Binding commitments can add predictability and transparency to the process of voluntary separation by a vertically integrated undertaking which has been designated as having significant market power in one or more relevant markets, by setting out the process of implementation of the planned separation, for example by providing a roadmap for implementation with clear milestones and predictable consequences if certain milestones are not met. National regulatory authorities should consider the commitments made from a forward-looking perspective of sustainability, in particular when choosing the period for which they are made binding, and should have regard to the value placed by stakeholders in the public consultation on stable and predictable market conditions. \n\n\n(189)The commitments can include the appointment of a monitoring trustee, whose identity and mandate should be approved by the national regulatory authority and the obligation on the operator offering them to provide periodic implementation reports. \n\n\n\n\n(190)Network owners that do not have retail market activities and whose business model is therefore limited to the provision of wholesale services to others, can be beneficial to the creation of a thriving wholesale market, with positive effects on retail competition downstream. Furthermore, their business model can be attractive to potential financial investors in less volatile infrastructure assets and with longer term perspectives on deployment of very high capacity networks. Nevertheless, the presence of a wholesale-only operator does not necessarily lead to effectively competitive retail markets, and wholesale-only operators can be designated with significant market power in particular product and geographic markets. The competition risks arising from the behaviour of operators following wholesale-only business models  might be lower than for vertically integrated operators, provided the wholesale-only model is genuine and no incentives to discriminate between downstream providers exist. The regulatory response should therefore be commensurately less intrusive. On the other hand, national regulatory authorities must be able to intervene if competition problems have arisen to the detriment of end-users. \n\n\n(191)To facilitate the migration from legacy copper networks to next-generation networks, which is in the interests of end-users, national regulatory authorities should be able to monitor network operators' own initiatives in this respect and to establish, where necessary, an appropriate migration process, for example by means of prior notice, transparency and acceptable comparable access products, once the intent and readiness by the network owner to switch off the copper network is clearly demonstrated. In order to avoid unjustified delays to the migration, national regulatory authorities should be empowered to  withdraw access obligations relating to the copper network once an adequate migration process has been established.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\n(192) The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector and increasing competition and choice for communications services go hand in hand with parallel action to create a harmonised regulatory framework which secures the delivery of universal service. The concept of universal service should evolve to reflect advances in technology, market developments and changes in user demand. The regulatory framework established for the full liberalisation of the telecommunications market in 1998 in the Community defined the minimum scope of universal service obligations and established rules for its costing and financing.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n(193)Under Article 153\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0169\u00a0\u00d5 of the Treaty \u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 , the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 is to contribute to the protection of consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\n\nThe Community and its Member States have undertaken commitments on the regulatory framework of telecommunications networks and services in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement on basic telecommunications. Any member of the WTO has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the member.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 51 (adapted)\n\n\nSince the objectives of the proposed action, namely setting a common level of universal service for telecommunications for all European users and of harmonising conditions for access to and use of public telephone networks at a fixed location and related publicly available telephone services and also achieving a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic communications services, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale or effects of the action be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 5\n\n\nIn a competitive market, certain obligations should apply to all undertakings providing publicly available telephone services at fixed locations and others should apply only to undertakings enjoying significant market power or which have been designated as a universal service operator.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(194)Universal service is a safety net to ensure that a set of minimum services is available to all end-users at an affordable price, where a risk of social exclusion arising from the lack of such access prevents citizens from full social and economic participation in society.\n\n\n\n\n(195)Basic boadband internet access is virtually universally available across the Union and very widely used for a wide range of activities. However, the overall take-up rate is lower than availability as there are still those who are disconnected by reasons related to awareness, cost, skills and by choice. Affordable functional internet access has become of crucial importance to society and the wider economy. It provides the basis for participation in the digital economy and society through essential online internet services.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(196)A fundamental requirement of universal service is to \u00d6\u00a0ensure that all end-users have access at an affordable price to available functional internet access and voice communications services, at least\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0provide users on request with a connection to the public telephone network at a fixed location, at an affordable price. \u00f0\u00a0Member States should also have the possibility to ensure affordability of services not provided at a fixed location but to citizens on the move, where they deem this necessary to ensure their full social and economic participation in society.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0The requirement is limited to a single narrowband network connection, the provision of which may be restricted by Member States to the end-user's primary location/residence, and does not extend to the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) which provides two or more connections capable of being used simultaneously. There should be no constraints\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0limitations\u00a0\u00d5 on the technical means by which the connection is provided, allowing for wired or wireless technologies, nor any constraints\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0limitations\u00a0\u00d5 on which\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the category of\u00a0\u00d5 operators \u00d6\u00a0which\u00a0\u00d5 provide part or all of universal service obligations. Connections to the public telephone network at a fixed location should be capable of supporting speech and data communications at rates sufficient for access to online services such as those provided via the public Internet. The speed of Internet access experienced by a given user may depend on a number of factors including the provider(s) of Internet connectivity as well as the given application for which a connection is being used. The data rate that can be supported by a single narrowband connection to the public telephone network depends on the capabilities of the subscriber's terminal equipment as well as the connection. For this reason it is not appropriate to mandate a specific data or bit rate at Community level. Currently available voice band modems typically offer a data rate of 56 kbit/s and employ automatic data rate adaptation to cater for variable line quality, with the result that the achieved data rate may be lower than 56 kbit/s. Flexibility is required on the one hand to allow Member States to take measures where necessary to ensure that connections are capable of supporting such a data rate, and on the other hand to allow Member States where relevant to permit data rates below this upper limit of 56 kbits/s in order, for example, to exploit the capabilities of wireless technologies (including cellular wireless networks) to deliver universal service to a higher proportion of the population. This may be of particular importance in some accession countries where household penetration of traditional telephone connections remains relatively low. In specific cases where the connection to the public telephony network at a fixed location is clearly insufficient to support satisfactory Internet access, Member States should be able to require the connection to be brought up to the level enjoyed by the majority of subscribers so that it supports data rates sufficient for access to the Internet. Where such specific measures produce a net cost burden for those consumers concerned, the net effect may be included in any net cost calculation of universal service obligations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 5\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(197)Data connections to the public communications network at a fixed location should be capable of supporting data communications at rates sufficient for access to online services such as those provided via the public Internet.

The data rate that can be supported by a connection to the public communications network depends on the capabilities of the subscriber\u2019s terminal equipment as well as the connection. For this reason, it is not appropriate to mandate a specific data or bit rate at Community level.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0The affordable functional internet access service should be sufficient in order to support access to and use of a minimum set of basic services that reflect the services used by the majority of end-users. This minimum list of services should be further defined by Member States, in order to allow an adequate level of social inclusion and participation in the digital society and economy in their territory.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Flexibility is required to allow Member States to take measures, where necessary, to ensure that a data connection is capable of supporting satisfactory data rates which are sufficient to permit functional Internet access, as defined by the Member States, taking due account of specific circumstances in national markets, for instance the prevailing bandwidth used by the majority of subscribers in that Member State, and technological feasibility, provided that these measures  seek to minimise market distortion. Where such measures result in an unfair burden on a designated undertaking, taking due account of the costs and revenues as well as the intangible benefits resulting from the provision of the services concerned, this may be included in any net cost calculation of universal obligations. Alternative financing of underlying network infrastructure, involving Community funding or national measures in accordance with Community law, may also be implemented.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(198)End-users should not be obliged to access services they do not want and it should therefore be possible for eligible end-users to limit, on request, the affordable universal service to voice communications service only.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 17\n\n\n(199) National regulatory authorities should be able to monitor the evolution and level of retail tariffs for services that fall under the scope of universal service obligations, even where a Member State has not yet designated an undertaking to provide universal service. In such a case,\u00a0tThe monitoring should be carried out in such a way that it would not represent an excessive administrative burden for either national regulatory authorities or undertakings providing such service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(200)Affordable price means a price defined by Member States at national level in the light of specific national conditions, and may involve setting common tariffs irrespective of location or special tariff options \u00f0\u00a0or packages\u00a0\u00ef to deal with the needs of low-income users \u00d6\u00a0or users with special social needs, including the elderly, the disabled and the end-users living in rural or geographically isolated areas. These offers should be provided with basic features, in order to avoid distortion of the functioning of the market.\u00a0\u00d5 Affordability for individual consumers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users should be founded upon\u00a0\u00ef their \u00f0\u00a0right to contract with an undertaking, availability of a number, continued connection of service and their\u00a0\u00ef ability to monitor and control their expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(201)It should no longer be possible to refuse  end-users access to the minimum set of connectivity services.

In order to minimise the financial risks such as non-payment of bills, undertakings should be free to provide the contract under pre-payment terms, on the basis of affordable individual pre-paid units. \n\n\n(202)In order to ensure that citizens are reachable by voice communications services, Member States should ensure the availability of a telephone number for a reasonable period also during periods of non-use of voice communications service. Undertakings should be able to put in place mechanisms to check the continued interest of the end-user in keeping the availability of the number.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\n(203)Ensuring universal service (that is to say, the provision of a defined minimum set of services to all end-users at an affordable price) may involve the provision of some services to some end-users at prices that depart from those resulting from normal market conditions.\u00a0However,cCompensating undertakings designated to providinge such services in such circumstances need not result in any distortion of competition, provided that designated\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0such\u00a0\u00d5 undertakings are compensated for the specific net cost involved and provided that the net cost burden is recovered in a competitively neutral way.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(204)In order to assess the need for affordability measures, national regulatory authorities should be able to monitor the evolution and details of offers of tariff options or packages for end-users with low incomes or special social needs.\n\n\n(205)Where additional measures beyond the basic tariff options or packages provided by undertakings are insufficient for ensuring affordability for end-users with low incomes or special needs, direct support such as for example vouchers to such end-users can be an appropriate alternative having regard to the need to minimise market distortions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(206)Member States should introduce measures to promote the creation of a market for \u00d6\u00a0affordable\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0widely available products and services incorporating facilities for disabled end-users\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0, including equipment with assistive technologies\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0.

The standard fixed broadband coverage and availability in the Union stands at 97% of homes in 2015, with an average take-up rate of 72%, and services based on wireless technologies have even greater reach. However, there are differences between Member States as regards availability and affordability of fixed broadband across urban and rural areas.\n\n\n(208)The market has a leading role to play in ensuring availability of broadband internet access with constantly growing capacity.In areas where the market would not deliver, other public policy tools to support availability of functional internet access connections appear, in principle, more cost-effective and less market-distortive than universal service obligations, for example recourse to financial instruments such as those available under EFSI and CEF, the use of public funding from the European structural and investment funds, attaching coverage obligations to rights of use for radio spectrum to support the deployment of broadband networks in less densely populated areas and public investment in conformity with Union State aid rules.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 4\n\n\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(209)A fundamental requirement of universal service is to provide users on request with a connection to the public communications network at a fixed location and at an affordable price.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0If after carrying out a due assessment, taking into account the results of the geographical survey of networks deployment conducted by the national regulatory authority,\u00a0it is shown that neither the market nor public intervention mechanisms are likely to provide end-users in certain areas with a connection capable of delivering functional internet access service as defined by Member States in accordance with Article 79 (2) and voice communications services at a fixed location, the Member State should be able to exceptionally designate different undertakings or sets of undertakings to provide these services in the different relevant parts of the national territory.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0The requirement is for the provision of local, national and international telephone calls, facsimile communications and data services, the provision of which\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Universal service obligations in support of availability of functional internet access\u00a0service \u00ef may be restricted by Member States to the end-user\u2019s primary location or residence.

This does not preclude that Member States may\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0can\u00a0\u00d5 include, in the designation process, specific conditions justified on grounds of efficiency, including, inter alia, grouping geographical areas or components or setting minimum periods for the designation.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(211)The costs of ensuring the availability of a connection capable of delivering functional internet access service as identified in accordance with Article 79\u00a0(2) and voice communications service at a fixed location at an affordable price within the universal service obligations should be estimated, in particular by assessing the expected financial burden for undertakings and users in the electronic communications sector.\n\n\n(212)A priori, requirements to ensure nation-wide territorial coverage imposed in the designation procedure are likely to exclude or dissuade certain undertakings from applying for being designated as universal service providers. Designating providers with universal service obligations for an excessive or indefinite time period may also lead to an a priori exclusion of certain undertakings.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 9\n\n\n The provisions of this Directive do not preclude Member States from designating different undertakings to provide the network and service elements of universal service. Designated undertakings providing network elements may be required to ensure such construction and maintenance as are necessary and proportionate to meet all reasonable requests for connection at a fixed location to the public telephone network and for access to publicly available telephone services at a fixed location.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\nDirectory information and a directory enquiry service constitute an essential access tool for publicly available telephone services and form part of the universal service obligation. Users and consumers desire comprehensive directories and a directory enquiry service covering all listed telephone subscribers and their numbers (including fixed and mobile numbers) and want this information to be presented in a non-preferential fashion. Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector\n72\n\u00a0ensures the subscribers' right to privacy with regard to the inclusion of their personal information in a public directory.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\nFor the citizen, it is important for there to be adequate provision of public pay telephones, and for users to be able to call emergency telephone numbers and, in particular, the single European emergency call number (\u2018112\u2019) free of charge from any telephone, including public pay telephones, without the use of any means of payment. Insufficient information about the existence of \u2018112\u2019 deprives citizens of the additional safety ensured by the existence of this number at European level especially during their travel in other Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 13\n\n\n\n\nMember States should take suitable measures in order to guarantee access to and affordability of all publicly available telephone services at a fixed location for disabled users and users with special social needs. Specific measures for disabled users could include, as appropriate, making available accessible public telephones, public text telephones or equivalent measures for deaf or speech-impaired people, providing services such as directory enquiry services or equivalent measures free of charge for blind or partially sighted people, and providing itemised bills in alternative format on request for blind or partially sighted people. Specific measures may also need to be taken to enable disabled users and users with special social needs to access emergency services \u2018112\u2019 and to give them a similar possibility to choose between different operators or service providers as other consumers. Quality of service standards have been developed for a range of parameters to assess the quality of services received by subscribers and how well undertakings designated with universal service obligations perform in achieving these standards. Quality of service standards do not yet exist in respect of disabled users. Performance standards and relevant parameters should be developed for disabled users and are provided for in Article 11 of this Directive. Moreover, national regulatory authorities should be enabled to require publication of quality of service performance data if and when such standards and parameters are developed. The provider of universal service should not take measures to prevent users from benefiting fully from services offered by different operators or service providers, in combination with its own services offered as part of universal service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 14\n\n\nThe importance of access to and use of the public telephone network at a fixed location is such that it should be available to anyone reasonably requesting it. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for Member States to decide on the basis of objective criteria which undertakings have universal service obligations for the purposes of this Directive, where appropriate taking into account the ability and the willingness of undertakings to accept all or part of the universal service obligations. It is important that universal service obligations are fulfilled in the most efficient fashion so that users generally pay prices that correspond to efficient cost provision. It is likewise important that universal service operators maintain the integrity of the network as well as service continuity and quality. The development of greater competition and choice provide more possibilities for all or part of the universal service obligations to be provided by undertakings other than those with significant market power. Therefore, universal service obligations could in some cases be allocated to operators demonstrating the most cost-effective means of delivering access and services, including by competitive or comparative selection procedures. Corresponding obligations could be included as conditions in authorisations to provide publicly available services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n(213)When an undertaking designated to provide universal service\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0ensure the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access or voice communications services\u00a0\u00d5 , as identified in Article 81 4 of \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive), chooses to dispose of a substantial part, viewed in light of its universal service obligation, or all, of its local access network assets in the national territory to a separate legal entity under different ultimate ownership, the national regulatory authority should assess the effects of the transaction in order to ensure the continuity of universal service obligations in all or parts of the national territory. To this end, the national regulatory authority which imposed the universal service obligations should be informed by the undertaking in advance of the disposal. The assessment of the national regulatory authority should not prejudice the completion of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(214)In order to provide stability and support a gradual transition, Member States should be able to continue to ensure the provision of universal services in their territory, other than functional internet access and voice communications services at a fixed location, that are included in the scope of their universal obligations on the basis of Directive 2002/22/EC at the entry into force of this Directive, provided the services or comparable services are not available under normal commercial circumstances. Allowing the continuation of the provision of public payphones, directories and directory enquiry services under the universal service regime, as long as the need is still demonstrated, would give Member States the flexibility necessary to duly take into account the varying national circumstances. However, the financing of such services should be done via public funds as for the other universal service obligations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 15 \n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(215)Member States should monitor the situation of consumers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0 with respect to their use of \u00f0\u00a0functional internet access and voice communications services\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0publicly available telephone services and in particular with respect to affordability. The affordability of \u00f0\u00a0functional internet access and voice communications services\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0telephone service is related to the information which users receive regarding telephone usage expenses as well as the relative cost of telephone usage compared to other services, and is also related to their ability to control expenditure. Affordability therefore means giving power to consumers through obligations imposed on undertakings designated as having universal service obligations. These obligations include a specified level of itemised billing, the possibility for consumers selectively to block certain calls (such as high-priced calls to premium services), the possibility for consumers to control expenditure via pre-payment means and the possibility for consumers to offset up-front connection fees. Such measures may need to be reviewed and changed in the light of market developments. Current conditions do not warrant a requirement for operators with universal service obligations to alert subscribers where a predetermined limit of expenditure is exceeded or an abnormal calling pattern occurs. Review of the relevant legislative provisions in future should consider whether there is a possible need to alert subscribers for these reasons.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(216)Except in cases of persistent late payment or non-payment of bills, consumers \u00f0\u00a0entitled to affordable tariffs\u00a0\u00ef should be protected from immediate disconnection from the network on the grounds of an unpaid bill and, particularly in the case of disputes over high bills for premium-rate services, should continue to have access to essential telephone\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0voice communications\u00a0\u00d5 services pending resolution of the dispute. Member States may decide that such access may continue to be provided only if the subscriber continues to pay line rental charges.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 17\n\n\n\n\nQuality and price are key factors in a competitive market and national regulatory authorities should be able to monitor achieved quality of service for undertakings which have been designated as having universal service obligations. In relation to the quality of service attained by such undertakings, national regulatory authorities should be able to take appropriate measures where they deem it necessary. National regulatory authorities should also be able to monitor the achieved quality of services of other undertakings providing public telephone networks and/or publicly available telephone services to users at fixed locations.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(217)Where the provision of functional internet access and voice communications services or the provision of other universal services in accordance with Article 85 result in an unfair burden on an undertaking, taking due account of the costs and revenues as well as the intangible benefits resulting from the provision of the services concerned, that unfair burden can be included in any net cost calculation of universal obligations.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n(218)Member States should, where necessary, establish mechanisms for financing the net cost of universal service obligations in cases where it is demonstrated that the obligations can only be provided at a loss or at a net cost which falls outside normal commercial standards. It is important to ensure that the net cost of universal service obligations is properly calculated and that any financing is undertaken with minimum distortion to the market and to undertakings, and is compatible with the provisions of Articles 87\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0107\u00a0\u00d5 and 88 108 of the Treaty\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 19\n\n\n(219)Any calculation of the net cost of universal service should take due account of costs and revenues, as well as the intangible benefits resulting from providing universal service, but should not hinder the general aim of ensuring that pricing structures reflect costs. Any net costs of universal service obligations should be calculated on the basis of transparent procedures.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 20\n\n\n(220)Taking into account intangible benefits means that an estimate in monetary terms, of the indirect benefits that an undertaking derives by virtue of its position as provider of universal service, should be deducted from the direct net cost of universal service obligations in order to determine the overall cost burden.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 21\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(221)When a universal service obligation represents an unfair burden on an undertaking, it is appropriate to allow Member States to establish mechanisms for efficiently recovering net costs. \u00f0\u00a0The net costs of universal service obligations should be recovered via public funds. Functional internet access brings benefits not only to the electronic communications sector but also to the wider online economy and to society as a whole. Providing a connection which supports broadband speeds to an increased number of end-users enables them to use online services and so actively to participate in the digital society. Ensuring such connections on the basis of universal service obligations serves at least as much the public interest as it serves the interests of electronic communications providers. Therefore Member States should compensate the net costs of such connections supporting broadband speeds as part of the universal service from public funds, which should be understood to comprise funding from general government budgets.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Recovery via public funds constitutes one method of recovering the net costs of universal service obligations. It is also reasonable for established net costs to be recovered from all users in a transparent fashion by means of levies on undertakings. Member States should be able to finance the net costs of different elements of universal service through different mechanisms, and/or to finance the net costs of some or all elements from either of the mechanisms or a combination of both. In the case of cost recovery by means of levies on undertakings, Member States should ensure that that the method of allocation amongst them is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria and is in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This principle does not prevent Member States from exempting new entrants which have not yet achieved any significant market presence. Any funding mechanism should ensure that market participants only contribute to the financing of universal service obligations and not to other activities which are not directly linked to the provision of the universal service obligations. Recovery mechanisms should in all cases respect the principles of Community law, and in particular in the case of sharing mechanisms those of non-discrimination and proportionality. Any funding mechanism should ensure that users in one Member State do not contribute to universal service costs in another Member State, for example when making calls from one Member State to another.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 22 \n\n\nWhere Member States decide to finance the net cost of universal service obligations from public funds, this should be understood to comprise funding from general government budgets including other public financing sources such as state lotteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 23\n\n\nThe net cost of universal service obligations may be shared between all or certain specified classes of undertaking. Member States should ensure that the sharing mechanism respects the principles of transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and proportionality. Least market distortion means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 24 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(222)National regulatory authorities should satisfy themselves that those uUndertakings benefiting from universal service funding \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 provide \u00d6\u00a0to national regulatory authorities\u00a0\u00d5 a sufficient level of detail of the specific elements requiring such funding in order to justify their request. Member States' schemes for the costing and financing of universal service obligations should be communicated to the Commission for verification of compatibility with the Treaty. There are incentives for designated operators to raise the assessed net cost of universal service obligations. Therefore Member States should ensure effective transparency and control of amounts charged to finance universal service obligations. \u00f0\u00a0Calculation of the net costs of providing universal service should be based on an objective and transparent methodology to ensure the most cost-effective provision of universal service and promote a level playing field for market operators. Making the methodology intended to be used to calculate the net costs of individual universal service elements known in advance before implementing the calculation could help to achieve increased transparency.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 25\n\n\nCommunications markets continue to evolve in terms of the services used and the technical means used to deliver them to users. The universal service obligations, which are defined at a Community level, should be periodically reviewed with a view to proposing that the scope be changed or redefined. Such a review should take account of evolving social, commercial and technological conditions and the fact that any change of scope should be subject to the twin test of services that become available to a substantial majority of the population, with a consequent risk of social exclusion for those who can not afford them. Care should be taken in any change of the scope of universal service obligations to ensure that certain technological choices are not artificially promoted above others, that a disproportionate financial burden is not imposed on sector undertakings (thereby endangering market developments and innovation) and that any financing burden does not fall unfairly on consumers with lower incomes. Any change of scope automatically means that any net cost can be financed via the methods permitted in this Directive. Member States are not permitted to impose on market players financial contributions which relate to measures which are not part of universal service obligations. Individual Member States remain free to impose special measures (outside the scope of universal service obligations) and finance them in conformity with Community law but not by means of contributions from market players.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 26\n\n\nMore effective competition across all access and service markets will give greater choice for users. The extent of effective competition and choice varies across the Community and varies within Member States between geographical areas and between access and service markets. Some users may be entirely dependent on the provision of access and services by an undertaking with significant market power. In general, for reasons of efficiency and to encourage effective competition, it is important that the services provided by an undertaking with significant market power reflect costs. For reasons of efficiency and social reasons, end-user tariffs should reflect demand conditions as well as cost conditions, provided that this does not result in distortions of competition. There is a risk that an undertaking with significant market power may act in various ways to inhibit entry or distort competition, for example by charging excessive prices, setting predatory prices, compulsory bundling of retail services or showing undue preference to certain customers. Therefore, national regulatory authorities should have powers to impose, as a last resort and after due consideration, retail regulation on an undertaking with significant market power. Price cap regulation, geographical averaging or similar instruments, as well as non-regulatory measures such as publicly available comparisons of retail tariffs, may be used to achieve the twin objectives of promoting effective competition whilst pursuing public interest needs, such as maintaining the affordability of publicly available telephone services for some consumers. Access to appropriate cost accounting information is necessary, in order for national regulatory authorities to fulfil their regulatory duties in this area, including the imposition of any tariff controls. However, regulatory controls on retail services should only be imposed where national regulatory authorities consider that relevant wholesale measures or measures regarding carrier selection or pre-selection would fail to achieve the objective of ensuring effective competition and public interest.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 27\n\n\nWhere a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to implement a cost accounting system in order to support price controls, it may itself undertake an annual audit to ensure compliance with that cost accounting system, provided that it has the necessary qualified staff, or it may require the audit to be carried out by another qualified body, independent of the operator concerned.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 29\n\n\nNational regulatory authorities may also, in the light of an analysis of the relevant market, require mobile operators with significant market power to enable their subscribers to access the services of any interconnected provider of publicly available telephone services on a call-by-call basis or by means of pre-selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(223)In order to effectively support the free movement of goods, services and persons within the Union, it should be possible to use certain national numbering resources, in particular certain non-geographic numbers, in an extraterritorial manner, that is to say outside the territory of the assigning Member State throughout the territory of the Union. In view of the considerable risk of fraud with respect to interpersonal communications, such extraterritorial use should be allowed for electronic communications services with the exception of interpersonal communications services. Member States should therefore ensure that relevant national laws, in particular consumer protection rules and other rules related to the use of numbers, are enforced independently of the Member State where the rights of use for numbers have been granted. That should entail that the national regulatory and other competent authorities of those Member States where a number is used are competent to apply their national laws  to the undertaking to which the number has been assigned. In addition, the national regulatory authorities of those Member States should have the possibility to request the support of the national regulatory authority responsible for the assignment of the number to assist them in enforcing the respect of the rules applicable in those Member states where the number is used. Such support measures should include dissuasive sanctions, in particular in case of a serious breach the withdrawal of the right of extraterritorial use for the numbers assigned to the undertaking concerned. The requirements on extraterritorial use should be without prejudice to Member States' powers to block, on a case-by case basis, access to numbers or services where that is justified by reasons of fraud or misuse. The extraterritorial use of numbers should be without prejudice to Union's rules related to the provision of roaming services, including those relative to preventing anomalous or abusive use of roaming services which are subject to retail price regulation and which benefit from regulated wholesale roaming rates. Member States should continue to be able to enter into specific agreements on extraterritorial use of numbering resources with third countries.\n\n\n(224)Member States should promote over-the-air provisioning of numbering resources to facilitate switching of electronic communications providers. Over the-air provisioning of numbering resources enables the reprogramming of telecommunication equipment identifiers without physical access to the devices concerned. This feature is particularly relevant for machine-to-machine services, that is to say services involving an automated transfer of data and information between devices or software-based applications with limited or no human interaction. Providers of such machine-to-machine services might not have recourse to physical access to their devices due to their use in remote conditions, or to the large number of devices deployed or to their usage patterns. In view of the emerging machine-to-machine market and new technologies, Member States should strive to ensure technological neutrality in promoting over-the-air provisioning.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 20 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(225)Access to numbering resources on the basis of transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria is essential for undertakings to compete in the electronic communications sector. \u00f0\u00a0Member States should be able to grant rights of use for numbers to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks or services in view of the increasing relevance of numbers for various Internet of Things services.\u00a0\u00ef All elements of national numbering plans should be managed by national regulatory authorities, including point codes used in network addressing. Where there is a need for harmonisation of numbering resources in the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 to support the development of pan-European services \u00f0\u00a0or cross-border services, in particular new machine-to-machine-based services such as connected cars, and where the demand could not be met on the basis of the existing numbering resources in place\u00a0\u00ef , the Commission may\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0can\u00a0\u00d5 take technical implementing measures using its executive powers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0with the assistance of BEREC\u00a0\u00ef . Where this is appropriate to ensure full global interoperability of services, Member States should coordinate their national positions in accordance with the Treaty in international organisations and fora where numbering decisions are taken. The provisions of this Directive do not establish any new areas of responsibility for the national regulatory authorities in the field of Internet naming and addressing.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 19 (adapted)\n\n\n\n(226)The requirement to publish decisions on the granting of rights to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0of\u00a0\u00d5 use frequencies or\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 numbers may be fulfilled by making these decisions publicly accessible via a website.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(227) Considering the particular aspects related to reporting missing children and the currently limited availability of such a service, Member States \u00d6\u00a0should maintain their commitment\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0should not only reserve a number, but also make every effort to ensure that a \u00f0\u00a0well-functioning\u00a0\u00ef service for reporting missing children is actually available in their territories under the number \u2018116000\u2019, without delay.\u00a0To that end, Member States should, if appropriate, inter alia, organise tendering procedures in order to invite interested parties to provide that service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 46 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(228)A single market implies that end-users are able to access all numbers included in the national numbering plans of other Member States and to access services using non-geographic numbers\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0, including freephone and premium-rate numbers,\u00a0\u00d5 within the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5, including, among others, freephone and premium rate numbers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0except where the called end-user has chosen, for commercial reasons, to limit access from certain geographical areas\u00a0\u00ef . End-users should also be able to access numbers from the European Telephone Numbering Space (ETNS) and Universal International Freephone Numbers\u00a0(UIFN). Cross-border access to numbering resources and associated services should not be prevented, except in objectively justified cases, for example to combat fraud or abuse (e.g. in connection with certain premium-rate services), when the number is defined as having a national scope only (e.g. a national short code) or when it is technically or economically unfeasible. \u00f0\u00a0Tariffs charged to parties calling from outside the Member State concerned need not be the same as for those parties calling from inside that Member State.\u00a0\u00ef Users should be fully informed in advance and in a clear manner of any charges applicable to freephone numbers, such as international call charges for numbers accessible through standard international dialling codes.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 38 \n\n\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nAccess by end-users to all numbering resources in the Community\u00a0is a vital pre-condition for a single market. It should include freephone, premium rate, and other non-geographic numbers, except where the called subscriber has chosen, for commercial reasons, to limit access from certain geographical areas. Tariffs charged to parties calling from outside the Member State concerned need not be the same as for those parties calling from inside that Member State.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(229)The completion of the single market for electronic communications requires the removal of barriers for end-users to have cross-border access to electronic communications services across the Union. Providers of electronic communications to the public should not deny or restrict access or discriminate against end-users on the basis of their nationality or Member State of residence. Differentiation should, however, be possible on the basis of objectively justifiable differences in costs and risks, which may go beyond the measures provided for in Regulation 531/2012 in respect of abusive or anomalous use of regulated retail roaming services.\n\n\n(230)Divergent implementation of the rules on end-user protection has created significant internal market barriers affecting both providers of electronic communications services and end-users. Those barriers should be reduced by the applicability of the same rules ensuring a high common level of protection across the Union. A calibrated full harmonisation of the end-user rights covered by this Directive should considerably increase legal certainty for both end-users and providers of electronic communications services, and should significantly lower entry barriers and unnecessary compliance burden stemming from the fragmentation of the rules. Full harmonisation helps to overcome barriers to the single market resulting from such national end-user provisions which at the same time protect national providers against competition from other Member States. In order to chieve a high common level of protection, several end-user provisions should be reasonably enhanced in this Directive in the light of best practices in Member States. Full harmonisation of their rights increases the trust of end-users in the internal market as they benefit from an equally high level of protection when using electronic communications services, not only in their Member State but also while living, working or travelling in other Member States. Member States should maintain the possibility to have a higher level of end-user protection where an explicit derogation is provided for in this Directive, and to act in areas not covered by this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 30 (adapted)\n\n\n(231)Contracts are an important tool for \u00d6\u00a0end-\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0users and consumers to ensure a minimum level of transparency of information and legal security\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0certainty\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0.

Specifically, consumers should enjoy a minimum level of legal certainty in respect of their contractual relations with their direct telephone service provider, such that the contractual terms, conditions, quality of service, condition for termination of the contract and the service, compensation measures and dispute resolution are specified in their contracts. Where service providers other than direct telephone service providers conclude contracts with consumers, the same information should be included in those contracts as well. The measures to ensure transparency on prices, tariffs, terms and conditions will increase the ability of consumers to optimise their choices and thus to benefit fully from competition.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 21 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(232)Provisions on contracts \u00d6\u00a0in this Directive\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0should apply irrespective the amount of any payment to be made by the customer.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0They\u00a0\u00d5 should apply not only to consumers but also to other end-users, primarily micro enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs)\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC,\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0which\u00a0may prefer a contract adapted to consumer needs\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0whose bargaining position is comparable to that of consumers and which should therefore benefit from the same level of protection\u00a0\u00ef .

End-users should inter alia be informed of any quality of service levels offered, , conditions for promotions and termination of contracts, applicable tariff plans and tariffs for services subject to particular pricing conditions. That information is relevant for most publicly available electronic communications services but not for number-independent interpersonal communications services. In order to enable the end-user to make a well-informed choice, it is essential that the required relevant information is provided prior to the conclusion of the contract and in clear and understandable language. For the same reason, providers should present a summary of the essential contract terms. In order to facilitate comparability and reduce compliance cost, BEREC should issue a template for such contract summaries.\n\n\n(234)Following the adoption of Regulation (EU)\u00a02015/2120 the provisions in this Directive regarding information on conditions limiting access to and/or use of services and applications and as regards traffic shaping became obsolete and should be repealed.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 24\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n\n\n(235) With respect to terminal equipment, the customer contract should specify any restrictions imposed by the provider on the use of the equipment, such as by way of \u2018SIM-locking\u2019 mobile devices, if such restrictions are not prohibited under national legislation, and any charges due on termination of the contract, whether before or on the agreed expiry date, including any cost imposed in order to retain the equipment. \u00f0\u00a0Any charges due at early termination for terminal equipment and other promotional advantages should be calculated on the basis of customary depreciation methods and on a pro rata temporis basis, respectively.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 25 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(236)Without \u00d6\u00a0prejudice to the substantive\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0imposing any obligations on the provider \u00f0\u00a0related to security by virtue of this Directive\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0to take action over and above what is required under Community law, the customer contract should also specify the type of action, if any, the provider might take in case of security or integrity incidents, threats or vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 32 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(237) The availability of transparent, up-to-date and comparable information on offers and services is a key element for consumers in competitive markets where several providers offer services.

Undertakings should not be entitled to any remuneration for the use of information where it has already been published and thus belongs in the public domain. In addition, end-users and consumers should be adequately informed of the price and the type of service offered before they purchase a service, in particular if a freephone number is subject to additional charges. National regulatory authorities should be able to require that such information is provided generally, and, for certain categories of services determined by them, immediately prior to connecting the call, unless otherwise provided for by national law. When determining the categories of call requiring pricing information prior to connection, national regulatory authorities should take due account of the nature of the service, the  pricing conditions which apply to it and whether it is offered by a provider who is not a provider of electronic communications services. Without prejudice to Directive 2000/31/EC (Directive on electronic commerce), undertakings should also, if required by Member States, provide subscribers with public interest information produced by the relevant public authorities regarding, inter alia, the most common infringements and their legal consequences.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(238)End-users are often not aware of the cost of their consumption behaviour or have difficulties to estimate their time or data consumption when using electronic communications services. In order to increase transparency and to allow better control of their communications budget it is important to provide end-users with facilities that enable them to track their consumption in a timely manner.\n\n\n(239)Independent comparison tools, such as websites, are an effective means for end-users to assess the merits of different providers of publicly available electronic communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services , and to obtain impartial information, in particular by comparing prices, tariffs, and quality parameters in one place. Such tools should aim at providing information that is both clear and concise and complete and comprehensive. They should also aim at including the broadest possible range of offers, so as to give a representative overview and cover a significant part of the market. The information given on such tools should be trustworthy, impartial and transparent. End-users should be informed of the availability of such tools. Member States should ensure that end-users have free access to at least one such tool in their respective territories.\n\n\n(240)Independent comparison tools should be operationally independent from providers of publicly available electronic communications services. They can be operated by private undertakings, or by or on behalf of competent authorities, however they should be operated in accordance with specified quality criteria including the requirement to provide details of their owners, provide accurate and up-to-date information, state the time of the last update, set out clear, objective criteria on which the comparison will be based and include a broad range of offers on publicly available electronic communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services, covering a significant part of the market. Member States should be able to determine how often comparison tools are required to review and update the information they provide to end-users, taking into account the frequency with which providers of publicly available electronic communications services other than number-independent interpersonal communications services, generally update their tariff and quality information. Where there is only one tool in a Member State and that tool ceases to operate or ceases to comply with the quality criteria, the Member State should ensure that end-users have access within a reasonable time to another comparison tool at national level.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 26 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(241)In order to address public interest issues with respect to the use of \u00f0\u00a0publicly available electronic\u00a0\u00ef communications services and to encourage protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the relevant national\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0competent\u00a0\u00ef authorities should be able to produce and have disseminated, with the aid of providers, public interest information related to the use of such services.

Such public interest information should be updated whenever necessary and should be presented in easily comprehensible printed and electronic formats, as determined by each Member State, and on national public authority websites. National regulatory authorities should be able to oblige providers to disseminate this standardised information to all their customers in a manner deemed appropriate by the national regulatory authorities. When required by Member States, the information should also be included in contracts. Dissemination of such information should however not impose an excessive burden on undertakings. Member States should require this dissemination by the means used by undertakings in communications with subscribers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef made in the ordinary course of business.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 31 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(242)In the absence of relevant rules of Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, content, applications and services are deemed lawful or harmful in accordance with national substantive and procedural law.

National regulatory authorities should nonetheless be able to require publication of such information where it is demonstrated that such information is not effectively available to the public. \u00f0\u00a0National regulatory authorities should also set out the measurement methods to be applied by the service providers in order to improve the comparability of the data provided. In order to facilitate comparability across the Union and to reduce compliance cost, BEREC should adopt guidelines on relevant quality of service parameters which national regulatory authorities should take into utmost account.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 47 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(244)In order to take full advantage of the competitive environment, consumers should be able to make informed choices and to change providers when it is in their \u00d6\u00a0best\u00a0\u00d5 interests.

Independently from the electronic communications service contract, consumers might prefer and benefit from a longer reimbursement period for physical connections. Such consumer commitments can be an important factor in facilitating deployment of very high capacity connectivity networks up to or very close to end-user premises, including through demand aggregation schemes which enable network investors to reduce initial take-up risks. However, the rights of consumers to switch between providers of electronic communications services, as established in this Directive, should not be restricted by such reimbursement periods in contracts on physical connections.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\nNumber portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in competitive markets for electronic communications and should be implemented with the minimum delay, so that the number is functionally activated within one working day and the user does not experience a loss of service lasting longer than one working day.

The availability of transparent, accurate and timely information on switching should increase the end-users' confidence in switching and make them more willing to engage actively in the competitive process. Service providers should ensure continuity of service so that end-users are able to switch providers without being hindered by the risk of a loss of service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 40 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(248)Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in a competitive telecommunications environment\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0electronic communications markets.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0such that\u00a0eEnd-users who so request should be able to retain their number(s) on the public telephone network independently of the organisation\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0undertaking\u00a0\u00d5 providing service.

While they often bring about benefits for end-users, they can make switching more difficult or costly and raise risks of contractual \"lock-in\". Where divergent contractual rules on contract termination and switching apply to the different services, and to any contractual commitment regarding acquisition of products which form part of a bundle, consumers are effectively hampered in their rights under this Directive to switch to competitive offers for the entire bundle or parts of it. The provisions of this Directive regarding contracts, transparency, contract duration and termination and switching should, therefore, apply to all elements of a bundle, except to the extent that other rules applicable to the non-electronic communications elements of the bundle are more favourable to the consumer. Other contractual issues, such as the remedies applicable in the event of non-conformity with the contract, should be governed by the rules applicable to the respective element of the bundle, for instance by the rules of contracts for the sales of goods or for the supply of digital content. For the same reasons consumers should not be locked in with a provider by means of a contractual de facto extension of the initial contract period.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 23 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(253)Providers of electronic\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0number-based interpersonal\u00a0\u00ef communications services that allow calls\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0have an obligation to provide access to emergency services through emergency communications.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0In exceptional circumstances, namely due to a lack of technical feasibility, they might not be able to provide access to emergency services or caller location, or to both.

Where the service is not provided over a switched telephony network\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0connection which is managed to give a specified quality of service\u00a0\u00ef , the information should also include the level of reliability of the access and of caller location information compared to a service that is provided over \u00d6\u00a0such\u00a0\u00d5 a switched telephony network\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0connection\u00a0\u00ef , taking into account current technology and quality standards, as well as any quality of service parameters specified under \u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC recital 22 (adapted)\n\n\n(254)In line with the objectives of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the regulatory framework should ensure that all users, including disabled end-users, the elderly, and users with special social needs, have easy access to affordable high quality services. Declaration 22 annexed to the final Act of Amsterdam provides that the institutions of the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 shall take account of the needs of persons with a disability in drawing up measures under Article 95 of the Treaty \u00a0\u00d6\u00a0114  of the TFEU\u00a0\u00d5 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(255)End-users should be able to access emergency services through emergency communications free of charge and without having to use any means of payment, from any device which enables number-based interpersonal communications services, including when using roaming services in a Member State. Emergency communications are means of communication, that include not only voice communications but also SMS, messaging, video or other types of communications, that are enabled in a Member State to access emergency services. Emergency communication can be triggered on behalf of a person by the eCall in-vehicle system as defined by Regulation 2015/758/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n77\n.\n\n\n(256)Member States should ensure that undertakings providing end-users with number-based interpersonal communications services provide reliable and accurate access to emergency services, taking into account national specifications and criteria. Where the number-based interpersonal communications service is not provided over a connection which is managed to give a specified quality of service, the service provider might not be able to ensure that emergency calls made through their service are routed to the most appropriate PSAP with the same reliability. For such network-independent undertakings, namely undertakings which are not integrated with a public communications network provider, providing caller location information may not always be technically feasible. Member States should ensure that standards ensuring accurate and reliable routing and connection to the emergency services are implemented as soon as possible in order to allow network-independent providers of number-based interpersonal communications services to fulfil the obligations related to access to emergency services and caller location information provision at a level comparable to that required of other providers of such communications services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 36 (adapted)\n\n\nIt is important that users should be able to call the single European emergency number \u2018112\u2019, and any other national emergency telephone numbers, free of charge, from any telephone, including public pay telephones, without the use of any means of payment. Member States should have already made the necessary organisational arrangements best suited to the national organisation of the emergency systems, in order to ensure that calls to this number are adequately answered and handled. Caller location information, to be made available to the emergency services, will improve the level of protection and the security of users of \u2018112\u2019 services and assist the emergency services, to the extent technically feasible, in the discharge of their duties, provided that the transfer of calls and associated data to the emergency services concerned is guaranteed. The reception and use of such information should comply with relevant Community law on the processing of personal data. Steady information technology improvements will progressively support the simultaneous handling of several languages over the networks at a reasonable cost. This in turn will ensure additional safety for European citizens using the \u2018112\u2019 emergency call number\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 37 (adapted)\n\n\nEasy access to international telephone services is vital for European citizens and European businesses. \u201800\u2019 has already been established as the standard international telephone access code for the Community. Special arrangements for making calls between adjacent locations across borders between Member States may be established or continued. The ITU has assigned, in accordance with ITU Recommendation E.164, code \u20183883\u2019 to the European Telephony Numbering Space (ETNS). In order to ensure connection of calls to the ETNS, undertakings operating public telephone networks should ensure that calls using \u20183883\u2019 are directly or indirectly interconnected to ETNS serving networks specified in the relevant European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards. Such interconnection arrangements should be governed by the provisions of Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)\n78\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 41\n\n\n(257) Member States should take specific measures to ensure that emergency services, including \u2018112\u2019, are equally accessible to disabled end-users, in particular deaf, hearing-impaired, speech-impaired and deaf-blind users. This could involve the provision of special terminal devices for hearing-impaired users, text relay services, or other specific equipment.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 39 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(258)End-users should be able to call and access the emergency services using any telephone service capable of originating voice calls through a number or numbers in national telephone numbering plans. Member States that use national emergency numbers besides \u2018112\u2019 may impose on undertakings similar obligations for access to such national emergency numbers. Emergency authorities should be able to handle and answer calls to the number \u2018112\u2019 at least as expeditiously and effectively as calls to national emergency numbers. It is important to increase awareness of \u2018112\u2019 in order to improve the level of protection and security of citizens travelling in the European Union. To this end, citizens should be made fully aware, when travelling in any Member State, in particular through information provided in international bus terminals, train stations, ports or airports and in telephone directories, payphone kiosks, subscriber\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-user\u00a0\u00ef and billing material, that \u2018112\u2019 can be used as a single emergency number throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 . This is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, but the Commission should continue both to support and to supplement initiatives of the Member States to heighten awareness of \u2018112\u2019 and periodically to evaluate the public\u2019s awareness of it. The obligation to provide caller location information should be strengthened so as to increase the protection of citizens. In particular, undertakings should make caller location information available to emergency services as soon as the call reaches that service independently of the technology used. In order to respond to technological developments, including those leading to increasingly accurate caller location information, the Commission should be empowered to adopt technical implementing measures to ensure effective access to \u2018112\u2019 services in the Community for the benefit of citizens. Such measures should be without prejudice to the organisation of emergency services of Member States.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(259)Caller location information improves the level of protection and the security of end-users and assists the emergency services in the discharge of their duties, provided that the transfer of emergency communication and associated data to the emergency services concerned is guaranteed by the national system of PSAPs. The reception and use of caller location information should comply with relevant Union law on the processing of personal data. Undertakings that provide network-based location should make caller location information available to emergency services as soon as the call reaches that service, independently of the technology used. However handset-based location technologies have proven to be significantly more accurate and cost effective due to the availability of data provided by the EGNOS and Galileo Satellite system and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems and Wi-Fi data. Therefore handset-derived caller location information should complement network-based location information even if the handset-derived location may become available only after the emergency communication is set up. Member States should ensure that the PSAPs are able to retrieve and manage the caller location information available. The establishment and transmission of caller location information should be free of charge for both the end-user and the authority handling the emergency communication irrespective of the means of establishment, for example through the handset or the network, or the means of transmission, for example through voice channel, SMS or Internet Protocol-based.\n\n\n(260)In order to respond to technological developments concerning accurate caller location information, equivalent access for disabled end-users and call routing to the most appropriate PSAP, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures necessary to ensure the compatibility, interoperability, quality and continuity of emergency communications in the Union. Those measures may consist of functional provisions determining the role of various parties within the communications chain, for example interpersonal communications service providers, electronic communications network operators and PSAPs, as well as technical provisions determining the technical means to fulfil the functional provisions. Such measures should be without prejudice to the organisation of emergency services of Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 36 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(261)In order to ensure that disabled end-users benefit from competition and the choice of service providers enjoyed by the majority of end-users, relevant national authorities should specify, where appropriate and in light of national conditions, consumer protection requirements \u00f0\u00a0for disabled end-users\u00a0\u00ef to be met by undertakings providing publicly available electronic communications services.

Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC ensures the end-users' right to privacy with regard to the inclusion of their personal information in a public directory.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 32 (adapted)\n\n\n(265)End-users should be able to enjoy a guarantee of interoperability in respect of all equipment sold in the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 for the reception of digital television. Member States should be able to require minimum harmonised standards in respect of such equipment. Such standards could be adapted from time to time in the light of technological and market developments.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 33 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(266)It is desirable to enable consumers to achieve the fullest connectivity possible to digital television sets. Interoperability is an evolving concept in dynamic markets. Standards bodies should do their utmost to ensure that appropriate standards evolve along with the technologies concerned. It is likewise important to ensure that connectors are available on \u00f0\u00a0digital\u00a0\u00ef television sets that are capable of passing all the necessary elements of a digital signal, including the audio and video streams, conditional access information, service information, application program interface (API) information and copy protection information. This Directive \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 therefore ensures that the functionality \u00f0\u00a0associated to and/or implemented in connectors\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0of the open interface for digital television sets is is not limited by network operators, service providers or equipment manufacturers and continues to evolve in line with technological developments. For display and presentation of digital interactive\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0connected\u00a0\u00ef television services, the realisation of a common standard through a market-driven mechanism is recognised as a consumer benefit. Member States and the Commission may take policy initiatives, consistent with the Treaty, to encourage this development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC recital 38 (adapted)\n\n\n(267)Directory enquiry services should be, and frequently are, provided under competitive market conditions, pursuant to Article\u00a05 of Commission Directive 2002/77/EC of 16\u00a0September 2002 on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services\n80\n. Wholesale measures ensuring the inclusion of end-user data (both fixed and\u00a0mobile) in databases should comply with the safeguards for the protection of personal data\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0under Directive 95/46/EC which will be replaced by Regulation (EU) 2016/697\n81\n on 25 May 2018, and\u00a0\u00d5 including Article\u00a012 of Directive 2002/58/EC (Directive on privacy and electronic communications). The cost-oriented supply of that data to service providers, with the possibility for Member States to establish a centralised mechanism for providing comprehensive aggregated information to directory providers, and the provision of network access under reasonable and transparent conditions, should be put in place in order to ensure that end-users benefit fully from competition, with the ultimate aim of\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0which has largely allowed\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0enabling the removal of retail regulation from these services and the provision of offers of directory services under reasonable and transparent conditions.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(268)Following the abolition of the universal service obligation for directory services and given the existence of a functioning market for such services, the right to access directory enquiry services is not necessary any more. However, the national regulatory authorities should still be able to impose obligations and conditions on undertakings that control access to end-users in order to maintain access and competition in that market.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(269)Currently, Member States impose certain \u2018must carry\u2019 obligations on networks for the distribution of radio or television broadcasts to the public. Member States should be able to lay down proportionate obligations on undertakings under their jurisdiction, in the interest of legitimate public policy considerations, but such obligations should only be imposed where they are necessary to meet general interest objectives clearly defined by Member States in conformity with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law and should be proportionate \u00d6\u00a0and\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0, transparent and subject to periodical review. \u2018Must carry\u2019 \u00d6\u00a0obligations may be applied to specified radio and television broadcast channels and complementary services supplied by a specified media service provider.\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0oObligations imposed by Member States should be reasonable, that is they should be proportionate and transparent in the light of clearly defined general interest objectives. \u00f0\u00a0Member States should provide an objective justification for the \u2018must carry\u2019 obligations that they impose in their national law so as to ensure that such obligations are transparent, proportionate and clearly defined. The obligations should be designed in a way which provides sufficient incentives for efficient investment in infrastructure. Obligations should be subject to periodic review at least every five years in order to keep them up-to-date with technological and market evolution and in order to ensure that they continue to be proportionate to the objectives to be achieved.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0and\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Obligations\u00a0\u00d5 could, where appropriate, entail a provision for proportionate remuneration. Such \u2018must carry\u2019 obligations may include the transmission of services specifically designed to enable appropriate access by disabled users.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 44 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(270)Networks used for the distribution of radio or television broadcasts to the public include cable, \u00d6\u00a0IPTV,\u00a0\u00d5 satellite and terrestrial broadcasting networks. They might also include other networks to the extent that a significant number of end-users use such networks as their principal means to receive radio and television broadcasts. \u00f0\u00a0Must carry obligations can include the transmission of services specifically designed to enable appropriate access by disabled users. Accordingly complementary services include, amongst others, services designed to improve accessibility for end-users with disabilities, such as videotext, subtitling, audio description and sign language. Because of the growing provision and reception of connected TV services and the continued importance of electronic programme guides for user choice the transmission of programme-related data supporting those functionalities can be included in must carry obligations.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 39 \n\n\n(271)Tone dialling and\u00a0cCalling line identification facilities are normally available on modern telephone exchanges and can therefore increasingly be provided at little or no expense. Tone dialling is increasingly being used for user interaction with special services and facilities, including value added services, and the absence of this facility can prevent the user from making use of these services. Member States are not required to impose obligations to provide these facilities when they are already available. Directive 97/66/EC\u00a02002/58/EC safeguards the privacy of users with regard to itemised billing, by giving them the means to protect their right to privacy when calling line identification is implemented. The development of these services on a pan-European basis would benefit consumers and is encouraged by this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 22\n\n\n(272)Publication of information by Member States will ensure that market players and potential market entrants understand their rights and obligations, and know where to find the relevant detailed information. Publication in the national gazette helps interested parties in other Member States to find the relevant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 23\n\n\n(273)In order to ensure that the pan-European electronic communications market is effective and efficient, the Commission should monitor and publish information on charges which contribute to determining prices to end-users.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 24 \n\n\nThe development of the electronic communications market, with its associated infrastructure, could have adverse effects on the environment and the landscape. Member States should therefore monitor this process and, if necessary, take action to minimise any such effects by means of appropriate agreements and other arrangements with the relevant authorities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 25 (adapted)\n\n\n(274)In order to determine the correct application of Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, the Commission needs to know which undertakings have been designated as having significant market power and what obligations have been placed upon market players by national regulatory authorities. In addition to national publication of this information, it is therefore necessary for Member States to send this information to the Commission. Where Member States are required to send information to the Commission, this may be in electronic form, subject to appropriate authentication procedures being agreed.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(275)In order to take account of market, social and technological developments, to manage the risks posed to security of networks and services and to ensure effective access to emergency services through emergency communications, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying measures to address security risks; adapting conditions for access to digital television and radio services; setting a single wholesale voice call termination rate in fixed and mobile markets ; adopting measures related to emergency communications in the Union; and adapting annexes II, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX and X of this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(276)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt decisions to resolve cross-border harmful interferences between Member States; to make the implementation of standards compulsory, or remove standards and/or specifications from the compulsory part of the list of standards; to take decisions setting out whether rights in a harmonised band shall be subject to a general authorisation or to individual rights of use; to specify the modalities of application of the criteria, rules and conditions with regard to harmonised radio spectrum; to specify the modalities of applying the conditions that Member States may attach to authorisations to use harmonised radio spectrum; to identify the bands for which rights of use for radio frequencies may be transferred or leased between undertakings; to establish common limitation maximum dates by which the use of specific harmonised radio spectrum bands shall be authorised; to adopt transitional measures regarding the duration of rights of use for radio spectrum; to set criteria to coordinate the implementation of certain obligations; to specify technical characteristics for the design, deployment and operation of small-area wireless access points; to address unmet cross-border or pan-European demand for numbers; and to specify the nature and scope of obligations ensuring effective access to emergency services or to end-to-end connectivity between end-users within one or several Member States or throughout the European Union. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers.\n\n\n(277)\u00f0\u00a0Finally, the Commission should be able to adopt as necessary, having taken utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, recommendations in relation to the identification of the relevant product and service markets, the notifications under the procedure for consolidating the internal market and the harmonised application of the provisions of the regulatory framework.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 39\n\n\n(278)The provisions of this Directive should be reviewed periodically, in particular with a view to determining the need for modification in the light of changing technological or market conditions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 42\n\n\n(279)Certain directives and decisions in this field should be repealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\n(280)The Commission should monitor the transition from the existing framework to the new framework,\u00a0and may in particular, at an appropriate time, bring forward a proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop\n82\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 34\n\n\nA single Committee should replace the \u2018ONP Committee\u2019 instituted by Article 9 of Directive 90/387/EEC and the Licensing Committee instituted by Article 14 of Directive 97/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 April 1997 on a common framework for general authorisations and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services\n83\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 35\n\n\n National regulatory authorities and national competition authorities should provide each other with the information necessary to apply the provisions of this Directive and the Specific Directives, in order to allow them to cooperate fully together. In respect of the information exchanged, the receiving authority should ensure the same level of confidentiality as the originating authority.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 36 \n\n\nThe Commission has indicated its intention to set up a European regulators group for electronic communications networks and services which would constitute a suitable mechanism for encouraging cooperation and coordination of national regulatory authorities, in order to promote the development of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services, and to seek to achieve consistent application, in all Member States, of the provisions set out in this Directive and the Specific Directives, in particular in areas where national law implementing Community law gives national regulatory authorities considerable discretionary powers in application of the relevant rules.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC recital 41 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(281)Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely achieving a harmonised \u00f0\u00a0and simplified\u00a0\u00ef framework for the regulation of electronic communications services, electronic communications networks, associated facilities and associated services,\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0of the conditions for the authorisation of networks and services, of spectrum use and of numbers, of the regulation of access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and of end-user protection\u00a0\u00ef cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level, the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary for those objectives.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\nThe outcome of the public consultation on the 1999 review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications, as reflected in the Commission communication of 26 April 2000, and the findings reported by the Commission in its communications on the fifth and sixth reports on the implementation of the telecommunications regulatory package, has confirmed the need for a more harmonised and less onerous market access regulation for electronic communications networks and services throughout the Community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 2 \n\n\nConvergence between different electronic communications networks and services and their technologies requires the establishment of an authorisation system covering all comparable services in a similar way regardless of the technologies used.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 14\n\n\nMember States are neither obliged to grant nor prevented from granting rights to use numbers from the national numbering plan or rights to install facilities to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks or services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 26\n\n\nWhere undertakings find that their applications for rights to install facilities have not been dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) or where such decisions are unduly delayed, they should have the right to appeal against decisions or delays in such decisions in accordance with that Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC recital 27\n\n\nThe penalties for non-compliance with conditions under the general authorisation should be commensurate with the infringement. Save in exceptional circumstances, it would not be proportionate to suspend or withdraw the right to provide electronic communications services or the right to use radio frequencies or numbers where an undertaking did not comply with one or more of the conditions under the general authorisation. This is without prejudice to urgent measures which the relevant authorities of the Member States may need to take in case of serious threats to public safety, security or health or to economic and operational interests of other undertakings. This Directive should also be without prejudice to any claims between undertakings for compensation for damages under national law.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 4 (adapted)\n\n\nDirective 95/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the use of standards for the transmission of television signals\n84\n did not mandate any specific digital television transmission system or service requirement, and this opened up an opportunity for the market actors to take the initiative and develop suitable systems. Through the Digital Video Broadcasting Group, European market actors have developed a family of television transmission systems that have been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world. These transmissions systems have been standardised by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and have become International Telecommunication Union recommendations. In relation to wide-screen digital television, the 16:9 aspect ratio is the reference format for wide-format television services and programmes, and is now established in Member States' markets as a result of Council Decision 93/424/EEC of 22 July 1993 on an action plan for the introduction of advanced television services in Europe\n85\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 26 (adapted)\n\n\nGiven the pace of technological and market developments, the implementation of this Directive should be reviewed within three years of its date of application to determine if it is meeting its objectives.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 27 (adapted)\n\n\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\n86\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC recital 28 (adapted)\n\n\nSince the objectives of the proposed action, namely establishing a harmonised framework for the regulation of access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 7 (adapted)\n\n\nMember States should continue to ensure that the services set out in Chapter II are made available with the quality specified to all end-users in their territory, irrespective of their geographical location, and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price. Member States may, in the context of universal service obligations and in the light of national conditions, take specific measures for consumers in rural or geographically isolated areas to ensure their access to the services set out in the Chapter II and the affordability of those services, as well as ensure under the same conditions this access, in particular for the elderly, the disabled and for people with special social needs. Such measures may also include measures directly targeted at consumers with special social needs providing support to identified consumers, for example by means of specific measures, taken after the examination of individual requests, such as the paying off of debts.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 45 (adapted)\n\n\nServices providing content such as the offer for sale of a package of sound or television broadcasting content are not covered by the common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. Providers of such services should not be subject to universal service obligations in respect of these activities. This Directive is without prejudice to measures taken at national level, in compliance with Community law, in respect of such services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 46 (adapted)\n\n\nWhere a Member State seeks to ensure the provision of other specific services throughout its national territory, such obligations should be implemented on a cost efficient basis and outside the scope of universal service obligations. Accordingly, Member States may undertake additional measures (such as facilitating the development of infrastructure or services in circumstances where the market does not satisfactorily address the requirements of end-users or consumers), in conformity with Community law. As a reaction to the Commission's e-Europe initiative, the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 called on Member States to ensure that all schools have access to the Internet and to multimedia resources.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC recital 52 (adapted)\n\n\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\n87\n,\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(282)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\n88\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\n\n\n\n\n(283)The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directives.

Within the framework set out in Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), tThis Directive harmonises the way in which Member States regulate access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities. The aim is to establish a regulatory framework, in accordance with internal market principles, for the relationships between suppliers of networks and services that will result in \u00f0\u00a0deployment and take-up of very high capacity networks,\u00a0\u00ef sustainable competition, interoperability of electronic communications services and consumer\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-user\u00a0\u00ef benefits.\n\n\n2. This Directive establishes rights and obligations for operators and for undertakings seeking interconnection and/or access to their networks or associated facilities. It sets out objectives for national regulatory authorities with regard to access and interconnection, and lays down procedures to ensure that obligations imposed by national regulatory authorities are reviewed and, where appropriate, withdrawn once the desired objectives have been achieved. Access in this Directive does not refer to access by end-users. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.1 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle\u00a01\n\n\nSubject-matter and scope\n\n\n1.

The aim\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0On the other hand, it\u00a0\u00d5 is to ensure the availability\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0provision\u00a0\u00ef throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 of good-quality, \u00f0\u00a0affordable\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0, publicly available services through effective competition and choice,\u00a0and to deal with circumstances in which the needs of end-users \u00f0\u00a0, including disabled users,\u00a0\u00ef are not satisfactorily met by the market \u00f0\u00a0and to lay down the necessary end-user rights\u00a0\u00ef . The Directive also includes provisions concerning certain aspects of terminal equipment, including provisions intended to facilitate access for disabled end-users.\n\n\n2. This Directive establishes the rights of end-users and the corresponding obligations of undertakings providing publicly available electronic communications networks and services. With regard to ensuring provision of universal service within an environment of open and competitive markets, this Directive defines the minimum set of services of specified quality to which all end-users have access, at an affordable price in the light of specific national conditions,without distorting competition. This Directive also sets out obligations with regard to the provision of certain mandatory services.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC (adapted)\n\n\n\n23.

In taking a decision pursuant to paragraph 1, competent authorities shall have regard to the following considerations: \n\n\n(a) fulfilment of the objectives of Articles 3, 45(2) and 48(2), as well as public policy objectives under national or Union law;\n\n\n\n\n(b) implementation of a measure adopted pursuant to Article 4 of Decision No 676/2002/EC;\n\n\n(c) review of the appropriate implementation of the conditions attached to the right concerned;\n\n\n(d) the need to promote, or avoid any distortion of, competition in line with Article 52;\n\n\n(e) rendering the use of radio spectrum more efficient in light of technological or market evolution; \n\n\n(f) the need to avoid severe service disruption.\n\n\n3. When considering possible renewal of individual rights of use for radio spectrum for which the number of rights of use is limited, competent authorities shall conduct an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure to examine the criteria in paragraph 2, and shall, in particular,\n\n\n(a) give all interested parties, including users and consumers, the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation in accordance with article 23; and\n\n\n(b) clearly state the reasons for such possible renewal.\n\n\nIf as a result of the consultation pursuant to the first subparagraph, there is evidence of market demand from undertakings other than those holding rights of use for spectrum in the band concerned, the competent authority shall grant the rights pursuant to Article 54.\n\n\n4. A decision to grant a renewal of rights shall be accompanied by a review of the fees attached thereto. Where appropriate, competent authorities may adjust the fees for the rights of use in compliance with the principles set out in Article 42(1) and (2).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 1.11 (adapted)\n\n\nArticle\u00a09a\n\n\nReview of restrictions on existing rights\n\n\n1. For a period of five years starting from 25\u00a0May 2011, Member States may allow holders of rights to use radio frequencies which were granted before that date and which will remain valid for a period of not less that five years after that date, to submit an application to the competent national authority for a reassessment of the restrictions on their rights in accordance with Article\u00a09(3) and\u00a0(4).\n\n\nBefore adopting its decision, the competent national authority shall notify the right holder of its reassessment of the restrictions, indicating the extent of the right after reassessment, and shall allow him a reasonable time limit to withdraw his application.\n\n\nIf the right holder withdraws his application, the right shall remain unchanged until its expiry or until the end of the five-year period, whichever is the earlier date.\n\n\n2. After the five-year period referred to in paragraph\u00a01, Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that Article\u00a09(3) and\u00a0(4) apply to all remaining general authorisations or individual rights of use and spectrum allocations used for electronic communications services which existed on 25\u00a0May 2011.\n\n\n3. In applying this Article, Member States shall take appropriate measures to promote fair competition.\n\n\n4. Measures adopted in applying this Article do not constitute the granting of new rights of use and therefore are not subject to the relevant provisions of Article\u00a05(2) of Directive 2002/20/EC (Authorisation Directive).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nExisting authorisations\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 3.10 (adapted)\n\n\n1.

Where application of paragraph 1 results in a reduction of the rights or an extension of the general authorisations and individual rights of use already in existence, Member States may extend the validity of those authorisations and rights until 30 September 2012 at the latest, provided that the rights of other undertakings under Community law are not affected thereby. Member States shall notify such extensions to the Commission and state the reasons therefor.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/20/EC (adapted)\n\n\n3. Where the Member State concerned can prove that the abolition of an authorisation condition regarding access to electronic communications networks, which was in force before the date of entry into force of this Directive, creates excessive difficulties for undertakings that have benefited from mandated access to another network, and where it is not possible for these undertakings to negotiate new agreements on reasonable commercial terms before the date of application referred to in Article 18(1), second subparagraph, Member States may request a temporary prolongation of the relevant condition(s). Such requests shall be submitted by the date of application referred to in Article 18(1), second subparagraph, at the latest, and shall specify the condition(s) and period for which the temporary prolongation is requested.\n\n\nThe Member State shall inform the Commission of the reasons for requesting a prolongation. The Commission shall consider such a request, taking into account the particular situation in that Member State and of the undertaking(s) concerned, and the need to ensure a coherent regulatory environment at a Community level. It shall take a decision on whether to grant or reject the request, and where it decides to grant the request, on the scope and duration of the prolongation to be granted. The Commission shall communicate its decision to the Member State concerned within six months after receipt of the application for a prolongation. Such decisions shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 1.11 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 9b51\n\n\nTransfer or lease of individual rights to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0of\u00a0\u00d5 use \u00d6\u00a0for\u00a0\u00d5 radio frequencies\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0spectrum\u00a0\u00d5\n\n\n1.

Consequently, remedies aimed at preventing such leverage may be applied in the second market pursuant to Articles\u00a09, 10, 11 and\u00a013 of Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive), and where such remedies prove to be insufficient, remedies pursuant to Article\u00a017 of Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive) may be imposed.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC Art.15\n\n\nArticle 1562\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 1.17(a)\n\n\nProcedure for the identification and definition of markets\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 1.17(b) (adapted)\n\n\n1. After public consultation including with national regulatory authorities and taking the utmost account of the opinion of BEREC, the Commission shall, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article\u00a022(2), adopt a Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets (the Recommendation). The Recommendation shall identify those product and service markets within the electronic communications sector the characteristics of which may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations set out in the Specific\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0this\u00a0\u00d5 Directives, without prejudice to markets that may be defined in specific cases under competition law. The Commission shall define markets in accordance with the principles of competition law.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nThe Commission shall include product and service markets in the Recommendation where, after observing overall trends in the Union, it finds that each of the criteria listed in paragraph 1 of Article 65 is met. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC (adapted)\n\n\nThe Commission shall regularly review the Rrecommendation.\n\n\n2.

National regulatory authorities shall \u00f0\u00a0take into account the results of the geographical survey conducted in accordance with Article 22(1). They shall\u00a0\u00ef follow the procedures referred to in Articles\u00a0623 and\u00a0732 before defining the markets that differ from those identified in the Recommendation.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 63\n\n\n\n\nProcedure for the identification of transnational markets\n\n\n1.

BEREC shall conduct an analysis of transnational end-user demand for products and services that are provided within the Union in one or more of the markets listed in the Recommendation, if it receives a reasoned request providing supporting evidence from the Commission or from at least two of the national regulatory authorities concerned indicating that there is a serious demand problem to be addressed. BEREC may also conduct such analysis if it receives a reasoned request from market participants providing sufficient supporting evidence and considers there is a serious demand problem to be addressed.  BEREC's analysis is without prejudice to any findings of transnational markets in accordance with Article 63(1) and to any findings of national or sub-national geographical markets by national regulatory authorities in accordance with Article 62(3). \n\n\nThat analysis of transnational end-user demand may include products and services that are supplied within product or service markets that have been defined in different ways by one or more national regulatory authorities when taking into account national circumstances, provided that those products and services are substitutable to those supplied in one of the markets listed in the Recommendation. \n\n\nIf BEREC concludes that a transnational end-user demand exists, is significant and is not sufficiently met by supply provided on a commercial or regulated basis, it shall, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, issue guidelines on common approaches for national regulatory authorities to meet the identified transnational demand, including, where appropriate, when they impose remedies in accordance with Article 66. National regulatory authorities shall take into utmost account these guidelines when performing their regulatory tasks within their jurisdiction.\n\n\n2. On the basis of BEREC guidelines referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may adopt a Decision pursuant to Article 38 to harmonise the technical specifications of wholesale access products capable of meeting such identified transnational demand, when they are imposed by national regulatory authorities on operators designated with significant market power in markets where such access products are supplied, as defined according to national circumstances. Article 38(3)(a) second subparagraph first indent shall not apply in such a case. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/21/EC\n\n\nArticle 16\u00a065\n\n\nMarket analysis procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 1.18(a) (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n1.

A national regulatory authority may, in accordance with the provisions of Article 668, impose obligations relating to cost recovery  and price controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned may sustain prices at an excessively high level, or may apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users. \n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0In determining whether or not price control obligations would be appropriate, national regulatory authorities shall take into account long-term end-user interests related to the deployment and take-up of next-generation networks, and in particular of very high capacity networks. In particular,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0tTo encourage investments by the operator, including in next-generation networks, national regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator,.\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0Where the national regulatory authorities deem price controls appropriate, they shall\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0and allow \u00d6\u00a0the operator\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0him a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account any risks specific to a particular new investment network project.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nNational regulatory authorities shall not impose or maintain obligations pursuant to this Article, where they establish that a demonstrable retail price constraint is present and that any obligations imposed in accordance with Articles 67 to 71, including in particular any economic replicability test imposed in accordance with Article 68 ensures effective and non discriminatory access. \n\n\nWhen national regulatory authorities consider it appropriate to impose price controls on access to existing network elements, they shall also take account of the benefits of predictable and stable wholesale prices in ensuring efficient entry and sufficient incentives for all operators to deploy new and enhanced networks. \n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/19/EC\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n2.

In this regard national regulatory authorities may also take account of prices available in comparable competitive markets.\n\n\n3. Where an operator has an obligation regarding the cost orientation of its prices, the burden of proof that charges are derived from costs including a reasonable rate of return on investment shall lie with the operator concerned. For the purpose of calculating the cost of efficient provision of services, national regulatory authorities may use cost accounting methods independent of those used by the undertaking. National regulatory authorities may require an operator to provide full justification for its prices, and may, where appropriate, require prices to be adjusted.\n\n\n4. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where implementation of a cost accounting system is mandated in order to support price controls, a description of the cost accounting system is made publicly available, showing at least the main categories under which costs are grouped and the rules used for the allocation of costs. Compliance with the cost accounting system shall be verified by a qualified independent body.

Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations relating to cost recovery and price controls on operators designated as having significant market power on a market for wholesale voice call termination, it shall set maximum symmetric termination rates based on the costs incurred by an efficient operator. The evaluation of efficient costs shall be based on current cost values. The cost methodology to calculate efficient costs shall be based on a bottom-up modelling approach using long-run incremental traffic-related costs of providing the wholesale voice call termination service to third parties. \n\n\nThe details of the cost methodology shall be set by a Commission decision, adopted pursuant to Article 38.\n\n\n2. By [date] the Commission shall, after having consulted BEREC, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 109 concerning a single maximum termination rate to be imposed by national regulatory authorities on undertakings designated as having significant market power in fixed and mobile voice termination markets respectively in the Union. \n\n\nWhen adopting these delegated acts, the Commission shall follow the principles laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and shall comply with the criteria and parameters provided in Annex III.\n\n\n4. In applying paragraph 2, the Commission shall ensure that the single voice call termination rate in mobile networks shall not exceed 1.23\u00a0\u20accent per minute and the single voice call termination rate in fixed networks shall not exceed 0.14\u00a0\u20accent per minute. The Commission shall take into account the weighted average of maximum termination rates in fixed and mobile networks established in accordance with the principles provided in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 applied across the Union when setting the single maximum termination rate for the first time.\n\n\n5. When adopting delegated acts pursuant to paragraph 2, the Commission shall take into account the total number of end-users in each Member State, in order to ensure a proper weighting of the maximum termination rates, as well as national circumstances which result in significant differences between Member States when determining the maximum termination rates in the Union\n\n\n6. The Commission may request BEREC to develop an economic model in order to assist the Commission in determining the maximum termination rates in the Union. The Commission shall take into account market information provided by BEREC, national regulatory authorities or, directly, by undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services. \n\n\n7. The Commission shall review the delegated acts adopted pursuant this Article every five years.\n\n\n\nArticle 74\n\n\nRegulatory treatment of new network elements\n\n\n1. A national regulatory authority shall not impose obligations as regards new network elements that are part of the relevant market on which it intends to impose or maintain obligations in accordance with Articles 66 and Articles 67 to 72 and that the operator designated as significant market power on that relevant market has deployed or is planning to deploy, if the following cumulative conditions are met: \n\n\n(a) the deployment of the new network elements is open to co-investment offers according to a transparent process and on terms which favour sustainable competition in the long term including inter alia fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms offered to potential co-investors; flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the commitment provided by each co-investor;  possibility to increase such commitment in the future; reciprocal rights awarded by the co-investors after the deployment of the co-invested infrastructure; \n\n\n(b) the deployment of the new network elements contributes significantly to the deployment of very high capacity networks; \n\n\n(c) access seekers not participating in the co-investment can benefit from the same quality, speed, conditions and end-user reach as was available before the deployment, either through commercial  agreements based on fair and reasonable terms or by means of regulated access maintained or adapted by the national regulatory authority; \n\n\nWhen assessing co-investment offers and processes referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that those offers and processes comply with the criteria set out in Annex IV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 2.10\n\n\n\u00e81\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 2.10 amended by Corrigendum, OJ L 241, 10.9.2013, p. 8\n\n\nArticle 13a75\n\n\nFunctional separation\n\n\n1. Where the national regulatory authority concludes that the appropriate obligations imposed under Articles 67 to 729 to 13 have failed to achieve effective competition and that there are important and persisting competition problems and/or market failures identified in relation to the wholesale provision of certain access product markets, it may, as an exceptional measure, in accordance with the provisions of the second subparagraph of Article 866(3), impose an obligation on vertically integrated undertakings to place activities related to the wholesale provision of relevant access products in an independently operating business entity.\n\n\nThat business entity shall supply access products and services to all undertakings, including to other business entities within the parent company, on the same timescales, terms and conditions, including those relating to price and service levels, and by means of the same systems and processes.\n\n\n2. When a national regulatory authority intends to impose an obligation for functional separation, it shall submit a proposal to the Commission that includes:\n\n\n(a) evidence justifying the conclusions of the national regulatory authority as referred to in paragraph 1;\n\n\n(b) a reasoned assessment that there is no or little prospect of effective and sustainable infrastructure-based competition within a reasonable time frame;\n\n\n(c) an analysis of the expected impact on the regulatory authority, on the undertaking, in particular on the workforce of the separated undertaking and on the electronic communications sector as a whole, and on incentives to invest in a sector as a whole, particularly with regard to the need to ensure social and territorial cohesion, \u00e81\u00a0and on other stakeholders including, in particular, the expected impact on competition and any potential consequential effects on consumers\u00a0\u00e7 ; \n\n\n(d) an analysis of the reasons justifying that this obligation would be the most efficient means to enforce remedies aimed at addressing the competition problems/markets failures identified.\n\n\n3. The draft measure shall include the following elements:\n\n\n(a) the precise nature and level of separation, specifying in particular the legal status of the separate business entity;\n\n\n(b) an identification of the assets of the separate business entity, and the products or services to be supplied by that entity;\n\n\n(c) the governance arrangements to ensure the independence of the staff employed by the separate business entity, and the corresponding incentive structure;\n\n\n(d) rules for ensuring compliance with the obligations;\n\n\n(e) rules for ensuring transparency of operational procedures, in particular towards other stakeholders;\n\n\n(f) a monitoring programme to ensure compliance, including the publication of an annual report.\n\n\n4. Following the Commission's decision on the draft measure taken in accordance with Article 866(3), the national regulatory authority shall conduct a coordinated analysis of the different markets related to the access network in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 65 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). On the basis of its assessment, the national regulatory authority shall impose, maintain, amend or withdraw obligations, in accordance with Articles 236 and 327 of this Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).\n\n\n\n\n5. An undertaking on which functional separation has been imposed may be subject to any of the obligations identified in Articles 967 to 7213 in any specific market where it has been designated as having significant market power in accordance with Article 6516 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) , or any other obligations authorised by the Commission pursuant to Article 866(3).\n\n\nArticle 13b76\n\n\nVoluntary separation by a vertically integrated undertaking\n\n\n1. Undertakings which have been designated as having significant market power in one or several relevant markets in accordance with Article 6516of this Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive shall inform the national regulatory authority in advance and in a timely manner, in order to allow the national regulatory authority to assess the effect of the intended transaction, when they intend to transfer their local access network assets or a substantial part thereof to a separate legal entity under different ownership, or to establish a separate business entity in order to provide to all retail providers, including its own retail divisions, fully equivalent access products.\n\n\nUndertakings shall also inform the national regulatory authority of any change of that intent as well as the final outcome of the process of separation.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nUndertakings may also offer commitments regarding access conditions that will apply to their network during an implementation period and after the proposed form of separation is implemented, with a view to ensuring effective and non-discriminatory access by third parties. The offer of commitments shall include sufficient details, including in terms of timing of implementation and duration, so as to allow the national regulatory authority to conduct its tasks in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Such commitments may extend beyond the maximum period for market reviews established in Article 65(6). \n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/140/EC Art. 2.10 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n2.

In its decision, the national regulatory authority may make the commitments binding, wholly or in part. By way of exception to Article 65(6), the national regulatory authority may make some or all commitments binding for the entire period for which they are offered.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n3. \u00f0\u00a0Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 77,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Tthe legally and/or operationally separate business entity may be subject \u00f0\u00a0as appropriate\u00a0\u00ef to any of the obligations identified in Articles 679 to 1372 in any specific market where it has been designated as having significant market power in accordance with Article 65 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), or any other obligations authorised by the Commission pursuant to Article 866(3) \u00f0\u00a0and where any commitments offered are insufficient to meet the objectives of Article 3\u00ef .\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n4. The national regulatory authority shall monitor the implementation of the commitments offered by the undertakings that it has made binding in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and shall consider their extension when the period of time for which they are initially offered has expired.\n\n\nArticle 77\n\n\nVertically separate undertakings\n\n\n1. A national regulatory authority that designates an undertaking which is absent from any retail markets for electronic communications services as having significant market power in one or several wholesale markets in accordance with Article 65 shall consider whether that undertaking has the following characteristics: \n\n\n(a) all companies and business units within the undertaking, including all companies that are controlled but not necessarily wholly owned by the same ultimate owner(s),  only have activities, current and planned for the future, in wholesale markets for electronic communications services and therefore do not have activities in any retail market for electronic communications services provided to end-users in the Union; \n\n\n(b) the undertaking does not hold an exclusive agreement, or an agreement which de facto amounts to an exclusive agreement, with a single and separate undertaking operating downstream that is active in any retail market for electronic communications services provided to private or commercial end-users.\n\n\n2. If the national regulatory authority concludes that the conditions laid down in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article are fulfilled, it may only impose on that undertaking obligations pursuant to Articles 70 or 71.\n\n\n3.  The national regulatory authority shall review obligations imposed on the undertaking in accordance with this Article at any time if it concludes that the conditions laid down in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article are no longer met and shall apply Articles 65 to 72, as appropriate.\n\n\n4. The national regulatory authority shall also review obligations imposed on the undertaking in accordance with this Article if on the basis of evidence of terms and conditions offered by the undertaking to its downstream customers, the authority concludes that competition problems have arisen to the detriment of end-users which require the imposition of one or more obligations provided in Articles 67, 68, 69 or 72, or the modification of the obligations imposed in accordance with paragraph 2. \n\n\n5. The imposition of obligations and their review in accordance with this Article shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures referred to in Articles 23, 32 and 33.\n\n\nArticle 78\n\n\nMigration from legacy infrastructure\n\n\n1. Undertakings which have been designated as having significant market power in one or several relevant markets in accordance with Article 65 shall inform the national regulatory authority in advance and in a timely manner when they plan to decommission parts of the network, including legacy infrastructure necessary to operate a copper network, which are subject to obligations pursuant to Articles 66 to 77.\n\n\n2. The national regulatory authority shall ensure that the decommissioning process includes a transparent timetable and conditions, including inter alia an appropriate period of notice and for transition, and establishes the availability of alternative comparable products providing access to network elements substituting the decommissioned infrastructure if necessary to safeguard competition and the rights of end-users. \n\n\nWith regard to assets which are proposed for decommissioning, the national regulatory authority may withdraw the obligations after having ascertained: \n\n\n\n\n(a) the access provider has demonstrably established the appropriate conditions for migration, including making available a comparable alternative access product enabling to reach the same end-users, as was available using the legacy infrastructure; and\n\n\n(b) the access provider has complied with the conditions and process provided to the national regulatory authority in accordance with the present Article. \n\n\nSuch withdrawal shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures referred to in Articles 23, 32 and 33.\n\n\nPart III. SERVICES\n\n\nTitle I: Universal service obligations\n\n\nArticle\u00a079\n\n\nAffordable universal service\n\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that all end-users in their territory have access at an affordable price, in the light of specific national conditions, to available functional internet access and voice communications services at the quality specified in their territory, including the underlying connection, at least at a fixed location.\n\n\n2. Member States shall define the functional internet access service referred to in paragraph 1 with a view to adequately reflect services used by the majority of end-users in their territory. To that end, the functional internet access service shall be capable of supporting the minimum set of services set out in Annex V.\n\n\n3. When an end-user so requests, the connection referred to in paragraph 1 may be limited to support voice communications only.\n\n\nArticle\u00a080\n\n\nProvision of affordable universal service\n\n\n 1. National regulatory authorities shall monitor the evolution and level of retail tariffs of services identified in Article 79(1) available on the market, in particular in relation to national prices and national end-user income.\n\n\n2. Where Member States establish that, in the light of national conditions, retail prices for services identified in Article 79(1) are not affordable, because low-income or special social needs end-users are prevented from accessing such services, they may require undertakings which provide such services to offer to those end-users tariff options or packages different from those provided under normal commercial conditions. To that end, Member States may require such undertakings to apply common tariffs, including geographic averaging, throughout the territory. Member States shall ensure that end-users entitled to such tariff options or packages have a right to contract with an undertaking providing the services identified in Article 79(1) and that such undertaking provides them with an adequate period of availability of a number and avoid unwarranted disconnection of service.\n\n\n3. Member States shall ensure that undertakings which provide tariff options or packages to low-income or special social needs end-users pursuant to paragraph 2, keep the national regulatory authorities informed of the details of such offers. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that the conditions under which undertakings provide tariff options or packages pursuant to paragraph 2 are fully transparent and are published and applied in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory authorities may require that specific schemes be modified or withdrawn.\n\n\n4. Member States may, in the light of national conditions, ensure that support is provided to low-income or special social needs end-users in view of ensuring affordability of functional internet access and voice communications services at least at a fixed location.\n\n\n5. Member States shall ensure, in the light of national conditions, that support is provided as appropriate to end-users with disabilities, or that other specific measures are taken, in view of ensuring that related terminal equipment, specific equipment and specific services enhancing equivalent access are affordable.\n\n\n6. When applying this Article, Member States shall seek to minimise market distortions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\n\n\nArticle\u00a03\n\n\nAvailability of universal service\n\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that the services set out in this Chapter are made available at the quality specified to all end-users in their territory, independently of geographical location, and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price.\n\n\n2. Member States shall determine the most efficient and appropriate approach for ensuring the implementation of universal service, whilst respecting the principles of objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality. They shall seek to minimise market distortions, in particular the provision of services at prices or subject to other terms and conditions which depart from normal commercial conditions, whilst safeguarding the public interest.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC (adapted)\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nDesignation of undertakings\n\n\n1. Member States may designate one or more undertakings to guarantee the provision of universal service as identified in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 and, where applicable, Article 9(2) so that the whole of the national territory can be covered. Member States may designate different undertakings or sets of undertakings to provide different elements of universal service and/or to cover different parts of the national territory.\n\n\n2. When Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory as having universal service obligations, they shall do so using an efficient, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory designation mechanism, whereby no undertaking is a priori excluded from being designated. Such designation methods shall ensure that universal service is provided in a cost-effective manner and may be used as a means of determining the net cost of the universal service obligation in accordance with Article 12.\n\n\n3. When an undertaking designated in accordance with paragraph\u00a01 intends to dispose of a substantial part or all of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership, it shall inform in advance the national regulatory authority in a timely manner, in order to allow that authority to assess the effect of the intended transaction on the provision of access at a fixed location and of telephone services pursuant to Article\u00a04. The national regulatory authority may impose, amend or withdraw specific obligations in accordance with Article\u00a06(2) of Directive 2002/20/EC (Authorisation Directive).\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle\u00a081\n\n\nAvailability of universal service\n\n\n1.  Where a Member State has\u00a0duly demonstrated, account taken of the results of the geographical survey conducted in accordance with Article 22(1), that the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service cannot be ensured under normal commercial circumstances or through other potential public policy tools, it may impose appropriate universal service obligations to meet all reasonable requests for accessing those services in its territory.\u00a0\n\n\n2. Member States shall determine the most efficient and appropriate approach for ensuring the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service, whilst respecting the principles of objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality. They shall seek to minimise market distortions, in particular the provision of services at prices or subject to other terms and conditions which depart from normal commercial conditions, whilst safeguarding the public interest.\n\n\n3. In particular, where Member States decide to impose obligations to ensure the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service, they may designate one or more undertakings to guarantee the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access service as identified in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service in order to cover all the national territory. Member States may designate different undertakings or sets of undertakings to provide functional internet access and voice communications services at a fixed location and/or to cover different parts of the national territory.\n\n\n4. When Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory as undertakings having the obligation to ensure the availability at a fixed location of functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service, they shall do so using an efficient, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory designation mechanism, whereby no undertaking is a priori excluded from being designated. Such designation methods shall ensure that functional internet access and voice communications services at a fixed location are provided in a cost-effective manner and may be used as a means of determining the net cost of the universal service obligation in accordance with Article 84.\n\n\n5. When an undertaking designated in accordance with paragraph\u00a03 intends to dispose of a substantial part or all of its local access network assets to a separate legal entity under different ownership, it shall inform in advance the national regulatory authority in a timely manner, in order to allow that authority to assess the effect of the intended transaction on the provision at a fixed location of functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and of voice communications service. The national regulatory authority may impose, amend or withdraw specific obligations in accordance with Article\u00a013(2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.3\n\n\nArticle\u00a04\n\n\nProvision of access at a fixed location and provision of telephone services\n\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that all reasonable requests for connection at a fixed location to a public communications network are met by at least one undertaking.\n\n\n2. The connection provided shall be capable of supporting voice, facsimile and data communications at data rates that are sufficient to permit functional Internet access, taking into account prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers and technological feasibility.\n\n\n3. Member States shall ensure that all reasonable requests for the provision of a publicly available telephone service over the network connection referred to in paragraph\u00a01 that allows for originating and receiving national and international calls are met by at least one undertaking.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nDirectory enquiry services and directories\n\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that:\n\n\n(a) at least one comprehensive directory is available to end-users in a form approved by the relevant authority, whether printed or electronic, or both, and is updated on a regular basis, and at least once a year;\n\n\n(b) at least one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is available to all end-users, including users of public pay telephones.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.4\n\n\n2. The directories referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall comprise, subject to the provisions of Article\u00a012 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)\n101\n, all subscribers of publicly available telephone services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\n3. Member States shall ensure that the undertaking(s) providing the services referred to in paragraph 1 apply the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other undertakings.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.5\n\n\nPublic pay telephones and other publics voice telephony access points\n\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that national regulatory authorities may impose obligations on undertakings in order to ensure that public pay telephones or other public voice telephony access points are provided to meet the reasonable needs of end-users in terms of the geographical coverage, the number of telephones or other access points, accessibility to disabled end-users and the quality of services.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\n2. A Member State shall ensure that its national regulatory authority can decide not to impose obligations under paragraph 1 in all or part of its territory, if it is satisfied that these facilities or comparable services are widely available, on the basis of a consultation of interested parties as referred to in Article 33.\n\n\n3. Member States shall ensure that it is possible to make emergency calls from public pay telephones using the single European emergency call number \u2018112\u2019 and other national emergency numbers, all free of charge and without having to use any means of payment.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.6\n\n\nArticle\u00a07\n\n\nMeasures for disabled end-users\n\n\n1. Unless requirements have been specified under Chapter IV which achieve the equivalent effect, Member States shall take specific measures to ensure that access to, and affordability of, the services identified in Article\u00a04(3) and Article\u00a05 for disabled end-users is equivalent to the level enjoyed by other end-users. Member States may oblige national regulatory authorities to assess the general need and the specific requirements, including the extent and concrete form of such specific measures for disabled end-users.\n\n\n2. Member States may take specific measures, in the light of national conditions, to ensure that disabled end-users can also take advantage of the choice of undertakings and service providers available to the majority of end-users.\n\n\n3. In taking the measures referred to in paragraphs\u00a01 and\u00a02, Member States shall encourage compliance with the relevant standards or specifications published in accordance with Articles\u00a017 and\u00a018 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nAffordability of tariffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.8\n\n\n1. National regulatory authorities shall monitor the evolution and level of retail tariffs of the services identified in Articles\u00a04 to\u00a07 as falling under the universal service obligations and either provided by designated undertakings or available on the market, if no undertakings are designated in relation to those services, in particular in relation to national consumer prices and income.\n\n\n2. Member States may, in the light of national conditions, require that designated undertakings provide to consumers tariff options or packages which depart from those provided under normal commercial conditions, in particular to ensure that those on low incomes or with special social needs are not prevented from accessing the network referred to in Article\u00a04(1) or from using the services identified in Article\u00a04(3) and Articles\u00a05, 6 and\u00a07 as falling under the universal service obligations and provided by designated undertakings.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC\n\n\n3. Member States may, besides any provision for designated undertakings to provide special tariff options or to comply with price caps or geographical averaging or other similar schemes, ensure that support is provided to consumers identified as having low incomes or special social needs.\n\n\n4. Member States may require undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 to apply common tariffs, including geographical averaging, throughout the territory, in the light of national conditions or to comply with price caps.\n\n\n5. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where a designated undertaking has an obligation to provide special tariff options, common tariffs, including geographical averaging, or to comply with price caps, the conditions are fully transparent and are published and applied in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory authorities may require that specific schemes be modified or withdrawn.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nQuality of service of designated undertakings\n\n\n1. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that all designated undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2) publish adequate and up-to-date information concerning their performance in the provision of universal service, based on the quality of service parameters, definitions and measurement methods set out in Annex III. The published information shall also be supplied to the national regulatory authority.\n\n\n2. National regulatory authorities may specify, inter alia, additional quality of service standards, where relevant parameters have been developed, to assess the performance of undertakings in the provision of services to disabled end-users and disabled consumers. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that information concerning the performance of undertakings in relation to these parameters is also published and made available to the national regulatory authority.\n\n\n3. National regulatory authorities may, in addition, specify the content, form and manner of information to be published, in order to ensure that end-users and consumers have access to comprehensive, comparable and user-friendly information.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.9\n\n\n4.

National regulatory authorities shall be able to order independent audits or similar reviews of the performance data, paid for by the undertaking concerned, in order to ensure the accuracy and comparability of the data made available by undertakings with universal service obligations.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle\u00a082\n\n\nStatus of existing universal services\n\n\nMember States may continue to ensure the availability or affordability of other services than functional internet access service as defined in accordance with Article 79(2) and voice communications service at a fixed location that were in force prior to [set date], if the need for such services is duly demonstrated in the light of national circumstances. When Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory for the provision of those services, Article 81 shall apply. Financing of these obligations shall comply with Article 85.\n\n\nMember States shall review the obligations imposed pursuant to this Article at the latest 3 years after the entry into force of this Directive and thereafter once every year. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02002/22/EC (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nArticle 1083\n\n\nControl of expenditure\n\n\n1.

In the case of fixed networks, calls shall be considered to be exclusively packet switched.\n\n\nANNEX IV\n\n\nCRITERIA FOR ASSESSING CO-INVESTMENT OFFERS\n\n\nWhen assessing a co-investment offer pursuant to Article 74 (1) (d), the national regulatory authority shall verify whether the following criteria have been met: \n\n\n(a)The co-investment offer shall be open to any undertaking over the lifetime of the network built under a co-investment offer on a non-discriminatory basis. The SMP operator may include in the offer reasonable conditions regarding the financial capacity of any undertaking, so that for instance potential co-investors need to demonstrate their ability to deliver phased payments on the basis of which the deployment is planned, the acceptance of a strategic plan on the basis of which medium-term deployment plans are prepared, etc. \n\n\n(b)The co-investment offer shall be transparent:\n\n\n\u2013the offer is available and easily identified on the website of the SMP operator;\n\n\n\u2013full detailed terms must be made available without undue delay to any potential bidder that has expressed an interest, including  the legal form of the co-investment agreement and -  when relevant - the heads of term of the governance rules of the co-investment vehicle; and\n\n\n\u2013The process, like the road map for the establishment and development of the co-investment project must be set in advance, it must clearly explained in writing to any potential co-investor, and all significant milestones be clearly communicated to all undertakings without any discrimination. \n\n\n(c)The co-investment offer shall include terms to potential co-investors which favour sustainable competition in the long term, in particular: \n\n\n\u2013All undertakings have to be offered fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for participation in the co-investment agreement relative to the time they join, including in terms of financial consideration required for the acquisition of specific rights, in terms of the protection awarded to the co-investors by those rights both during the building phase and during the exploitation phase, for example by granting indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) for the expected lifetime of the co-invested network and in terms of the conditions for joining and potentially terminating the co-investment agreement. Non-discriminatory terms in this context do not entail that all potential co-investors must be offered exactly the same terms, including financial terms, but that all variations of the terms offered must be justified on the basis of the same objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable criteria such as the number of end user lines committed for.\n\n\n\u2013The offer must allow flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the commitment provided by each co-investor, for example by means of an agreed and potentially increasing percentage of the total end user lines in a given area, to which co-investors have the possibility to commit gradually and which shall be set at a unit level enabling smaller co-investors to gradually increase their participation while ensuring adequate levels of initial commitment. The determination of the financial consideration to be provided by each co-investor needs to reflect the fact that early investors accept greater risks and engage capital sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013A premium increasing over time has to be considered as justified for commitments made at later stages and for new co-investors entering the co-investment after the commencement of the project, to reflect diminishing risks and to counteract any incentive to withhold capital in the earlier stages. \n\n\n\u2013The co-investment agreement has to allow the assignment of acquired rights by co-investors to other co-investors, or to third parties willing to enter into the co-investment agreement subject to the transferee undertaking being obliged to fulfil all original obligations of the transferor under the co-investment agreement.\n\n\n\u2013Co-investors have to grant each other reciprocal rights on fair and reasonable terms and conditions to access the co-invested infrastructure for the purposes of providing services downstream, including to end-users, according to transparent conditions which have to be made transparent in the co-investment offer and subsequent agreement, in particular where co-investors are individually and separately responsible for the deployment of specific parts of the network. If a co-investment vehicle is created, it has to provide access to the network to all co-investors, whether directly or indirectly, on an equivalence of inputs basis and according to fair and reasonable terms and conditions, including financial conditions that reflect the different levels of risk accepted by the individual co-investors. \n\n\n(d)The co-investment offer shall ensure a sustainable investment likely to meet future needs, by deploying new network elements that contribute significantly to the deployment of very high capacity networks. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\nANNEX V\n\n\nLIST OF SERVICES WHICH THE FUNCTIONAL INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE SHALL BE CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 79(2)\n\n\n(1)E-mail\n\n\n(2)search engines enabling search and finding of all type of information \n\n\n(3)basic training and education online tools\n\n\n(4)online newspapers/news\n\n\n(5)buying/ordering goods or services online\n\n\n(6)job searching and job searching tools\n\n\n(7)professional networking\n\n\n(8)internet banking\n\n\n(9)eGovernment service use\n\n\n(10)social media and instant messaging\n\n\n(11)calls and video calls (standard quality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/136/EC Art. 1.28 and Annex I (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\nANNEX\u00a0IVI\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITIES AND SERVICES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE\u00a010\u00a083 (CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE), ARTICLE\u00a029\u00a0107 (ADDITIONAL FACILITIES) AND ARTICLE\u00a030\u00a099 (FACILITATING CHANGE OF PROVIDER \u00d6\u00a0AND NUMBER PORTABILITY\u00a0\u00d5 )\n\n\nPart A: Facilities and services referred to in Article\u00a01083\n\n\n(a) Itemised billing\n\n\nMember States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities, subject to the requirements of relevant legislation on the protection of personal data and privacy, may lay down the basic level of itemised bills which are to be provided by undertakings to subscribers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef free of charge in order that they can:\n\n\n(i) allow verification and control of the charges incurred in using the public communications network at a fixed location and/or related publicly available telephone\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0voice communications\u00a0\u00ef services \u00f0\u00a0, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 107\u00a0\u00ef ; and\n\n\n(ii) adequately monitor their usage and expenditure and thereby exercise a reasonable degree of control over their bills.\n\n\nWhere appropriate, additional levels of detail may be offered to subscribers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef at reasonable tariffs or at no charge.\n\n\nCalls which are free of charge to the calling subscribers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef, including calls to helplines, are not to be identified in the calling subscriber's\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end user's\u00a0\u00ef itemised bill.\n\n\n(b) Selective barring for outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS, or, where technically feasible, other kinds of similar applications, free of charge\n\n\ni.e. the facility whereby the subscribers\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0end-users\u00a0\u00ef can, on request to the designated undertaking that provides telephone\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0voice communications\u00a0\u00ef services \u00f0\u00a0, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 107\u00a0\u00ef , bar outgoing calls or premium SMS or MMS or other kinds of similar applications of defined types or to defined types of numbers free of charge.\n\n\n(c) Pre-payment systems\n\n\nMember States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities may require designated undertakings to provide means for consumers to pay for access to the public communications network and use of publicly available telephone\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0voice communications\u00a0\u00ef services \u00f0\u00a0, or number-based interpersonal communications services in the case of Article 107,\u00a0\u00ef on pre-paid terms.\n\n\n(d) Phased payment of connection fees\n\n\nMember States are to ensure that national regulatory authorities may require designated undertakings to allow consumers to pay for connection to the public communications network on the basis of payments phased over time.\n\n\n(e) Non-payment of bills\n\n\nMember States are to authorise specified measures, which are to be proportionate, non-discriminatory and published, to cover non-payment of telephone bills issued by undertakings.

In undertaking a calculation exercise, the net cost of universal service obligations is to be calculated as the difference between the net cost for \u00d6\u00a0any\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0designated undertaking of operating with the universal service obligations and operating without the universal service obligations. This applies whether the network in a particular Member State is fully developed or is still undergoing development and expansion. Due attention is to be given to correctly assessing the costs that any designated undertaking would have chosen to avoid had there been no universal service obligation. The net cost calculation should assess the benefits, including intangible benefits, to the universal service operator.\n\n\nThe calculation is to be based upon the costs attributable to:\n\n\n(i) elements of the identified services which can only be provided at a loss or provided under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.\n\n\nThis category may include service elements such as access to emergency telephone services, provision of certain public pay telephones, provision of certain services or equipment for disabled people, etc;\n\n\n(ii) specific end-users or groups of end-users who, taking into account the cost of providing the specified network and service, the revenue generated and any geographical averaging of prices imposed by the Member State, can only be served at a loss or under cost conditions falling outside normal commercial standards.\n\n\nThis category includes those end-users or groups of end-users which would not be served by a commercial operator which did not have an obligation to provide universal service.\n\n\nThe calculation of the net cost of specific aspects of universal service obligations is to be made separately and so as to avoid the double counting of any direct or indirect benefits and costs. The overall net cost of universal service obligations to any undertaking is to be calculated as the sum of the net costs arising from the specific components of universal service obligations, taking account of any intangible benefits. The responsibility for verifying the net cost lies with the national regulatory authority.\n\n\nPart B: Recovery of any net costs of universal service obligations\n\n\nThe recovery or financing of any net costs of universal service obligations requires designated undertakings with universal service obligations to be compensated for the services they provide under non-commercial conditions. Because such a compensation involves financial transfers, Member States are to ensure that these are undertaken in an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. This means that the transfers result in the least distortion to competition and to user demand.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 13(3), a sharing mechanism based on a fund should use a transparent and neutral means for collecting contributions that avoids the danger of a double imposition of contributions falling on both outputs and inputs of undertakings.\n\n\nThe independent body administering the fund is to be responsible for collecting contributions from undertakings which are assessed as liable to contribute to the net cost of universal service obligations in the Member State and is to oversee the transfer of sums due and/or administrative payments to the undertakings entitled to receive payments from the fund.\n\n\nANNEX\u00a0IIVIII\n\n\nINFORMATION TO BE PUBLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE\u00a02196\n\n\n(TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION)\n\n\nThe national regulatory authority has a responsibility to ensure that the information in this Annex is published, in accordance with Article\u00a02196. It is for the national regulatory authority to decide which information is to be published by the undertakings providing \u00f0\u00a0publicly available electronic communications services, except number-independent interpersonal communications services \u00a0\u00ef\u00a0public communications networks and/or publicly available telephone services and which information is to be published by the national regulatory authority itself, so as to ensure that consumers are able to make informed choices. \u00f0\u00a0If deemed appropriate, national regulatory authorities may promote self- or co-regulatory measures prior to imposing any obligation.\u00a0\u00ef\n\n\n1.

Common scrambling algorithm and free-to-air reception\n\n\nAll consumer equipment intended for the reception of conventional digital television signals (i.e. broadcasting via terrestrial, cable or satellite transmission which is primarily intended for fixed reception, such as DVB-T, DVB-C or DVB-S), for sale or rent or otherwise made available in the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 , capable of descrambling digital television signals, is to possess the capability to:\n\n\n\u2013allow the descrambling of such signals according to a common European scrambling algorithm as administered by a recognised European standards organisation, currently ETSI,\n\n\n\u2013display signals that have been transmitted in the clear provided that, in the event that such equipment is rented, the renter is in compliance with the relevant rental agreement.\n\n\n2. Interoperability for analogue and digital television sets\n\n\nAny analogue television set with an integral screen of visible diagonal greater than 42\u00a0cm which is put on the market for sale or rent in the Community is to be fitted with at least one open interface socket, as standardised by a recognised European standards organisation, e.g. as given in the Cenelec EN 50\u00a0049-1:1997 standard, permitting simple connection of peripherals, especially additional decoders and digital receivers.\n\n\nAny digital television set with an integral screen of visible diagonal greater than
