Integration and a perfectly functioning internal market are indispensable in making the Europe 2020 strategy successful; put the EU economy on a sustainable growth path in order to overcome the financial and sovereign debt crisis that unfolded since 2008.\n\n\nAs capital markets are global, harmonisation of financial reporting and audit rules at global level is essential for the smooth functioning of the capital markets and also the realisation of an integrated market for financial services in the EU. Instead of introducing its own set of financial reporting standards, the EU decided in 2002 with the adoption of the Regulation 1606/2002 on the application of international accounting standards (IAS Regulation) to implement internationally agreed accounting standards, the so-called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\n\nWith more and more countries moving towards and adopting IFRS, the EU has to speak with one voice. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), the European Commission's technical adviser in accounting matters has gradually taken up the role of providing upstream, technical and credible input to the IASB standard setting process.\n\n\nBoth the international standard setter and the organisation representing Europe's interests need to be independent, possess the sufficient capacity and expertise to produce quality standards and input to those standards, and have sound financial basis in order to be able to carry out their public interest mission on a long-term basis.\n\n\nTo these ends, in 2009 the European Parliament and the Council established a Community Programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing\n1\n. This programme was extended with the Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 April 2014 (\"Financing Regulation\"). The beneficiaries of the extended programme are the IFRS Foundation, EFRAG and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB).\n\n\nThe Financing Regulation prolonged the financing of the IFRS Foundation and PIOB for the period 2014-2020. In view of the uncertainties related to a major governance reform the organisation was undergoing in 2014, the co-legislators decided to limit its financing period until the end of 2016 and called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, if appropriate, to continue financing of EFRAG after 31 December 2016. In the meantime, the governance reform of EFRAG was successfully implemented on 31 October 2014. Consequently, the purpose of this regulation is to extend the Union co-financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 under the Union programme established by the Financing Regulation. \n\n\n1.1.EFRAG\n\n\nEFRAG was established in 2001 as a private organisation to provide the Commission with technical expertise in financial reporting matters. At the beginning, EFRAG provided mainly advice to the Commission on whether an international accounting standard to be adopted in the Union meets the technical endorsement criteria\n2\n. EFRAG has gradually taken on the role of pro-actively influencing the IASB in its standard setting work. It provides input by issuing comment letters on draft standards and early-stage contribution by publishing discussion papers on current accounting issues. \n\n\nOriginally, representation and voting rights at EFRAG's governing bodies (such as the General Assembly and the Supervisory Board) were tied to the financial contribution to EFRAG's budget. The body in charge of the core technical work, the TEG (Technical Expert Group), has always been independent.\n\n\nOn 12 November 2013 the Commission published the report of Philippe Maystadt, special advisor to the Commissioner responsible for internal market and services, in which he outlined potential reforms to EFRAG governance aimed at reinforcing the Union's contribution to the development of international accounting standards. The recommendations of Philippe Maystadt were broadly supported by the ECOFIN Council of 15 November 2014. The timely implementation of the reform was also deemed necessary by the European Parliament and the Council to achieve the expected objectives of the co-financing programme established by the Financing Regulation of 2014.\n\n\nIn July 2014, the Commission submitted a report to the European Parliament and the Council\n3\n on the progress achieved in the implementation of the reform of EFRAG, which came to a favourable conclusion regarding the progress made to date.\n\n\nThe reform involved a fundamental revision of the EFRAG Statutes and the EFRAG Internal rules to incorporate a new governance structure, which increased the legitimacy and representativeness of EFRAG. The revised EFRAG Statutes and EFRAG Internal Rules were approved on 16 June 2014 with an effective date of 31 October 2014. On the same day EFRAG enlarged its membership\n4\n and the new governance structure became operational as of November 2014.\n\n\nThe reform resulted in establishing a new Board of EFRAG, its new decision-making body, with balanced representation of public and private interests. The EFRAG Board takes all its decisions on a consensus basis after considering the results of EFRAG\u2019s due process. The Commission, European Supervisory Authorities and the European Central Bank have been contributing to the discussions of the Board as observers. The President of the Board is nominated by the Commission after consulting the European Parliament and the Council. Currently, one of the Board Members acts as the President pending the formal appointment. The Commission ensures that the Accounting Regulatory Committee provides input to EFRAG or requests specific assessments where it is needed. As a result, EFRAG is now well equipped to strengthen the legitimacy of its positions and significantly contribute to the objective of Europe speaking with one voice. \n\n\nIn order to continue to play a key role in ensuring Union's needs and interest are duly taken into account in the development phase of new standards as well as to provide the Commission with high quality endorsement advice on new or amended standards, EFRAG needs solid, long-term, diverse funding to be credible and independent and be able to produce top-quality documents by employing top-quality experts.\n\n\nIn line with the Financing Regulation, EFRAG was allocated an amount of EUR 9 303 000 for the period 2014-2016. The current regulation proposes to allocate to EFRAG an additional amount of EUR 13 831 000 for the period 2017-2020. This amount corresponds to the amount of financing EFRAG for that period in the Commission proposal of 19 December 2012 for the Financing Regulation currently in place. In order to ensure the operational continuity of EFRAG it is necessary to maintain the EU co-financing given that it accounts for approximately 60% of EFRAG's budget.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n2.1.Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nThe legal basis is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a0114.\n\n\nIn accordance with the Commission legislative policy adopted in the framework of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the present funding programme is proposed as a Regulation.\n\n\n2.2.Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nThe Union programme provides for the possibility to co-finance activities of certain bodies pursuing aims of a general Union interest on Union-wide issues in the field of financial reporting and auditing. The proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle since, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union, its objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the scale and the effect of the action, be better achieved at Union level.\n\n\n2.3.Proportionality principle\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. As assessed in the ex-ante evaluation accompanying the Commission proposal of 19 December 2012 for the Financing Regulation currently in place, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objectives. Union funding is proposed for a well-defined and limited number of the most important bodies in the field of financial services. Within the current institutional framework, the new funding arrangements will ensure stable, diversified, sound and adequate funding to enable the relevant bodies to carry out their Union-related or Union public interest mission in an independent and efficient manner. Financial support will be granted according to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nIn the ex-ante evaluation\n5\n accompanying the Commission's proposal of 19 December 2012 for the Financing Regulation that is currently in place, different possible alternatives of funding EFRAG were assessed. The objectives of the programme established by the Regulation were to ensure stable, diversified, sound and adequate funding and to enable EFRAG to accomplish its mission in an independent and efficient manner. It has been concluded that Union co-financing is the most efficient option. This assessment is still valid following the governance reform of EFRAG implemented in 2014.\n\n\n\nIn the ex-ante evaluation it was concluded that the programme with respect to EFRAG has so far met the objectives set and that financing should be continued. As explained above, the governance reform of EFRAG was successfully implemented in 2014 following the recommendations laid down in the report of Philippe Maystadt. The Commission favorably assessed the activities of EFRAG following the reform in its report to the European Parliament and the Council of 17 September 2015.\n6\n In the report, the Commission confirmed that EFRAG took account in its endorsement assessments of whether IFRS were meeting all technical criteria of the IAS Regulation. Following its governance reform, EFRAG has strengthened its scope of assessment of whether new or proposed financial reporting requirements are conducive to the public good. The Commission also welcomed EFRAG's willingness to further develop its capacities with respect to the analysis of the effects of standards including macro-economic effects such as any detrimental effects on financial stability or economic development in the EU.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it is appropriate to propose to continue financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 in order to meet the long-term objectives of the Union programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing. For more details please refer to the Commission services' ex ante evaluation accompanying the Commission's proposal of 19 December 2012 for the Financing Regulation that is currently in place (COM(2012)782final).\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposed regulation prolongation of the financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 will increase the total budget of the programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing from EUR 43.176 million to approx. EUR 57 million.\n\n\nThis will result in additional amount to be borne by the Union's budget of EUR 13.831 million. \n\n\n\n2016/0110 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 establishing a Union Programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing for the period of 2014-20 \n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n7\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On the basis of Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n8\n, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (the IFRS Foundation), which is the legal successor to the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) benefit from Union co-financing in the form of operating grants until 31 December 2020.\n\n\n(2)The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 258/2014, benefits from Union co-financing in the form of operating grants until 31 December 2016.\n\n\n(3)On 12 November 2013, the Commission published the report of Philippe Maystadt, special advisor to the Commissioner responsible for internal market and services (the \u2018special advisor\u2019s report\u2019), in which he outlined potential reforms to EFRAG governance aimed at reinforcing the Union\u2019s contribution to the development of international accounting standards.\n\n\n(4)The Commission closely monitored the implementation of the reform of EFRAG governance and informed duly the European Parliament and the Council of the progress in its implementation. The Commission found that EFRAG successfully implemented the conclusions of the special advisor\u2019s report, by implementing a new governance structure, which has increased the legitimacy and representativeness of EFRAG. Therefore it is appropriate to continue financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 in order to meet the long-term objectives of the Union programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing.\n\n\n(5)Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(6)Since the objective of this Regulation, namely increasing the budget of a Union programme for the period 2017 to 2020 in order to support the activities of EFRAG, which contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in relation to financial reporting, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1 \n\n\nRegulation (EU) No 258/2014 is amended as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1) in Article 3(1)(a), point (i) is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"(i) EFRAG;\";\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Article 6 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n\n\"1.

These controls are documented in checklists that are systematically filled in by all actors involved in the respective financial transactions (OIA,OVA,OVA2,FIA, FVA, FVA2, AO), including controls carried out by the DG's financial unit on financial and legal matters in order to deliver the \"Bon \u00e0 Payer\"\n\n\n\u2013 The DG's financial unit systematically carries out on-the-spot controls
