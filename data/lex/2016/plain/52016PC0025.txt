"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 28.1.2016\nCOM(2016) 25 final\n2016/0010(CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe European Council Conclusions of 18 December 2014 cite \"an urgent need to advance efforts in the fight against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, both at the global and EU levels\". Since December 2014, the Commission has quickly launched the first steps towards an EU approach. In the meanwhile the OECD has finalized its work in defining the global rules and standards to these ends.\n\n\nThis Directive amending Council Directive 2011/16/EU as part of the Commission's Anti- Tax Avoidance Package, addresses the political priority of fighting against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. It also responds to the demands from the European Parliament. It is also in line with the initiatives announced in the Commission's Action Plan on a Fairer Corporate Tax System (COM (2015) 302) to tackle tax avoidance.\n\n\nBusinesses have traditionally viewed tax planning as legitimate on the grounds that they use legal arrangements to reduce their tax liabilities. However, tax planning has become more elaborate in recent years, developing across jurisdictions and shifting taxable profits towards states with beneficial tax regimes. This \"aggressive\" form of tax planning can take a multitude of forms, such as taking advantage of the technicalities of a tax system or of mismatches between two or more tax systems for the purpose of reducing or avoiding tax liabilities. Its consequences include double deductions (e.g. the same expense is deducted in both the state of source and the state of residence) and double non-taxation (e.g. income is not taxed in either its state of source or in the recipient\u2019s state of residence).\n\n\nUnlike Small and medium companies or individual taxpayers, Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Groups are in a position that renders them capable of exploiting loopholes in domestic and international tax laws to shift profits from one country to the next in order to reduce their tax bill.\n\n\nThe global economic and financial crisis of the last years had made the public aware of the need to ensure that all contributors pay their fair share of tax payments. This should result in higher tax revenues that would contribute to the reduction of public sector deficits for the benefit of all. \n\n\nIn this context, tax authorities need comprehensive and relevant information on structure, transfer pricing policy and internal transactions with related parties of MNE Groups. With the aim to combat tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, this Directive imposes transparency requirements on MNE Groups. It requires MNE Groups to provide annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business certain information including the amount of revenue, the profit before income tax, the income tax paid and accrued, the number of employees, the stated capital, the retained earnings and the tangible assets. This information will enable the tax authorities to react to harmful tax practices through changes in the legislation or adequate risk assessments and tax audits. Increased transparency should also incentivize MNE Groups to pay their fair share of tax in the country where profits are made. \n\n\nThe new transparency requirements should ensure that the administrative burden imposed on businesses is minimized. EU MNE Groups should in principle not be obliged to submit the information to of all the EU Member States where they operates, but only to the tax authorities of their of residence. The Directive requires Member States, once they have received the country-by-country report, to share the information with the Member States in which, on the basis of the information in the report, companies of the MNE Group are either resident for tax purposes, or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a permanent establishment.\n\n\nTo ensure an appropriate balancing of reporting burden and benefit to tax administrations, only MNE Groups with total consolidated group revenue equal or higher than \nEUR 750 000 000, will be obliged to file the country-by-country report. According to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) estimations, approximately 85 to 90 percent of MNE groups will be excluded from the requirement, but the country-by-country report will nevertheless be filed by MNE groups controlling approximately 90 percent of corporate revenues.\n\n\nNow more than ever, cooperation between Member States\u2019 tax authorities is crucial in order to tackle tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. EU legislation provides for administrative cooperation between Member States' tax authorities, and sets out a series of instruments to help them to cooperate in collecting their due revenues, including exchange of information. However, the EU needs to continue reinforcing cooperation to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market in respect with fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\n\nCouncil Directive 77/799/EEC\n1\n was the first response to Member States\u2019 need for enhanced mutual assistance in the field of taxation. It was replaced by Council Directive 2011/16/EU\n2\n (DAC) that was intended to increase the effectiveness of the previous Directive. In recent years, the Directive has been amended by Directive 2014/107/EU (DAC2) and by Directive EU 2015/2376 (DAC3) providing tax authorities with further instruments to tackle tax fraud and evasion and aggressive tax planning, in the field of financial accounts, tax rulings and advance pricing arrangements.\n\n\nThe purpose of the present proposal is to ensure that Directive 2011/16/EU continues providing for comprehensive and effective administrative co-operation between tax administrations by providing for the mandatory automatic exchange of information regarding country-by-country reports. \n\n\nThis Directive is in line with the international developments. On 5 October 2015 the OECD presented its final reports on the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) which is a major initiative for modifying existing international tax rules. On 15-16 November 2015 the OECD package was also endorsed by the G20 leaders. The work on Action 13 of the OECD\u2019s Action Plan on BEPS resulted in a set of standards for providing information on MNE Groups' transfer pricing positions, including the masterfile, the local file and the country-by-country report. The Directive contributes to the implementation in the Union of the country-by-country report.\n\n\nMost Member States, in their capacity as OECD members, have committed to implementing the outputs contained in the Final Reports on the 15 Actions against BEPS. It is therefore essential for the good functioning of the Internal Market that Member States transpose political commitments under BEPS into their national systems in a coherent and sufficiently coordinated fashion. This should be the way ahead in order to maximise the positive effects for the Internal Market as a whole. If not, unilateral implementation of BEPS would risk national policy clashes and new obstacles in the Internal Market, which would continue to be fragmented in 28 constituent parts and suffer from mismatches and other distortions. \n\n\nThis initiative aims at achieving a certain degree of uniformity in implementing the BEPS Action 13 across the EU. The Directive also intends to foster fair competition between the different business operators and ultimately to protect the tax base of EU Member States.\n\n\nThe proposal has been specifically designed to allow the automatic information exchange on country-by-country reporting to build on the existing rules in Directive 2011/16/EU relating to the practical arrangements for exchanging information including the use of standard forms. \n\n\nThe Commission\u2019s commitment to making such a proposal for the AEOI on country-by-country reporting is reflected in the Commission's 2016 Work Programme.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nTax Transparency Package (COM (2015) 136)\n\n\nThe Package contained two main elements: (i) a proposal to introduce the AEOI between Member States on their tax rulings and (ii) an announcement that the Commission was assessing whether additional disclosure obligations of certain corporate tax information should be introduced.\n\n\nThis proposal does not preclude that the Commission decides in the future to propose imposing public disclosure obligations on companies.\n\n\nCommission's Action Plan on a Fairer Corporate Tax System (COM (2015) 302)\n\n\nThis proposal is in line with the initiatives announced in the Action Plan to tackle tax avoidance.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal modifies Directive 2011/16/EU as amended by Directive 2014/107/EU\n4\n  and by Council Directive EU 2015/2376\n5\n by introducing a specific requirement for the AEOI on country-by-country report.\n\n\nThe modifications are contained in Article 1 of the proposal. In particular:\n\n\nArticle 3 (definitions) is amended. \n\n\nArticle 8aa requires Member States to oblige MNE Groups to submit the relevant information (the country by country report) and to automatically exchange that information received with the other Member States concerned.  \n\n\nArticle 20 (6) refers to the standard form that will be used for the exchange and Article 21 (7) provides for the practical arrangements.\n\n\nA new Article 25a on penalties is added.\n\n\nA new Annex, including the definitions applicable to the proposal, the obligations for MNE Groups and the templates for the exchange of information, is added. \n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe subject-matter of these modifications falls within the same legal basis as Directive 2011/16/EU, i.e. Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which aims to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market. Article 115 TFEU provides for the approximation of such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States which directly affect the establishment or functioning of the internal market and make the approximation of laws necessary.\n\n\nTo ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the EU needs to ensure fair competition and a level playing field between SME, non-EU and EU MNE Groups. MNE Groups have the possibility to engage in aggressive tax planning practices due to their cross border activities. For this reason, all MNEs, both EU Groups and non-EU Groups, should be subject to the reporting obligation. Without this element this initiative would be less effective in achieving the ultimate objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal Market.\n\n\nThis proposal complies with the principles of Subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 paragraph 3 of the Treaty on the European Union.\n\n\n\n\nAccess by Member States to country-by-country reporting can therefore only be achieved effectively through action at Union level. The objective of ensuring that all Member States receive country-by-country reporting cannot be sufficiently achieved through non-coordinated action taken by each Member State individually. Moreover, the exchange of information that potentially affects the tax bases of more than one Member State requires a common and compulsory approach. It should be taken into account that as MNE Groups normally operate in different Member States, the cross-border element is inherent in the proposed action.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe specific problem identified as the object of a policy response is the lack of transparency on corporate structures with cross-border relevance and important level of activity, which has negative effects, notably on the proper functioning of the Internal Market. The policy response is limited to addressing MNE Groups operating in several States, either within the European Union or with non-EU jurisdictions. Thus, the proposal represents the most proportionate answer to the identified problem. It is also based on the automatic exchange of basic information allowing each Member State where the company operates to receive information. The proposed amendments consequently do not go beyond what is necessary to address the issues at stake and, in that way, to achieve the Treaty's objectives of a proper and effective functioning of the Internal Market. \n\n\nThis proposal complies with the principles of proportionality as set out in Article 5, paragraph 4 of the Treaty on the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe present proposal will expand further the scope of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) in the EU. An EU initiative is needed both from an internal market perspective and in terms of efficiency and effectiveness: \n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An EU initiative ensures a coherent, consistent and comprehensive EU-wide approach to AEOI in the internal market. It would mean a single reporting approach across Member States which would lead to costs savings both for tax administrations and companies.\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An EU legal instrument would also ensure certainty for tax administrations and companies within the EU.\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An EU legal instrument would contribute to the development of the international standard of AEOI on country-by-country reports as discussed and agreed at the OECD.\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An EU legal instrument based on the DAC would involve the use of the IT arrangements already in place or under development to facilitate information reporting under the DAC. Under this Directive, EU Member States share information in specific formats using a specific communication channel. These formats could easily be extended so as to be usable also for the additional items now proposed for inclusion. As Member States have invested considerable time and money in developing these formats, there would be economies of scale if Member States also exchanged information on the new items using these formats.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nConsultations in the context of the Action Plan on tax fraud and tax evasion of the Recommendations (COM (2012) 722) and other fora\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn its resolution on 21 May 2013,\n6\n the European Parliament welcomed the Commission's Action Plan and its Recommendations, urged Member States to follow up their commitments and embrace the Action Plan, and emphasised that the EU should take a leading role in global discussions on the fight against tax fraud, tax avoidance and tax havens, in particular in relation to promoting the exchange of information.\n\n\nThe European Economic and Social Committee adopted an opinion on 17 April 2013.\n7\n  The Committee endorsed the Commission's Action Plan and supported its efforts to find practical solutions aimed at reducing tax fraud and tax evasion. \n\n\nOver recent years, Member States have worked in the Code of Conduct Group to improve the exchange of information regarding cross-border rulings and in the area of transfer pricing. Conclusions of this Code of Conduct Group have been communicated to the Council on a regular basis in the form of reports.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\nMost Member States are members of the OECD and have participated in lengthy and detailed discussions on the anti-BEPS Actions, including on the elaboration of technicalities, between 2013 and 2015. The OECD organised extensive public consultations with stakeholders on each of the anti-BEPS Actions. Furthermore, the Commission has debated internally and with OECD experts several BEPS topics, in particular where the Commission has had doubts about the compatibility of certain ideas and/or proposed solutions with EU law.\n\n\nIn the second half of 2014, the Italian Presidency of the Council launched the idea of an 'EU - BEPS Roadmap' and the Presidency encouraged consistency with parallel OECD initiatives, while respecting EU law. This approach was endorsed by the High Level Working Party on Taxation and pursued by the subsequent Presidencies. Discussions on the EU - BEPS Roadmap continued into 2015. The aim was to contribute to the OECD debate and pave the way towards a smooth implementation of the future OECD Recommendations, whilst taking account of EU specificities.\n\n\nThe Commission's public consultation on tax transparency provided stakeholders with the possibility to comment on different aspects of corporate transparency in particular on the basis of country-by-country reporting. The possible options presented were mainly focused on public reporting by enterprises but included the exchange of information between tax administrations as required by BEPS Action 13. The Commission received in total 422 responses, of which most provided useful feedback regarding either public or non-public tax transparency measures. As regards BEPS Action 13, although business were not keen on tax authorities exchanging such information the majority of other respondents were in favour.\n\n\n\n\n\nMember States\n\n\n\nThis Directive is in line with international developments at the level of the OECD and its work on BEPS where most EU Member States participate. The European Commission has also been heavily involved and other jurisdictions and stakeholders were consulted widely. \n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nAfter its report on Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting was published in early 2013 and the so-called Action Plan on BEPS was endorsed by the G20 Leaders in September 2013, the OECD embarked on a 2-year period of intensive work which led to the delivery of 13 reports, in November 2015. These reports lay down new or reinforced international standards as well as concrete measures to help countries tackle BEPS. In this framework, OECD/G20 members are committed to this comprehensive package and to its consistent implementation.\n\n\nMany Member States, in their capacity as OECD Members, have, in some areas very urgently, embarked on the transposition of the output of the BEPS project into their national laws. Considering this, it is critical to make fast progress on agreeing rules for coordinating the implementation of the conclusions on BEPS in the EU. In the light of a great risk of fragmentation of the internal market, which would possibly result from uncoordinated unilateral actions by Member States, the Commission is putting forward, in this proposal, solutions for achieving coherence a certain degree of uniformity in implementing the BEPS Action 13 across the EU.\n\n\nThe Commission has made every effort to respond simultaneously to both the urgency to act, and the imperative need to avoid that the functioning of the internal market is compromised either by unilateral measures adopted by Member States (whether OECD members or not) acting on their own, or lack of action by other Member States altogether. The possibility of proposing soft law was also considered as an option but was discarded as inappropriate for securing a coordinated approach.\n\n\nTo provide up-to-date analysis and evidence, a separate Staff Working Document (SWD) accompanying the proposal provides an extensive overview of existing academic work and economic evidence in the field of base erosion and profit shifting. This is based on recent studies, amongst others, by the OECD, the European Commission and European Parliament. The SWD highlights the drivers and most common identified mechanisms which, according to the OECD reports, are linked to aggressive tax planning. It summarises the conclusions of an in-depth review of key mechanisms for aggressive tax planning on a basis of analysis per Member State, as carried out on behalf of the Commission in 2015. The SWD outlines how implementation of BEPS Action 13 through this proposal complements other initiatives to implement the OECD BEPS reports in the EU and contribute towards a common minimum level of protection against tax avoidance.\n\n\nAgainst this background, no impact assessment was carried out for this proposal on the following grounds: there is a strong link to the OECD BEPS work in particular with BEPS Action 13; the SWD supplies a significant body of evidence and analysis; stakeholders were extensively involved in consultations on the technical elements of the proposed rules at a previous stage; and, in particular, there is an urgent current demand for coordinated action in the EU on this matter of international political priority.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe impact of the proposal on the EU Budget is presented in the financial statement accompanying the proposal, and will be met within available resources. The costs of the additional IT tools to facilitate the communication of information between Member States would be funded out of the FISCALIS 2020 programme provided for in Regulation (EU) 1286/2013 which provides financial support for activities to improve administrative cooperation between tax authorities in the EU.\n\n\n\n2016/0010 (CNS)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\n\n\namending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 and 115 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n9\n,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n10\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\u00a0\n\n\n(1)In recent years, the challenge posed by tax fraud and tax evasion has increased considerably and has become a major focus of concern within the Union and at global level. The automatic exchange of information constitutes an important tool in this regard and the Commission in its Communication of 6 December 2012 containing an Action plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion highlighted the need to promote vigorously the automatic exchange of information as the future European and international standard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters. The European Council in its conclusions of 22 May 2013 requested the extension of automatic information exchange at Union and global levels with a view to combatting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.\n\n\n(2)As Multi National Enterprise (MNE) Groups are active in different countries, they have the possibility of engaging in aggressive tax planning practices that are not available for domestic companies. When MNEs do so, purely domestic companies, normally small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may be particularly affected as their tax burden is higher than that of MNE Groups. On the other hand, all Member States may suffer revenue losses and there is the risk of competition to attract MNE Groups by offering them further tax benefits. There is therefore a problem for the proper functioning of the Internal Market.\n\n\n(3)Union tax authorities need comprehensive and relevant information on MNE Groups regarding their structure, transfer pricing policy and internal transactions in and outside the EU. That information will enable the tax authorities to react to harmful tax practices through changes in the legislation or adequate risk assessments and tax audits, and to identify whether companies have engaged in practices that have the effect of artificially shifting substantial amounts of income into tax-advantaged environments.\n\n\n(4)Increased transparency towards tax authorities could have the effect of giving MNE Groups an incentive to abandon certain practices and pay their fair share of tax in the country where profits are made. Enhancing transparency for MNE Groups is therefore an essential part of tackling base erosion and profit shifting.\n\n\n(5)Resolution of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States on a code of conduct on transfer pricing documentation for associated enterprises in the European Union (EU TPD) already provides EU MNE Groups in the Union with a method to provide tax authorities with information on global business operations and transfer pricing policies (masterfile) and information on the concrete transactions of the local entity (local file). However, the EU TPD dos not provide at present any mechanism for the provision of a country-by-country report. \n\n\n(6)In the country-by-country report, MNEs Groups should provide annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid and accrued. MNE Groups should also report number of their employees, stated capital, retained earnings and tangible assets in each tax jurisdiction. Finally, MNE Groups should identify each entity within the group doing business in a particular tax jurisdiction and should provide an indication of the business activities each entity engages in.\n\n\n(7)In order to enhance the efficient use of public resources and reduce the administrative burden for MNE Groups, the reporting obligation should only apply to MNE Groups with annual consolidated group revenue exceeding a certain amount. The Directive should ensure that the same information is collected and made available to tax administrations in a timely manner throughout the EU.\n\n\n(8)To ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market, the EU has to provide for fair competition between EU MNE Groups and non-EU MNE Groups for which one or several of their entities are located in the EU. Both of them should therefore be subject to the reporting obligation.\n\n\n(9)Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should ensure that those penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive and that they are implemented\n\n\n(10)To ensure the proper functioning of the internal Market, it is necessary to ensure that Member States adopt coordinated rules on transparency obligations of MNE Groups.\n\n\n(11)As regards exchange of information between Member States, Council Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC already provides for the mandatory automatic exchange of information in a number of fields. Its scope should be enlarged to provide for the mandatory automatic exchange of country-by-country reports between Member States.\n\n\n(12)The mandatory automatic exchange of country-by-country reports between Member States should in each case include the communication of a defined set of basic information that would be accessible to those Member States in which, on the basis of the information in the country-by-country report, one or more entities of the MNE Group are either resident for tax purposes, or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a permanent establishment of an MNE Group.\n\n\n(13)In order to minimise costs and administrative burdens both for tax administrations and for MNE Groups, it is necessary to provide rules that are in line with the international developments and contribute positively to their implementation. On 19 July 2013 the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) published an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) which is a major initiative for modifying existing international tax rules. On 5 October 2015 the OECD presented its final reports that were endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers. During the meeting of 15 and 16 November 2015, the OECD package was also endorsed by the G20 leaders.\n\n\n(14)The work on Action 13 of the BEPS Action Plan resulted in a set of standards for providing information for MNE Groups, including the masterfile, the local file and the country-by-country report. It is therefore appropriate to take into account the OECD standards when establishing the rules on the country-by-country report.\n\n\n(15)Union action in the area of country-by-country reporting should continue to take particular account of future developments at OECD level. In implementing this Directive, Member States should use the 2015 Final Report on Action 13 of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, developed by the OECD, as a source of illustration or interpretation of this Directive and in order to ensure consistency in application across Member States. \n\n\n(16)It is necessary to specify linguistic requirements for the exchange of information between Member States on country-by-country report. It is also necessary to adopt the practical arrangements necessary for the upgrading of CCN network. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Articles 20(6) and 21(7), implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n\n(17)In order to enhance the efficient use of resources, facilitate the exchange of information and avoid the need for each Member State to make similar adjustments to their systems the exchange of information should be made through the common communication network (CCN) developed by the Union. The practical arrangements necessary for the upgrading of the system should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2) of Directive 2011/16/EU.\n\n\n\n\n(18)The scope of mandatory exchange of information should therefore be extended to include the automatic exchange of information of the country-by-country report.\n\n\n(19)This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\u00a0\n\n\n(20)Since the objective of this Directive, namely the efficient administrative cooperation between Member States under conditions compatible with the proper functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the uniformity and effectiveness required, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n\n(21)\u00a0Directive 2011/16/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nDirective 2011/16/EU is amended as follows:\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Article 3 is amended as follows: \n\n\n(a)point 9 is replaced by the following\n\n\n9.

Following up on this, one key area for action in the Commission work programme for 2016 is to enhance transparency of the corporate tax system\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nSpecific objective\n\n\nSpecific objective of the FISCALIS programme is to support the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning and the implementation of Union law in the field of taxation by ensuring exchange of information, by supporting administrative cooperation and, where necessary and appropriate, by enhancing the administrative capacity of participating countries with a view to assisting in reducing the administrative burden on tax authorities and the compliance costs for taxpayers\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\nABB 3\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nFirst, automatic exchange of information between Member States on country by country reporting will mean that all Member States will be able to properly assess whether multinationals groups engage in aggressive tax planning and will be able to react accordingly. \n\n\nSecond, the fact that there is more transparency should create a greater incentive for ensuring that tax competition becomes fairer. Automatic exchange of information on country by country reports may also deter companies from aggressive tax planning, since Member States will now have the information needed to detect and react to artificial arrangements and profit shifting. \n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe proposal will be governed by the requirements in the Directive that it is amending (i.e. Directive 2011/16) for the provision by Member States on an annual basis of an evaluation of the effectiveness of the automatic exchange of information.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nThis proposal would require Member States, once they have received the country-by-country report, to share the information with the Member States in which, on the basis of the information in the report, companies of the MNE Group are either resident for tax purposes, or are subject to tax with respect to the business carried out through a permanent establishment \n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nAn EU initiative ensures a coherent, consistent and comprehensive EU-wide approach to AEOI in the internal market. It would mean a single reporting approach across Member States which would lead to costs savings both for tax administrations and companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn EU legal instrument would also ensure certainty for tax administrations and companies within the EU, contribute to the development of the international standard of AEOI on country-by-country reports as discussed and agreed at the OECD and would involve the use of the IT arrangements already in place or under development to facilitate information reporting under the DAC. Under this Directive, EU Member States share information in specific formats using a specific communication channel. These formats could easily be extended so as to be usable also for the additional items now proposed for inclusion. As Member States have invested considerable time and money in developing these formats, there would be economies of scale if Member States also exchanged information on the new items using these formats.\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe automatic exchange of information between tax administrations which applies in other tax fields, such as for savings income, has led to good results. Automatic exchange is now accepted at global level as the best tool available to tax administrations to tackle tax avoidance and evasion and aggressive tax planning.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nAs the proposal is designed to amend the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (2011/16), the procedures, arrangements and IT tools already established or under development under that Directive will be available for use for the purposes of this proposal.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,\n\n\n\u2013The proposal will take effect from 1 January 2017\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Direct management by the Commission\n\n\n\u2013\u2612 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations; the Fiscalis 2020 programme is managed in direct mode.\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the executive agencies \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u2013\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial Regulation;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n\u2013If more than one management mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nNothing as regards management would change under this proposal. Under Article 21 of Directive 2011/16, the Commission, in comitology in conjunction with Member States, develops the formats for information exchange. As regards the CCN network necessary to permit the exchange of information between Member States, the Commission is responsible for whatever development of the CCN network is necessary to permit the exchange of that information while Member States are responsible for whatever development of their systems is necessary to enable information in question to be exchanged using the CCN network.\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nUnder the FISCALIS programme, the monitoring and reporting is dealt with as follows:\n\n\nPreparatory activities required for this initiative and other joint actions and common training activities are monitored regularly through input collected from the participants and action managers. The input is collected via standardised forms and feeds in indicators established in the Fiscalis 2020 programme performance measurement framework (PMF). Other expenditure related to the exchange of information is monitored according to the mechanism described under section 1.4.4 and also consolidated under PMF.\n\n\n\n2.2.Management and control system \n\n\n2.2.1.Risk(s) identified \n\n\n\nThe potential risks for the implementation of the initiative with the Fiscalis 2020 support relate to:\n\n\nImplementation of the grant agreement signed with the consortium of the Member States and Candidate Countries\n\n\nImplementation of the procurement contracts concluded under the programme\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the internal control system set up\n\n\n\nThe set-up of internal control system is identical to the Fiscalis 2020 programme, which will be covering all operational expenditures of the initiative.\n\n\nThe main elements of the control strategy applied are:\n\n\nFor procurement contracts: \n\n\nThe control procedures for procurement defined in the Financial Regulation are applied. Any procurement contract is established following the established procedure of verification by the services of the Commission for payment, taking into account contractual obligations and sound financial and general management. Anti-fraud measures (controls, reports, etc.) are foreseen in all contracts concluded between the Commission and the beneficiaries. Detailed terms of reference are drafted and form the basis of each specific contract. The acceptance process follows strictly the TAXUD TEMPO methodology: deliverables are reviewed, amended if necessary and finally explicitly accepted (or rejected). No invoice can be paid without an \"acceptance letter\". \n\n\nTechnical verification for procurement\n\n\nDG TAXUD performs controls of deliverables and supervises operations and services carried out by contractors. It also conducts quality and security audits of their contractors on a regular basis. Quality audits verify the compliance of the contractors' actual processes against the rules and procedures defined in their quality plans. Security audits focus on the specific processes, procedures and set-up. \n\n\nIn addition to the above controls, DG TAXUD performs the traditional financial controls: \n\n\nEx-ante verification of commitments: \n\n\nAll commitments in DG TAXUD are verified by the head of the HR and Finances Unit. Consequently, 100% of the committed amounts are covered by the ex-ante verification. This procedure gives a high level of assurance as to the legality and regularity of transactions.\n\n\nEx-ante verification of payments: \n\n\n100% of payments are verified ex-ante. Moreover, at least one payment (from all categories of expenditures) per week is randomly selected for additional ex-ante verification performed by the head of the HR and Finances Unit. There is no target concerning the coverage, as the purpose of this verification is to check payments \"randomly\" in order to verify that all payments were prepared in line with the requirements. The remaining payments are processed according to the rules in force on a daily basis.\n\n\nDeclarations of the AOSD: \n\n\nAll the Authorising Officers by Sub-Delegations sign declarations supporting the Annual Activity Report for the year concerned. These declarations cover the operations under the programme. The AOSD declare that the operations connected with the implementation of the budget have been executed in accordance with the principles of the sound financial management, that the management and control systems in place provided satisfactory assurance concerning the legality and regularity of the transactions and that the risks associated to these operations have been properly identified, reported and that mitigating actions have been implemented. \n\n\n\n2.2.3.Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \n\n\n\nThe controls established enable DG TAXUD to have sufficient assurance of the quality and regularity of the expenditure and reduce the risk of non-compliance. The above control strategy measures reduce the potential risks bellow the target of 2% and it reaches all beneficiaries Any additional measures for further risk reduction would result in disproportionate high costs and are therefore not envisaged. \n\n\nThe overall costs entailed to implement the above control strategy \u2013 for all expenditures under Fiscalis 2020 programme \u2013 are limited to 1.6 % of the total payments made. It is expected to remain at the same ratio for this initiative.\n\n\nThe programme control strategy is deemed efficient to limit the risk of non-compliance to virtually zero and to be proportionate with the risks entailed.\n\n\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\n\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, in accordance with the provisions and procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) and Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 ( 2 ) with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract funded under this Regulation\n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE

will receive tax-related information on entities which will put them in an informed position to target tax audits; ii) the general public may view the measure as an active step to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes; iii) companies might limit their aggressive tax planning structures. While Member States will have an increased administrative burden directly related to providing information on country-by-country reports, these costs are expected to be limited given the fact that the reports are prepared by the entities..\n\n\n3.2.3.Estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature\n\n\n3.2.3.1.Summary \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal/initiative does

Purpose\n\n\nThe template shall be used for reporting a multinational enterprise's (MNE) group allocation of income, taxes and business activities on a tax jurisdiction-by-tax jurisdiction basis.\n\n\n\n2. Treatment of Branches and Permanent Establishments\n\n\nThe permanent establishment data shall be reported by reference to the tax jurisdiction in which it is situated and not by reference to the tax jurisdiction of residence of the business unit of which the permanent establishment is a part. Residence tax jurisdiction reporting for the business unit of which the permanent establishment is a part shall exclude financial data related to the permanent establishment.\n\n\n\n3. Period covered by the annual template\n\n\nThe template shall cover the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE. For Constituent Entities, at the discretion of the Reporting MNE, the template shall reflect on a consistent basis either of the following information:\n\n\n(a) information for the fiscal year of the relevant Constituent Entities ending on the same date as the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE, or ending within the 12 month period preceding such date;\n\n\n(b) information for all the relevant Constituent Entities reported for the fiscal year of the Reporting MNE.\n\n\n\n4. Source of data\n\n\nThe Reporting MNE shall consistently use the same sources of data from year to year in completing the template. The Reporting MNE may choose to use data from its consolidation reporting packages, from separate entity statutory financial statements, regulatory financial statements, or internal management accounts. It is not necessary to reconcile the revenue, profit and tax reporting in the template to the consolidated financial statements. If statutory financial statements are used as the basis for reporting, all amounts shall be translated to the stated functional currency of the Reporting MNE at the average exchange rate for the year stated in the Additional Information section of the template. Adjustments need not be made, however, for differences in accounting principles applied from tax jurisdiction to tax jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe Reporting MNE shall provide a brief description of the sources of data used in preparing the template in the Additional Information section of the template.

Tax Jurisdiction\n\n\nIn the first column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall list all of the tax jurisdictions in which Constituent Entities of the MNE group are resident for tax purposes. A tax jurisdiction is defined as a State as well as a non-State jurisdiction which has fiscal autonomy. A separate line shall be included for all Constituent Entities in the MNE group deemed by the Reporting MNE not to be resident in any tax jurisdiction for tax purposes. Where a Constituent Entity is resident in more than one tax jurisdiction, the applicable tax treaty tie breaker shall be applied to determine the tax jurisdiction of residence. Where no applicable tax treaty exists, the Constituent Entity shall be reported in the tax jurisdiction of the Constituent Entity's place of effective management. The place of effective management shall be determined with internationally agreed standards.\n\n\n1.2. Revenues\n\n\nIn the three columns of the template under the heading 'Revenues', the Reporting MNE shall report the following information: \n\n\n(a) the sum of revenues of all the Constituent Entities of the MNE group in the relevant tax jurisdiction generated from transactions with associated enterprises; \n\n\n(b) the sum of revenues of all the Constituent Entities of the MNE group in the relevant tax jurisdiction generated from transactions with independent parties; \n\n\n(c) the total of the sums referred to in points (a) and (b). \n\n\nRevenues shall include revenues from sales of inventory and properties, services, royalties, interest, premiums and any other amounts. Revenues shall exclude payments received from other Constituent Entities that are treated as dividends in the payer's tax jurisdiction.\n\n\n1.3. Profit (Loss) before Income Tax\n\n\nIn the fifth column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the sum of the profit (loss) before income tax for all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction.

Income Tax Paid (on Cash Basis)\n\n\nIn the sixth column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the total amount of income tax actually paid during the relevant fiscal year by all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction. Taxes paid shall include cash taxes paid by the Constituent Entity to the residence tax jurisdiction and to all other tax jurisdictions. Taxes paid shall include withholding taxes paid by other entities (associated enterprises and independent enterprises) with respect to payments to the Constituent Entity. Thus, if company A resident in tax jurisdiction A earns interest in tax jurisdiction B, the tax withheld in tax jurisdiction B shall be reported by company A.\n\n\n1.5. Income Tax Accrued (Current Year)\n\n\nIn the seventh column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the sum of the accrued current tax expense recorded on taxable profits or losses of the year of reporting of all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction. The current tax expense shall reflect only operations in the current year and shall not include deferred taxes or provisions for uncertain tax liabilities.\n\n\n1.6. Stated Capital\n\n\nIn the eighth column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the sum of the stated capital of all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction.

Number of Employees\n\n\nIn the tenth column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the total number of employees on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis of all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction. The number of employees may be reported as of the year-end, on the basis of average employment levels for the year, or on any other basis consistently applied across tax jurisdictions and from year to year. For this purpose, independent contractors participating in the ordinary operating activities of the Constituent Entity may be reported as employees. Reasonable rounding or approximation of the number of employees is permissible, providing that such rounding or approximation does not materially distort the relative distribution of employees across the various tax jurisdictions. Consistent approaches shall be applied from year to year and across entities.\n\n\n\n\n1.9. Tangible Assets other than Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n\nIn the eleventh column of the template, the Reporting MNE shall report the sum of the net book values of tangible assets of all the Constituent Entities resident for tax purposes in the relevant tax jurisdiction.
