At the same time, the energy sector plays a key role in the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by at least 40% until 2030 with an expected share of 50% of renewables by 2030. \n\n\nThe proposals for a recast of the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity, the Regulation on the electricity market and the Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are part of the Commission's broader package of initiatives (\"Clean Energy for All Europeans\"). The Package comprises the Commission's key proposals to implement the Energy Union, as foreseen in the Energy Union Roadmap\n1\n. It includes both legislative proposals as well as non-legislative initiatives to create a conducive enabling framework to deliver tangible benefits for citizens, jobs, growth and investments while contributing to all five dimensions of the Energy Union. The key priorities for the package are thus energy efficiency first, the EU's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers.\n\n\nBoth the European Council\n2\n and the European Parliament\n3\n have repeatedly stressed that a well-functioning integrated energy market is the best tool to guarantee affordable energy prices, secure energy supplies and to allow for the integration and development of larger volumes of electricity produced from renewable sources in a cost efficient manner. Competitive prices are essential for achieving growth and consumer welfare in the European Union, and hence are at the heart of EU energy policy. The current electricity market design is based on the rules of the \"Third Energy Package\n4\n\", adopted in 2009. These rules have subsequently been complemented by legislation against market abuses\n5\n and implementing legislation concerning electricity trade and grid operation rules\n6\n. The EU internal energy market is built on well-established principles, such as the right of access for third parties to electricity grids, free choice of suppliers for consumers, robust unbundling rules, the removal of barriers to cross-border trade, market supervision by independent energy regulators, and the EU-wide cooperation of regulators and grid operators within the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO).\n\n\nThe Third Energy Package has brought tangible progress for consumers. It has led to increased liquidity of European electricity markets and significantly increased cross-border trade. Consumers in many Member States can now benefit from more choice. Increased competition notably on wholesale markets helped to keep wholesale prices in check. New consumer rights introduced by the Third Energy Package have clearly improved the position of consumers in energy markets. \n\n\nNew developments have led to fundamental changes in European electricity markets. The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E) has steeply increased. This shift towards RES-E will continue as it is a key condition to fulfil the Union's obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate. The physical nature of RES-E \u2013 more variable, less predictable and decentralised than traditional generation \u2013 requires an adaptation of market and grid operation rules to the more flexible nature of the market. In parallel, state interventions, often designed in an uncoordinated manner, have led to distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade\n7\n. Significant changes are also taking place on the technological side. Electricity is traded almost European-wide through so-called \"market coupling\", jointly organised by power exchanges and transmission system operators. Digitalisation and the rapid development of internet-based metering and trading solutions enable industry, businesses and even households to generate and store electricity, as well as participate in electricity markets via so-called 'demand response' solutions. The electricity market of the next decade will be characterised by more variable and decentralised electricity production, an increased interdependence between Member States and new technological opportunities for consumers to reduce their bills and actively participate in electricity markets through demand response, self-consumption or storage. \n\n\nThe present electricity market design initiative thus aims to adapt the current market rules to new market realities, by allowing electricity to move freely to where it is most needed when it is most needed via undistorted price signals, whilst empowering consumers, reaping maximum benefits for society from cross-border competition and providing the right signals and incentives to drive the necessary investments to decarbonise our energy system. It will also give priority to energy efficiency solutions, and contribute to the goal of becoming a world leader in energy production from renewable energy sources, thus contributing to the Union's target to create jobs, growth and attract investments.\n\n\nAdapting market rules\n\n\nThe existing market rules are based on the predominant generation technologies of the last decade, i.e. centralised, large-scale fossil fuel-based power plants with limited participation of consumers. As variable RES-E will play an increasing role in the generation mix in future, and consumers should be enabled to participate in the markets if they wish so, the rules need to be adapted. Short-term electricity markets which allow trading RES-E across borders are key for the successful integration of RES-E into the market. This is because most generation from renewables can only be accurately forecasted shortly before the actual production (due to weather uncertainties). The creation of markets which allow participation at short notice before actual delivery (so-called \"intraday\" or \"balancing\" markets) are a crucial step to enable RES-E producers to sell their energy at fair terms and it will also increase liquidity in the market. Short-term markets will provide new business opportunities for participants to offer \"back-up\" energy solutions at times of high demand and scarce renewable generation. This includes the possibility for consumers to shift their demand (\"demand response\"), storage operators or flexible generators. While dealing with variability in small regions can be very expensive, aggregation of variable production over larger areas could help consumers save significant amounts of money. Yet, integrated short-term markets are still missing.\n\n\nThe shortcomings of the current market arrangements reduce the attractiveness of the energy sector for new investment. An adequately interconnected, market-based energy system in which prices follow market signals will stimulate the necessary investments into generation and transmission in an effective manner and ensure that they are made where they are most needed by the market, thereby minimising the need for state-planned investments. \n\n\nNational market rules (e.g. price caps) and state interventions currently hinder prices from reflecting when electricity is scarce. Furthermore, price zones do not always reflect actual scarcity if poorly configured and instead follow political borders. The new market design aims to improve price signals to drive investment in areas where it is needed most, reflecting grid constraints and demand centres, rather than national borders. Price signals should also allow for adequate remuneration of flexible resources (including demand-response and storage), as these resources rely on rewards for shorter periods of time (e.g. modern gas plants which are only used for peak hours or  the reduction of industrial demand at times of peak demand or system stress). Effective price signals also ensure the efficient dispatch of existing generation assets. It is therefore critical to review any existing rules that distort price formation (such as rules prioritising the dispatch of certain installations) in order to activate and fully realise the flexibility potential that the demand side can offer\n\n\nPutting consumers at the heart of the energy market \n\n\nFully integrating industrial, commercial and residential consumers into the energy system can avoid significant costs for 'backup' generation; costs which consumers would otherwise end up paying. It even allows consumers to benefit from price fluctuations and to earn money through participation in the market. Activating consumer participation is therefore a prerequisite for managing the energy transition successfully and in a cost-effective way. \n\n\nDelivering a new deal for energy consumers is a key commitment of the Energy Union. However, current market rules often do not allow consumers to benefit from these new opportunities. Although consumers can generate and store electricity as well as manage their energy consumption more easily than ever, the current design of the retail market prevents them from being able to fully benefit from such opportunities.\n\n\nIn most Member States, consumers have little or no incentive to change their consumption in response to changing prices in the markets, as real-time price signals are not passed on to final consumers. The market design package is an opportunity to deliver on this commitment. More transparent real time price signals will stimulate consumer participation, either individually or through aggregation, and make the electricity system more flexible, facilitating the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources. Besides offering great energy saving potential for households, technological developments mean that appliances and systems, such as smart white electronics, electric vehicles, electric heating, air conditioning and heat pumps in insulated buildings and district heating and cooling, can automatically follow price fluctuations and, on a large scale, offer a significant and flexible contribution to the electricity grid. In order to enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities, they must have access to fit-for-purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices linked to the spot market. In addition to consumers adjusting their consumption to price signals, new demand services are currently emerging whereby new market actors offer to manage the electricity consumption of a number of consumers by paying them a compensation for their flexibility. Although such services are already encouraged under existing EU legislation, the evidence suggests that these provisions have not been effective in removing the primary market barriers for those service providers to enter the market. Sharpening these provisions is necessary to further encourage such new services.\n\n\nIn many Member States, electricity prices do not follow demand and supply, but are regulated by the public authorities. Price regulation can limit the development of effective competition, discourage investments and the emergence of new market players. The Commission therefore committed in its Energy Union Framework Strategy\n8\n to phase-out regulated prices below cost and to encourage Member States to establish a road map for the phasing-out of all regulated prices.\u00a0The new market design aims at ensuring that supply prices are free of any public intervention, and only with duly justified exceptions.\n\n\n\n\nRapidly falling technology costs mean that more and more consumers are able to reduce their energy bills by using technologies such as rooftop solar panels and batteries. However, self-generation is still hampered by a lack of common rules for 'prosumers'. Appropriate rules could remove these barriers, e.g. by guaranteeing consumers' rights to generate energy for their own consumption and sell surplus into the grid, while taking into account the costs and benefits for the system as a whole (e.g. appropriate participation in grid costs).\n\n\nLocal energy communities can be an efficient way of managing energy at community level by consuming the electricity they generate either directly for power or for (district) heating and cooling, with or without a connection to distribution systems. To ensure that such initiatives can freely develop, the new market design requires Member States to put in place appropriate legal frameworks to enable their activities.\n\n\nToday, more than 90% of variable renewable electricity sources are connected to distribution grids. The integration of local generation has in fact contributed to a significant increase in network tariffs for household consumers. In addition, taxes and levies to finance grid extensions and renewables' investments have risen drastically. The new market design and the revision of the Renewables Directive provide an opportunity to address these shortcomings, which can disproportionately impact certain household consumers.\n\n\nAllowing Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to manage some of the challenges associated with variable generation more locally (e.g. by managing local flexibility resources) could significantly reduce network costs. However, since many DSOs are part of vertically integrated companies which are also active in the supply business, regulatory safeguards are necessary to guarantee the DSOs' neutrality in their new functions, e.g. in terms of data management and when using flexibility to manage local congestions. \n\n\nAnother key driver to competition and consumer engagement is information. Previous Commission consultations and studies have shown that consumers complain about a lack of transparency in electricity markets, reducing their ability to benefit from competition and actively participate in markets. Consumers do not feel informed enough about alternative suppliers, the availability of new energy services and complain about the complexity of offers and procedures for switching suppliers. The reform will also ensure data protection as an increased use of new technologies (notably smart metering systems) will generate a range of energy data carrying high commercial value.\n\n\nIn putting consumers at the heart of the energy market, an essential consideration in the new market design is how to ensure that the most vulnerable in society are protected and that the overall number of energy-poor households will not further increase. With rising levels of energy poverty as well as a lack of clarity on the most appropriate means of tackling consumer vulnerability and energy poverty, the new market design proposal requires Member States to duly measure and regularly monitor energy poverty based on principles defined at EU level. The revised Energy Efficiency and Energy Performance of Building Directives provide for further measures to tackle energy poverty.\n\n\nSecurity of electricity supply\n\n\nSecurity of electricity supply is indispensable in modern societies which largely depend on electricity and internet driven systems. It is therefore necessary to assess the ability of the European electricity system to offer sufficient generation and flexibility to ensure reliable electricity supply at all times (resource adequacy). Ensuring security of supply is not only a national obligation, but a key pillar of European energy policy\n9\n. This is because security of supply can, in a fully interconnected and synchronised network with well-functioning markets, be organised far more efficiently and competitively than on a purely national basis. Grid stability in individual Member States often heavily depends on electricity flows from neighbouring countries and potential security of supply problems therefore usually have a regional impact. For this reason, the most efficient remedies to national generation deficits are often regional solutions, allowing Member States to benefit from generation surpluses in other countries. A coordinated European adequacy assessment should therefore be introduced, following a jointly agreed methodology, in order to obtain a realistic picture of possible generation needs, taking into account the integration of electricity markets and potential flows from other countries. If the coordinated adequacy assessment shows that capacity mechanisms are necessary in certain countries or regions, such mechanisms should be designed so as to minimise distortions to the internal market. Clear and transparent criteria to minimise distortions of cross-border trade, maximise use of demand response, and reduce impacts affecting decarbonisation should therefore be defined to avoid the risk of fragmented national capacity mechanisms creating new market barriers and undermining competition\n10\n.  \n\n\nStrengthening regional cooperation\n\n\nThe close interconnection of EU Member States through the common trans-European grid is unique in the world and a great asset when it comes to dealing efficiently with the energy transition. Without the ability to rely on generation or demand resources from other Member States, the costs of the energy transition for consumers would increase significantly. Today, system operation across borders is much more interrelated than it was in the past. This is due to the increase in variable and decentralised generation, together with closer market integration, especially in shorter market time intervals. This also means that national actions by regulators or grid operators can have an immediate effect on other EU Member States. Experience has shown that uncoordinated national decisions can lead to significant costs for European consumers. \n\n\nThe fact that some interconnectors are only used to 25% of their capacities, often due to uncoordinated national limitations, and that Member States have not been able to agree on appropriate price zones illustrates that there is a need for more coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and regulators. Successful examples of voluntary and mandatory cooperation between TSOs, regulators and governments have shown that regional cooperation can improve market functioning and reduce costs significantly. In certain areas, e.g. for the EU-wide 'market coupling' mechanism, TSO cooperation has already become mandatory, and the system of majority voting on some issues has proven to be successful in areas where voluntary cooperation (leaving each TSO a veto right) did not lead to efficient results for regional problems. Following this successful example, mandatory cooperation should be expanded to other areas in the regulatory framework. To this end, TSOs could decide within 'Regional Operational Centres' (ROCs) on those issues where fragmented and uncoordinated national actions could negatively affect the market and consumers (e.g. in the fields of system operation, capacity calculation for interconnectors, security of supply and risk preparedness). \n\n\nAdapting regulatory oversight to regional markets\n\n\nIt appears appropriate to also adapt regulatory oversight to the new realities of the market. All main regulatory decisions are currently taken by national regulators, even in cases where a common regional solution is needed. While ACER has been successful in providing a forum for the coordination of national regulators with diverging interests, its main role is currently confined to coordination, advising and monitoring. While market actors increasingly cooperate across borders and decide on certain matters concerning grid operation and electricity trading with qualified majority at a regional or even Union level\n11\n, there is no equivalent for these regional decision-making procedures at regulatory level. Regulatory oversight therefore remains fragmented, leading to a risk of diverging decisions and unnecessary delays. Strengthening the powers of ACER for those cross-border issues which require a coordinated regional decision would contribute to faster and more effective decision-making on cross-border issues. National regulators, deciding within ACER on those issues through majority voting, would remain fully involved in the process.\n\n\nIt also appears appropriate to better define the role of ENTSO-E in order to strengthen its coordination role and render its decision-making process more transparent. \n\n\nText clarifications \n\n\nFinally, the recast of the Electricity Regulation, the Agency Regulation and the Electricity Directive will be used to provide some editorial clarifications on some of the existing rules and to restructure some of them in order to make the-highly technical-rules of the three acts more comprehensible, without touching upon the substance of the provisions. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other provisions and proposals in the policy area\n\n\nThe market design initiative is strongly linked to other energy and climate legislative proposals brought forward in parallel. These notably include initiatives to improve Europe's energy efficiency, a renewable energy package, and the overarching initiative addressing governance and reporting mechanisms for the Energy Union. All those initiatives aim at implementing the necessary measures to achieve the objective of a competitive, secure and sustainable Energy Union. The intention of packaging the different initiatives, consisting of multiple legislative and non-legislative levers, is to ensure utmost coherence of the different but closely interlinked policy proposals. \n\n\nTherefore, although the current proposal is centred on updating market rules so as to make a clean energy transition economically advantageous, these provisions work in synergy with the wider EU climate and energy policy framework. These links are further explained in the Commission's Impact Assessment\n12\n.\n\n\nThe proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a revised Renewable Energy Directive, providing for a framework to achieve the 2030 renewable target, including also principles in relation to support schemes for renewable energy sources, which would make them more market-oriented, cost-effective and more regionalised in scope in cases where Member States are opting to keep support schemes. Those measures aimed at the integration of renewable energies in the market, such as provisions on dispatching, market-related barriers to self-consumption and other market access rules \u2013 previously contained in the Renewable Energy Directive \u2013, have now been integrated in the Electricity Regulation and the Electricity Directive. \n\n\n\n\nThe proposal for a Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union will contribute to ensuring policy coherence by streamlining planning and reporting obligations by Member States so as to better support the convergence towards energy and climate goals set at EU level. As a new planning, reporting and monitoring instrument, it shall provide a temperature gauge on the state of progress from a Member State on the implementation of European-wide market requirements introduced by the present acts.\n\n\nThe proposal for a Regulation on risk preparedness in the electricity sector complements the current proposal, focusing in particularly on government actions to manage electricity crisis situations and to prevent short term risks for the electricity system. \n\n\nThe current proposal is closely aligned with the Commission's competition policy in the field of energy. It incorporates notably the results of the Commission's Sector Inquiry on Capacity Mechanisms, ensuring full coherence with the Commission's energy state aid enforcement policy.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe proposal seeks to implement key objectives of the Energy Union, as defined in the Framework Strategy for a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy. As already stated above, the details of the package are also in line with the recent global-level engagement by the Union to achieve ambitious climate targets under the agreement found in Paris at the 21st UN Conference of the Parties (COP21). The current proposal is mutually reinforcing and complementary to the proposal for the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System made in July 2015.\n\n\nFurther, to the extent that a revision of the electricity market design is aimed at making Europe's energy market more competitive and accessible for new energy technologies, the proposal also contributes to fulfilling the Union's objectives to generate jobs and growth. By offering market opportunities for new technologies, the proposal will spur the uptake of a number of services and products that would give European businesses a first-mover advantage as the clean energy transition advances globally.  \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for the proposed measures is Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which consolidated and clarified the competences of the EU in the field of energy. According to Article 194 TFEU, the main aims of the EU\u2019s energy policy are to: ensure the functioning of the energy market; ensure security of energy supply in the Union; promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy; and promote the interconnection of energy networks. \n\n\nThe present initiative also builds upon a comprehensive set of legislative acts that have been adopted and updated during the past two decades. With the objective of creating an internal energy market, the EU has adopted three consecutive legislative packages between 1996 and 2009, with the overarching aim of integrating markets and liberalising national electricity and gas markets. These provisions cover a wide range of aspects, from market access to transparency, consumer rights and the independence of regulatory authorities, to name a few.\n\n\nWith an eye on existing legislation and the general trajectory of growing energy market integration, the current initiative should thus also be seen as part of an ongoing effort to ensure the integration and effective operation of Europe\u2019s energy markets.\n\n\nRecent calls from the European Council\n13\n and the European Parliament for action at EU level to complete the European energy market have also created further ground for action. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsidiarity \n\n\nThe proposed changes to the provisions of the Regulation on electricity markets, the Directive on common rules for the internal electricity market and the Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are necessary to achieve the purpose of an integrated EU electricity market and cannot be reached at national level in an equally efficient manner. As set out in detail in the evaluation of the recast legislative acts\n14\n, evidence has shown that isolated national approaches have led to delays in the implementation of the internal energy market, leading to sub-optimal and incompatible regulatory measures, unnecessary duplication of interventions and delays in correcting market inefficiencies. The creation of an internal energy market that delivers competitive and sustainable energy for all cannot be achieved on the basis of fragmented national rules where they concern the trading of energy, the operation of the shared grid and a certain amount of product standardisation.\n\n\nThe increasing interconnection of EU electricity markets requires closer coordination between national actors. National policy interventions in the electricity sector have a direct impact on neighbouring Member States due to energy interdependence and grid interconnections. Ensuring the stability of the grid and its efficient operation is increasingly difficult to do at national level alone, as rising cross-border trade, the uptake of decentralised generation and enhanced consumer participation, all increase the potential for spill-over effects. No state can effectively act alone and the consequences of unilateral action have become more pronounced over time. This general principle applies across the range of measures introduced by the current proposal, whether they concern energy trading, the operation of the grid and consumers\u2019 effective participation.\n\n\nSince common regional issues which require a coordinated decision often have a significant economic impact on individual Member States, past experience has shown that voluntary cooperation, while useful in many areas of cooperation between Member States, has often not been able to overcome technically complex conflicts with significant distributive effects between Member States\n15\n. Existing voluntary initiatives, such as the Pentalateral Energy Forum, are also limited in their geography, as they only cover parts of the EU electricity market and do not necessarily combine all countries which are physically most closely interconnected. \n\n\nTo illustrate on a concrete example, uncoordinated national policies concerning the principles for distribution tariffs may distort the internal market to an extent that distributed generation or energy storage services will be under very different incentives to participate in the market. With the uptake of new technologies and energy services increasingly traded across borders, EU action has a significant value in ensuring a level playing field and more efficient market outcomes for all parties involved.\n\n\nThe coordinating function of ACER has been adapted to new developments in energy markets, such as the increased need for coordination in times of higher energy flows across borders and the rise of energy production from volatile RES-E. The independent national regulatory authorities (NRAs) play a major role in providing regulatory oversight over their national energy sector. A system which becomes more and more interdependent between the Member States both when it comes to market transactions and system operation requires, however, regulatory oversight beyond national borders. ACER is the body established to provide such regulatory oversight as far as situations are concerned which cover more than two Member States. The main role of ACER as a coordinator of the action of national regulators has been preserved; limited additional competences have been assigned to ACER in those areas where fragmented national decision-making on issues with cross-border relevance would lead to problems or inconsistencies for the internal market. For example, the creation of regional operational centres (ROCs) in the [recast Electricity Regulation as proposed by COM(2016) 861/2] calls for supra-national monitoring which needs to be performed by ACER, as the ROCs cover several Member States. Similarly, the introduction of an EU-wide coordinated adequacy assessment in the [recast Electricity Regulation as proposed by COM(2016) 861/2] calls for a regulatory approval of its methodology and calculations that may only be attributed to ACER as the adequacy assessment is to be performed across Member States.\n\n\nWhile the assignment of new tasks to ACER will require a reinforcement of its staff, the coordinating role of ACER will lead to a lower burden for national authorities, thus freeing up administrative resources at national level. The proposed approach will streamline regulatory procedures (e.g. by introducing direct approval within ACER instead of 28 separate approvals). The coordinated development of methodologies (e.g. concerning adequacy assessment) will reduce the workload for national authorities and avoid extra work resulting from potential problems through non-aligned national regulatory action. .\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality\n\n\n\n\nThe policy choices covered by the Electricity Regulation, the Electricity Directive and the Agency Regulation seek to adapt the electricity market design to the increasing share of decentralized generation and to ongoing technological developments. \n\n\nThe proposed reforms are strictly oriented on what is indispensable to achieve the necessary progress for the internal market, while leaving utmost competencies and responsibilities for Member States, national regulators and national actors. \n\n\nOptions considering a more far-reaching harmonisation, e.g. by proposing a single independent European energy regulator, a single integrated European transmission system operator or more straightforward prohibitions of state interventions without exemption possibilities have been consistently dismissed in the Impact Assessment. Instead the proposals aim at well-balanced solutions which only restrict the national scope for regulatory action where coordinated action clearly brings more benefits for the consumer. \n\n\nThe policy options adopted are aimed at creating a level playing field amongst all generation technologies and removing market distortions so that, amongst other things, renewable energy sources may compete on an equal footing in the energy market. In addition, all market participants would bear a financial responsibility for keeping the grid in balance. Barriers to services that provide flexibility to the grid, such as demand-response services, will be removed. Further, the measures seek to create a more liquid short-term market, so that price fluctuations can properly reflect scarcity and offer adequate incentives for a flexible grid.\n\n\nAt retail market level, Member States will also be encouraged to progressively phase-out blanket price regulation, starting with prices below cost. Vulnerable consumers can be protected by a transitional price regulation. To further increase competition, the use of contract termination fees will be restricted, so as to encourage switching. Equally, high-level principles shall ensure that energy bills are clear and easy to understand, and non-discriminatory access to consumer data will be granted, all whilst keeping in place general privacy provisions.\n\n\nIn line with the evolution of cross-border trade in electricity and the gradual integration of the market, the institutional framework will be adapted in line with the need for additional regulatory cooperation and new tasks. ACER is to be given additional tasks, especially in the regional operation of the energy system, all whilst keeping the national regulators' centre role in energy regulation.\n\n\nAll of the options have been extensively checked to meet the requirements of proportionality, in the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal. It should be noted here that the proposed policies present a compromise between bottom-up initiatives and top-down steering of the market. In keeping with proportionality, the measures do not in any way substitute the role of national governments, NRAs and TSOs in carrying out a variety of critical functions. If anything, national regulators are encouraged to come together more effectively in a regional setting, both formally and informally, to address issues arising from the management of the electricity system at a scale that is commensurate with the scale of the problem.  \n\n\nFar from endorsing a \"full harmonisation\" approach, the measures seek to create a level playing field for all market players, particularly where market opportunities extend beyond national borders. Ultimately, a certain standardisation of rules and products is essential to the effective trading of electricity across borders; whilst decisions concerning the operation of the grid would lead to sub-optimal market outcomes if left to single Member States and regulators acting in isolation. Direct experience in the formulation and adoption of common network and trading rules (so called \u201cNetwork Codes\u201d and \"Guidelines\") since the Third Energy Package of 2009 has shown a clear added value in having regulators and national authorities coming around the table to agree common rules and methodologies, both on high level and technical principles.\n\n\nThere is an increasing competitiveness gap between retail and wholesale markets, with the former still lagging behind in terms of service offer and tangible benefits to consumers. By monitoring energy poverty, transparency and clarity of consumer information and access to data, the proposed measures will not unduly limit national prerogatives.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of legal instrument\n\n\nThe proposal will amend the key legal acts that were part of the Third Energy Package. These include the Electricity Regulation (No 714/2009) and the Electricity Directive (No 2009/72/EC), alongside the Regulation establishing ACER (No 713/2009). The choice of a recast of said legal acts will enhance legal clarity. Recourse to an amending act may have been inadequate to address a wide set of new provisions. The choice of the instrument thus calls for a revision of rules already adopted and implemented, as a natural evolution of current legislation. \n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex-post evaluations/fit-for-purpose checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe Commission services have evaluated the performance of the current legislative framework (Third Energy Package) against five set criteria: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and EU added value. A stand-alone evaluation has been carried out alongside the Impact Assessment, and the results of the evaluation have been reflected in the problem identification of the impact assessment.\n\n\nThe evaluation found that, overall, the Third Energy Package's aim to increase competition and remove obstacles to cross-border competition in electricity markets has been met. Active enforcement of the legislation has led to positive results for electricity markets and consumers, and markets are in general less concentrated and more integrated than in 2009. As regards retail markets, the set of new consumer rights introduced by the Third Energy Package have clearly improved the position of the consumer in energy markets. \n\n\nHowever, the success of the rules of the Third Energy Package in developing the internal electricity market remains limited in a number of fields, both at the wholesale and the retail level. In general, the evaluation showed that large gains can still be made by an improvement of the market design framework, as shown by untapped general welfare gains and ultimate benefits to consumers. At the level of wholesale markets, barriers to cross-border trade persist and interconnector capacities are rarely fully exploited. These originate, amongst other things, from insufficient cooperation between national grid operators and regulators on the shared use of interconnectors. The national perspective of the parties involved still prevents effective cross-border solutions in many cases and ultimately limits otherwise beneficial cross-border flows. The picture is not the same across all markets and timeframes, with varying degrees of integration across day-ahead, intra-day and balancing markets.\n\n\nWith regards to retail markets, competition performance could be significantly improved. Electricity prices still vary significantly from Member State to Member State for non-market reasons, and prices have risen steadily for households as a result of significant increases in non-contestable charges in recent years; these being network charges, taxes and levies. With regard to consumer protection, rising energy poverty, as well as lack of clarity on the most appropriate means of tackling consumer vulnerability and energy poverty, have been a drag on the further deepening of the internal energy market. Switching-related fees such as contract termination charges continue to constitute a significant financial barrier to consumer engagement. In addition, the high number of complaints related to billing\n16\n suggests that there is still scope to improve the comparability and clarity of billing information.\n\n\nIn addition to shortcomings in meeting the original objectives sought by the Third Energy Package, a new set of challenges has emerged which had not been envisaged at the time of preparing the Third Energy Package. These include, as mentioned above, the very strong increase of renewable sources in electricity generation, the increase of state interventions in the electricity markets for security of supply purposes, and changes taking place on the technological side. These have all led to significant changes in the way markets operate, especially during the past five years, to a dampening of the positive effect of the reforms for consumers and also an untapped potential from modernisation. This has opened a gap in the existing legislation regarding how to deal with these developments. \n\n\nIn line with the outcome of the evaluation and the related Impact Assessment, the current proposal seeks to close the gap and present an enabling framework to reflect technological developments in the sector as our energy systems' transition to new production and consumption models.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the present initiative, the Commission has conducted several public consultations. These were open to EU citizens and Member States' authorities, energy market participants and their associations, as well as to any other relevant stakeholders, including SMEs and energy consumers.\n\n\nThree consultations and their respective results shall be highlighted in particular:\n\n\n1) Resource adequacy related issues were the subject of a public consultation\n17\n conducted from 15 November 2012 to 7 February 2013, as per the \"Consultation on generation adequacy, capacity mechanisms, and the internal market in electricity\". This was aimed at obtaining stakeholders' views on ensuring resource adequacy and security of electricity supply in the internal market. \n\n\nThe consultation received 148 individual responses from public bodies, industry (both energy producing and consuming) and academia. A detailed chart of responses to the consultation is available online\n18\n, as well as all individual contributions and a summary of results from the consultation\n19\n. \n\n\n2) A public consultation dedicated to electricity retail markets and end-consumers\n20\n was conducted from 22 January 2014 to 17 April 2014. The Commission received 237 responses to the consultation, with about 20% of submissions coming from energy suppliers, 14% from DSOs, 7% from consumer organisations, and 4% from NRAs. A significant number of individual citizens also participated in the consultation. A full summary of responses is available on the Commission's website\n21\n. \n\n\n3) A wide public consultation\n22\n on a new energy market design\u00a0was conducted from 15 July 2015 to 9 October 2015. \n\n\nThe Commission received 320 replies to this consultation. About 50% of submissions have come from national or EU-wide industry associations. 26% of answers originated from companies active in the energy sector (suppliers, intermediaries, consumers) and 9% from network operators. 17\u00a0national governments and several NRAs also fed back on the consultation. A significant number of individual citizens and academic institutes participated to the consultation as well. A detailed description of stakeholders' opinions under each of the specific policy options is available in the Impact Assessment accompanying this legislative initiative. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe preparation of the proposed regulation and the Impact Assessment is based on a large body of material, all of which is referenced in the footnotes in the Impact Assessment. These include close to 30 studies and modelling tools, conducted mostly by independent external parties, aimed at assessing specific options under the current proposal. These are listed in full under Annex V of the Impact Assessment. The studies cover a range of methodologies, with a focus on quantitative estimates of economic and social cost benefit analyses.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission has also been conducting a sector inquiry into national capacity mechanisms whose interim outcomes were promptly fed into the preparatory phase of the current proposal\n23\n. The results from these studies have complemented the extensive feedback obtained by stakeholders as described above and, overall, have given the Commission an extensive evidence basis on which to ground the current proposals.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\nAll proposed measures are supported by the Impact Assessment. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on 7 November 2016. The manner in which the Regulatory Scrutiny Board's views were taken into account is set out in Annex I of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment looked at a number of policy options for each problem set identified. These problem sets and the alternative routes for intervention are listed below:\n\n\nAdapting Market Design to the rise in renewables and technological development:\n\n\nThe Impact Assessment endorsed an enhancement of current market rules in order to create a level-playing field among all generation technologies and resources by removing existing market distortions. It addresses rules that discriminate between resources and which limit or favour the access of certain technologies to the electricity grid. In addition, all market participants would bear financial responsibility for imbalances caused on the grid and all resources would be remunerated in the market on equal terms. Barriers to demand-response would be removed. The chosen option would also strengthen short-term markets by bringing them closer to real-time in order to provide maximum opportunity to meet flexibility needs and by rendering balancing markets more efficient. The chosen option includes measures that would help pulling all flexible distributed resources concerning generation, demand and storage, into the market via proper incentives and a market framework better adapted to them and measures to better incentivise DSOs.\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach was dismissed as providing little scope for improving the market and ensuring a level-playing field among resources. Indeed, the current EU regulatory framework in the relevant areas is limited or even non-existent for other areas. Furthermore, voluntary cooperation was deemed not to provide the appropriate level of harmonisation or certainty to the market. Equally, the option of full harmonisation of market rules was also discarded as the changes might breach proportionality principles and would generally be unnecessary given the state of European energy markets at present.\n\n\nAddressing future generation investments and uncoordinated capacity mechanisms\n\n\nVarious policy options going beyond the baseline scenario were assessed, with each option proposing varying degrees of alignment and coordination among Member States at EU level, and a different extent to which market participants would rely on energy market payments.\n\n\nA so-called 'energy-only market' option would see European markets being sufficiently improved and interconnected that it provides the necessary price signals to spur investments in new resources and in the right places. In such a scenario, no capacity mechanisms would be required any longer. \n\n\nThe chosen option builds on this energy-only market scenario but does not discard the possibility for Member States of using capacity mechanisms, provided however these are based on a shared resource adequacy assessment methodology carried out in full transparency through ENTSO-E and ACER and comply with common design features for better compatibility between national capacity mechanisms and harmonised cross-border cooperation. This option builds on the European Commission Guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020, alongside the Sector Inquiry on capacity mechanisms. \n\n\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach was rejected as existing provisions under EU legislation are not sufficiently clear and robust to cope with the challenges facing the European electricity system. In addition, voluntary cooperation may not provide for appropriate levels of harmonisation across all Member States or certainty to the market. Legislation is needed in this area to address the issues in a consistent way.  The option in which, based on regional or EU-wide generation adequacy assessments, entire regions or ultimately all EU Member States would be required to roll out capacity mechanisms on a mandatory basis was discarded as being disproportionate.\n\n\nUnder-performance of Retail Markets: slow deployment and low levels of services \n\n\nThe endorsed option includes a gradual phasing-out by Member States of blanket price regulation by a deadline set in EU legislation, starting with prices below costs. This option allows for transitional price regulation for vulnerable consumers. To increase consumer engagement, the use of contract termination fees is restricted. Consumer confidence in comparison websites is to be fostered through national authorities implementing a certification tool. In addition, high-level principles will ensure that energy bills are clear and easy to understand, through minimum content requirements. Member States are also required to monitor the number of households on energy poverty. Finally, to allow the development of new services by new entrants and energy service companies, non-discriminatory access to consumer data is ensured.  \n\n\nOther options considered, but discarded, included a full harmonization of consumer legislation alongside extensive consumer safeguards; exemptions to price regulation defined at EU level on the basis of either a consumption threshold or a price threshold; a standard data handling model to be enforced and the responsibility assigned to a neutral market actor such as a TSO; all switching fees including contract termination fees would be banned and the content of energy bills partially harmonized; and finally, an EU framework to monitor energy poverty based on an energy efficiency survey done by Member States of the housing stock as well as preventive measures to avoid disconnections are put in place. These options were all discarded on grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality principles. Maintaining the status quo was not considered a viable option either by almost all of the stakeholders consulted. \n\n\nImprovement of the institutional framework and role of the Agency\n\n\nThe Third Package institutional framework aims at fostering the cooperation of NRAs as well as between TSOs. Since their establishment, ACER and the ENTSOs have played a key role in the progress towards a functioning internal energy market. However, the recent developments in the European energy markets that are considered in the current Impact Assessment and the subsequent proposals of the Market Design Initiative require an adaptation of the institutional framwork. In addition, the implementation of the Third Package has also highlighted areas with room for improvement concerning the framework applicable to ACER and the ENTSOs. In terms of options considered for reforming the institutional framework, a business as usual scenario was discarded for it would open up regulatory and market surveillance gaps, in line with evolving market provisions introduced elsewhere in this proposal as well as with the ongoing progress at EU level of secondary legislation.\n\n\nA non-regulatory approach of \"stronger enforcement\" and voluntary collaboration without any new, additional measures to adapt the institutional framework was considered.  Improved enforcement of existing legislation entails the continued implementation of the Third Package and full implementation of network codes and guidelines \u2013 as described under option \"business as usual\" \u2013 combined with stronger enforcement. However, stronger enforcement alone would not provide any improvement to the current institutional framework.\n\n\nA legislative option transforming ACER to something closer to a pan-European regulator was also considered but ultimately discarded. In order for the Agency to perform such a role, it would require a significant reinforcement of ACER's budget and staff as this would make a strong concentration of experts in the Agency necessary. It appears also appropriate to maintain the involvement of national regulators in the Agency's decision-making process and not to substitute systematically majority decisions by national regulators through decisions by the director. \n\n\nLegislative options to improve ACER on the basis of the existing framework were thus considered. The option endorsed by the Impact Assessment enables the adaptation of the EU institutional framework to the new realities of the electricity system. It also addresses the resulting need for additional regional cooperation and the existing and anticipated regulatory gaps in the energy market, thereby providing for flexibility by a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches.\n\n\nIn addition, in order to address the existing regulatory gap as regards NRAs' regulatory functions at regional level, the policy initiatives under this option would set out a flexible regional regulatory framework to enhance the regional coordination and decision-making of NRAs. This option would introduce a system of coordinated regional decisions and oversight of certain topics by NRAs of the region (e.g. ROCs and others deriving from the proposed market design initiatives) and would give ACER a role for safeguarding the EU-interest.\n\n\nFundamental rights \n\n\nThe present proposal may have an impact on a number of fundamental rights established by the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the EU, in particular: the respect for private and family life (Article 7), the right to protection of personal data (Article 8), the prohibition of discrimination (Article 21), the right to social assistance (Article 34), access to services of general economic interest (Article 36), the integration of a high level of environmental protection (Article 37) and the right to an effective remedy (Article 47).\n\n\nThis is addressed in particular through a number of provisions concerning consumer protection, energy poverty, protection of vulnerable customers, access to services of general economic interest, data protection and privacy. \n\n\nA summary of the Impact Assessment can be found on the Commission website\n24\n, alongside the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe proposal may increase administrative requirements, albeit to a limited extent. For example, by bringing in a level-playing field for all technologies to participate fully in energy markets, these technologies would have to abide with a number of market compliance requirements that may generate some administrative workload. \n\n\nThe measures envisaged to improve the liquidity and integration of energy markets may also generate some short-term impact to businesses as these would have to adapt for new energy trading arrangements. These are however considered minimal compared to the baseline scenario of no action, as the economic gains of the reform would very largely surpass any short or long-term administrative reorganization.\n\n\nEqually, the gradual phasing out of regulated prices at Member State level will require NRAs to step up efforts in monitoring markets, ensuring efficient competition and guaranteeing consumer protection. These impacts may be offset by increased consumer engagement, which would naturally act to foster competition in the market.\n\n\nThe range of activities to be performed under the updated institutional setting shall also generate a new set of requirements for engagement at administrative level on the part of national regulators and transmission operators. These include participation within ACER and through the decision-making processes leading to the agreement of methodologies and practices for the smooth trading of energy at the border. \n\n\nA detailed administrative and economic impact on business and public authorities for each of the policy options considered can be found in chapter 6 of the Impact Assessment. \n\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe budgetary impact associated to the proposal under this package concerns the resources of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) which are described in the Legislative Financial Statement accompanying the  Commission proposal for a recast of the Regulation establishing ACER. Essentially, the new tasks to be carried out by ACER, notably as regards the assessment of system adequacy and  the establishment of Regional Operation Centres, require a phasing in of up to 18 additional FTE in the Agency in 2020, as well as corresponding financial resources. \n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe Commission will monitor the transposition and compliance of the Member States and other actors with the measures that shall be ultimately adopted, and shall take enforcement measures if and when required. In addition, as it has already done in the context of the implementation of the Third Energy Package, the Commission will provide guidance documents providing assistance on the implementation of the adopted measures. \n\n\nAcross monitoring and implementation purposes, the Commission will notably be supported by ACER. The annual reporting by the Agency and parallel evaluations carried out by the Commission, together with the reporting from the Electricity Coordination Group are all part of the provisions in the current initiative. The Agency will be invited to further review its monitoring indicators to ensure their continuing relevance for monitoring progress towards the objectives underlying the present proposals, so that these may be adequately reflected, amongst other things, through ACER's annual market monitoring report document.\n\n\nParallel to the proposed initiatives, the Commission will bring forward an initiative concerning the governance of the Energy Union that will streamline the planning, reporting and monitoring requirements. Based on the initiative of the governance of the Energy Union, the current monitoring and reporting requirements of the Commission and Member States in the Third Energy Package will be integrated in horizontal progress and monitoring reports. More information on the streamlining of the monitoring and reporting requirements can be found in the impact assessment for the governance of the European Union.\n\n\nA more extensive treatment of monitoring mechanisms and benchmark indicators can be found in Chapter 8 of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explanation of the specific provisions of the proposals\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on\u00a0common rules for the internal market in electricity (Recast)\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Directive provides some clarifications to the scope and subject matter of the Directive, emphasising the focus on consumers and the importance of the internal market and its main principles. It provides also for an update of the main definitions used in the Directive. \n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Directive lays down the general principle that Member States have to ensure that the EU electricity market is competitive, consumer-centred, flexible and non-discriminatory. It emphasises that national measures should not unduly hamper cross-border flows, consumer participation or investments. It further enshrines the principle that supply prices shall be market-based, subject to duly justified exceptions. The chapter also clarifies certain principles relating to the functioning of the EU electricity markets, such as the right to choose a supplier. It also provides for updated rules on possible public service obligations which may be imposed by Member States on energy undertakings under certain circumstances. \n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Directive reinforces pre-existing consumer rights and introduces new rights that aim at putting consumers at the heart of the energy markets by ensuring that they are empowered and better protected. It sets rules on clearer billing information and on certified comparison tools. It contains provisions ensuring that consumers are able to freely choose and change suppliers or aggregators, are entitled to a dynamic price contract and are able to engage in demand response, self-generation and self-consumption of electricity. It entitles every consumer to request a smart meter equipped with a minimum set of functionalities. It also improves pre-existing rules on the consumers' possibility to share their data with suppliers and service providers by clarifying the role of the parties responsible for data management and by setting a common European data format to be developed by the Commission in an implementing act. It also aims to ensure that energy poverty is addressed by Member States. It further requires Member States to define frameworks for independent aggregators and for demand response along principles that enable their full participation in the market. It defines a framework for local energy communities which may engage in local energy generation, distribution, aggregation, storage, supply or energy efficiency services. It further provides some clarifications to pre-existing provisions on smart meters, single points of contacts, and rights to out-of-court settlement, universal service and vulnerable consumers.  \n\n\nChapter IV of the proposed Directive provides for some clarifications concerning the tasks of DSOs, notably relating to the activities of DSOs concerning the procurement of network services to ensure flexibility, the integration of electrical vehicles and data management. It also clarifies the role of DSOs with respect to storage and recharging points for electric vehicles.\n\n\nChapter V of the proposed Directive summarises the general rules applicable to TSOs, largely based on existing text, providing only some clarifications concerning ancillary services and the new Regional Operational Centres. \n\n\nChapter VI of the proposed Directive, setting out the rules on unbundling as developed in the Third Energy Package, remains unchanged as concerns the main substantive rules on unbundling, notably with respect to the three regimes for TSOs (ownership unbundling, independent system operator and independent transmission operator), as well as with respect to the provisions on TSO designation and certification. It only provides a clarification on the possibility for TSOs to own storage or to provide ancillary services.\n\n\nChapter VII of the proposed Directive contains the rules on establishment, scope of powers and duties as well as rules of functioning of the independent national energy regulators. The proposal notably emphasises the obligation of regulators to cooperate with neighbouring regulators and ACER in case issues of cross-border relevance are concerned and updates the list of tasks of regulators, inter alia with respect to the supervision of the newly created Regional Operational Centres. \n\n\n\nChapter VIII of the proposed Directive changes some general provisions, inter alia on derogations to the Directive, exercise of delegated powers by the Commission and the Committee established under comitology rules pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. \n\n\nThe new Annexes to the proposed Directive set out more requirements on comparison tools, billing and billing information and amends pre-existing requirements for smart meters and their roll-out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on\u00a0the \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0internal electricity market (Recast)\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Regulation sets out the scope and subject matter and the definitions of terms used in it. It emphasises the importance of undistorted market signals to provide for increased flexibility, decarbonisation and innovation and updates and complements the main definitions used in the Regulation.\n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Regulation introduces a new Article which sets out the key principles to be respected by national energy legislation in order to allow for a functioning internal electricity market. It also sets out the main legal principles for electricity trading rules within different trading timeframes (balancing, intraday, day-ahead and forward markets), including principles for price formation. It clarifies the principle of balancing responsibility and provides for a framework for more market compatible rules for the dispatch and curtailment of generation and demand response, including conditions for any exceptions thereof.   \n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Regulation describes the process to define bidding zones in a coordinated manner, in line with the review process created in Regulation 1222/2015 establishing a Guideline on Capacity Calculation and Congestion Management\n25\n. In order to address the persisting problem of significant national limitations to cross-border electricity flows, the conditions for such exceptional limitations are clarified, notably by rules that shall ensure that electricity imports and exports are not restricted by national actors for economic reasons. This Chapter further contains amendments to pre-existing principles for transmission and distribution network tariffs and sets a procedure for fostering the progressive convergence of transmission and distribution tariff methodologies. It also sets out amended rules for the usage of congestion rents.\n\n\nChapter IV of the proposed Regulation sets out new general principles for addressing resource adequacy concerns by Member States in a coordinated manner. It sets out principles and a procedure for the development of a European resource adequacy assessment to better determine the need for capacity mechanisms and, if appropriate, the setting of a reliability standard by Member States. It clarifies how and under which conditions capacity mechanisms can be introduced in a market-compatible manner. It also clarifies market compatible design principles for capacity mechanisms, including rules for the participation of capacity located in another Member State and for interconnection usage. It sets out how Regional Operational Centres, national TSOs, the ENTSO for electricity and national regulators via ACER will be involved in the development of technical parameters for the participation of capacities located in another Member State as well as the operational rules for their participation. \n\n\nChapter V of the proposed Regulation sets out the tasks and duties of the ENTSO for Electricity and the monitoring tasks of ACER in this regard whilst clarifying its duty to act independently and for the European good. It defines the mission of Regional Operational Centres and provides for criteria and a procedure for defining system operation regions covered by each Regional Operational Centre and the coordination functions that these centres perform. It also sets out working and organisational arrangements, consultation requirements, requirements and procedures for the adoption of decisions and recommendations and their revision, the composition and responsibilities of the management board and liability arrangements of Regional Operational Centres. The chapter also incorporates rules on the connection if cogeneration units, previously included in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency. The rules on a ten-year network development plan, inter-transmission system operator compensation, information exchange and certification remain largely unchanged. \n\n\nChapter VI of the proposed Regulation sets up a European entity for DSOs, defines a procedure for its establishment and its tasks including with regard to the consultation of stakeholders. It also provides detailed rules on the cooperation between DSOs and TSOs with regard to the planning and operation of their networks.\n\n\nChapter VII of the proposed Regulation sets out pre-existing powers and rules for the Commission to adopt delegated acts in the form of network codes or guidelines. It provides for clarifications as to the legal nature and the adoption of network codes and guidelines and enlarges their possible content to areas such as distribution tariff structures; rules for the provision of non-frequency ancillary services; demand response, energy storage and demand curtailment rules; cyber security rules; rules regarding to Regional Operational Centres; and, the curtailment of generation and redispatch of generation and demand. It simplifies and streamlines the procedure for the elaboration of electricity network codes and gives national regulators the possibility to decide within ACER on issues concerning the implementation of network codes and guidelines. It also includes the European entity for DSOs and other stakeholders more closely in the procedure of the development of proposals for electricity network codes. \n\n\nChapter VIII of the proposed Regulation sets out the final provisions of the proposed Regulation. It includes the pre-existing rules for the exemption of new direct current interconnectors from certain requirement of the Electricity Directive and Regulation whilst clarifying the procedure for subsequent amendments made by NRAs thereof. \n\n\nThe Annex to the proposed Regulation defines in more detail the functions attributed to the Regional Operational Centers created by the Regulation.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (recast)\n\n\nIn general, the rules concerning ACER are proposed to be adapted to the \"Common Approach\" on EU decentralised agencies agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission (Common Approach)\n26\n. Keeping limited deviations from the \"Common Approach\" is, however, warranted for ACER at the present stage.\n\n\nChapter I of the proposed Regulation describes the role, objectives and tasks of ACER and the type of acts that it can adopt, and provides for rules on consultations and monitoring. The list of tasks has been updated to include ACER's duties in the field of wholesale market supervision and cross-border infrastructure which were attributed to ACER subsequent to the adoption of the Regulation. \n\n\nWith respect to the adoption of electricity network codes, ACER is given more responsibility in elaborating and submitting the final proposal for a network code to the Commission, while maintaining ENTSO-E's role as a technical expert. The proposal also includes a formal place for DSOs to be represented at EU level, notably in the development of network code proposals, in line with an increase in their responsibilities. The Agency is given the competence to decide on terms, methodologies and algorithms for the implementation of electricity network codes and guidelines. \n\n\nFor tasks in a regional context concerning only a limited number of national regulators, a regional decision-making process is introduced. Accordingly, the Director would have to give his opinion on whether the issue in question is primarily of regional relevance. If the Board of Regulators agrees that this is the case a regional sub-committee of the Board of Regulators should prepare the decision in question which would finally be taken or rejected by the Board of Regulators itself. Otherwise the Board of Regulators would decide without the intervention of a regional sub-committee.\n\n\nThe Chapter also defines a number of new tasks for ACER concerning the coordination of certain functions related to the Regional Operational Centres within the Agency, concerning the supervision of Nominated Electricity Market Operators and related to the approval of methods and proposal related to generation adequacy and risk preparedness. \n\n\nChapter II of the proposed Regulation contains organisational rules relating to the Administrative Board, the Board of Regulators, the Director, the Board of Appeal and, as a new provision, on the Agency's working groups. While adapting several individual provisions to the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies or to the new Council voting rules, the main features of the existing governance structure, in particular the Board of Regulators, are preserved.\n\n\nThis deviation of ACER, from the Common Approach is justified as follows:\n\n\nThe main objectives of European Electricity Policy, security of supply, affordability of electricity and decarbonisation could be reached most cost effectively by an integrated European electricity market. Accordingly, the electricity transmission infrastructure is progressively interconnected, increasing volumes of electricity are traded cross border, generation capacities are shared at a European scale and the transmission system is operated taking regional, cross-border aspects into account. The present legislative packages further enhance these trends which are expected to result in efficiencies to the benefit of European customers.\n\n\n\n\nA precondition for the creation of an internal electricity market is the opening of the sector to competition. As in other sectors of economy as well, the opening of the electricity market required new regulations, in particular with regard to the transmission and distribution system, and regulatory oversight. To this effect, independent regulatory authorities were put in place. These entities remain with a particular responsibility when it comes to overseeing national and European rules applicable to the electricity sector.\n\n\nHowever, with the increasing cross-border trade and system operation which takes the regional and European context into account, NRAs were required to increasingly coordinate their action with NRAs from other Member States. ACER was designed to become the platform for this interaction and fulfils this duty since its creation in 2011. The body within the Agency where most opinions, recommendations and decisions of the Agency are prepared, together with ACER staff, is thus the Board of Regulators comprising senior representatives of the NRAs and a non-voting representative of the Commission. The first years of the existence of the Agency have shown that the Board of Regulators managed to contribute effectively to the fulfilment of the tasks of the Agency.\n\n\nSince energy markets are still largely regulated at national level, national regulators are actors with a key role for energy markets. The main role of ACER is not the execution of delegated regulatory Commission competencies, but the coordination of the regulatory decisions of independent national regulators. The present legislative proposal still largely preserves this distribution of roles. The current structure strikes a fine-tuned balance of powers between the different actors, having regard to the special features of the developing internal energy market. Changing the balance at this stage might risk jeopardising the implementation of the policy initiatives in the legislative proposals and thereby would pose obstacles to the further integration of the energy market which is the main purpose of the present proposal. It therefore appears as premature to transfer decision-making powers to a Management Board as provided for in the Common Approach. Instead it seems rather appropriate to keep the current structure which ensures that the national regulators act without any direct intervention of EU institutions or Member States in the specific matters. At the same time, the overall work of the regulators remains subject to the approval of the EU institutions via programming, budgetary and strategic documents. EU institutions are also involved in administrative matters. As a consequence, it is not proposed to change the set-up and operation of the existing Board of Regulators.\n\n\nLikewise, it is not proposed to adapt the concept of the Administrative Board to the model of the Common Approach Management Board. The Agency's Administrative Board in its existing composition proved to be particularly effective and efficient over the last years. Its operation is assured by representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\n\n\nEven though at this stage, the Commission does not find it appropriate to adapt the governance structure of the Agency fully to the Common Approach, it will continue to monitor if the described deviations from the Common Approach are still justified, with the next evaluation scheduled for 2021 which in addition to an assessment of the Agency's objectives, mandate and tasks will have a particular focus on the governance structure of the Agency.\n\n\nChapter III of the proposed Regulation contains financial provisions.

Improving the regulatory framework at Community level was identified as a key measure to achieve that objective.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 2  (adapted) \n\n\nAn independent advisory group on electricity and gas, called the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) was established by Commission Decision 2003/796/EC\n28\n to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in Member States, and between those bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal markets in electricity and natural gas. That group is composed of representatives of the national regulatory authorities established pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity\n29\n and Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas\n30\n.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 3 (adapted) \n\n\nThe work undertaken by the ACER ERGEG since its establishment has made a positive contribution to the internal markets in electricity and natural gas. However, it is widely recognised by the sector, and has been proposed by the ERGEG itself, that voluntary cooperation between national regulatory authorities should now take place within a Community structure with clear competences and with the power to adopt individual regulatory decisions in a number of specific cases. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 4  (adapted)\n\n\nThe European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007 invited the Commission to propose measures to set up an independent mechanism for national regulators to cooperate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(2)The creation of the Agency has manifestly improved coordination between regulators on cross-border issues. Since its creation, the Agency has received new important tasks concerning the monitoring of wholesale markets under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n31\n and in the field of cross-border energy infrastructure under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and Council\n32\n. \n\n\n(3)It is projected that the need for coordination of national regulatory actions will increase further in the coming years. Europe's energy system is in the middle of its most profound change in decades. More market integration and the change towards more variable electricity production requires increased efforts to coordinate national energy policies with neighbours and to use the opportunities of cross-border electricity trade. \n\n\n(4)Experience with the implementation of internal market rules has shown that uncoordinated national action can lead to severe problems for the market, notably in closely interconnected areas where decisions of Member States often have a tangible impact on their neighbours. To achieve the positive effects of the internal electricity market for consumer welfare, security of supply and decarbonisation Member States, and in particular independent national regulators, are required to cooperate on those regulatory measures which have a cross-border effect. \n\n\n(5)Fragmented national state interventions in energy markets constitute an increasing risk to the proper functioning of cross-border electricity markets. The Agency should therefore be given a role in the development of a coordinated European Adequacy Assessment, in close cooperation with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (\"ENTSO for Electricity\"), in order to avoid the problems of fragmented national assessments which follow different uncoordinated methods and do not sufficiently take into account the situation in neighbouring countries. The Agency should also supervise the technical parameters developed by the ENTSO for Electricity for an efficient participation of cross-border capacities and other technical features of capacity mechanisms. \n\n\n(6)Security of electricity supply requires a coordinated approach to prepare against unexpected supply crises. The Agency should therefore coordinate national actions related to risk preparedness, in line with [Risk Preparedness Regulation as proposed by COM(2016) 862].\n\n\n(7)Due to the close interconnection of the Union electricity grid and the increasing need to cooperate with neighbouring countries to maintain grid stability and integrate large volumes of renewable energies, regional  operational centres will play an important role for the coordination of transmission system operators. The Agency should guarantee regulatory oversight over the regional operational centres where necessary.\n\n\n(8)As large parts of new electricity generation will be connected at local level, distribution system operators will play an important role when it comes to operating the European electricity system in a flexible and efficient manner.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 5 (adapted)\n\n\n(9)\u0422he Member States should cooperate closely, eliminating obstacles to cross-border exchanges of electricity and natural gas with a view to achieving the objectives of Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0the Union\u00a0\u00d5 energy policy. On the basis of the impact assessment of the resource requirements for a central entity, it was concluded that an independent central entity offered a number of long-term advantages over other options. An\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0European Union\u00a0\u00d5 Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the Agency) should be \u00d6\u00a0was\u00a0\u00d5 established \u00d6\u00a0by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009\u00a0\u00d5 in order to fill the regulatory gap at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level and to contribute towards the effective functioning of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas. The Agency should also enable\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0enables\u00a0\u00d5 national regulatory authorities to enhance their cooperation at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level and participate, on a mutual basis, in the exercise of Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 -related functions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n(10)The Agency should ensure that regulatory functions performed by the national regulatory authorities in accordance with [the recast Electricity Directive as proposed by COM(2016) 864/2] 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity\n33\n and Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas\n34\n are properly coordinated and, where necessary, completed at the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level. To that end, it is necessary to guarantee the independence of the Agency from electricity and gas producers, transmission and distribution system operators, whether public or private, and consumers and to ensure the conformity of its actions with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law, its technical and regulatory capacities and its transparency, amenability to democratic control and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 7\n\n\n\u00f0new\n\n\n(11)The Agency should monitor regional cooperation between transmission system operators in the electricity and gas sectors as well as the execution of the tasks of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO for Electricity), and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO for Gas). \u00f0\u00a0The Agency should also monitor the implementation of the tasks of other entities with regulated functions of Union-wide dimension, such as energy exchanges.\u00a0\u00ef The involvement of the Agency is essential in order to ensure that the cooperation between transmission system operators \u00f0 and the operation of other entities with Union-wide functions \u00ef proceeds in an efficient and transparent way for the benefit of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 8\n\n\n\n\n(12)The Agency should monitor, in cooperation with the Commission, the Member States and relevant national authorities, the internal markets in electricity and natural gas and inform the European Parliament, the Commission and national authorities of its findings where appropriate. Those monitoring tasks of the Agency should not duplicate or hamper monitoring by the Commission or national authorities, in particular national competition authorities.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 10 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0new\n\n\n(13)It is appropriate to\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0The Agency\u00a0\u00d5 provides an integrated framework within which \u00d6\u00a0enables\u00a0\u00d5 national regulatory authorities are able to participate and cooperate. That framework should facilitates the uniform application of the legislation on the internal markets in electricity and natural gas throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5. As regards situations concerning more than one Member State, the Agency should be\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0has been\u00a0\u00d5 granted the power to adopt individual decisions.

It is also considered appropriate for the Agency, and consistent with its purpose, to have a role in reviewing \u00f0\u00a0draft\u00a0\u00ef network codes (both when created and upon modification) to ensure that they are in line with the framework guidelines \u00f0\u00a0and provide for the necessary degree of harmonisation\u00a0\u00ef, before it may\u00a0recommend\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0submits\u00a0\u00d5 them to the Commission for adoption. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(15)With the adoption of a set of network codes and guidelines which provide for a stepwise implementation and a further refinement of common regional and Union-wide rules, the role of the Agency in monitoring the implementation of the network codes and guidelines has increased. Effective monitoring of network codes and guidelines is a key function of the Agency and crucial for the implementation of internal market rules. \n\n\n(16)From experience with the implementation of network codes and guidelines it has emerged that it is useful to streamline the procedure for the regulatory approval of regional or Union-wide terms and conditions or methodologies to be developed under the guidelines and network codes by submitting them directly to the Agency in order for national regulators, represented in the Board of Regulators, to be able to decide upon them.\n\n\n(17)Since the stepwise harmonisation of the Union energy markets involves finding regional solutions regularly as an interim step, it is appropriate to reflect the regional dimension of the internal market and to provide for appropriate governance mechanisms. Regulators responsible for coordinated regional approvals should be able to prepare Board of Regulators decisions on issues of regional relevance in a regional subcommittee of the Board of Regulators, unless those issues are of general importance for the Union. \n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 11 (adapted)\n\n\n(18)Since the Agency has an overview of the national regulatory authorities, it should have an advisory role towards the Commission, other Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 institutions and national regulatory authorities as regards the issues relating to the purpose for which it was established. It should also be required to inform the Commission where it finds that the cooperation between transmission system operators does not produce the results which are needed or that a national regulatory authority whose decision is not in compliance with the Guidelines does not implement the opinion, recommendation or decision of the Agency appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 12 \n\n\n(19)The Agency should also be able to make recommendations to assist regulatory authorities and market players in sharing good practices.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 13 \n\n\n(20)The Agency should consult interested parties, where appropriate, and provide them with a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed measures, such as network codes and rules.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 14 (adapted)\n\n\n(21)The Agency should contribute to the implementation of the guidelines on trans-European energy networks as laid down in Regulation (EU) No\u00a0347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0\n35\n\u00a0Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks\n36\n, in particular when providing its opinion on the non-binding \u00d6\u00a0 Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Community-wide ten-year network development plans ( \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Community-wide network development plans) in accordance with Article 4\u00a06(3) of this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 15\n\n\n(22)The Agency should contribute to the efforts of enhancing energy security.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 16\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(23)\u00f0\u00a0In order to ensure that the Agency's framework is efficient and coherent with other decentralised agencies, the rules governing the Agency should be aligned to the Common Approach agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission on decentralised agencies\n37\n. However, insofar as necessary,\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0Tthe structure of the Agency should be adapted to meet the specific needs of energy regulation. In particular, the specific role of the national regulatory authorities needs to be taken fully into account and their independence guaranteed. \n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n\n\n(24)Additional changes to the present regulation may be envisaged in the future in order to bring the regulation fully in line with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies. Based on the current needs of energy regulation, deviations from the Common Approach are necessary. This proposal therefore does not prejudge any further amendments to the Founding Regulation of the Agency which the Commission may wish to propose following further evaluation, as provided for in this act or on its own initiative. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 17\n\n\n(25)The Administrative Board should have the necessary powers to establish the budget, check its implementation, draw up internal rules, adopt financial regulations and appoint a Director. A rotation system should be used for the renewal of the members of the Administrative Board who are appointed by the Council so as to ensure a balanced participation of Member States over time. The Administrative Board should act independently and objectively in the public interest and should not seek or follow political instructions.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(26)The Agency should have the necessary powers to perform its regulatory functions in an efficient, transparent, reasoned and, above all, independent manner. The independence of the Agency from electricity and gas producers and transmission and distribution system operators is not only a key principle of good governance but also a fundamental condition to ensure market confidence. Without prejudice to its members\u2019 acting on behalf of their respective national authorities, the Board of Regulators should therefore act independently from any market interest, should avoid conflicts of interests and should not seek or follow instructions or accept recommendations from a government of a Member State, from \u00f0\u00a0Union institutions\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0the Commission or another public or private entity \u00f0\u00a0or person\u00a0\u00ef . The decisions of the Board of Regulators should, at the same time, comply with Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 law concerning energy, such as the internal energy market, the environment and competition. The Board of Regulators should report its opinions, recommendations and decisions to the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a0713/2009 recital 19 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0new\n\n\n(27)Where the Agency has decision-making powers, interested parties should, for reasons of procedural economy, be granted a right of appeal to a Board of Appeal, which should be part of the Agency, but independent from its administrative and regulatory structure. \u00f0\u00a0In order to guarantee its functioning and full independence, the Board of Appeal should have a separate budget line in the budget of the Agency.\u00a0\u00ef In the interest of continuity, the appointment or renewal of the members of the Board of Appeal should allow for partial replacement of the members of the Board of Appeal. The decisions of the Board of Appeal \u00d6\u00a0can\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0may be subject to appeal before the Court of Justice of the European \u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0Communities. \n\n\n(28)\u00f0\u00a0The Agency should exercise its decision-making powers in line with the principles of fair, transparent and reasonable decision-making.

In particular, the resources currently pooled by regulatory authorities for their cooperation at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level should continue to be available to the Agency. The Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0 Union\u00a0\u00d5 budgetary procedure should remain applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned.

Under the framework of the Strategic Plan, the current proposal addresses \"general objective A: A New Boost for Jobs, Growth and Investment\". \n\n\nBy reforming the institutional framework underpinning the working of European energy markets, we are providing markets with appropriate governance mechanisms, as these are required to deliver sustainable and competitive energy for all.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an ever-more interconnected energy market to function effectively, it needs adequate decisional fora for national regulators to come together. The integration of Europe's energy market goes hand in hand with ACER fulfilling such a role and being given the resources to meet the tasks it is assigned to.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\nThe initiative falls under Budget heading 32 02 10: Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)\n\n\nSpecific objective No\n\n\nIn addition to the activities already performed by the Agency at present, the current initiative seeks to expand upon ACER's tasks to meet a number of additional objectives whose importance for the ultimate welfare of European energy markets cannot be underestimated. \n\n\nThis review of the Agency's tasks is thus far from being marginal, as ACER will be required to fulfill tasks of a new nature and of a large scope. These include, notably, new tasks in relation to the assessment of system security for the purposes of evaluating the introduction of capacity remuneration mechanisms, as well as the establishment and monitoring of Regional Operation Centres. These are a departure from business as usual for the Agency and justify the demand for additional posts as listed in this fiche.\n\n\nTo the extent that such new objectives have a bearing on the financial resources allocated to the Agency, they are being listed in full below. The below also includes reference to the Regulation from which the tasks originate (Electricity Regulation or Risk Preparedness Regulation) and where the tasks are either reflected or solely attributed in the ACER Regulation proposal.\n\n\n1) Approving and amending methodologies linked to the newly introduced European generation adequacy assessment, as well as carrying an assessment of proposals for the introduction of new such mechanisms at national level. This tasks lies at the core of the strenghtened approach to capacity mechanisms at European level, and is mandated by the Electricity Regulation, and reflected in Art. 9 of the ACER Regulation. We estimate a total of 7 FTE (Full Time Equivalents) needed for the task at full regime.\n\n\n2) Surveilling market performance and in particular \"flexibility barriers\" at Member State level, including price interventions. In addition, ACER is to create a methodology for market performance against security of supply indicators. Market surveillance and development of the methodology is key to achieve market integration and competitiveness in these areas. The Electricity Regulation and ACER Regulation Art 11 spell this out, and would require 0.5 FTE. \n\n\n3)  Deciding upon the configuration of new Regional Operation Centres (ROCs) and carrying a regular monitoring and analysis of their performance. This includes the issuing of opinions and recommendations on a regular basis as needs arise. The establishment of ROCs is a pillar of the regionalisation approach, and would require an estimated 1.5 FTE. Art. 6 of ACER Regulation spells out the task.\n\n\n4) Ensuring the interoperability, communication, and monitoring of regional performance outside areas not harmonised at EU level and not falling under point 3) above. This includes supporting and coordinating National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) cooperating at regional level. These activities require  1 FTE and would be necessary to fully deliver on beneftis from the regionalisation approach, as per Art. 7 of ACER Regulation.\n\n\n5) Improving  wholesale market efficiencies by, amongst other things: approving and amending methodologies with relevance for cross border electricity trade and other regulatory issues with cross-border relevance; establishing and implementing rules for the use of congestion income with the purpose of network investments; establishing rules for the reallocation of said income and possible disputed between actors; intra-day market monitoring to remove distortions and create more liquid trading. Overall, we foresee 3 FTE dedicated to the new tasks, as per Art 9 and 17 of the Electricity Regulation and Art. 7 of ACER Regulation. \n\n\n6) Deciding upon NRAs disputes through a reinforced Board of Appeal as more cases are brought to the board following the parallel extension in scope of ACER's decisions and in light of a reinforced regional framework. These tasks would call for 1 FTE following Art. 19 of the ACER Regulation.\n\n\n7) Establishing an EU entity of Distribution System Operators (EU DSO), ensuring its smooth functioning and cooperation between EU DSO and Transmission System Operators (TSOs). Similarly to the establishment of Regional Operation Centres (ROCs), the establishment of an EU DSO is vital in adressing challenges resulting from a more distributed energy system. 2 FTE would be needed as per Art. 50 of the Electricity Regulation.\n\n\n8) Approving and amending methodologies for the identification of electricity crisis scenarios at regional level, with regular analysis and amendements of the methodology. These tasks are crucial to implementing the European risk preparedness approach as set out in the Risk Preparedness Regulation, and would call for 2 FTE.\n\n\nIt is noted for the reader's attention, that the list of tasks above-mentioned are linked to the more general estimates for new tasks and related staff needs as these can be found in the Impact Assessment \u2013 specifically under the annex on the reform of the institutional framework (chapter 3.4 of said Impact Assessment's annex document). \n\n\nThe original estimation provided for a rough bottom ceiling of around 18 extra staff under the proposed policy option, which is in line with the 18 full time equivalents specified by this fiche. The assessment of the present fiche should be considered however superior both in the level of detail of tasks specified, and in the accuracy of the estimates, as these have been carried out on the back of the concrete legislative acts proposed, something lacking at the time of the Impact Assessment exercise for obvious reasons.\n\n\nIt is also noted, as explained more fully in the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum to the Legislative Acts above-cited, that the additional tasks carried by ACER will abide to a subsidiarity principle, also to the extent to which they will act to free up resources at national levels for similar tasks.\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nThe sum effect of the proposal is to overall increase the functioning of wholesale and retail energy markets.\n\n\nAccordingly, the net contribution of ACER's role across the new tasks, if executed effectively, will result in very large effects by way of market efficiencies and overall economic and social welfare gains. The Impact Assessment accompanying the set of proposals under the Market Design Initiative, estimate that the establishment of ROCs and the optimization of network functions to a regional level could lead to an additional EUR 1bn yearly approximately, whilst ensuring cross-border participation to capacity mechanisms will bring savings of EUR 2bn by 2030. \n\n\nThe supervision of the European adequacy assessement will lead to a more efficiant regional coordination of capacity mechanism intended to ensure security of electricity supply, and thereby save costs for energy consumers. At present such mechanisms are financed for the most part through national levies and taxes, with consumers having to shoulder  large, unnecessary costs from uncoordinated measures aimed at ensuring security of supply.\n\n\nThe methodologies for electricity trading and grid operation to be developed by ACER shall also increase the rate of energy market coupling, improving the use of capacity at the border, reducing congestions and reducing price distortions.\n\n\nThe beneficiaries of the initiative include market participants across the chain, as well as market operators and consumers. With more effective methodologies in place, market competition across the wholesale and retail markets shall also receive a boost.\n\n\nMarket monitoring activities and the spurring of cooperation across regulatory issues shall in fact ultimately enable prices to better reflect underlying market realities and allow declining wholesale energy prices to be better reflected at retail market level.\n\n\nThe setting up of regional-level operational entities shall also decrease the need for recourse to national electricity safeguards whose cost is borne by the system as a whole and by consumers in the last instance.\n\n\nIncreased regulatory cooperation shall also gretaly increase security of supply across the EU, with a benefit to system operators and to the system at large.  \n\n\nThe development of methodologies aimed at making the market more flexible shall also adequately benefit market operators offering flexibility services, and new technology providers catering to a more flexible energy grid. \n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nThe Agency's performance is already subject to a Commission-led evaluations taking place at regular time intervals and carried by external bodies to safeguard the neutrality of the assessment.\n\n\nIn addition, the Agency's annual Work Program, which is subject to European Commission scrutiny and opinion, provides for key performance indicators measuring ACER's performance against set targets.\n\n\nIndicators would include timely delivery of agreed methodologies as these are mandated under the Regulation proposed; alongside effective cooperation amongst NRAs and the swift handling of appeals shall these be raised to its Board of Appeal. Other Agency level performance indicators include, under market transparency requirement, that the Agency carries an analysis of a given number of market data points per assessment cycle.\n\n\nCarrying in mind the ultimate objective of integrating energy markets and the role played by ACER in bringing national authorities, transmission and distribution operators together, the effectiveness of ACER's action can be seen in improved market performance.\n\n\nSuch market performance is the object of an extensive Market Monitoring Annual Report by the Agency, including rates of interconnection use, market coupling performance, market mark-ups alongisde a number of other market indicators that are directly related to the Agency's methodologies and activities. \n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nAllow ACER to engage in new activities as these are set by the Regulation and in line with evolving energy market developments; contirbuting to a competitive, sustainable and secure Energy Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nThe need for EU action is based on the evidence that isolated national approaches can lead to sub-optimal measures, unnecessary duplication, market inefficiencies and \"beggar-thy-neighbour\" policies. In sum, the creation of an internal energy market that delivers competitive and sustainable energy for all, would be impossible without clear, shared rules on the trading of energy, the operation of the grid and a certain amount of product standardization. ACER provides a forum for national regulators to come together and agree on shared principles and methodologies. \n\n\nThe increasing interconnection of the EU electricity markets is opening up opportunities as well as challenges. In the lack of coordinated measures on issues that have direct consequences on cross-border electricity markets, the creation of an internal energy market would remain a utopia. National policy interventions in the electricity sector have direct impact on neighbouring Member States due to energy interdependence and grid interconnections. Ensuring the stability of the grid and its efficient operation is increasingly difficult to do at national level alone, as rising cross-border trade, the uptake of decentralised generation and enhanced consumer participation, all increase the potential for spill-over effects. No state can effectively act alone and the externalities of unilateral action have become heavier over time.\n\n\nWhile Member States already collaborate on a voluntarily basis to a certain extent to address some of the above mentioned challenges, for example through regional initiatives such as the Pentalateral Energy Forum, these fora work as political coordination bodies and cannot take binding decisions on the detailed issues on which a decision is needed in order to avoid the current fragmentation of system operation, regulatory oversight and state interventions in electricity markets. \n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nA Commission Evaluation of the Agency's activities was published on 22.1.2014 [C(2014)242 final]. The evaluation found that since its establishment, ACER has become a credible and respected institution playing a prominent role in the energy regulatory arena. Overall, ACER has been focusing on the right priorities as these have been set by its founding Regulation and by annual programming document. It is however noted that the Agency has lamented a lack in resources to meet its tasks and a degree of redeployment has been necessary to achieve statutory objectives. In this light, it is particularly important that new tasks assigned to the Agency under the current proposal are matched by budgetary and staff levels that are adequate and proportionate to the aim of creating a true Energy Union.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nThe proposal is in line with the Juncker Commission's Political Guidelines as these made the achievement of a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy one of its strategic objectives.\n\n\nThis ambition was confirmed in the Commission Work Programme for 2015 and further detailed in the Commission Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union [COM(2015)80 final of 25.02.2015]. Further impetus for the creation of a sustainable and competitive European Energy Union has been given by ratification of the agreement reached at the United Nations 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris (COP21).\n\n\nIn addition, EU Climate and Energy goals to 2020 and 2030 foresee the integration of higher shares of renewable electricity generation resulting in an increased need for managing a flexible greed and ensuring a cost-effective, clean energy transition. To reach such objectives, stronger regulatory cooperation within ACER will be a pre-requisite.   \n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2018 to 2019,\n\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation\n\n\n1.7.Management mode(s) planned\n62\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Direct management by the Commission through\n\n\n\u2013\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0executive agencies \n\n\n\n\n\u25fb\u00a0Shared management with the Member States \n\n\n\u2612\u00a0Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\n\u25fb international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\n\n\u25fbthe EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\n\n\u2612 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209;\n\n\n\u25fb public law bodies;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n\u25fb persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title\u00a0V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\nComments \n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules \n\n\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\n\n\n\nAll EU Agencies work under a strict monitoring system involving internal audit capability, the Internal Audit Service of the Commission, ACER's Administrative Board, the Court of Auditors and the Budgetary Authority.

These provisions were part of ACER's funding Regulation Article 26 and will continue to apply. \n\n\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual
