Products in the Annex of the Agreement are classified according to their respective tariff headings for customs purposes under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (hereinafter referred to as \"the Harmonized System\") developed by the World Customs Organization.\n\n\nSince the adoption of the ATCA, different versions of Harmonized System have been adopted. Accordingly, the Annex of the ATCA has been amended several times with a view to transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the new versions of the Harmonized System.\n\n\nIn November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System,\n\n\nAnother revision of the Harmonized System took place in 2007 and the WTO Civil Aircraft Committee has been working since 2008 to modify the product list in Annex to the ATCA to make it compatible with the 2007 version of the Harmonized System.\n\n\nOn 5 November 2015, after several years of discussions, the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft agreed to open for acceptance the revised Product Coverage of the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft via the Protocol amending the annex to the ATCA.\n\n\nMember States that are members of the ATCA have been part of these discussions.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nIn November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System.\n\n\nThe new Protocol open for acceptance on 5th November 2015 by the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft will modify the 2001 Protocol to make it compatible with the 2007 version of the Harmonized System.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nConsistent with the common commercial policy\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content.\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 207(1) in conjunction Article 218(6)(a) are applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence), proportionality and choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe European Union as well as some Member States are part of the ATCA. \n\n\n\nThe protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content.\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(1) in conjunction Article 218(6)(a) thereof, the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the ATCA.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nAs this Decision concerns a technical update of an existing international agreement without altering its scope or content, no ex-post evaluation or fitness checks were carried out.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNo stakeholder consultations carried out as such by the Commission. The Protocol was discussed for several years in the framework of the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft.\n\n\nMember States that are members of the ATCA and the European Commission have been part of these discussions.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Protocol was discussed for several years in the framework of the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nAs this Decision concerns a technical update of an existing international agreement without altering its scope or content, no impact assessment was carried out.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThis Decision is neutral in terms of regulatory burden and simplification as it concerns a technical update of an existing international agreement without altering its scope or content.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\n\nAs this Decision concerns a technical update of an existing international agreement without altering its scope or content, there is no impact on fundamental rights. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis proposal has no implications for the budget of the Union.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThis Protocol shall enter into force, for those Signatories who have accepted it, on\n\n\n1 July 2016. Thereafter, for each other Signatory it shall enter into force on the 30th day following the date of its acceptance.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nAs explained in the Protocol, the objective of the amendment is the technical transposition into the Product Coverage Annex of the ATCA of the changes introduced in the 2007 version of the Harmonized System. \n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(1) in conjunction Article 218(6)(a) thereof, the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the ATCA.\n\n\n\n2016/0202 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol (2015) Amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament, \n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Decision (80/271/EEC)\n1\n approved the conclusion of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft (the \u201cAgreement\u201d),\n\n\n(2)Signatories to the Agreement, through their representatives, agreed to open for acceptance the Protocol (2015) Amending the Annex to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft (the \u201cProtocol\u201d) in Geneva on 5 November 2015, transposing into the Annex to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft the changes introduced in the 2007 version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System,\n\n\n(3)The Protocol should be concluded on behalf of the European Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Protocol (2015) amending the Annex to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft is hereby concluded on behalf of the European Union. \n\n\nThe text of the Protocol is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instrument of acceptance in order to express the consent of the Union to be bound by the Protocol\n2\n.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ L 71, 17.3.1980, p. 1.\n\n\n\n(2)\nThe date of entry into force of the Protocol will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by the General Secretariat of the Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 5.7.2016\nCOM(2016) 440 final\nANNEX\nto the\nProposal for a Council Decision\non the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol (2015) Amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\n\n\nPROTOCOL (2015) AMENDING THE ANNEX TO THE\nAGREEMENT ON TRADE IN CIVIL AIRCRAFT\n\n\nSignatories to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft (hereinafter referred to as \"the Agreement\"),\n\n\nHAVING carried out negotiations with a view to transposing into the Annex to the Agreement the changes introduced in the 2007 version of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (hereinafter referred to as \"the Harmonized System\"), \n\n\nHAVE, through their representatives, agreed as follows:\n\n\n1.The Annex attached to this Protocol shall, upon its entry into force pursuant to paragraph 3, replace the Annex to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.\n\n\n2.This Protocol shall be open for acceptance by Signatories to the Agreement.\n\n\n3.This Protocol shall enter into force, for those Signatories who have accepted it, on 1\u00a0July\u00a02016.
