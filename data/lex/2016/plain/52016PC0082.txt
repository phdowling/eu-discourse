The initiative builds upon over 19 years of experience with implementation of Directives 96/50/EC\n1\n and 91/672/EEC\n2\n which are however limited to the mutual recognition of boatmasters operating on EU inland waterways other than the Rhine river. \n\n\nInland waterway transport (IWT) is a cost-saving and energy-efficient transport mode that could be used more efficiently to support the European Union\u2019s energy efficiency, growth and industrial development goals. However, its contribution is hampered by difficulties in terms of labour mobility, persistent vacancies and skills mismatches, which continue in spite of attempts by the sector to tackle the problems at bilateral and multilateral level. Varying minimum requirements for professional qualifications across the Member States do not provide sufficient assurance for individual countries as regards the recognition of professional qualifications of crew from other Member States, in particular as this also affects the safety of navigation. \n\n\nThis initiative therefore proposes to extend the scope of recognition of professional qualifications beyond the level of boatmasters to all crew involved in the operation of vessels, including on the Rhine river. To instil the necessary confidence which is a prerequisite for such recognition, this initiative proposes to base the recognition of the professional qualifications on the competences that are needed for the operation of vessels and to balance the recognition of qualifications with safeguards introducing standards as regards assessment of competence, approval of training programmes and monitoring and evaluation of certification and training. \n\n\nThe initiative responds to long-standing calls from the sector and Member States to revise the existing outdated legal framework and replace it with a modern, competence-based framework in line with the approach towards recognition of qualifications for other modes of transport. \n\n\n1.2.Consistency with existing policies in this area\n\n\nDirective 91/672/EEC and Directive 96/50/EC provide for the reciprocal recognition and set minimum requirements for obtaining boatmasters\u2019 certificates. This initiative builds upon these instruments and extends the requirements to cover all crew in inland navigation in the EU, including on the Rhine river. \n\n\nAs there is no EU-wide sectoral legislation for the recognition of professional qualifications for workers below the level of boatmaster, the general Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications is applicable. In practice however, this Directive does not provide an effective solution for professionals performing frequent and regular cross-border activities in IWT and for this reason the possibilities offered by this general framework have hardly been used by the workers in the sector.\n\n\nThe proposal has been prepared under the Commission\u2019s policy framework for promoting IWT, NAIADES II\n3\n, entailing review of the framework on the harmonisation and modernisation of professional qualifications in the sector. As part of the new approach to governance in IWT, the Commission has strengthened its cooperation with various River Commissions, in particular with the Central Commission for the Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR). This cooperation has led amongst others to the creation of a new body open to experts from all EU Member States, known by the French acronym CESNI\n4\n whose task is to develop technical standards for the inland waterway sector. Its expertise may be used by the EU also in the area of professional qualifications in this sector. The development of minimum competence-based standards which the EU, the CCNR and other international bodies and third countries may use within their legal frameworks is an important step towards mutual recognition of qualifications for inland navigation across the EU. \n\n\n1.3.Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis initiative is consistent with and contributes to the internal \u2019market as it helps to overcome barriers that prevent realising its full potential. It can help give businesses access to IWT services offering for the best quality, price or service available and help professionals to provide services across the EU quickly and conveniently. The initiative contributes to the 2014-2019 strategic objectives that the Commission is pursuing to promote \u2018a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base\u2019, \u2018a new boost for jobs, growth and investment\u2019, \u2018energy union\u2019 and the EU as \u2018a stronger global actor\u2019.\n\n\nMore particularly, the initiative is consistent with the Commission\u2019s 2016 work programme which underlines both the importance of supporting labour mobility while tackling abuse and of promoting skills development, including the mutual recognition of qualifications. The present initiative illustrates a balanced approach to labour mobility for a fairer and deeper internal market as it addresses issues of persistent vacancies in the inland waterway transport sector and paves the way for measures to combat abuse or fraudulent claims. At the same time, with making the competences the cornerstone of the mutual recognition of qualification, the initiative aims at giving boost for jobs and careers. \n\n\nThis further accomplishment of the EU internal market for IWT is essential for improving the energy efficiency of transport and participates, with new the setting up of common standards across the EU, in making the Union a \u2018stronger global actor\u2019.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n2.1.Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is the legal base for the adoption of Union measures relating to inland waterway transport. \n\n\n2.2.Subsidiarity \n\n\n\n\nThis initiative is justified because the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States acting alone. All aspects of transporting goods over the IWT network are generally transnational. Differences in the Member States\u2019 national legislation undermine the functioning of the internal market for goods and workers. Without EU action, the completion and efficient use of the Trans-European Transport Network would be jeopardised and the investments of EU funds in the IWT network would not have optimal results. Differences in legal regimes\n5\n for professional qualifications in IWT throughout the EU cannot be entirely resolved by the Member States individually or in the framework of international conventions, nor by the industry itself. This reasoning is valid for measures applying to boatmasters and for other categories of crew members. Extending the scope to include the Rhine river adds value compared to the existing legal framework as it provides for common standards that are a necessary component of the internal market for skilled workers in IWT at EU level. \n\n\n2.3.Proportionality\n\n\nIn line with measures taken for other modes of transport, competence-based EU-wide minimum requirements, verified through examinations, are only envisaged for skilled crew \u2014 boatmen and boatmasters. For unskilled crew, such as deckhands, only minimum requirements with regard to age and medical fitness are proposed. \n\n\nThe measure designed to certify training programmes is proportionate to its goals as it does not interfere with the national education curricula on general subjects but relates to competences and skills necessary to ensure safety of navigation and the protection of human life, and does not require that those who have already successfully completed an approved training programme in the EU to pass additional administrative exams on the same subjects already covered by their training programme. \n\n\nIntroducing common criteria for competence for specific risks is necessary as such requirements should be justified on safety grounds and the knowledge required should be proportional to the risk at stake. \n\n\nThe inclusion of information on certified qualifications in a database kept by the Commission or a designated body is necessary to streamline the exchange of information between the Member States and to ensure efficient implementation of the initiative. \n\n\nTo instil the necessary confidence among the Member States in the mechanism for mutual recognition, the requirements in terms of quality standards with respect to assessment of competences and skills, recognition of training programmes and monitoring of the whole certification system are also considered proportionate.\n\n\nA number of measures, such as extending the requirements to crew working on inland waterways not linked to the navigable network of another Member State, have been discarded for reasons of proportionality. Member States with non-linked inland waterways nevertheless have to recognise the certified qualifications of crew members from other Member States.\n\n\nAs such, the proposed intervention is proportionate to its goals.\n\n\n2.4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of instrument\n\n\nFor the purpose of establishing a harmonised and efficient system of recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation and complying with the principle of proportionality, a directive is the most appropriate instrument. The present proposal also does not change the type of instrument previously used. A directive will enable Member States to take the actions needed to comply with the obligations foreseen in this Directive by taking also into account national specificities. Provided that it recognises qualifications certified by other Member States, a Member State may also apply more stringent requirements for certifying qualifications on its own territory.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\u00a0\n\n\n3.1.Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nAn external evaluation of Directives 91/672/EEC and 96/50/EC was carried out\n6\n.\u00a0The study showed that the existing framework has been partially effective in fulfilling the objective of reciprocally recognising boatmasters\u2019 certificates and harmonising conditions for obtaining the certificates, but several barriers remain. All recommendations were taken into account in the framework of the impact assessment.\n\n\n3.2.Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nStakeholders were consulted on several occasions and by different methods on the various elements which are now the subject of the proposal:\n\n\n(1)In 2012 the Commission created a Common Expert Group (CEG) on professional qualifications and training standards in inland navigation. The consultation within the CEG took the form of 11 expert meetings between September 2012 and November 2014 and included international river commissions, national administrations, professional organisations, trade unions, training institutions and other associations\n7\n. Those meetings provided the opportunity for useful exchanges on the measures envisaged for a Commission proposal. They showed broad support for an initiative at EU level.\n\n\n(2)The Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee for Inland Waterway Transport at European level\n8\n was also involved in the consultations. The social partners submitted on 16 September 2013 a document entitled \u2018Social partners\u2019 position on professional qualifications and training standards for crew members on inland waterways transport vessels\u2019. They pointed out that the current \u2018patchwork arrangement\u2019 is quite clearly no longer fit for purpose. It hampers the attractiveness of the profession and makes the sector vulnerable to illegal practices that may distort the competition. They confirmed the need for a modern and flexible regulatory tool regarding training and certification. Social partners also stressed that the proposal on professional qualifications is only one part of the puzzle. The electronic service record book, logbook and tachograph are the missing pieces that have to be addressed without too much delay in order to ensure a level playing field.\n\n\n(3)An online public consultation on the essential elements of the Impact Assessment took place from 26 March to 21 June 2013\n9\n. The Commission received a total of 94 replies from education and training organisations, entrepreneurs/ship owners, shipping companies, public authorities, ports, workers\u2019 organisations and river commissions. Responses came from a total of 16 countries. The online public consultation highlighted the fact that the problems addressed in the Commission proposal are of great importance. The responses indicated a high level of support for regulatory measures aiming to harmonise professional requirements, qualifications and examinations in inland navigation.\n\n\n3.3.Impact assessment \n\n\n\n\nThis proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment report which has been reviewed by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, which issued a positive opinion on 31 July 2015. All the recommendations from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board have been taken into consideration in the final impact assessment report. More information on the way these have been addressed is included under section 2.2. of the impact assessment report.\n\n\nIn order to address the main problems identified, namely that workers face difficulties with regard to mutual recognition of professional qualifications and that local knowledge requirements may create unnecessary difficulties for boatmasters operating on certain river stretches, the policy option introducing minimum competence requirements for boatmen and boatmasters, including examination standards for training institutes, has been chosen. \n\n\nThis option is preferred as it offers a more effective way to improve labour mobility than the \u2018do nothing\u2019 and the \u2018voluntary measures\u2019 options. \n\n\nThe preferred option also addresses the difficulties for labour mobility arising from requirements for local knowledge requirements and allows Member States to carry out assessments of required competences for specific risks also for inland waterways located in another Member State, which further improves the effectiveness of this option. \n\n\nThe impact assessment presented two variations of the preferred option, one limiting the regulatory requirements for assessment of competences to mandatory administrative examination and one including alongside the mutual recognition of approved training programmes. Under the first variant, all boatmen and boatmasters are required to pass an administrative exam organised by a competent authority in order to have their qualifications recognised across the EU, even if they are already in possession of a diploma or certificate from an IWT education or training institute. The second variant has been preferred as it minimises the administrative burden for those applicants who have already acquired the necessary skills and who have demonstrated their competences in the course of their training, by sparing them the need to take additional exams. As a result, there is also a positive impact on attractiveness of the profession, labour mobility, access to the profession and administrative savings. The latter impact makes the second variant also more efficient compared to the first variant. Finally, this variant is also more coherent as similar legislative requirements for education and training institutes already exist at EU level for the rail and air transport sector. In these sectors, the requirements even go further as they also entail continuous training. Overall, the second variant is more coherent, more effective and more efficient and complies with the principles of proportionality as outlined in section 2.3.\n\n\n3.4.Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nThe private IWT sector is almost exclusively composed of SME\u2019s and micro-enterprises. They are therefore not excluded from this initiative as doing so would neutralise the effect completely. This proposal has been drafted with SME\u2019s in mind. The impact of this proposal on SMEs and micro-enterprises is positive, as they will have to bear only a small proportion of the costs, which will be more than off-set by the benefits of enhanced labour mobility.\n\n\nBy providing the common standards across the Union necessary to achieve the internal market for workers in IWT, the proposal streamlines the legal framework related to professional qualifications in the European IWT sector, which is currently fragmented. The proposal will replace a complex set of regional requirements with multilateral and bilateral agreements by a simpler and, more importantly, EU-wide framework for certification and mutual recognition.\n\n\nThe proposal minimises the administrative burden for those applicants who completed an approved training programme by avoiding that they would have to take unnecessary additional administrative exams.\n\n\nThe proposal also facilitates the electronic exchange of information and paves the way for the introduction of electronic tools, with a view to reduce the administrative burden whilst rendering the documents less prone to tampering \n\n\nThe proposal repeals Directive 91/672/EEC and Directive 96/50/EC and provides for gradual phasing-in with transitional measures.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU budget. \n\n\n5.OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \n\n\n5.1.Monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nIt is anticipated that the Commission will submit, at the latest seven years after the end of the transposition period, a report to the European Parliament and the Council, evaluating the effectiveness of the measures introduced by this proposal. \n\n\n\n5.2.Explanatory documents\n\n\nThe proposed Directive contains a significant number of more extensive legal obligations compared to the existing Directives 91/672/EEC and 96/50/EC. Given this, and the fact that the proposal includes provisions on a number of qualifications not yet covered in a mandatory way by the current legal framework i.e. deck crew members other than boatmasters, experts in the use of liquefied natural gas as a fuel and passengers navigation experts, explanatory documents accompanying the notification of transposition measures will be needed so that measures which the Member States have introduced are clearly identifiable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2016/0050 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\non the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation and repealing Council Directive 96/50/EC and Council Directive 91/672/EEC \n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a091(1) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n10\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n11\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Directive 91/672/EEC\n12\n and Council Directive 96/50/EC\n13\n are the first steps taken towards the harmonisation and recognition of professional qualifications for crew members in inland navigation. \n\n\n(2)The requirements for crew members navigating on the Rhine river, who are outside the scope of Directives 91/672/EEC and 96/50/EC, are established by the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR), pursuant to the Rhine Navigation Personnel Regulation under the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation.\n\n\n(3)Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n14\n applies to inland waterway occupations other than boatmasters, who are covered by that Directive. The mutual recognition of diplomas and certificates under Directive 2005/36/EC does not, however, provide an optimised response to regular and frequent cross-border activities of inland waterways occupations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n(4)An evaluation study carried out by the Commission in 2014 highlighted the fact that the limitation of the scope of Directives 91/672/EEC and 96/50/EC to boatmasters, as well as the lack of automatic recognition of boatmasters\u2019 certificates issued in accordance with those Directives on the Rhine, greatly hinders the mobility of crew members in inland navigation.\n\n\n(5)To facilitate mobility, to ensure the safety of navigation and the protection of human life, it is essential for deck crew members, persons in charge of emergency situations on board passenger vessels and persons involved in the bunkering of liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels to hold certificates of qualification proving their qualifications. For efficient enforcement, they should carry such certificates while exercising their occupation.\n\n\n(6)Boatmasters sailing in circumstances presenting a particular safety hazard should hold a specific authorisation, in particular, for sailing large convoys, sailing liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels, sailing in conditions of reduced visibility, sailing on waterways with a maritime character or sailing on waterways with specific risks for navigation. In order to obtain such authorisation, boatmasters should be required to demonstrate additional competences.\n\n\n(7)For ensuring safety of navigation, Member States should identify waterways with a maritime character, in accordance with harmonised criteria. The competence requirements for navigating on these waterways should be defined at Union level. Without unnecessarily limiting the mobility of boatmasters, when necessary for ensuring safety of navigation, Member States should also have the possibility to identify the waterways entailing specific risks for navigation in accordance with harmonised criteria and procedures, pursuant to this Directive. In such a case, the related competence requirements should be set at Member State level. \n\n\n\n\n(8)For reasons of cost-effectiveness, holding Union certificates of qualification should not be made compulsory on national inland waterways not linked to the navigable network of another Member State.\n\n\n(9)With a view to contributing to the mobility of persons involved in the operation of vessels across the Union and considering that all certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued in accordance with this Directive should comply with minimum standards, Member States should recognise the professional qualifications certified in accordance with this Directive. Consequently the holders of such qualifications should be able to exercise their profession on all Union inland waterways. \n\n\n(10)In view of the established cooperation between the Union and the CCNR since 2003 which has led to the establishment of a European Committee for drawing up Standards in Inland Navigation (CESNI), an international body set up under the auspices of the CCNR, and in order to streamline the legal frameworks governing the professional qualifications in Europe, certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks, issued in accordance with the Rhine Navigation Personnel Regulation under the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation which lay down requirements that are identical to those of this Directive should be valid on all Union inland waterways. Such documents issued by third countries should be recognised in the Union, subject to reciprocity.  To further remove barriers to labour mobility and further streamline the legal frameworks governing the professional qualifications in Europe, any certificate of qualification, service record book or logbook issued by a third country on the basis of requirements which are identical to those laid down in this Directive may also be recognised on all Union waterways, subject to an assessment by the Commission and subject to recognition by that third-country of documents issued in accordance with the present Directive . \n\n\n(11)Directive 2005/36/EC remains applicable for deck crew members exempted from the obligation of holding a Union certificate of qualification issued in accordance with this Directive, as well as for inland waterways qualifications not covered by the present Directive.\n\n\n(12)Member States should issue certificates of qualification only to persons that have the minimum levels of competence, the minimum age, the minimum medical fitness and the navigation time required for obtaining a specific qualification. \n\n\n(13)To safeguard the mutual recognition of qualifications, the certificates of qualification should be based on the competences necessary for the operation of vessels. Member States should ensure that persons receiving certificates of qualification have the corresponding minimum levels of competence, verified following an appropriate assessment. Such assessments may take the form of an administrative examination or may form part of approved training programmes carried out in accordance with common standards in order to ensure a comparable minimum level of competence in all Member States for various qualifications. \n\n\n(14)Due to the responsibility with respect to safety when exercising the profession of boatmaster, sailing with the aid of radar and bunkering liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels or sailing liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels, verification through practical examinations on whether the required level of competence has effectively been reached is required. Such practical examinations may be carried out using approved simulators, with a view to further facilitating the evaluation of competence. \n\n\n(15)Approval of training programmes is necessary to verify that the programmes comply with common minimum requirements regarding content and organisation. Such compliance allows for eliminating unnecessary barriers to entering the profession by preventing those who already acquired the necessary skills during their vocational training from passing unnecessary additional examination. The existence of approved training programmes may also facilitate the entry of workers with prior experience from other sectors into the profession of inland navigation as they may benefit from dedicated training programmes that take account of their already acquired competences. \n\n\n(16)To further facilitate mobility for boatmasters, all Member States should be allowed, where practicable, to assess the necessary competence for addressing specific risks for navigation for all inland waterway stretches in the Union where such risks are identified. \n\n\n(17)The navigation time should be verified by means of entries in service record books validated by a Member State. To allow for such verification, Member States should issue service record books and logbooks and ensure that the latter provide a record of the journeys of vessels. Medical fitness of a candidate should be certified by an approved medical practitioner. \n\n\n(18)Whenever the measures provided for in this Directive entail the processing of personal data, they shall be carried out in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data\n15\n. \n\n\n(19)To contribute to an efficient administration with respect to the issuing, renewing and withdrawing certificates of qualification, Member States should designate the competent authorities for implementing this Directive and set up registers for recording data on Union certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks. In order to facilitate the exchange of information between Member States and with the Commission for the purpose of implementation, enforcement and evaluation of the Directive as well as for statistical purposes, for maintaining safety and for ease of navigation, Member States should report such information, including data on the certificates of qualifications, service record books and logbooks, in a database kept by the Commission. \n\n\n(20)Authorities, including in third countries, issuing certificates of qualifications, service record books and logbooks in accordance with rules that are identical to those of this Directive are processing personal data. For the purpose of evaluation of the Directive, for statistical purposes, for maintaining safety, for ease of navigation and in order to facilitate the exchange of information between the authorities involved in the implementation and enforcement of this Directive, these authorities and, where relevant, international organisations that established these identical rules, should also have access to the database kept by the Commission. This access should however be subject to adequate level of data protection, including of personal data.\n\n\n(21)With a view to further reducing administrative burden whilst rendering the documents less prone to tampering, the Commission should as a second step, after the adoption of this Directive, examine the possibility of introducing an electronic version of service record books and logbooks, as well as electronic professional cards incorporating Union certificates of qualifications. In doing so, the Commission should take existing technologies in other modes of transport into account, in particular road transport. After conducting an impact assessment including of cost-benefit and of the impacts on the fundamental rights, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, the Commission should present, if appropriate, a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n(22)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt decisions approving measures proposed by the Member States with respect to requirements for the competence for specific risks on certain stretches of inland waterways.\n\n\n(23)The implementing powers relating to the adoption of models for the issuing of Union certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks and the adoption of decisions for establishing or suspending the recognition of such documents issued by a third country or under an international agreement regulating navigation on a Union inland waterway should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n. \n\n\n(24)In order to provide minimum harmonised standards for the certification of qualifications and to facilitate the exchange of information between Member States  and the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of this Directive by the Commission, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission as regards the setting of standards of competence, standards for medical fitness, standards for practical examinations, standards for the approval of simulators and standards defining the characteristics and conditions of use for a database kept by the Commission to host a copy of key data related to Union certificates of qualifications, service record books, logbooks and recognised documents. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. \n\n\n(25)Transitional measures should address the problem of national certificates in use, including those issued by the CCNR, for boatmasters, but also for other categories of deck crew members falling in the scope of the Directive. They should safeguard as far as possible entitlements previously granted and aim at providing for reasonable time to skilled crew members to apply for a Union certificate of qualification. They should therefore provide for a period of maximum 10 years in which these certificates may be used on the Union waterways where they were valid before the end of the transposition period and ensure a system of transition to the new rules for all these certificates on the basis of a single EU set of criteria.\n\n\n(26)The CESNI which is open to experts from all Member States, draws up standards in the field of inland navigation, including for professional qualifications. The Commission may take into account such standards when empowered to adopt acts in conformity with this Directive. \n\n\n(27)Since the objective of this Directive, namely establishing a common framework on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. \n\n\n\n\n(28)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\n17\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n\n\n(29)Directives 91/672/EEC and 96/50/EC should therefore be repealed, \n\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n\nsubject matter, definitions and scope \n\n\nArticle 1 \nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Directive lays down the conditions and procedures for the certification of the qualifications of persons involved in the operation of a vessel for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union, as well as the recognition of such qualifications in the Member States.\n\n\nArticle 2\nScope\n\n\n1.This Directive applies to deck crew members, persons who are involved in the operation of bunkering vessels using liquefied natural gas as fuel and passenger navigation experts of the following vessels on any Union inland waterway: \n\n\n(a)vessels having a length (L) of 20 metres or more;\n\n\n(b)vessels where the length (L), breadth (B) and draught (T) is a volume of 100 cubic metres or more;\n\n\n(c)tugs and pushers intended for: \n\n\n(i) towing or pushing vessels referred to in points (a) and (b),\n\n\n(ii) towing or pushing floating equipment \n\n\n(iii) moving vessels referred to in points (a) and (b) or floating equipment alongside.\n\n\n(d)passenger vessels;\n\n\n(e)self-propelled floating equipment. \n\n\n2.This Directive does not apply to persons involved in the operation of: \n\n\n\n\n(a)recreational craft;\n\n\n(b)ferries not moving independently.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: \n\n\n(1)\u2018inland waterway\u2019 means a stretch of water not part of the sea, open to navigation;\n\n\n(2)\u2018vessel\u2019 means an inland waterway vessel or sea-going ship;
