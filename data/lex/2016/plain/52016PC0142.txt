In February 2013, the European Commission presented the Georgian Government with an action plan on visa liberalisation (VLAP). The Commission committed itself to proposing visa-free travel for short stays in the European Union to Georgian nationals holding biometric passports as soon as all the benchmarks set in the VLAP have been met by the Georgian Government.\n\n\nBefore the start of the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the EU and Georgia had concluded in parallel a Visa Facilitation Agreement and a Readmission Agreement, which entered into force on 1 March 2011. Their full and effective implementation has been an underlying condition for the launch and the continuation of the visa dialogue. \n\n\nThe VLAP is structured around four 'blocks': document security, including biometrics (block I), migration and integrated border management, including asylum (block II), public order and security (block III), and external relations and fundamental rights (block IV). The VLAP sets out a series of precise benchmarks for each of these four 'blocks' of technically relevant issues with a view to adopting a legislative, policy and institutional framework (phase 1) and ensuring its effective and sustainable implementation (phase 2). \n\n\nSince the launch of the EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the Commission has reported to the European Parliament and the Council on Georgia's progress towards fulfilling the benchmarks identified under the four blocks of the VLAP's first and second phases. Progress has been assessed on the basis of on-site evaluations by experts from EU Member States and detailed information provided by Georgia.\n\n\nOn 15 November 2013 the Commission adopted its first progress report\n1\n on Georgia\u2019s implementation of the VLAP and made several recommendations for completing the first (legislative and planning) phase. \n\n\nThe Commission's second progress report\n2\n of 29 October 2014 concluded that Georgia had fulfilled the first-phase benchmarks of the VLAP and was ready to be assessed on the second-phase benchmarks. In its conclusions of 17 November 2014, the Council agreed with the Commission\u2019s assessment. The report was accompanied by an assessment of the potential migratory and security impacts of future visa liberalisation for Georgian citizens travelling to the EU. \n\n\nThe Commission adopted the third progress report\n3\n on Georgia's implementation of the VLAP on 8 May 2015. The report confirmed that Georgia was broadly in line with all the benchmarks set in the four blocks of the VLAP and identified actions that, if taken, would ensure that Georgia fulfills all benchmarks for the second phase of the VLAP.\n\n\nIn its fourth and final progress report\n4\n, adopted on 18 December 2015, the Commission considered that Georgia had made the necessary progress and had undertaken all the required reforms to ensure the effective and sustainable achievement of the remaining benchmarks. Based on this assessment, and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the Commission confirmed that Georgia had met all the benchmarks set for each of the four blocks of the VLAP's second phase and that it would present, in early 2016, a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Georgia to the list of visa-free countries (Annex II).\n\n\nIn addition to reporting on the VLAP, the Commission continued to monitor the implementation of the Visa Facilitation and Readmission Agreements, notably through the Joint Committees established under those agreements. The last meeting to date of both committees was held in Brussels on 13 October 2015. In this context, the Commission noted that implementation of the two agreements was very satisfactory overall.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and other Union policies\n\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001\n5\n lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member\u00a0States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001 is applied by all Member\u00a0States \u2013 with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom \u2013 and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU's common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period.\n\n\nGeorgia is currently listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001, i.e. among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. \n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 was last amended by Regulation (EU) No 259/2014\n6\n when Moldova was transferred to the visa-free list after successfully implementing its VLAP; and by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014\n7\n when five Caribbean\n8\n and eleven Pacific countries\n9\n, as well as Colombia, Peru and the United Arab Emirates were exempted from the visa requirement \u2013 subject to the conclusion of visa waiver agreements between the EU and the respective third countries \u2013 following a periodical review of the visa lists.\n\n\nThe criteria which should be taken into account when determining \u2013 based on a case-by-case assessment \u2013 the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement are laid down in Article -1 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014). They include \u201cillegal immigration, public policy and security, economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade, and the Union\u2019s external relations with the relevant third countries, including in particular, considerations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity\u201d\n10\n. Particular attention should be paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries concerned.\n\n\nThere is no reason to condition the implementation of the visa exemption for Georgian citizens on the conclusion of a visa waiver agreement with the EU, as Georgia has already exempted all EU citizens from the visa requirement for stays of 90 days (within a 180-day period). Should this decision be revoked or should the visa-free regime be abused, the existing reciprocity and suspension mechanisms of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 would provide sufficient remedies.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nAs the proposal will amend the EU's common visa policy, the legal basis for the proposal is point (a) of Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis.\n\n\n\n\n \u2022Subsidiarity \n\n\n\nAs Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001 is a legal act of the EU, it can only be amended by way of an equivalent legal act. Member States cannot act individually.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nSee above \u2013 no other options to achieve the policy objective are available.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nSee above.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nRegular discussions with Member States in the Council Working Party on Eastern Europe and Central Asia (COEST) and several presentations of the visa liberalisation process to the European Parliament have taken place.\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThe Commission collected comprehensive data on Georgia's implementation of all VLAP benchmarks. Its final progress report on Georgia, as was the case for the two preceding reports,  was accompanied by a Commission staff working document\n11\n which provided more detailed background information on the developments under each benchmark. \n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nIn the annex to the staff working document, the Commission provided an updated factual analysis and statistics-based information on the possible migratory and security impacts of visa liberalisation for Georgian citizens travelling to the EU, based on inputs from relevant EU agencies and stakeholders. No further impact assessment is necessary.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no negative consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ASPECTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe amended of Regulation will be directly applicable from its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary.\n\n\nThe Commission will continue to actively monitor Georgia's continuous implementation of all benchmarks under the four blocks of the VLAP through the existing association structures and dialogues, and, if necessary, through ad hoc follow-up mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 will be amended, transferring Georgia from Annex I (list of visa-required countries) to Annex II (list of visa-free countries). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa waiver will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\n\n\n2016/0075 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement \n\n\n(Georgia)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (a) of Article\u00a077(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001\n12\n lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member\u00a0States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The composition of the lists of third countries in Annexes I and II should be, and should remain, consistent with the criteria set out therein. References to third countries in respect of which the situation has changed as regards those criteria should be transferred from one annex to the other, as appropriate.\n\n\n(2)It is considered that Georgia has met all the benchmarks set out in the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan presented to the Georgian Government in February 2013, and therefore fulfils the relevant criteria for its citizens to be exempted from the visa requirement when travelling to the territory of \n\nEU Member States. \n\n\n(3)Georgia should thus be transferred from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0539/2001 to Annex II thereof. This visa waiver should apply only to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\n\n(4)This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC\n13\n. The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. \n\n\n(5)This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC\n14\n. Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. \n\n\n(6)As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in point B of Article 1, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC\n15\n.\n\n\n(7)As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in point B of Article 1, of Decision 1999/437/EC, read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC\n16\n.\n\n\n(8)As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in point B of Article 1, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU\n17\n,\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 539/2001 is amended as follows:\n\n\n(a)in Annex I, Part 1 (\"STATES\"), the reference to Georgia is deleted. \n\n\n(b)in Annex II, Part 1 (\"STATES\"), the following reference is inserted:\n\n\n\"Georgia\"*\n\n\n______________\n\n\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visa waiver is limited to the holders of biometric passports issued in line with standards of the International Civil
