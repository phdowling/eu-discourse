In 2015, 100 new substances were reported for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EWS), bringing the total number of new substances monitored to more than 560 \u2013 with more than 380 (70%) of these detected in the last five years alone.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly\u00a0at the Special Session on the world drug problem (UNGASS, 19-21 April 2016) adopted the outcome document \"Our joint commitment to effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem\"\n2\n. A specific section deals with addressing emerging and persistent challenges and threats including NPS. The joint commitment calls for strengthening action to address the challenge of NPS as well as for enhancing information-sharing and early warning networks. \n\n\n\nOn 17 September 2013, the Commission put forward a package of two legislative proposals on new psychoactive substances: a proposal for a Regulation on new psychoactive substances\n3\n and a Directive amending Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking, as regards the definition of drug\n4\n. The objective was to reduce the availability of new psychoactive substances that pose risk through swifter, more effective action on Union level compared to the currently applicable system based on Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances\n5\n.\n\n\nInter-institutional negotiations of this legislative package have been ongoing for more than two years. The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 17 April 2014\n6\n. The Council did not adopt a general approach on the proposals; during the examination of the proposals Member States expressed doubts concerning the choice of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as the legal basis for the proposed Regulation.  \n\n\n\nTo achieve the same objective of a swifter, more effective EU action on NPS, the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) on 6 April 2016\n7\n agreed to the approach proposed by the Netherlands Presidency in its discussion paper, including amendments of the draft Directive based on Article 83 TFEU that will in particular contain a definition of new psychoactive substances and provisions on swift Union level decision making in order to criminalise harmful new psychoactive substances in all Member States. COREPER also invited the Commission to present a proposal on amending the founding Regulation of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Regulation 1920/2006.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0the Summary Record of the 2580th meeting of COREPER this decision triggers the start of the 3 months' opt-in deadline for the Member States concerned by Protocol 21 and has consequences under Protocol 22 annexed to the TEU. The European Parliament is informed about this change by a letter from the Council.\n\n\n\nGiven that the decision of COREPER aims to achieve the same objectives as proposed by the package of 2013, the Commission proposes targeted amendments of Regulation 1920/2006 integrating the draft provisions on early warning system and risk assessment procedure that were part of the 2013 Commission proposal for a Regulation on new psychoactive substances into the founding Regulation of the EMCDDA. The Commission will consider the withdrawal of the proposal on a Regulation on new psychoactive substances in preparing Commission's Work Programme for 2017. \n\n\nThe new proposal as the previous one aims at strengthening the EU early warning system and the risk assessment and at streamlining procedures to ensure more effective and fast action. Therefore, in order to speed up the process, deadlines are substantially shortened compared to the current system based on Council Decision 2005/387/JHA. For the purpose of swift and effective collection of information on NPS, the EMCDDA should conclude working arrangements with Europol, the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority without undue delay following the publication of the Regulation in the Official Journal. \n\n\nThis proposal also ensures a participation of EUROPOL in the early warning system and risk assessment procedure, in particular as input on the involvement of criminal groups in the manufacture and distribution of new psychoactive substances is concerned. \n\n\nAccording to Article 23 of Regulation 1920/2006 the Commission may propose, if appropriate, and in the light of developments in respect of regulatory agencies on the basis of the next evaluation of the Centre further amendments to the EMCDDA founding Regulation. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe proposal reflects the priorities set out by the European Agenda on Security\n8\n adopted on 28 April 2015. The European Agenda of Security stresses that the market for illicit drugs remains the most dynamic of criminal markets, with a recent trend being the proliferation of new psychoactive substances. It also states that the production of these substances is increasingly taking place in the Union thus pointing to the urgency of adopting a new legislative framework.\n\n\nThis proposal has to be read in conjunction with Directive (EU) \u2026/ \u2026 [amending Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking\n9\n]. Both instruments are designed to replace the mechanism established by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 168(5) TFEU, which empowers the European Parliament and the Council to adopt measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross border threats to health whilst excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States. \n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsidiarity\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear need for EU action on new psychoactive substances. Member States alone cannot reduce the problems caused by the spread of harmful new psychoactive substances. Uncoordinated national action in this area can produce adverse knock-on effects, for instance displacement of harmful substances from one Member State to another. Criminal groups may exploit this situation.\n\n\nConsequently, EU-level action is necessary to ensure that potentially harmful new psychoactive substances, which cause EU-wide concern, can be identified, assessed and, if they pose risks, incriminated in all Member States. This Regulation has therefore to be read in conjunction with Directive (EU) \u2026/ \u2026 [amending Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking] since both acts are designed to replace the mechanism established by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA. \n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposal is proportionate and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives because it only addresses new psychoactive substances that are a concern at the EU level.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe proposal concerns the amendment of a Regulation. There are no indications that a different instrument than a Regulation would be appropriate.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThis proposal follows an agreement by COREPER on 6 April 2016 on a compromise approach proposed by the Netherlands Presidency of the Council. In the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament of 15 June 2016, the Rapporteurs and the Shadow Rapporteurs announced that they have taken the decision to pursue this new approach as a package and work together with the Council and the Commissions to reach agreement. As the content reflects this agreement, this new proposal does not require further stakeholder consultations.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\n\nThe Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives in the context of the package of two proposals put forward on 17 September of 2013. The impact assessment in particular concluded that the quality and quantity of information available at EU level and shared by Member States as well as the capacity to rapidly identify and assess new psychoactive substances needs to be improved.\n10\n Therefore, no new impact assessment is required for this proposal. \n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe EMCDDA is tasked with the exchange of information, the early warning system and the risk assessment procedure on new psychoactive substances. The subsidy for the Centre forms already part of the Union's budget.\n\n\nHowever, for the Centre to adequately deal with the growing number of requests related to information exchange on new psychoactive substances as well as with the proposed streamlined procedures for the EU early warning system and risk assessment procedure, an amount of EUR 676.000 in total for the period 2017-2020 for the system development and an amount of EUR 100.000 per year to finance three additional contract agents will need to be added to the Centre's budget. \n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe EMCDDA is on a regular basis evaluated according to Article 23 of Regulation 1920/2006. According to this article, the Commission shall initiate an external evaluation of the EMCDDA every six years to coincide with the completion of two of the Centre's three-year programmes.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nArticle 1 provides for the following amendments to Regulation 1920/2006:\n\n\nNew point (f) in Article 2 (Tasks) \u2013 this provision clarifies that tasks of the EMCDDA are information exchange and early warning on new psychoactive substances as well as risk assessment. The Centre also monitors all new psychoactive substances that have been reported by Member States.\n\n\n\n\nNew Article 5a (Exchange of information, early warning system and risk assessment on new psychoactive substances) \u2013 this provision establishes the respective roles of Member States, the EMCDDA and Europol in the process of exchange of information and early warning on new psychoactive substances.\n\n\nNew Article 5b (Initial report) \u2013 this provision lays down the contents and the procedures for the drawing up and the transmission by the EMCDDA of an initial report on a new psychoactive substance. Europol, the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority are associated to the collection of information for an initial report.\n\n\nNew Article 5c (Risk assessment procedure and report) \u2013 this provision empowers the Commission to request the EMCDDA to assess the risks of a new psychoactive substance on which an initial report has been drawn up. It lays down the procedures for the risk assessment, which is to be conducted by the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA, and for the drawing up and the transmission of a risk assessment report. \n\n\nNew Article 5d (Exclusion from risk assessment) \u2013 this provision details such circumstances in which no risk assessment is to be conducted on a new psychoactive substance.\n\n\nArticle 2 establishes when the Regulation shall enter into force. \n\n\n2016/0261 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\namending Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006 as regards information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure on new psychoactive substances\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 168(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n11\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n12\n, \n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)New psychoactive substances can pose serious cross border threats to health which makes necessary to enhance monitoring, early warning and combating of those threats.\n\n\n(2)During the past years, Member States have notified an increasing number of new psychoactive substances via the mechanism for rapid exchange of information which was established by Joint Action 97/396/JHA adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the information exchange, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs\n13\n and was further strengthened by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA\n14\n.\n\n\n(3)New psychoactive substances that pose health and social risks across the Union should be addressed at the Union level. This Regulation has therefore to be read in conjunction with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA\n15\n [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026] since both acts are designed to replace the mechanism established by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.\n\n\n\n\n(4)It is necessary to insert provisions concerning the information exchange and early warning system on new psychoactive substances as well as the risk assessment procedure into Regulation (EC) 1920/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n16\n In particular provisions concerning the early warning on new psychoactive substances should be strengthened and the procedures for drawing up an initial report and organising the risk assessment procedure should be made more efficient. Substantially shortened deadlines for all stages of the procedure should be set.\n\n\n(5)Any Union action on new psychoactive substances should be based on scientific evidence. \n\n\n(6)Following the risk assessment procedure, the Commission should determine whether the new psychoactive substances should be incriminated, in line with the procedure provided for in Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026]. This Regulation will enter into force on the same day as the day for transposition of the Directive since both acts are designed to replace the mechanism established by Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.\n\n\n(7)No risk assessment should be conducted on a new psychoactive substance if it is subject to an assessment under international law, or if it is an active substance in a medicinal product or in a veterinary medicinal product.\n\n\n(8)Regulation (EC) 1920/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006\n\n\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1920/2006 is amended as follows:\n\n\n\n(1) In Article 2 the following point (f) is added:\n\n\n\n \"(f) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exchange of information, early warning system and risk assessment on new psychoactive substances\n\n\n\n(i) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collecting, collating, analysing, and assessing the available information from the Reitox National Focal Points and the Europol National Units on new psychoactive substances as defined in Article [\u2026] of Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026] and communicating this information to the Reitox National Focal Points and the Europol National Units as well as to the Commission without undue delay;\n\n\n\n(ii) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drawing up the initial report or combined initial report in accordance with Article 5b; \n\n\n\n(iii) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0organising the risk assessment procedure in accordance with Articles 5c and 5d;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0monitoring, in cooperation with Europol and with the support of the Reitox National Focal Points and the Europol National Units, all new psychoactive substances that have been reported by Member States.\"\n\n\n\n(2) In Article 5 (2) the second and third subparagraphs are deleted. \n\n\n\n(3) The following Articles 5a, 5b, 5c and 5d are inserted:\n\n\n\"Article 5a\n\n\nInformation exchange and early warning system on new psychoactive substances\n\n\nEach Member State shall ensure that its Reitox National Focal Points and the Europol National Unit provide timely and without any undue delay to the Centre and Europol the available information on new psychoactive substances.

The European Agenda on Security states: \n\n\n\"The market for illicit drugs remains the most dynamic of criminal markets, with a recent trend being the proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS). The production of NPS increasingly takes place in the EU and points to the urgency of adopting a new legislative framework.\"\n\n\n\n1.4.2.Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\n\n\nRelevant general objective: \n\n\nContribute to ensuring a high level of security in the European Union while facilitating legitimate travel, through a uniform and high level of control at the external borders and the effective processing of Schengen visas, in compliance with the Union\u2019s commitment to fundamental freedoms and human rights.\n\n\nSpecific objective 6: \n\n\nTo support initiatives in the field of drugs policy as regards judicial cooperation and crime prevention aspects closely linked to the general objective of the Justice Programme, insofar as they are not covered by the ISF of by the Health for Growth programme.\n\n\n\nSpecific objective 7: \n\n\nTo contribute to reducing drug use and trafficking, and the harms that drugs cause to individuals and to society, through measures to reduce the availability of new drugs, to improve the quality of drug-demand reduction services and the understanding of drug supply, by supporting actions to raise awareness about the risks of drugs, enhance the effectiveness of treatment and support cross-border operational cooperation against drug \n\n\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-drugs\n\n\n\n1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\n\n\nProviding for an effective and efficient early warning system and risk assessment procedure on new psychoactive substances in order to proactively protect, identify, validate, respond and prevent serious harms caused by new psychoactive substances, and to ensure that harmful new psychoactive can be incriminated in all Member States on the basis of Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026]\n\n\n\n1.4.4.Indicators of results and impact \n\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\n\n\nResult indicator 1 (objective 6): \n\n\nNumber of new psychoactive substances assessed (including through testing, if necessary) to enable the EU or the Member States to take appropriate action to protect consumers, depending on the type and level of risk that may pose when consumed by humans.\n\n\nResult indicator 3 (objective 7): \n\n\nDegree to which new psychoactive substances which are notified by several Member States and which seem to pose risks are subjected to risk assessment (including to testing, if necessary) to enable the EU or the Member States to take appropriate action to protect consumers.\n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To protect the health of individuals from the risks posed by harmful new psychoactive substances\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To provide a basis for decision-making on Union level concerning incrimination of harmful new psychoactive substances on the basis of Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026]\n\n\n- \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To improve the capacity to rapidly identify and assess new psychoactive substances\n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nA strengthened early warning system would boost the exchange of information among Member States, with the clear added value of alerting Member States to potentially harmful substances that have emerged in other Member States, to help them anticipate a potential public health threat. The assessment of risk of new psychoactive substances at EU level has the added value of pooling scientific resources and analytical capacities from across the Union and to provide the best evidence available on a substance, thus forming a solid basis of decision making on Union level on new psychoactive substances based on Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA [as amended by Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026]\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe current system based on Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances is too slow to address effectively the fast growing number of new psychoactive substances.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\n\n\nAction in the field of new psychoactive substances is in compliance with Union strategic policy documents, in particular the European Agenda on Security\n22\n and the EU Drugs Strategy 2013-2020. EU action in the field of new psychoactive substances is also fully consistent with action at the United Nation's level.\n\n\n\n1.6.Duration and financial impact \n\n\n\u25fb Proposal/initiative of
