Consequently, the European Union was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. Such adjustment is due if the adoption of the EU\u2019s external tariff regime results in an increase in tariff beyond the level for which the acceding country has bound itself at the WTO.\n\n\nOn 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. \n\n\nNegotiations with the Eastern Republic of Uruguay resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 18 December 2015 in Nairobi (the Agreement). Consequently, the European Commission proposes to the Council to authorise the signature of the Agreement.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe proposal is consistent with EU practice followed in previous EU enlargements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe proposal follows EU practice which is consistent with the EU external action and agricultural policies.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjuction with Article 218(5) of the TFEU for the signature of international agreements.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe proposal falls under exclusive competence of the Union, Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay was affected by the withdrawal of Croatia's concessions. The compensatory adjustments do not exceed Uruguay's rights in this respect. The proposal complies with the proportionality treatment.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nA Decision of the Council authorising the signature of the Agreement is required under Article 218(5) TFEU.\n\n\n\n\n3.STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThe Council (Trade Policy Committee) has been regularly consulted on the content and advancement of the negotiations. The European Parliament (INTA Committee) has been informed.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nSee Financial Statement.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans \n\n\nThe Commission proposes to the Council that the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the Eastern Republic of Uruguay be signed on behalf of the Union. In parallel, a separate proposal on the conclusion of this Agreement is also being submitted to the Council.\n\n\nAs a result of the Agreement the Commission will adopt an implementing Regulation to extend the following tariff rate quotas, pursuant to Article 187(a) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013):\n\n\n\u2013Add 76 tonnes in the country allocated (Uruguay) EU tariff rate quota 'boneless meat of bovine animals, fresh or chilled; edible offal of bovine animals, thick skirt and thin skirt, fresh or chilled', tariff item numbers ex 0201 30 00 and ex 0206 10 95, maintaining the present in-quota rate of 20%. The new tariff rate quota shall be 4\u00a0076 tonnes; \n\n\n\u2013Add 1\u00a0875 tonnes into the EU tariff rate quota 'Meat of bovine animals, frozen \u2013 Edible offal of bovine animals, frozen', tariff item numbers 0202 and 0206.29.91, maintaining the present in-quota rate of 20%. The new tariff rate quota shall be 54\u00a0875 tonnes.\n\n\nThe relevant implementation measures are being prepared in parallel to this proposal.\n\n\n2016/0057 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nauthorising the signature of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), first subparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\n(1)On 15 July 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain other Members of the World Trade Organization under Article XXIV:6 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, in the course of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Croatia.\n\n\n(2)Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council.\n\n\n(3)These negotiations have been concluded and an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union was initialled on 18 December 2015.\n\n\n(4)This Agreement should be signed on behalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing of the Agreement between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union, subject to the conclusion of the said agreement.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is annexed to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThe Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\n\n\nThis Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR PROPOSALS HAVING A BUDGETARY IMPACT EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO THE REVENUE SIDE\n\n\n1.NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\n\nProposal for a Council Decision authorising the signature of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union\n\n\n2.BUDGET LINES:\n\n\n\n\nRevenue line:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter 12 \u2013 Customs duties and other duties\n\n\n3.FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n\n\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has no financial implications\n\n\nX Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue\n\n\n\u25fb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposal has a financial impact on assigned revenue \u2013 the effect is as follows:\n\n\n(EUR million to one decimal place\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue line\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nYear N\n\n\n\n\nYear N+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation following action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue line\n\n\n\n\n[n+1]\n\n\n\n\n[n+2]\n\n\n\n\n[n+3]\n\n\n\n\n[n+4]\n\n\n\n\n[n+5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n4.ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES\n\n\nGeneral anti-fraud measures associated with EU customs and quantitative quota administration will apply.\n\n\n5.OTHER REMARKS\n\n\n(method/formula used for calculation of revenues): Unit value of average similar trade imports for years 2012-2014 multiplied by the new tariff rate quotas volumes multiplied by the in-quota rate duty (20%) minus 25% deduction for collection costs.
