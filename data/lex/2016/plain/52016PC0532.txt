The reasons for the revision are twofold. \n\n\nThe revision of the Cedefop's Founding Regulation will align certain provisions of the existing Regulation governing Cedefop with the Common Approach on Decentralised Agencies. \n\n\nThe revision also offers the opportunity to update the objectives and tasks of Cedefop. Since its establishment in 1975, the Centre has adapted its activities to the overall societal, institutional and economic developments and emerging trends in European policies in the field of vocational education and training. This includes technological developments, as vocational occupations have been increasingly relying on the use of digital technologies. To respond to the evolution of the changing policy context, Cedefop's current activities go beyond vocational education and training and include work on qualifications, in particular the European Qualifications Framework, on skills analysis and forecasting, and the validation of non-formal and informal learning which should all be acknowledged. The new objectives and tasks will be adjusted to better reflect these developments. \n\n\n\nThe revision is not an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT).\n\n\nThe other two so-called tripartite Agencies of the European Union, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) will also undergo a revision of their respective Founding Regulations at the same time as Cedefop. \n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe Cedefop's Founding Regulation has been amended five times, in 1993, 1994, 1995, 2003 and 2004, mainly to take account of the EU enlargement or Treaty changes. However, these amendments have not significantly altered the fundamentals of the Agency. \n\n\n\nThis revision will define more sharply the role of Cedefop in supporting the shaping and implementation of vocational education and training, skills and qualifications policies. It will update the mandate of Cedefop as a centre for analysis, research and policy monitoring in these policy areas.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nAs Cedefop is at the interface of vocational education and training and the labour market, the revision takes into consideration the existing EU education and training policies\n1\n and skills policies\n2\n, on the one hand and employment policies on the other hand. It foresees complementarity with ongoing and planned research in this area carried out with EU funding, such as those financed under EU research funding programmes.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposed legal basis is article 166(4) with references to a vocational training policy which shall support and supplement the action of the Member States, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content and organisation of vocational training, article 165(4) with references to the contribution of the Union to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Members States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and article 149 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, referring to adoption of incentive measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States and to support their action in the field of employment.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThis proposal addresses certain aspects relating to how the EU agency operates internally and within the EU institutional framework. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal cannot be achieved by action at national level.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\n\n\nThe revision of the Founding Regulation should be considered in terms of its impact on administrative burden and budgetary costs so as to respect the proportionality principle. A\u00a0general principle which shall guide the revision is the necessity to keep the text of the Founding Regulation simple, clear and flexible, while relying on other forms of regulation (e.g. Rules of Procedure) for detailed provisions. The Founding Regulation should have a mid-term lifespan and ensure the necessary flexibility to allow for possible future developments in the organisation without a need for a further revision.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe instrument will be a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing and replacing Regulation (EEC) No 337/75. \n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nThe most recent external evaluation carried out by the Commission, finalised in 2013, recommended to amend Cedefop's Founding Regulation to reflect the Agency's work on skills and qualifications as one of its tasks and to integrate more clearly the work on policy reporting and common European tools and initiatives. \n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nManagement and labour at EU level have been consulted on both the possible direction of Union action and the content of the envisaged proposal. Both management and labour insisted in their opinion on maintaining the tripartite nature of the Agency and reflecting this in the objectives of the Agency and in the representation of all groups in its governance structures.\n\n\nThe Commission has kept other relevant stakeholders informed on broad decisions concerning this revision exercise and consulted them when necessary. \n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n\nGiven the limited revision of the founding act, an impact assessment was not carried out.\n\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNot applicable. The proposal is not linked to REFIT.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe budgetary implications in terms of human and financial resources, as presented in more detail in the Legislative Financial Statement, are in line with the Commission Communication (2013)519. \n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Common Approach, the proposal includes a provision on the evaluation of the Agency by the Commission. In addition to making this\u00a0proposal, the Commission envisages to carry out a cross-cutting evaluation to assess the Agency's objectives, mandates, governance and tasks, also in relation to other Agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills. \n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe revision of the Founding Regulation offers the opportunity to update Cedefop's objectives and tasks, to reflect the developments within the Agency and in the context in which it operates since the adoption of the Founding Regulation. It will allow the role of Cedefop to be reconfirmed in supporting the Commission in shaping and implementing vocational education and training, skills and qualifications policies. \n\n\nFurthermore, the revision creates the opportunity to provide for anti-fraud measures, conflict of interest policy, evaluation and review, and the establishment of a headquarters agreement. \n\n\nThe revision will also harmonise the provisions on programming and reporting with the requirements set by the revised Framework Financial Regulation. It will lead to modifying and aligning the appointment procedure of the Director (Executive Director) with the procedure provided for in the Common Approach. The role of appointing authority will be conferred to the Management Board of the Agency. The terminology for the management structure will be aligned with the Common Approach. Certain elements of the Founding Act are not being reviewed in the light of the Common Approach in the framework of this proposal, pending further evaluation. \n\n\nRegarding the appointment by the Council of the Management Board members representing the employers' and employees' organisations from each Member State, it is proposed that this is done on the basis of a list submitted by the EU social partners' organisations.\n\n\n\n2016/0257 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nestablishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 337/75\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 166(4), Article 165(4) and Article 149 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission;\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments;\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n3\n;\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n4\n;\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure;\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) was established by Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 of the Council\n5\n to assist the Commission in encouraging, at the Union level, the promotion and development of vocational training and of in-service training.\n\n\n(2)Since its establishment Cedefop has played an important role in supporting the development of a common vocational education and training policy. At the same time the concept and significance of vocational training has evolved under the influence of changing labour markets, technological developments, particularly in the digital area, and increasing labour mobility. Vocational training policies have evolved accordingly and encompass a variety of instruments and initiatives, some of which, namely related to skills and qualifications, including validation of learning, necessarily go beyond the traditional boundaries of vocational education and training. Therefore the character of Cedefop activities should be clearly spelled out and relevant terminology should be adjusted whilst staying within the remit of the Treaty provisions for vocational education and training.\n\n\n(3)The 2013 Cedefop evaluation report concluded that the Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should be amended to include the Agency\u2019s work on skills as one of its tasks and to integrate more clearly the work on policy reporting and common European tools and initiatives.\n\n\n(4)Implementation of a vocational education and training policy will require a focus on the interface between education and training and the world of work, making sure that the knowledge, skills and competences acquired support employability in changing labour markets and are relevant to the needs of citizens and society.\n\n\n(5)Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 has been amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be repealed in the interest of clarity.\n\n\n(6)The Agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012 to the extent possible. This proposal therefore does not prejudge any further amendments to the Founding Regulation of Cedefop which the Commission may wish to propose following further evaluation, as provided for in this act or on its own initiative. The Commission will evaluate the objectives, mandate, governance and tasks of all EU Agencies acting in the field of labour market, working conditions, vocational education and training and skills. \n\n\n(7)As the three so-called tripartite Agencies - Cedefop, the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound) and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) - address issues related to the labour market, working environment and vocational education and training and skills, close coordination among the three Agencies is required and the ways to enhance efficiency and synergies should be exploited. In addition, where relevant, the Agency should seek to engage in efficient cooperation with the European Commission's in-house research capacities.\n\n\n(8)The financial provisions and provisions for programming and reporting set out in Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should be aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No\u00a01271/2013\n6\n. \n\n\n(9)The provisions concerning Cedefop's staff set out in Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should be aligned with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (\u2018Staff Regulations\u2019) and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (\u2018CEOS\u2019), laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68\n7\n. \n\n\n(10)The Agency should take the necessary measures to ensure safe handling and processing of confidential information. Where required Cedefop should adopt security rules as set out in Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/443\n8\n and Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444.\n\n\n(11)It is necessary to provide for transitional budgetary provisions and transitional provisions on the Management Board and Cedefop staff to ensure continuation of activities of the Agency pending the entry into force of this Regulation.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nOBJECTIVE AND TASKS OF THE AGENCY\n\n\nArticle 1 \u2013 Establishment and objectives of the Agency\n\n\n1.The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, (\u2018the Agency\u2019) or 'Cedefop' is hereby established as a European Union Agency.\n\n\n2.The objective of the Agency shall be to assist the Commission in shaping and implementing vocational education and training and skills and qualifications policies.

This will be completed by the evaluation and review carried out by the Commission every five years. \n\n\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative \n\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term \n\n\n\nArticle 166(4) refers to a vocational training policy which shall support and supplement the action of the Member States, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content and organisation of vocational training. Article 165(4) refers to the contribution of the Union to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Members States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems.\n\n\nCedefop contributes to the Commission long-term policy work for/in: \n\n\n- Providing new knowledge and evidence in VET and skills and qualifications policies; \n\n\n- Monitoring policy trends and providing policy analysis of developments in VET and skills and qualifications policies; \n\n\n- Promoting better anticipation of future skills needs, including in the light of technological developments, and developing better matching between skills and labour market needs; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- In the short-term, contributing to implementation of a common vocational training policy and European tools in the field of education and following the EU Priorities for vocational education and training (2011-2020), as updated in the 2015 Joint Report under the ET 2020 Strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training and the newly launched new Skills Agenda for Europe. \n\n\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement\n\n\n\nCedefop\u2019s added value relies on its tripartite nature which enables it to develop the high quality comparative analyses and expertise in the field of vocational educaiton and training, skills and qualifications policies based on input coming from a variety of actors at national and European level. This rich expertise translates into concrete support for EU and national policy development and implementation through the following tasks:\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0analyse developments and provide comparative analyses of policies and practices across countries;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0analyse labour market trends in relation to skills and qualifications; \n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0analyse and contribute to developments related to the design and award of qualifications, their organisation into framework, and their function in the labour market with a view to enhance their transparency and recognition;\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0analyse and contribute to developments in the field of validation of non-formal and informal learning; \n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0undertake or commission studies and carry out research on relevant socio-economic developments and related policy issues;\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide forums for exchange of experiences and information between governments, social partners and stakeholders at national level, and support implementation of reforms, and policies at national level;\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0disseminate information as a contribution to policies and to raise awareness and understanding of the potential of vocational education and training in promoting and supporting the employability of people, productivity in companies and lifelong learning;\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0manage and make available tools, datasets and services for skills, occupations and qualifications to citizens, companies, policy makers, social partners and other stakeholders.\n\n\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\n\n\nThe Commission undertakes an external evaluation of Cedefop every five years. Previous evaluations confirmed that Cedefop makes a substantial contribution to the analytical and policy work of the Commission in the field of VET. The latest external evaluation of Cedefop was performed in 2013 (covering the period from 2007 until mid-2012)\n17\n. According to the evaluation report, the Centre has further moved towards focus on policy support aside from its more traditional open source function. Cedefop's Founding Regulation should be amended to include the Agency's work on skills and qualifications as one of its tasks and to integrate more clearly the work on policy reporting and common European tools and initiatives.\n\n\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\n\n\n\nCedefop cooperates with other EU Agencies working in related fields. Cooperation agreements exist with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU OSHA), the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) and the European Training Foundation (ETF).
