Article\u00a047(3) thereof provides that the agreement will remain in force until the new agreement enters into force, provided that the period of such extension does not exceed 12\u00a0months. The existing agreement will therefore expire no later than 31\u00a0December 2016.\n\n\nOn 19\u00a0November 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union in order to conclude a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives.\n\n\nDuring the United Nations Conference for the Negotiation of a Successor Agreement to the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2005, held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from 5 to 9\u00a0October 2015, the representatives of 24\u00a0Member States of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and two intergovernmental organisations drew up the text of the new agreement. \n\n\nThe text of the agreement, which was negotiated in consultation with the Working Party on Commodities (PROBA), duly reflects the negotiating directives issued by the Council.\n\n\n\nThe new agreement will be open for signature at the United Nations Headquarters in New York until 31\u00a0December 2016 inclusive. It should enter into force on 1\u00a0January 2017, provided that at least five of the Contracting Parties accounting for at least 80\u00a0% of the participation shares have signed it definitively or have ratified, accepted or approved it, or have acceded thereto. If, on 1\u00a0January 2017, the new agreement has not entered fully into force, it may be applied provisionally in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a031(2) and (3) of the new agreement.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nIn the light of the above, the Commission proposes:\n\n\nthat, in accordance with Articles\u00a0207(4) and 218(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Council authorise the Commission to sign the agreement on behalf of the European Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n\n\n3.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe new agreement will require the European Union to contribute to the budgets of the IOC. That contribution is budgeted under item\u00a005\u00a006\u00a001 of the EU budget (International agricultural agreements).\n\n\n2016/0196 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and the provisional application of the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2015 \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article\u00a0207(4), in conjunction with Article\u00a0218(5) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)On 19\u00a0November 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union in order to conclude a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives\n2\n.\n\n\n(2)The text of the new International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives was adopted on 9\u00a0October 2015 by the representatives of 24\u00a0Member States of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and two intergovernmental organisations during the United Nations Conference for the Negotiation of a Successor Agreement to the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2005.\n\n\n(3)The International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2005\n3\n, which was due to expire on 31\u00a0December 2014, was extended until 31\u00a0December 2015 and will remain in force, in accordance with Article\u00a047(3) thereof, until the new agreement enters into force, provided that the period of such extension does not exceed 12\u00a0months.
