Negotiations began in July 2012 and were successfully concluded on 30 July 2014. The Agreement was signed on 5 October 2016. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and New Zealand, are provisionally applied in accordance with Article 58 of the Agreement. \n\n\nThe European External Action Service and Commission services have been involved in the negotiating process. Member States have been consulted throughout the negotiating process at meetings of the relevant Council Working Parties. The European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations.\n\n\nThe High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for conclusion. This joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement on behalf of the EU.\n\n\nThe Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and New Zealand, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS and other legal aspects\n\n\n2.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aim and content of the agreement\n\n\nThe purpose of the Agreement is \u2018to establish a strengthened partnership between the Parties and to deepen and enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest, reflecting shared values and common principles, including through intensifying high-level dialogue\u2019 (Article 1 of the Agreement).\n\n\nThe content of the Agreement covers three pillars:\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in international fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU.\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cooperation on economic and trade matters, including facilitating trade and investment flows, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary issues, technical barriers to trade, government procurement and intellectual property;\n\n\n\u2013\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of research and innovation, education and culture, migration, counter terrorism, the fight against organised crime and cybercrime and judicial cooperation.\n\n\n2.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The legal basis for the proposed decision\n\n\nThe choice of legal basis for the conclusion of an agreement must rest on objective factors amenable to judicial review, which include the aim and content of the measure.\n\n\nWith regard to a measure that simultaneously pursues a number of objectives, or that has several components, which are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other, the Court of Justice has held that, where various provisions of the Treaty are therefore applicable, such a measure will have to be founded, exceptionally, on the various corresponding legal bases, unless the procedure laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other\n2\n.\n\n\nThe Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Common Commercial Policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. \n\n\nArticle 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. \n\n\n\n\nThe Common Foreign and Security Policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part,  and New Zealand, of the other part. \n\n\nIn light of the above, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. No additional provisions are required as legal basis\n3\n. \n\n\n2.3. The necessity of the proposed decision\n\n\nArticle 216 of the TFEU provides that the Union may conclude an agreement with one or more third countries where the Treaties so provide or where the conclusion of an agreement is necessary in order to achieve, within the framework of the Union\u2019s policies, one of the objectives referred to in the Treaties, or where is provided for in a legally binding Union act or where is likely to affect common rules or alter their scope.\n\n\nThe Treaties provide for the conclusion of agreements such as the Agreement, namely in Articles 37 TEU, 207 TFEU and 212(1) TFEU.\n\n\n2.4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other legal aspects\n\n\nThe Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. \n\n\nThe Agreement includes as well a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements.\n\n\nOnce into force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU\u2019s relations with New Zealand. \n\n\n2016/0366 (NLE)\n\n\nJoint Proposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement on Relations and

European Union, in particular Article 37 thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 and Article 212(1), read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) thereof, \n\n\nHaving regard to the joint proposal of the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with the Council Decision No 2016/1970/EU, the Partnership Agreement on

a provisional basis in accordance with Article 58 of the Agreement, pending its conclusion at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n(2)The objective of the Agreement is to strengthen the cooperation across a wide

the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption. \n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The
