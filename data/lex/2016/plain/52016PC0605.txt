Over the last 30 years, the number of general financial rules contained in the Financial Regulation has increased sharply\n2\n. In addition, a number of sectoral financial rules have emerged: the rules for participation to the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation\n3\n, the Common Provisions to the European Structural and Investment Funds\n4\n and the Common Implementing Rules for the External Action\n5\n. \n\n\nUsers of EU funds have repeatedly complained about the proliferation of rules both at general and at sectoral level, their heterogeneity and their complexity due to the fact that they follow the architecture of the programme and multiple layers of controls. In addition, the complexity of the financial set of rules has slowed down implementation of the EU funds, making it costly and prone to errors. \n\n\nA first step towards more coherent and simpler financial rules was achieved in 2012: the Commission tabled proposals for the programmes covered by the MFF 2014-2020 which reduced the number of programmes and instruments, grouped them under a single framework with common rules, simplified procedures for application and declaration of costs by final beneficiaries, facilitated the deployment of innovative financial instruments, enabled EU Trust-Funds and improved the cost-efficiency of controls. Recent revisions have aligned the Financial Regulation on the results of the negotiation to the MFF 2014-2020 (2013 revision) as well as to the new Procurement Directive (2015 revision).\n\n\nHowever, there is room for further simplification. This is confirmed by the experience gained since 2014 and by the work of the High Level Group of Independent Experts on Monitoring Simplification for Beneficiaries of the European Structural and Investment Funds\n6\n. The public consultation on the revision of the Financial Regulation\n7\n also shows stakeholders\u2019 clear expectations in the area.\n\n\nEfforts must therefore continue in order to remove bottlenecks,\u00a0ensure synergies and complementarities between ESI Funds and the other EU funds and\u00a0improve efficiency of delivery and control requirements. Simpler and more flexible financial rules will contribute to optimising spending and impact of the MFF 2014-2020 and constitute as such one of the key elements of the Commission's initiative for a Budget Focused on Results (BFOR) which aims at making sure that resources are allocated to priorities and that every action delivers maximum performance and added value\n8\n. In addition, this will reduce the costs related to implementation of EU rules as well the number of errors.\n\n\nSimpler and more flexible EU financial rules are key in enhancing EU budget\u2019s ability to adapt to changing circumstances and to respond to unexpected developments. \n\n\nThe present legislative proposal forms an integral part of the mid-term review/revision of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020\n9\n. It contributes to two of its main objectives: simplification and flexibility.\n\n\nThe Commission therefore proposes in a single act an ambitious revision of the general financial rules accompanied by corresponding changes to the sectorial financial rules set out in 15 legislative acts concerning multiannual programmes. The inclusion of sectoral changes in the same legislative proposal aims at ensuring a coherent negotiation process as well as at facilitating a speedy adoption by the legislator. The focus is put on the following key areas: \n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simplification for recipients of EU funds: many measures aim at simplifying life for recipients of EU funds. They relate to grants (removal of the non-cumulative award check for low-value grants and of the non-profit principle; simpler rules for \"contribution in kind\" valuation; recognition of volunteer work; grant awards without calls for proposal under specific conditions) and simplified forms of grants (Title VIII). \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From multiple layers of controls to cross reliance on audit, assessment or authorisation, and harmonisation of reporting requirements: the aim of these measures is to encourage reliance as far as possible on one single audit, assessment or authorisation (conformity to State aids for instance), when the audit, assessment or authorisation\u00a0meets the necessary conditions to be taken into account in the EU system. More generally, rules for implementing partners (international organisations, EIB/EIF, national promotional banks, national agencies, NGOs) will be simplified by relying increasingly on their procedures and policies once assessed positively. Financial framework partnership agreements concluded with long term partners will allow progressing in the harmonisation of audit, reporting and other administrative requirements among donors (Title V Articles 122, 123 and 126).\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allowing the application of only one set of rules to hybrid actions or in the case of combination of measures or instruments: the proposal aims at achieving further simplification for the partners of the EU by a number of measures to avoid the parallel application of different rules and procedures, notably through facilitating the combination of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) funding with financial instruments and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (Title V).\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More effective use of financial instruments: optimise use of reflows, ensuring a level playing field among key EU implementing partners, reducing burdensome requirements related to publication of individual data of final recipients or to the exclusion criteria (Title X).\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More flexible budget management: the proposal sets out several ways for more budgetary flexibility, in order to allow the Union to respond to unforeseen challenges and new tasks more effectively and to achieve swifter crisis management - among which the creation of a \"flexibility cushion\" for unforeseen needs and new crises in the external actions geographic instruments budget, a more efficient activation of the solidarity and globalization adjustment funds,\u00a0and the extension of Trust-Funds to internal policies (Articles 14 and 227),\u00a0the creation of a EU crisis reserve with the reuse of decommitted appropriations, and for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the possibility that financial operations other than financial instruments generate a contingent liability for the Union exceeding the financial assets provided to cover the financial liability of the Union (Article 203) and the creation of a common provisioning fund holding the resources provisioned for financial operations (Article 205).\u00a0Recent initiatives (such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) or the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD)), have indeed shown the need to fully use the leverage of the EU budget by creating non-provisioned contingent liabilities. Title X sets the framework to authorise, manage and control these financial risks.\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Focus on results and streamlining of reporting: a stronger focus on results through lump sums, prizes, payment based on output and results rather than on reimbursement of costs, payment against conditions to be fulfilled (Article 121, Title XIII). This should contribute to further reducing the costs of implementing EU funds as well as the number of errors. On the reporting side, reports are regrouped around the draft budget and the integrated financial reporting package, in order to increase efficiency and transparency both towards the general public and the budgetary authority (Articles 39 and 239-245).\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simpler and leaner EU administration: facilitating agreements or delegations between Institutions or bodies in order to pool the implementation of administrative appropriations in European Offices or within Executive Agencies (Articles 57, 58, 64, 65 and 68); merging consultative panels competent for financial irregularities (Article 73 (6)) with the EDES panel (Article 139) and moving from annual to multiannual financing decisions (Article 108).\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Providing possibility for citizen engagement: the proposal provides a possibility for citizens to be consulted on the implementation of the Union budget by the Commission, Member States and any other entity implementing the Union budget (\u0410rticle 54).\n\n\n\n\nIn simplifying and making EU financial rules more flexible, the present proposal paves the way for the preparation of the next generation of spending programmes (post-2020).\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing provisions on the policy area\n\n\nIn designing simpler and more flexible EU financial rules the Commission has made sure that it does not weaken sound financial management which remains a key objective. Quite to the contrary, the present proposal also strengthens rules on tax avoidance to be respected by EU implementing partners and clarifies that the duty to avoid conflicts of interest fully applies to all modes of implementation of EU funds (including at the level of Member States). It also consolidates the systems in place to protect EU budget against fraud and financial irregularities (extending the authorising officer's competence to take action with regard to the Early Detection and Exclusion System in indirect implementation).The simplification of EU financial rules will also contribute to reduce the costs and time needed to implement EU funds as well as the number of errors. It should also increase the impact of the policies and their results on the ground.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) for the part relating to the revision the Financial Regulation and on the sectoral legal basis for the legislative acts modified by the second part.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe adoption of EU general financial rules and of the modifications proposed to the sectoral legislative acts falls under the exclusive competence of the EU.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThis proposal focused on simplification and does not contain rules which would not be necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. In particular, the modifications to the sectorial legislative acts proposed in its omnibus part are limited to those necessary to allow the simplifications proposed in the Financial Regulation to deploy their full effect on the ground.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nA public consultation on the revision of the Financial Regulation was carried out in April/May 2016. A total of 111 contributions were received from a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n\nThe replies show overall support for the simplification (65%) and flexibility (79%) measures proposed. With respect to simplifying EU grant rules, stakeholders continue to prefer the reimbursement of actual costs but do not oppose simplified reimbursement through unit costs, lump sums or flat rates or reimbursement on the basis of pre-defined results as long as those are not compulsory. These concerns are reflected in the proposal. In particular, simplified reimbursement of costs will remain only an additional option to be used by the authorising officer with regards to the nature of the supported actions and recipients. Implementing partners of the EU (national development agencies, international organizations, EIB/EIF, NGOs) request the Commission to rely more on their rules and policies once positively assessed. They complain about multiple prior assessments of their systems or procedures or repeated audits of the same activities by the EU and other donors, when cross-reliance on such assessments and audits could be possible. They also criticize different reporting requirements among donors\n10\n.\n\n\nAn Awareness Raising Event took place on 6 April 2016 in Brussels to allow stakeholders to voice their concerns/suggestions about the Financial Regulation. Their comments made are in line with the replies to the public consultation.\n\n\nThe measures contained in this proposal address these concerns.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nNo impact assessment for this revision of the Financial Regulation has been carried out. The Financial Regulation as such has a limited economic, environmental or social impact (it provides the general rules for the implementation of the spending programmes, but the concrete economic or social impact incurs when making policy choices implementing the sectorial programmes). Changes proposed to the sectoral legislative acts are merely consequential to the simplifications proposed in the Financial Regulation\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nWhile the revision of the Financial Regulation and the corresponding changes to the sectoral legislative acts do not fall under the Regulatory Fitness Programme, they are in line with \u2013 and contribute significantly to \u2013 the Better Regulation agenda: indeed, this proposal reduces the overall number of general financial rules applicable to the EU budget by some 25% and regroups them in a single rule book which will replace both the Financial Regulation and its Rules of Application: \n\n\n\n\n\u00b7Key provisions of the Rules of Application are moved into the Financial Regulation, while less important elements will be integrated if needed and on a case by case basis in Commission\u2019s internal rules or in guidelines made public by the Commission.\n\n\n\u00b7The detailed procurement rules applicable to EU institutions and bodies are consolidated in an annex of the revised Financial Regulation, which could be modified by delegated act.\n\n\n\u00b7Provisions of Part Two of the Financial Regulation relating to special provisions applicable to the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, to Research, external action and to other specific EU funds are inserted in the relevant parts of the Financial Regulation unless they are no longer relevant.\n\n\nThe proposal to revise the Financial Regulation also stresses commonalities and reduces specificities to the minimum so as to make the rules easier to apply for the users: emphasis is put on common rules applicable to all methods of implementation (direct, indirect and shared) as well as for all legal instruments by regrouping them in dedicated chapters. Provisions on European offices, executive agencies, decentralised agencies and public-private partnership bodies currently spread over the Financial Regulation are pulled into the same chapter. Rules on EU trust funds, budget support and experts (including research experts) are regrouped under a new title \u201cOther budget implementation instruments\u201d.\n\n\nThe proposal also strongly focuses on achieving substantive simplification of the current EU financial rules. As mentioned in point 1 above, it contains numerous elements reducing the administrative burden for applicants and recipients of EU funds.\n\n\nThe proposal does not exempt micro-enterprises from its scope. Such enterprises can be beneficiaries of EU funds and must therefore be subject to the rules. However, in certain areas, it reduces the costs for businesses which are often SMEs (replacing in the area of financial instruments the publication of individual data of beneficiaries by aggregate statistics) and more generally the numerous simplification measures should benefit to all enterprises\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nThe proposal is in line with the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposal does not have budgetary implications.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n1. Simplification for recipients of EU funds\n\n\n1.1. Simplify grant use, lump sums and cost calculations\n\n\nMany measures aim at simplifying life for recipients of EU funds. They relate to the content of grant applications, the value of contributions in kind, recognition of volunteers work, the conditions for award of grants without a call for proposals to Member States under specific conditions, the principle of no profit, the principles of non-cumulative award and the phasing out of grant decisions. Other measures demonstrate the move towards a simpler and leaner administration.\n\n\n1.1.1. General financial rules\n\n\nThe proposal promotes the use of simplified forms of grants, open to all EU funded programmes where the nature of the actions and underlying expenditure allow such approach (e.g. training and mobility actions, travel costs, etc.). This would alleviate the administrative burden, reinforce certainty on the reimbursed amount to beneficiaries and stimulate the up-take of simplified forms of grants and their combinations (Article 175).\n\n\nUse of expert judgment: the implementation of simplified forms of grants has been hampered by the lack of data needed to establish a reasonable approximation of the actual costs. This is often due to the innovative nature of the actions concerned or to the fact that actions are implemented only in certain countries and no data are available for other countries. In order to bridge this gap, it is proposed to make use of expert judgement in complement of or as an alternative to the statistical or historical data, depending on the nature of the action (Article 175).\n\n\nSimplifying the authorisation of lump sums, unit costs and flat rates: to replace the lengthy and burdensome process of authorisation (College decision for amounts higher 60.000 EUR per grant) by enabling the responsible authorising officer to adopt decisions authorising simplified forms. This level is more appropriate given the highly technical content (calculation methodologies, overviews of data, etc.) of the decision (Article 175).\n\n\nSimplifying and clarifying the content of grant applications including the accompanying supporting documents: no obligation to provide information demonstrating the applicants' financial and operational capacity if those are not verified (e.g. for public bodies); aligning the obligation to provide an audit report with the applicable EU and national law in the area of accounting (Article 189).\n\n\nSimplification of the principle of non\u2013cumulative award: grants like scholarships to natural persons, direct support to refugees, unemployed and other persons in most need will be exempted from this rule since traditionally their value is quite low (Article 185). \n\n\n\n\nRemoving the no profit principle: the practical importance of the no-profit principle has diminished substantially: revenue-generating projects are in principle supported throughfinancial instruments. For projects that are in principle not revenue-generating, the no profit principle creates disincentives: beneficiaries are not encouraged to ensure that their projects become sustainable or profitable. This has in turn a negative impact on the economy.\n\n\nSimplifying the determination of the value of contributions in kind: these contributions do not constitute eligible costs. Therefore, their exact value is irrelevant. However, they may continue to be accepted as part of the co-financing. Any value reasonably established by the authorising officer at the time of acceptance of the estimated budget can demonstrate that there are other sources of financing of the action, apart from the EU grant, and that the co-financing principle is complied with (Article 184). \n\n\nRecognition of volunteer work: In order to facilitate the participation of small organisations in the implementation of the EU policies in an environment of limited availability of resources, it is necessary to recognise the value of the work provided by volunteers as eligible costs. As a result, such organisations may rely to a greater extent on volunteers' work for sake of providing co-financing to the action (Articles 175, 180 and 184 ).\n\n\nSimplifying and harmonising the conditions for award of grants without a call for proposals: it is proposed to extend the possibility to award direct grants to entities mandated by the Member States to the cases of a de facto or de jure monopoly or where direct beneficiaries have been chosen for their technical competencies, high degree of specialisation or administrative powers. In addition, the authorising officer would be authorised to combine the evaluation report and the award decision in one document. This will alleviate the administrative burden and will speed up the award of direct grants (Article 188). \n\n\nSimpler record-keeping: the record-keeping period shall be a uniform five years (three years if the funding is of an amount lower than or equal to \u20ac 60.000), also for indirect implementation (Article 128).\n\n\nNotional approach for grants: where grants are expressed only as an absolute value (not as a percentage of eligible costs), the eligibility of costs shall be verified at the latest at the time of the payment of the balance (Article 180). For this verification, a simplified (\"notional\") approach can be used (Article 150). Phasing out of grant decisions: it is proposed to phase out grant agreement and use predominantly grant agreements, subject to a review in the progress made towards e-grants at the end of the current MFF (Article 277).\u00a0\n\n\n1.1.2. Sectoral rules\n\n\nThe improvements for using simplified cost options in the Financial Regulation are complemented by changes proposed for sectorial legislation extending the use of simplified cost options in \n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No. 1303/2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, \n\n\n\u00b7European Social Fund Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013,\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 on the Fund for European Aid for the most deprived.\n\n\n2. From multiple layers of controls to cross reliance on audit, assessment or authorisation, and harmonised reporting requirements\n\n\nThe aim of these measures is to encourage reliance as far as possible on one single audit, assessment or authorisation (conformity to State aids for instance), when they meet the necessary conditions to be taken into account in the EU system. In order to avoid multiple layers of controls, the Commission shall promote the recognition of internationally accepted standards or international best practices in that area, as well as common reporting requirements among donors:\n\n\n\u00b7Cross-reliance on ex-ante assessments and checks of recipients already conducted by other entities (donors) with regard to conditions equivalent to the EU ones (Article 122). \n\n\n\u00b7Cross-reliance on audits conducted in accordance with internationally accepted standards is also encouraged always with a view of avoiding multi-audits of the same persons/entities for the same activities. This would allow the Commission to rely on independent audits conducted on the use of the EU funds by international partners (UN, World Bank etc.) or Member States (Article 123).\n\n\n\u00b7Harmonisation of its reporting requirements with those of other donors: the Commission shall promote the adoption of common reporting requirements through the financial framework partnership agreements concluded with its main international partners (Article 126).\n\n\n\u00b7Allowing the Commission to rely possible on the systems and procedures of the partners of the EU under indirect implementation if they have\u00a0been positively assessed (Article 149) and impose remedies if certain rules/procedures are not sufficient to protect the EU financial interests;\u00a0where the Commission requires the use of its own or specific procedures no assessment will be carried out. In all cases the level of supervision/control exercised should be adapted on the basis of the principle of proportionality.\n\n\n\u00b7Enhancing Financial framework partnership agreements (Article 126): such agreements\u00a0established with trusted partners for long term cooperation will in the future cover all the actions in direct and indirect implementation and reflect the extent to which the Commission may rely on the systems and procedures positively assessed as well as the application of a single set of rules for all legal instruments. Long term partnership agreements will offer a flexible framework for cross-reliance on assessments and audits where possible as well as for harmonising audit, reporting and other administrative requirements among donors.\n\n\n3. Allowing the application of only one set of rules to hybrid actions or in the case of combination of measures or instruments\n\n\nThe proposal aims at achieving further simplification for the partners of the EU under indirect implementation to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\n\n\n3.1. General financial rules\n\n\n\u00b7The application to an implementation partner of the Commission of only one set of rules instead of two would be allowed in certain cases \u2013 regardless of the nature of the action and of the role of the partner as a manager of funds or a \"do-er\". Where hybrid actions combine indirect and direct implementation and currently imply two sets of rules, accessory elements that are currently submitted to direct implementation rules (very often the case for technical assistance) would follow the rules of the main elements of the action (e.g. the running of a financial instrument with guarantees or else (Article 208(2)).\n\n\n\u00b7In order to facilitate combinations between grants and financial instruments, a single set of rules (those of the financial instruments) shall apply to grants complementary to financial instruments if combined in a single action (Article 208(2));\n\n\n\u00b7The period for record-keeping for grants and financial instruments shall be aligned to five years (three years for amounts up to \u20ac 60.000 Article 128).\n\n\n3.2. Sectoral rules\n\n\n\u00b7Limiting state aid verifications\u00a0to the state aid consistency check for the EU-level financial instruments foreseen under the Financial Regulation when ESI funds contribute to EU- level financial instruments (no double verification): Member States contributions to EU-level financial instruments which are made without any additional conditions as to the use of the contributions other than in relation to the geographic area\u00a0for the use of the contribution shall not require another separate state aid verification as the financial instrument is already consistent with state aid rules based on the Financial regulation. This will be clarified through appropriate guidance.\n\n\n\u00b7Extension of SME Initiative(SMEI), allowing for the use of the SME Initiative beyond 2016, making it possible for Member States to commit funding to the SMEI up to 2020.\n\n\n\u00b7Extension and clarifications of CPR provisions on combinations between financial instruments and grants in order to facilitate their combined use.\n\n\n\u00b7Introducing a new possibility to combine ESI\u00a0Funds/EFSI and a new structure for combining ESI Funds with EIB and EIF: ESI\u00a0Funds programmes should be able to contribute to financial instruments combined with EIB financing under EFSI.\n\n\n4. More effective use of financial instruments\n\n\n4.1. General financial rules\n\n\nExperience with financial instruments and in particular input from key implementation partners (EIB/EIF) point at the following possibilities to improve further their management and effectiveness:\n\n\n\u00b7All reflows (revenues + repayments) generated by a financial instrument should be used for the same instrument to pursue efficiency gains; full transparency is guaranteed through reporting (Article 202(2));\n\n\n\u00b7EIB /EIF would retain their status as key EU partners in implementation but direct negotiations should be authorised between the Commission and a greater number of potential entities, to ensure a level-playing field amongst them (Article 149);\n\n\n\u00b7Given the impossibility to impose the full respect of EU rules where the EU participates in a financial instrument as minority shareholder of a fund, it is proposed to allow a proportionate application of EU rules in such cases instead (Article 208(4));\n\n\n\u00b7The publication of individual data of final recipients would be replaced with statistical data, aggregated per relevant criteria proposed for final beneficiaries receiving EU support of less than \u20ac 500.000 (policy area, type of support, type of beneficiary, geographical distribution (Article 36(5)).\n\n\n\u00b7Final beneficiaries and intermediaries shall not be required to provide a declaration of honour confirming that they are not in one of the exclusion situations where the implementing partner has an exclusion policy considered equivalent to that of the EU (Article 131).\n\n\n\u00b7Two new sections are proposed to regulate other instruments bearing a financial risk, such as budgetary guarantees and financial assistance to Member Stets or third countries (Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter 2 of Title X).\n\n\n\u00b7Rules to authorise, manage and control non-provisioned contingent liabilities have been introduced (Articles 203 to 206).\n\n\n4.2. Sectoral rules\n\n\n\n\nTo further optimise management and use of financial instruments in shared implementation, changes to the Common Provisions Regulation 1303/2013 (CPR) are proposed:\n\n\n\u00b7Clarifying the possibility for Member State Management Authorities to directly award a contract, including technical assistance, to the EIB/EIF, other International Financial Institutions as well as National Promotional Banks.\n\n\n\u00b7Treasury management: where the temporary investment of ESI Fund money paid into a Financial Instrument before the investments in final recipients generates negative interests, their payment from resources paid back when at least one cycle of investments has been carried out shall be authorised.\n\n\n\u00b7Certain EAFRD measure specific rules shall be removed that have hindered the programming of financial instruments in Rural Development and their implementation by the fund managers, to increase the leverage effect of the EAFRD funding through a higher use of financial instruments.\n\n\n5. More flexible budget management\n\n\n5.1. General financial rules\n\n\nThe proposal sets out several ways for more budgetary flexibility, in order to allow the Union to respond to unforeseen challenges and new tasks more effectively:\n\n\n\u00b7Allow for the establishment of EU trust funds also for emergency, post-emergency or thematic actions within the EU (and not only for third countries). Recent events in the European Union show the need for increased flexibility for funding within the EU. As the boundaries between external and internal policies are increasingly blurred, this would also provide a tool for replying to challenges crossing the borders (Article 227).\n\n\n\u00b7Increase the \"negative reserve\" from EUR 200 million to EUR\u00a0400\u00a0million and thus also follow up to a Council request to limit the number of Draft Amending Budgets linked to payments (Article 48).\n\n\n\u00b7Create a flexibility cushion for external action via the carry-over of non-allocated funds for the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPAII) , the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) to year N+1 in the limit of 10% of the initial appropriations of each instrument (Article 12). \n\n\n\u00b7Foresee more flexibility for crisis and emergency situations and humanitarian aid in grants: Administrative procedures are simplified to enable quick and efficient response (e.g. retroactive eligibility before the submission of the application to be decided by the authorising officer responsible, Article 186). \n\n\n\u00b7Use of imprest accounts in the Union Delegations\u00a0would be allowed for payment of limited amounts by budgetary procedures. Non-statutory staff in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations could administrate such accounts and sign legal commitments executed from them up to EUR 2\u00a0500 (Article 109).\n\n\n\u00b7Increase flexibility for autonomous transfers by the Commission by enlarging the current scope, i.e. by also allowing transfers of operational expenditure between different titles if they are covered by the same basic act, including support chapters, and from the administrative support lines to the corresponding operational lines (Article 28).\n\n\n\u00b7Simpler mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund EUSF via an autonomous transfer from the reserve to the budget line once the decision of mobilisation has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council (Article 28).\n\n\n\u00b7Simpler mobilisation of the European Globalisation Fund EGF via automatic approval of transfers from the reserve to the budget line upon adoption by the Budgetary Authority on the mobilisation of the Fund (Article 30).\n\n\n\u00b7Clarify that amounts corresponding to commitment appropriations for the Emergency Aid Reserve and the EU Solidarity Fund EUSF are carried over automatically (Article 12).\n\n\n\u00b7Remove the obligation to first use the appropriations authorised for the current financial year until they are exhausted before using appropriations carried over.\n\n\n\u00b7Allow use of internal assigned revenue for another purpose than the one for which it is assigned in case there are no identified needs allowing such revenue to be used for the same purpose (Article 30(3)).\n\n\n\u00b7Allow the institutions and bodies to accept corporate in kind sponsoring for specific events or activities (i.e. not receptions or other exclusively social events). For that provision to be implemented, each institution would first authorise the principle of acceptance of sponsoring in kind and set out specific guidelines covering notably ethical aspects (Article 24).\n\n\n\u00b7Foresee that, as part of the approval procedure of the sale of buildings or land, the Budget Authority may accept, on a case by case basis that the proceed of that sale is considered assigned revenue, in order to improve facility management by the Commission and facilitate the purchase of other buildings (Article 20(3)(g)).\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7Create a EU crisis reserve with the reuse of decommitted appropriations.\n\n\n\u00b7For the next Multiannual Financial Framework, create the possibility that financial operations other than financial instruments generate a contingent liability for the Union exceeding the financial assets provided to cover the financial liability of the Union (Article 203) and a common provisioning fund holding the resources provisioned for financial operations (Article 205).\n\n\n5.2 Sectoral rules\n\n\n\u00b7The possibility for the Member States to help also in case of man-made catastrophes like the refugee crisis and to use available funds immediately (without having to wait for the submission of a programme amendment) is introduced in Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. Also, a specific investment priority for migrants and refugees is added to simplify the programming of measures to help migrants and refugees under the European Regional Development Fund Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013.\n\n\n\u00b7European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI-Regulation No 1296/2013): in order to increase the adjustment capacity of EaSI to crisis and changing political priorities, flexibility is needed concerning the indicative spending levels foreseen for each of the three axis of the program and for each of the thematic priorities within these.\u00a0In addition, the derogation allowing use of the European Globalisation Fund for the benefit of young people not in employment, education or training should be maintained given the current economic context.\n\n\n\u00b7Connecting Europe Facility Regulation Nr 1316/2013: Given the success of the Multi-Annual Work Programmes, it is necessary to increase the flexibility so that 95% can be spent on multi-annual programmes and further projects supported with most value added for the Trans European Transport Network (Core Network Corridors, cross border projects and projects on the other sections of the Core Network).\n\n\n\u00b7Management of expenditure for the food chain, animal health and animal welfare (Regulation (EU) No 652/2014): given the positive experience with the application of this rule and the substantial reduction of the related workload on the part of the beneficiaries and of Commission services, it is proposed to extend the possibility to use budgetary commitments divided into annual instalments.\n\n\n\u00b7In Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 on support for rural development, targeting mutual funds helping farmers in case of sharp drops in income in specific sectors shall be allowed, and subsidisation of the initial capital stock of such funds.\n\n\n6. Focus on results and streamlining reporting\n\n\nThe proposal includes a series of measures aimed at focusing better the budget on results, establishing a clear performance framework, enhancing transparency and streamlining reporting.\n\n\n6.1 Focus on results\n\n\nA number of proposals open to all policy areas and focusing on results rather than on what has been actually spent. They demonstrate the Commission's commitment to provide the necessary conditions for a result-oriented approach:\n\n\n\u00b7Allowing for payments based on conditions fulfilled, output or performance in all management modes (e.g. payments per resettled refugee in the AMIF funds or the support for young farmer setting up, Article 121). In such cases, the financing of projects is delinked from the reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients of EU funds: it depends directly on the results delivered on the ground. What matters is either the fulfilment of certain conditions as set out ex ante in the basic act or Commission Decisions and/or the achievement of results measured through performance indicators (ex-post). Such system enhances ownership/commitment by the recipients of funds to achieve results. They allow a significant reduction of the administrative burden and of the cost of controls. Controls can indeed be limited to verifying whether the conditions/agreed results have been met and the administrative burden. This in turn limits the risk of legality and regularity errors. It has been advocated by the European Court of Auditors under the name \u201centitlements\u201d.\n\n\n\u00b7Facilitating \"Prizes\"(Title IX): the title on \u201cPrizes\u201d is shortened and simplified; the obligation to announce prizes of a value of EUR 1 million or more in the statements accompanying the draft budget is replaced by prior information of the European Parliament and an explicit announcement of such prizes in the financing decision. \n\n\n\u00b7Single lump sum (Article 176): a \"single lump sum\" could in the future cover all eligible costs of the action. Checks and controls will focus exclusively on the outputs/deliverables. The single lump sum is based on the assessment of the budget proposed by the grant applicant in view of the principles of efficiency, economy and effectiveness including by reference to relevant data and/or expert judgment. \n\n\n\u00b7Priority to simplified forms of grants where payment is triggered by output and results (Article 175): an input based approach should only be considered if the output based approach is impossible or not appropriate. Currently simplified forms are predominantly used to cover the value of inputs (e.g. number of man-days, number of travels, number of days spent in mission, etc.). The possibility to pay simplified forms against the delivery of concrete outputs (e.g. a conference delivered, a festival organized, a prototype built, etc.) is similarly encouraged. \n\n\n\u00b7Clarifying the scope of controls of simplified forms of grants and of their consequences if outputs are not delivered (Article 177): controls concentrate on the fulfilment of the conditions triggering the payment (e.g. whether a supported European movie was produced with the needed quality and distributed with the needed quantity, whether an Erasmus student actually studied abroad, etc.). No reporting on the costs actually incurred by the beneficiary is required. If the conditions triggering the payment were not fulfilled or if the agreed activities were implemented poorly, partially or late, the Commission shall reduce the amount of the grant proportionately to the failure and to recover amounts unduly spent.\n\n\n6.2 A clear performance framework\n\n\nTo complement the stronger focus on results, a clear performance framework is proposed:\n\n\n\u00b7Linking performance, objective-setting, indicators, results and the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of appropriations (Article 31).\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7Providing for performance based fees to remunerate organisations for managing EU funds (Article 150);\n\n\n\u00b7Considering programme statements as the main source of programme performance information (Article 39);\n\n\n\u00b7Merging of the \"Synthesis\" and \"Article 318 TFEU\" reports in one \u201cAnnual Management and Performance Report for the EU Budget\u201d to deliver annually a single performance report on the EU budget (as from the 2015 financial year, Article 239).\n\n\n\u00b7Aligning the terminology on evaluation to the provisions of the 2016 Inter Institutional Agreement on better law making and creating a link between ex-ante evaluations under the Financial Regulation and Impact Assessments (Article 32). \n\n\n6.3 Streamlining reporting \n\n\n6.3.1. General financial rules\n\n\nSuccessive revisions of the Financial Regulation have significantly increased the number of reports and information requested including on accounts: reporting is now provided through scattered documents, delivered along a differed calendar. In order to increasing efficiency and transparency not only towards the budgetary authority but also towards the general public, without however affecting the level of information currently provided, it is proposed:\n\n\n\u00b7To gather reporting obligations around two key moments: reports accompanying\n\n\n\u00b7the draft budget; all reporting on EU-level financial instruments would be merged into a single document accompanying the draft budget (Article 39).\n\n\n\u00b7and those submitted as part of the discharge process: \"the integrated financial reporting package\u201d \u2013 a separate Chapter would deal with budgetary and other financial reporting (Articles 239-245).\n\n\n\u00b7To make the new Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU Budget, resulting from the merge as from the 2015 financial year, of the Synthesis and of the Article 318 TFEU report is a key element of the integrated reporting package\u00a0(Article 239).\n\n\n\u00b7To specify that the external audit by the Court of Auditors takes account of the multiannual character of programmes\u00a0(Article 247(1)).\n\n\n6.3.2. Reporting: \n\n\n\u00b7Reporting obligations are streamlined by eliminating certain redundancies (CPR).\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A simpler and leaner EU administration\n\n\n7.1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General financial rules\n\n\nA series of simplification measures aims at allowing the EU institutions to work more efficiently, notably by implementing jointly administrative appropriations to achieve economies of scale:\n\n\n\u00b7Providing an explicit legal basis for Service Level Agreements (SLA) between departments of the EU institutions, EU bodies and European offices and extending to all institutions the possibility to conclude service-level agreements facilitating the implementation of administrative appropriations. In the future it will also be possible to delegate implementation of administrative appropriations to an office set up by the Commission.\n\n\n\u00b7Clarifying the distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory tasks of offices (Articles 64 and 65): obligatory tasks must be covered by appropriations entered in the section of the budget relating to the office. Non-obligatory tasks which an office agrees voluntarily to conduct at the request of another institution or body are covered from the budget of the respective institution or body.\n\n\n\u00b7Allowing multiannual financing decisions and reducing the amount of obligatory elements in a financing decision (Article 108). In addition, it is proposed that the financing decision constitutes at the same time the annual or the multi annual work programme. These changes would speed up the implementation of the budget in years 2 and following of a programme.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7Clarifying the rules on Executive Agencies (Article 68): they shall receive an annual contribution; their director acts as authorising officer by delegation when implementing operational appropriations; the delegation of an operational programme to an executive agency may include pilot projects and preparatory actions as well as the implementation of administrative expenditure in order to achieve synergies and economies of scale.\n\n\n\u00b7Merging the Article 139 of the Financial Regulation Panel with the Financial Irregularity Panel (Article 90): for efficiency reasons, the Financial Regulation Panel recommending exclusion and financial penalties on economic operators would also become competent for financial irregularities by EU staff members, while the Disciplinary Board would continue to draw the consequences of these irregularities under the Staff Regulations.\n\n\n7.2. Sectoral rules\n\n\n\u00b7Several changes of the Common Provisions Regulation are proposed to facilitate programme management and nation-wide programmes as well as Joint Action Plans comprising projects focussing on output and results.\n\n\n\u00b7In the area of direct payments for farmers, support is granted to active farmers and certain measures focus the support on young farmers. Proportionality for financial corrections linked to public procurement errors is introduced to avoid that such errors are always considered as affecting 100% of aid concerned.\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other changes\n\n\nRevenue operations: the following changes are proposed:\n\n\n\u00b7The provision on negative adjustments of own resources for accounting purposes is modified for reasons of transparency (Article 94).\n\n\n\u00b7A new provision sets a time limit within which a debit note shall be sent to the debtor (Article 96 (2)), reflecting recent case law of the Court of Justice.\n\n\n\u00b7A new Article 107 sets the rules concerning the rate to be applied for compensatory interests in cases where an amount shall be reimbursed following a judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union or an amicable settlement.\n\n\n\u00b7The provision concerning fines, other penalties\u00a0or sanctions is modified to make clear that the amounts provisionally cashed shall be repaid to the third party concerned taking into account the return; and that fines imposed by institutions other than the Commission (e.g. Council in line with Regulation 1173/2011) are also covered by the Financial Regulation (currently limited to fines imposed by the Commission, Article 106).\n\n\n\u00b7Wording on assigned revenue is modified to reflect contributions to measures like the Turkey refugee facility (Article 20(2)). \n\n\nList of sectoral acts modified by the proposal:\n\n\n\u00b7Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (OJ L 311, 14.11.2002, p.3);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on a European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (\"EaSI\") and amending Decision No 283/2010/EU establishing a European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion (OJ L 347 20.12.2013, p. 238);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the European Regional Development Fund and on specific provisions concerning the Investment for jobs and growth goal and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 289\u2013302);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (OJ L 347 20.12.2013, p. 320);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the European Social Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 (OJ L 347 20.12.2013, p. 470);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 487\u2013548);\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p.549);\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (OJ L 347 20.12.2013, p. 608);

In the interest of clarity, main rules from Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 should be included in this Regulation, others should be included in guidance for services.\n\n\n(3)The fundamental budgetary principles should be maintained. Derogations from those fundamental principles for specific areas such as research, external actions\u00a0and structural funds\u00a0should be reviewed and simplified as far as possible, taking into account their continuing relevance, their added-value for the budget, and the burden they impose on stakeholders.\n\n\n(4)Up to 10% of the funds of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II), the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI)\u00a0may be kept unallocated at the beginning of the financial year to allow additional funding to respond to major unforeseen needs, new crises situations or significant political shifts in third countries, in addition to the amounts already programmed. These unallocated funds, if not committed during the year, should be carried over by a Decision of the Commission.\n\n\n(5)Carry-over rules should be presented more clearly, making a distinction between the automatic and non-automatic carry-overs. \n\n\n(6)In order to optimise the implementation of the budget, it is important to allow for the carrying over and use of external assigned revenues for the succeeding programme or action. It should be possible to carry over internal assigned revenue for one year only, except where this Regulation provides otherwise.\n\n\n(7)The rules governing transfers of appropriations should allow for greater flexibility in order to ensure better budget implementation. To that end, it is important for the Commission to have the possibility of deciding on transfers, of up to 10%, of operational appropriations between Titles when they are covered by the same basic act. Transfers from administrative support lines to the corresponding operational lines should also be done autonomously by the Commission.\n\n\n(8)In order to improve agility of the implementation of special instruments, simplified mobilisation and transfer procedures are necessary for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Union Solidarity Fund.\n\n\n(9)Concerning internal assigned revenue, derogation from the principle of specification should be introduced to allow optimal use of all types of appropriations available. In this respect, in case there are no identified needs allowing such revenue to be used for the purposes for which it is assigned, its use for a different purpose should be allowed. \n\n\n(10)Union institutions should be able to accept any donation made to the Union.\n\n\n(11)An enabling clause should be introduced to allow for in-kind sponsoring by a legal person of an EU event or activity for promotional or corporate social responsibility purposes.\n\n\n(12)The concept of performance as regards the EU budget should be clarified. Performance should be described as a direct application of the principle of sound financial management. There should be a link between performance, objective-setting, indicators, results and economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of appropriations. To avoid conflicts with existing performance frameworks of the different programmes, references in terms of performance terminology should be limited to objectives and monitoring progress in achieving them.\n\n\n(13)Union legislation should be of high quality, focus on areas where it produces greatest added value for European citizens and is as effective and efficient as possible in delivering the common policy objectives of the Union\n16\n. Subjecting existing and new spending programmes and activities entailing significant spending to evaluation can help achieve these objectives.\n\n\n(14)The principle of transparency, enshrined in Article 15 TFEU which requires the institutions to work as openly as possible, implies, in the area of the implementation of the budget, that citizens are able to know where, and for what purpose, funds are spent by the Union. Such information fosters democratic debate, contributes to the participation of citizens in the Union's decision-making process and reinforces institutional control and scrutiny over Union expenditure. Such objectives should be achieved by the publication, preferably using modern communication tools, of relevant information concerning all recipients of Union funds which takes into account such all recipients' legitimate interests of confidentiality and security and, as far as natural persons are concerned, their right to privacy and the protection of their personal data. Institutions should therefore adopt a selective approach in the publication of information, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Decisions to publish should be based on relevant criteria in order to provide meaningful information.\n\n\n(15)The information on the use of Union funds implemented under direct implementation should be published on an internet website of the institutions and should include at least the name, the locality, the amount and the purpose of the funds. That information should take into account relevant criteria such as the periodicity, the type and the importance of the measure.\n\n\n(16)The name and locality of the recipients of Union funds should be published for prizes, grants and contracts awarded following the opening-up of a public procedure to competition, as it is the case in particular for contests, call for proposals and call for tenders, in the respect of the principles of the TFEU and in particular the principles of transparency, proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination. Moreover such publication should contribute to the control of the public selection procedures by the rejected applicants of the competition.\n\n\n(17)The publication of personal data referring to natural persons should not exceed the duration during which the funds are being used by the recipient and should therefore be removed after two years. The same should apply to personal data referring to legal persons for whom the official title identifies one or more natural persons.\n\n\n(18)In most of the cases covered by this Regulation, the publication concerns legal persons.\n\n\n(19)When natural persons are concerned, such publication should only be envisaged respecting the principle of proportionality between the importance of the amount granted and the need to control the best use of the funds. Where natural persons are concerned, the publication of the region on NUTS 2 level is consistent with the objective of publication of recipients, ensures equal treatment between Member States of different sizes while respecting the recipients\u2019 right to private life and in particular the protection of their personal data.\n\n\n\n\n(20)Information on scholarships, and other direct support paid to natural persons in most need should remain exempt from publication.\n\n\n(21)In order to ensure the respect of the principle of equal treatment between recipients, the publication of information related to natural persons should also be ensured in line with the obligation for the Member States to establish a large transparency of the contracts above the amount laid down in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.\n\n\n(22)The name and the locality of the recipient and the amount and the purpose of the funds should not be published if it risks endangering the integrity of the recipient as protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or would harm the legitimate commercial interests of the recipient.\n\n\n(23)In the case of indirect and shared implementation, it should be for the persons, entities or designated bodies implementing Union funds to make available information on recipients and final recipients. Where applicable, the level of detail and criteria should be defined in the relevant sector specific rules and may be further defined in the financial framework partnership agreements. The Commission should make available a reference of the website where the information on recipients and final recipients can be found.\n\n\n(24)In the interest of increased readability and transparency of data on financial instruments implemented under direct and indirect implementation, it is appropriate to merge all reporting requirements in one single working document attached to the draft budget.\n\n\n(25)It is appropriate to provide for a possibility for the Commission to conclude service-level agreements with other insitutions\u00a0in order to facilitate the implementation of administrative appropriations and also for an explicit possibility to conclude such agreements between departments of the institutions, Union bodies, European offices,\u00a0bodies or persons entrusted with implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and the Office of the Secretary General of the Board of Governors of the European schools for the provision of services, supply of products, execution of works or the implementation of building contracts.\n\n\n(26)It is appropriate to define the European offices and to distinguish between obligatory and non-obligatory tasks of such offices. A possibility for the\u00a0Union institutions, Union bodies and other European offices to delegate authorising officer powers to the director of the European office should be introduced. European offices should also have the possibility to conclude service-level agreements for the provision of services, supply of products, for execution of works or for implementation of building contracts. It is appropriate to set out specific rules for the provision of accounting records, provisions authorising the Commission's accounting officer to delegate some of his tasks to staff in those offices and operating procedures for the bank accounts which the European offices may be authorised to open in the Commission's name. \n\n\n(27)In order to further improve the cost-efficiency of executive agencies and in the light of the practical experience gained with other Union bodies, the accounting officer of the Commission should be allowed to be entrusted with all or part of the tasks of the accounting officer of the executive agency.\n\n\n(28)For reasons of legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that the directors of executive agencies act as authorising officers by delegation when managing operational appropriations of programmes delegated to their agency. To achieve the full effect of efficiency gains resulting from a global centralisation of certain support services the possibility for executive agencies to implement administrative expenditures should be explicitly mentioned.\n\n\n(29)It is necessary to establish rules on the powers and responsibilities of financial actors, in particular authorising officers and the accounting officers. \n\n\n(30)The European Parliament and Council should be informed of the appointment or termination of duties of an authorising officer by delegation, internal auditor and accounting officer within two weeks. \n\n\n(31)Authorising officers should be\u00a0fully responsible for all revenue and expenditure operations executed under their authority, including in terms of internal control systems, and should be held accountable for their actions, including, where necessary, through disciplinary proceedings. \n\n\n(32)Consequently, the tasks, responsibilities and principles of the procedures to be observed should also be laid down. It is also necessary to provide that the authorising officers by delegation shall ensure that the authorising officers by subdelegation and their staff receive information concerning the control standards and respective methods and techniques and that measures are taken in order to ensure the functioning of the control system which should replace the obligation to establish specific code of professional standards applicable to financial verifications only. The responsibilities assumed are accounted for in an annual report to the institution and the report shall include the required financial and management information to support the authorising officer by delegation\u2019s declaration of assurance on the performance of his or her duties, including the information on the overall performance of the operations carried out. The supporting documents relating to the operations carried out should be kept. Finally, all the various forms of negotiated procedure for the award of public contracts should, since those contracts represent derogations from the usual award procedures, be the subject of a special report to the institution and of a communication to the European Parliament and Council. \n\n\n(33)The double role of the Head of Union delegation, and of their deputies in their absence, as authorising officer by subdelegation for the European External Action Service (hereinafter \u2018EEAS\u2019) and, as regards operational appropriations, for the Commission should be taken into account.\n\n\n(34)The delegation of powers of budget implementation by the Commission concerning the operational appropriations of its own section to the deputy Heads of Delegations is restricted to situations where the performance of these tasks by the deputy Heads of Delegations is strictly necessary in order to ensure business continuity during the\u00a0absence of the Heads of Delegations. The deputy Heads of Delegations cannot exercise these powers on a systematic basis or for reasons of internal work division.\n\n\n(35)The accounting officer continues to be responsible for the proper execution of payments, the collection of revenue and the recovery of amounts receivable. He/She manages the treasury, bank accounts and third party files, keeps the accounts and is responsible for drawing up the institution's financial statements. The accounting officer of the Commission is the only person who is entitled to define the accounting rules and harmonised charts of accounts, while accounting officers of all other Union institutions define accounting procedures applicable in their institutions.\n\n\n(36)The arrangements for the appointment and termination of the accounting\u00a0officer\u2019s duties should also be established.\n\n\n(37)It is appropriate that the accounting officer should set up procedures to ensure that the accounts opened for the requirements of treasury management and imprest accounts are not in debit.\n\n\n(38)The conditions for the use of imprest accounts, a system of management which constitutes an exception to normal budgetary procedures, should also be laid down, and the tasks and responsibilities of the imprest administrators, as well as those of the authorising officer and accounting officer in connection with the control of imprest accounts, should be set out. The European Parliament and Council should be informed of any appointment or termination of duties. For reasons of efficiency, imprest accounts should be set up in Union delegations, for appropriations from both the Commission and EEAS sections of the budget. It is also appropriate to allow under specific conditions for the use of imprest accounts in the Union delegation for payments of limited amounts by budgetary procedures. As regards the appointment of imprest administrators, it has proven necessary to choose them also from personnel employed by the Commission in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations whenever there is no Commission statutory staff available.\n\n\n(39)In order to take into account the situation in the field of humanitarian aid operations whenever there is no respective Commission statutory staff available and the technical difficulties to have all legal commitments signed by the authorising officer responsible, it should be allowed for the personnel employed by the Commission in that field to sign legal commitments of a very low value up to EUR\u00a02500 which are linked to the payments executed from the imprest accounts, and for the Heads of Union delegations or their deputies to sign legal commitments on the instruction of the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\n\n\n(40)Once the tasks and responsibilities of each financial actor have been defined, they may be held liable only under the conditions laid down in the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union. The specialised financial irregularities panels have been set up in the Union institutions, however due to limited number of cases submitted to them and for reasons of efficiency, it is appropriate to transfer their functions to the newly established inter-institutional panel which has been set up to assess requests and issue recommendations on the imposition on administrative sanctions\u00a0(exclusion and financial penalty) referred to it by the Commission or other Union institutions and Union bodies. This transfer also aims at avoiding duplication and mitigating the risks of contradictory recommendations or opinions, in cases where both an economic operator and an EU staff member are involved. The procedure should be maintained by which an authorising officer may seek confirmation of an instruction which that officer considers to be irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial management, and thus be released from any liability. The composition of this panel should be modified when it fulfils this role.\n\n\n(41)As regards revenue, it is necessary to address negative adjustments of own resources covered by Council Regulation on the system of the European Union's own resources. Except for the special case of own resources, it is necessary to keep the tasks and controls falling within the responsibility of the authorising officers at the different stages of the procedure: establishment of the estimate of amounts receivable, recovery order, dispatch of the debit note informing the debtor that the amount receivable has been established, calculation of any default interest due, and the decision, where necessary, to waive an entitlement subject to criteria guaranteeing compliance with sound financial management in order to ensure an efficient collection of revenue.\n\n\n(42)The authorising officer should be able to waive totally or partially the recovery of an established amount receivable when the debtor has entered into any of the insolvency proceeding as defined by Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, in particular in cases of judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings.\n\n\n(43)Specific provisions on procedures of adjustment or cancellation of an estimate of amount receivable should be applied.\n\n\n(44)Due to the recent developments on the financial markets and the ECB rate applied to its principal refinancing operations, it is necessary to review the provisions concerning interest rate for fines or other penalties and to provide for rules in cases of negative interest rate.\n\n\n(45)To reflect the specific nature of receivables consisting in fines or other penalties imposed by the Institutions under the TFEU or Euratom Treaty, it is necessary to introduce specific provisions on the interest rates applicable on amounts due but not yet paid, in the case such amounts are increased by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n\n(46)The rules on recovery should be both clarified and strengthened. In particular, it should be specified that the accounting officer shall recover amounts by offsetting them also against amounts owed to the debtor by an executive agency when it implements the Union budget.\n\n\n(47)For the sake of legal security, the rules regarding the delays when a debit note is to be sent should be defined.\n\n\n(48)In order to secure the management of assets whilst also yielding financial remuneration, it is necessary to have the amounts provisionally cashed, such as competitions fines which are being contested, invested in financial assets, and to determine the assignment of the return on them. Since the Commission is not the only institution which is entitled to impose fines or other penalties, it is necessary to set provisions concerning such fines or other penalties imposed by other institutions and to set rules for their recovery which should be equivalent to those for the fines or penalties imposed by the Commission.\n\n\n(49)In order to ensure that the Commission has all the necessary information for the adoption of the financing decisions, it is necessary to lay down the minimum requirements for the contents of financing decisions on grants, procurement, trust funds, prizes, financial instruments, blending facilities and budgetary guarantees. At the same time, in order to give a longer-term perspective to the potential recipients, it is necessary to allow that the financing decisions are adopted for more than one year but the implementation being subject to the availability of budget appropriations for the respective year. In order to enable such longer-term perspective it is necessary to reduce the number of the elements required for the financing decision. With the aim of simplification, the financing decision should at the same time constitute an annual or multi-annual programme. Since the contribution to the bodies referred to in Articles 69 and 70 is already established in the annual budget, it should not be required to adopt a specific financing decision in this respect. \n\n\n(50)As regards expenditure, the relationship between financing decisions, global commitments and individual commitments as well as concepts of budgetary and legal commitment of expenditure should be clarified in order to establish a clear framework for the different stages of budget implementation. \n\n\n(51)In order to take into account in particular the number of legal commitments concluded in the Union delegations and representations and the exchange rate fluctuations experienced by them, the provisional commitments should be possible also in cases where the final recipients and the amounts are known.\n\n\n(52)In order to make better use of the appropriations available for the implementation of external actions, the time limit during which individual legal commitments may be made on the basis of global budgetary commitment should be removed as well as the obligation to conclude a contribution agreement until 31 December of year n+1 in cases where a financing agreement with the third country presents the global budgetary commitment covering also the contribution agreement.\n\n\n(53)As regards the typology of payments which may be made by authorising officers, clarification of the various types of payments should, in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, be provided. The rules for clearing of pre-financing payments should further be clarified in particular for situations where no interim clearing is possible. To this effect, appropriate provisions should be included in legal commitments signed. \n\n\n(54)This Regulation should stipulate that the payments must be made within a specified time limit and that in the event of failure to respect this time limit creditors will be entitled to default interests to be charged to the budget, with the exception of Member States and as newly introduced, also the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. \n\n\n(55)It is considered appropriate to integrate the provisions concerning validation and authorisation of expenditure in one article and to introduce a definition of de-commitments. Since the transactions are carried out in computerised systems, the concept of \"signing a 'passed for payment' voucher\" has been replaced by \"electronically secured signature\" except in a limited number of cases. It is also necessary to clarify that the validation of expenditure applies to all eligible costs, i.e. also such which are not associated with a request for payment, this being the case for the clearing of pre-financing.\n\n\n(56)In order to reduce complexity, streamline existing rules and improve the readability of this Regulation rules common to more than one budget implementation instruments should be established. For those reasons certain provisions should be regrouped, the wording and scope of other provisions should be aligned and unnecessary repetitions and cross referencing should be removed.\n\n\n(57)More emphasis should be put on performance and results. It is thus appropriate to define an additional form of financing not linked to costs of the relevant operations in addition to the forms of Union contribution already well established (reimbursement of the eligible costs actually incurred, unit cost, lump sums and flat-rate financing). This form of financing should be either based on the fulfilment of certain conditions ex ante or the achievement of results measured by reference to the previously set milestones or through performance indicators.\n\n\n(58)Where the Commission carries out assessments of the operational and financial capacity of recipients of EU funds or of their systems and procedures, it should be able to rely on the assessments already conducted by other entities or donors such as international organizations, in order to avoid duplicating assessments of the same recipients. The possibility to cross-rely on assessments conducted by other entities should be used where these assessments were made with regard to conditions equivalent to those set out in this Regulation for the applicable method of implementation. Therefore, in order to foster cross reliance on assessments among donors, the Commission should promote the recognition of internationally accepted standards or international best practices.\n\n\n(59)It is also important to avoid that recipients of EU funds are audited several times by different entities on the use of these funds. It is therefore necessary to foresee the possibility to rely on audits already carried out by independent auditors provided that they are based on internationally accepted standards, that they provide reasonable assurance, and that they have been conducted on the financial statements and reports setting out the use of the Union contribution. Such audits should then form the basis of the overall assurance on the use of EU funds. \n\n\n\n\n(60)It is important to allow Member States to request that resources allocated to them under shared implementation are transferred at Union level and implemented by the Commission in direct or indirect implementation, where possible for the benefit of the Member State concerned. This would optimise the use of these resources and of the instruments established under this Regulation or under sector specific Regulations including the EFSI Regulation, to which the Member States would request these resources to be transferred. In order to guarantee an efficient implementation of these instruments, it is necessary to foresee that where resources are transferred to instruments established under this Regulation or under sector specific Regulations including the EFSI Regulation, the rules of those regulations shall apply.\n\n\n(61)In order to provide for a long term cooperation mechanism with recipients of Union funding, the possibility of signing financial framework partnership agreements should be provided for. Financial framework partnerships should be implemented through grants or through cooperation agreements with entities implementing Union funds. For this purpose the minimum content of such agreements should be specified. Financial framework partnerships should not unduly restrict access to Union funding.\n\n\n(62)The conditions and procedures for suspending, terminating and reducing the Union contribution should be harmonised across the different budget implementation instruments (for example grants, procurement, indirect implementation, prizes, etc.). The grounds for such suspension, termination or reduction should be defined.\n\n\n(63)This Regulation should establish standard periods for which documents relating to Union contributions should be kept by recipients so as to avoid divergent or disproportionate contractual requirements while still providing the Commission, the European Anti-fraud office and the Court of Auditors with sufficient time to obtain access to such data and documents and perform the ex post checks and audits. In addition, participants and recipients should be obliged to cooperate in the protection of the Union's financial interest.\n\n\n(64)In order to provide adequate information to participants and recipients and to ensure that they have the possibility to exercise their right of defence this Regulation should allow participants and recipients to submit their observations before adoption of any measure adversely affecting their rights and to be informed on the means of redress they dispose of for challenging such a measure.\n\n\n(65)In order to protect the Union's financial interests, a single early detection and exclusion system should be set up by the Commission.\n\n\n(66)The early detection and exclusion sytem should apply to participants, recipients, entities on whose capacity the candidate or tenderer intends to rely or to subcontractors of a contractor, any person or entity receiving Union funds where the budget is implemented under indirect implementation, any person or entity receiving Union funds under financial instruments directly implemented and participants or recipients of entities implementing the budget under shared implementation.\n\n\n(67)It should be clarified that where a decision to register a person or entity in the early detection and exclusion system database is taken on the basis of the exclusion situations of a n\u0430tural or legal person who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of that person or entity, or who has powers of representation, decision or control with regard to that person or entity or a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of that person or entity or a natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the legal commitment, the information registered in the database shall include the information concerning these persons.\n\n\n(68)The decision to exclude a person or entity from participation in award procedures or the imposition of a financial penalty and the decision to publish the related information should be taken by the authorising officer responsible, in light of their autonomy in administrative matters. In the absence of a final judgment or final administrative decision and in cases related to a serious breach of contract, the authorising officers responsible should take their decision having regard to the recommendation of the panel on the basis of a preliminary classification in law.. The panel should also assess the duration of an exclusion in cases where the duration has not been set by the final judgment or the final administrative decision.\n\n\n(69)The role of the panel should be to ensure the coherent operation of the exclusion system. The panel should be composed of a standing chair, representatives of the Commission and a representative of the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\n(70)The preliminary classification in law does not prejudge the final assessment of the conduct of the person or entity concerned by the competent authorities of Member States under national law. The recommendation of the panel, as well as the decision of the authorising officer responsible, should therefore be reviewed following the notification of such a final assessment.\n\n\n(71)A person or entity should be excluded by the authorising officer responsible when a final judgment or a final administrative decision has been taken in the case of grave professional misconduct, non-compliance, whether intentional or not, with the obligations related to the payment of social security contributions or the payment of taxes, fraud affecting the budget , corruption, participation in a criminal organisation, money laundering, terrorist financing, terrorist related offences, child labour or other forms of trafficking in human beings or irregularity. It should also be excluded in the case of a serious breach of a legal commitment or bankruptcy.\n\n\n(72)When deciding on the exclusion or the imposition of a financial penalty and on the publication thereof or on the rejection of person or entity, the authorising officer responsible should ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality by taking into particular account the seriousness of the situation, its budgetary impact, the time which has elapsed since the relevant conduct, its duration and its recurrence, the intention or degree of negligence and the degree of collaboration of the person or entity with the relevant competent authority and its contribution to the investigation.\n\n\n(73)The authorising officer responsible should also be able to exclude a person or entity where a natural or legal person assuming unlimited liability for the debts of that economic operator is bankrupt or in a similar situation of insolvency or where that natural or legal person fails to comply with its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes, where such situations impact the financial situation of the economic operator. \n\n\n(74)A person or entity should not be subject to a decision of exclusion when it has taken remedial measures, thus demonstrating its reliability. That possibility should not apply in case of the most severe criminal activities.\n\n\n(75)In light of the principle of proportionality, cases where a financial penalty may be imposed as an alternative to the exclusion and cases where the gravity of the conduct of the recipient concerned in respect of attempting to unduly obtain Union funds justifies the imposition of a financial penalty in addition to the exclusion so as to ensure a deterrent effect should be distinguished. The minimum and maximum financial penalty which can be imposed by the contracting authority should also be defined.\n\n\n(76)A financial penalty should only be imposed on a recipient and not on a participant given that the amount of the financial penalty to be imposed is calculated on the basis of the value of the legal commitment at stake.\n\n\n(77)The possibility to apply administrative and/or financial penalties on a regulatory basis is independent from the possibility to apply contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages\u00a0and should be noted.\n\n\n(78)The duration of exclusion should be limited in time, as is the case in Directive 2014/24/EU\n17\n and in accordance with the principle of proportionality.\n\n\n(79)It is necessary to determine the commencement date and the duration of the limitation period for imposing administrative sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n(80)It is important to be able to reinforce the deterrent effect achieved by the exclusion and the financial penalty. In that regard, the deterrent effect should be reinforced by the possibility to publish the information related to the exclusion and/or to the financial penalty, with full respect for the data protection requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). This should contribute to ensuring that the same conduct is not repeated. For reasons of legal certainty and in accordance with the principle of proportionality it should be specified in which situations a publication should not take place. In its assessment, the authorising officer responsible should have regard to any recommendation of the panel. As far as natural persons are concerned, personal data should only be published in exceptional cases justified by the seriousness of the conduct or its impact on the Union's financial interests.\n\n\n(81)The information related to an exclusion or a financial penalty should only be published in the case of grave professional misconduct, fraud, a significant deficiency in complying with the main obligations of a contract financed by the budget or an irregularity.\n\n\n(82)The criteria for exclusion should be clearly separated from the criteria leading to a possible rejection from a given procedure.\n\n\n(83)The information on the early detection of risks and on the imposition of administrative sanctions on a person of entity should be centralised. For that purpose, related information should be stored in a database set up and operated by the Commission as the owner of the centralised system. That system should operate in full compliance with the right to privacy and the protection of personal data. \n\n\n(84)While the setting up and the operation of the early detection and exclusion system should be the responsibility of the Commission, other institutions and bodies, as well as all entities implementing the budget under direct, shared and indirect implementation should participate in that system by transmitting relevant information to the Commission.\u00a0The authorising officer responsible and the panel should guarantee the right of defence of economic operators. The same right should be given to a person of entity, in the context of an early detection, where an act envisaged by an authorising officer could adversely affect the rights of the person of entity concerned. In cases of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the Union's financial interests which are not yet subject to a final judgment, the authorising officer responsible and the panel should be given the possibility to defer the opportunity given to the person of entity to submit its observations. Such deferral should only be justified where there are compelling legitimate grounds to preserve the confidentiality of the investigation.\n\n\n(85)The Court of Justice of the European Union should be given unlimited jurisdiction with regard to penalties imposed pursuant to this Regulation, in accordance with Article 261 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\n\n(86)In order to facilitate the protection of the Union's financial interests across all implementation modes, it should be possible for the entities involved in the implementation of the budget in shared and indirect implementation\u00a0to take into account, as appropriate, exclusions decided upon by the authorising officers at Union level.\n\n\n(87)This Regulation should foster the objective of e-Government, and in particular the use of electronic data in the exchange of information between the institutions and third parties.\n\n\n(88)Progress towards the electronic exchange of information and electronic submission of documents, which constitute a major simplification measure, should be accompanied by clear conditions for the acceptance of the systems to be used, so as to establish a legally sound environment while preserving flexibility in the management of Union funds for the participants, recipients and the authorising offices as provided for in this Regulation.\n\n\n(89)Rules on the composition and tasks of the committee in charge of assessing application documents in procurement, grant award procedures and in contests for prizes should be laid down. The committee may be composed of external experts if provided so in the basic act. \n\n\n(90)In line with the principle of good administration the authorising officer should request clarifications or missing documents while respecting the principle of equality of treatment and without substantially changing the application documents. The authorising officer may decide not to do so only in duly justified cases. In addition, the authorising officer should be able to correct an obvious clerical error or request the participant to correct it.\n\n\n(91)Sound financial management should require that the Commission protects itself by requesting guarantees at the time of paying pre-financing. The requirement for contractors and beneficiaries to lodge guarantees should not be automatic, but should be based on a risk analysis. Where during the course of implementation the authorising officer discovers that a guarantor is no longer authorised to issue guarantees in accordance with the applicable national law, the authorising officer should be able to require replacement of the guarantee.\n\n\n(92)The different sets of rules for direct and indirect implementation, in particular the definition of budget implementation tasks, have created confusion and entailed risk in errors of qualification both for the Commission and for the partners and should thus be simplified and harmonised. \n\n\n(93)The provisions on the ex-ante pillar assessment should be revised to enable the Commission to rely as much as possible on the systems and procedures of the partners which have deemed equivalent to the ones used by the Commission.\u00a0In addition, it is important to clarify that where the assessment reveals areas where the procedures in place are not sufficient to protect the financial interests of the Union, the Commission may sign contribution agreements while imposing additional supervisory measures. It is also important to clarify where the Commission does not require a pillar assessment in order to sign contribution agreements. \n\n\n(94)It is appropriate to indicate that the remuneration of the Organisations implementing the EU budget should, where relevant and possible, have a performance based nature.\n\n\n(95)The Commission enters into partnerships with third countries by means of financing agreements. It is important to clarify the content of the financing agreement particularly for those parts that are implemented by the third country in indirect implementation. \n\n\n(96)It is important to recognise the specific nature of blending facilities where the Commission blends its contribution with that of Financial Institutions and to clarify the application of Title X on Financial Instruments.\n\n\n(97)Procurement rules and principles applicable to public contracts awarded by the Union institutions on their own account should be based on the rules contained in the Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n\u00a0and Directive 2014/24/EU.\n\n\n(98)In the case of mixed contracts, the methodology of the contracting authorities for determining the applicable rules should be clarified.\n\n\n(99)The ex ante and ex post publicity measures necessary to launch a procurement procedure should be clarified in the case of contracts above and below the thresholds set out in Directive 2014/24/EU and for those falling outside the scope of that Directive..\n\n\n\n\n(100)This Regulation should include an exhaustive list of all the procurement procedures available to the Union institutions regardless of the thresholds.\n\n\n(101)In the interests of administrative simplification and in order to encourage the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, negotiated procedures for middle-value contracts should be provided for.\n\n\n(102)As is the case in Directive 2014/24/EU, this Regulation should allow for market consultation prior to the launch of a procurement procedure. In order to ensure that the innovation partnership is used only when the desired product does not exist on the market, an obligation to carry out such preliminary market consultation before using an innovation partnership should be laid down in this Regulation.\n\n\n(103)The contribution of contracting authorities\u00a0the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development, while ensuring that they can obtain the best value for money for their contracts, in particular through requiring specific labels or through the use of appropriate award methods, should be clarified.\n\n\n(104)In order to ensure that, when executing contracts, economic operators comply with the applicable environmental, social and labour law obligations established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or the applicable international social and environmental conventions listed in Annex X to Directive 2014/24/EU, such obligations should be part of the minimum requirements defined by the contracting authority and should be integrated in the contracts signed by the contracting authority.\n\n\n(105)It is appropriate that different cases usually referred to as situations of conflict of interest be identified and treated distinctly. The notion of a \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 should be solely used for cases where an entity or person with responsibilities for budget implementation, audit or control or\u00a0an official or an agent of a Union institution is in such a situation. In cases where an economic operator attempts to unduly influence a procedure or obtain confidential information, this should be treated as grave professional misconduct. In addition, economic operators may be in a situation where they should not be selected to implement a contract because of a professional conflicting interest. For instance, a company should not evaluate a project in which it has participated or an auditor should not be in a position to audit accounts it has previously certified.\n\n\n(106)In accordance with Directive 2014/24/EU, it should be possible to verify whether an economic operator is excluded, to apply selection and award criteria, as well as to verify compliance with the procurement documents in any order. As a result, it should be possible to reject tenders on the basis of award criteria without a prior check on exclusion or selection criteria of the corresponding tenderer.\n\n\n(107)Contracts should be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender in line with Article 67 of Directive 2014/24/EU. It should be clarified that selection criteria are strictly linked to the evaluation of candidates or tenderers and award criteria are strictly linked to the evaluation of the tenders.\n\n\n(108)Union public procurement should ensure that Union funds are used in an effective, transparent, and appropriate way. In that regard, electronic procurement should contribute to the better use of Union funds and enhance access to contracts for all economic operators.\n\n\n(109)The existence of an opening phase and an evaluation for any procedure should be clarified. An award decision should always be the outcome of an evaluation.\n\n\n(110)When notified of the outcome of a procedure, candidates and tenderers should be informed of the grounds on which the decision was taken and should receive a detailed statement of reasons based on the content of the evaluation report.\n\n\n(111)Given that criteria are applied in no particular order, rejected tenderers who submitted compliant tenders should receive the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender if they so request.\n\n\n(112)For framework contracts with reopening of competition, the obligation to provide the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender to an unsuccessful contractor should be waived on the basis that the receipt of such information by parties to the same framework contract each time a competition is reopened might prejudice fair competition between them.\n\n\n(113)A contracting authority should be able to cancel a procurement procedure before the contract is signed, without the candidates or tenderers being entitled to claim compensation. This should be without prejudice to situations where the contracting authority has acted in such a way that it may be held liable for damages in accordance with the general principles of Union law.\n\n\n(114)As is the case in Directive 2014/24/EU, it is necessary to clarify the conditions under which a contract may be modified during its performance without a new procurement procedure. In particular, cases such as administrative changes, universal succession and application of clear and unequivocal revision clauses or options do not alter the minimum requirements of the initial procedure. A new procurement procedure should be required in the case of material modifications to the initial contract, in particular to the scope and content of the mutual rights and obligations of the parties, including the distribution of intellectual property rights. Such modifications demonstrate the parties' intention to renegotiate the essential terms or conditions of that contract, in particular if the modifications would have had an influence on the outcome of the procedure had they been part of the initial procedure.\n\n\n(115)It is necessary to provide for the option of a performance guarantee in relation to works, supplies and complex services in order to guarantee compliance with substantial contractual obligations and to ensure proper performance throughout the duration of the contract. It is also necessary to provide for a retention money guarantee to cover the contract liability period, in line with customary practice in these sectors.\n\n\n(116)In order to determine the applicable thresholds and procedures, it is necessary to clarify whether Union institutions, executive agencies and bodies are deemed to be contracting authorities. They should not be deemed to be contracting authorities in cases where they purchase from a central purchasing body. In addition, Union institutions form a single legal entity and cannot conclude contracts but only service-level agreements between their departments.\n\n\n(117)It is appropriate to include a reference in this Regulation to the two thresholds set out in Directive 2014/24/EU applicable to works and to supplies and services, respectively. Those thresholds should also be applicable to concession contracts for reasons of simplification as well as sound financial management, considering the specificities of the Union institutions' contracting needs. The revision of those thresholds as provided for in Directive 2014/24/EU should therefore be directly applicable to procurement by Union institutions.\n\n\n(118)For harmonisation and simplification purposes, the standard procedures applicable for public procurement should also be applied to purchases provided for under the light regime in Directive 2014/24/EU. Therefore, the threshold for light regime purchases should be aligned with the threshold for service contracts.\n\n\n(119)It is necessary to clarify the conditions of application of the standstill period.\n\n\n\n\n(120)The rules applicable to procurement in the field of external actions should be consistent with the principles laid down in the Directive 2014/23/EU and Directive 2014/24/EU.\n\n\n(121)In order to reduce complexity, streamline existing rules and improve the readability of the procurement rules, it is necessary to regroup the general provisions on procurement and the specific provisions applicable to procurement in external actions and to remove unnecessary repetitions and cross referencing.\n\n\n(122)It is necessary to clarify which economic operators have access to procurement by Union institutions depending on their place of establishment and to provide explicitly for the possibility of such access also to international organisations.\n\n\n(123)In order to achieve a balance between the need for transparency and greater coherence of procurement rules on the one hand, and the need to provide flexibility on certain technical aspects of these rules on the other hand, the technical rules on procurement should be aggregated in the Annex to this Regulation and the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to this Annex. \n\n\n(124)It is necessary to clarify the scope of the Title on grants, particularly with regard to the type of action or body eligible for a grant as well as with regard to legal commitments that may be used to cover grants. In particular, grant decisions should be phased out due to their limited use and progressive introduction of e-grants. The structure should be simplified by moving the provisions on instruments which are not grants to other parts of the Regulation. The nature of bodies which may receive operating grants should be clarified since the notion of bodies pursuing an aim of general Union interest is covered by the notion of bodies having an objective forming part of and supporting a Union policy. In addition, the restrictive definition of a body pursuing an aim of general Union interests should be removed.\n\n\n(125)In order to simplify procedures and improve the readability of this Regulation provisions related to the content of the grant application, of the call for proposals and of the grant agreement should be simplified and streamlined.\u00a0\n\n\n(126)In order to facilitate the implementation of actions financed by multiple donors where the overall financing of the action is not known at the time of commitment of the Union contribution, it is necessary to clarify the way the Union contribution is defined and the method of verifying its use. \n\n\n(127)Experience gained in the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing has shown that, such forms of financing significantly simplified administrative procedures and reduced the risk of error substantially. Lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are a suitable form of financing independently of the area of Union intervention and in particular for standardised and recurrent actions, e.g. mobility, institutional twinning, training activities, etc. In this context, the conditions for using lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should be made more flexible. It is necessary to provide explicitely for the establishment of single lump sums covering the entire eligible costs of the action or the work programme. In addition, in order to foster focus on results, priority should be given to output-based funding. Input b\u0430sed lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should remain an option where output based ones are not possible or appropriate.\n\n\n(128)The administrative procedures for authorising lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should be simplified by vesting the power for such authorisation in the authorising officer. Where appropriate, this authorisation may be given by the Commission in light of the nature of the activities or of the expenditure or in light of the number of authorising officers concerned.\n\n\n(129)In order to bridge the gap in the availability of data used to establish lump sums, unit costs and flat rates, the use of an expert judgement should be allowed.\n\n\n(130)The scope of checks and controls as opposed to the periodic assessment of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates should be clarified. Those checks and controls should focus on the fulfilment of the conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates, including, where required, the achievement of outputs. Those conditions should not require reporting on the costs actually incurred by the beneficiary. Where the amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing have been decided ex ante by the authorising officer responsible or the Commission\u00a0they should not be challenged by ex post controls. The periodic assessment of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates may require access to the accounts of the beneficiary for statistical and methodological purposes. The periodic assessment may lead to updates of the lump sums, unit costs or flat rates applicable to future agreements but should not be used for questioning the value of the lump sums, unit costs or flat rates already agreed upon. Access to the beneficiary's accounts is also necessary for fraud-prevention and detection purposes.\n\n\n(131)In order to facilitate the participation of small organisations in the implementation of the EU policies in an environment of limited availability of resources, it is necessary to recognise the value of the work provided by volunteers as eligible costs. As a result, such organisations may rely to a greater extent on volunteers' work for sake of providing co-financing to the action. Without prejudice to the maximum co-financing rate specified in the basic act, in such cases, the Union grant needs to be limited to the estimated eligible costs other than those covering volunteers' work. As volunteers work is a work provided by third parties without a remuneration being paid to them by the beneficiary, the limitation avoids reimbursing costs which the beneficiary did not incur. \n\n\n(132)As a valuable type of financial support not related to predictable costs, the use of prizes should be facilitated and the applicable rules should be\u00a0clarified. Prizes should be seen as complementing, not substituting, other funding instruments such as grants.\n\n\n(133)In order to allow for the more flexible implementation of prizes, the obligation to announce prizes of value of EUR 1 000 000 or more in the statements accompanying the draft budget should be replaced by prior information of the European Parliament and an explicit announcement of such prizes in the financing decision. \n\n\n(134)Prizes should be subject to the principles of transparency and equal treatment. In that context, the minimum characteristics of contests should be laid down, notably the conditions for paying the prize to the winners in case of award, and the appropriate publication means. It is also necessary to establish a clearly defined award procedure, from submission of the entries to information of applicants and notification to the winning applicant, which mirrors the procedure for award of grants.\n\n\n(135)This Regulation should lay down the principles and conditions for financial instruments, budgetary guarantees and financial assistance and the rules on the limitation of the financial liability of the Union, the fight against fraud and money laundering, the winding down of financial instruments and reporting.\n\n\n(136)In recent years the Union has increasingly used financial instruments that allow a higher leverage of the EU budget to be achieved but, at the same time, they generate a financial risk for that budget. Among those financial instruments are not only the financial instruments already covered by the Financial Regulation, but also other instruments such as budgetary guarantees and financial assistance that previously have been governed only by the rules established in their respective basic acts. It is important to establish a common framework to ensure the homogeneity of the principles applicable to that set of instruments and to regroup them under a new Title, comprising sections on budgetary guarantees and on financial assistance to Member States or third countries in addition to the existing rules applicable to Financial Instruments.\n\n\n(137)Financial instruments can be valuable in multiplying the effect of Union funds when those funds are pooled with other funds and include a leverage effect. Financial instruments should only be implemented if there is no risk of market distortion or inconsistency with state aid rules.\n\n\n(138)Within the framework of the annual appropriations authorised by the European Parliament and the Council for a given programme, financial instruments should be used on the basis of an ex ante evaluation demonstrating that they are effective for the achievement of the Union's policy objectives.\n\n\n(139)Financial instruments, budgetary guarantees and financial assistance should be authorised by means of a basic act. Where financial instruments are established without a basic act in duly justified cases, they should be authorised by the European Parliament and the Council in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n(140)The instruments that potentially fall under Title X, such as loans, guarantees, equity investments, quasi-equity investment and risk-sharing instruments should be defined. The definition of risk-sharing instruments should allow for the inclusion of credit enhancements for project bonds, covering the debt service risk of a project and mitigating the credit risk of bond holders through credit enhancements in the form of a loan or a guarantee.\n\n\n(141)Any reflow from a financial instrument should be used for the instrument which produced them with a view to enhance the efficiency of the instrument and possibly reduce the allocation of fresh resources from the budget to that instrument, unless specified otherwise in the basic act.\n\n\n(142)It is appropriate to recognise the alignment of interests in pursuing Union policy objectives and, in particular, that the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund have the specific expertise to implement financial instruments.\n\n\n(143)The European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, acting as a group, should have the possibility to transfer part of the implementation to each other, where it may benefit the implementation of a given action and as further defined in the relevant agreement with the Commission. \n\n\n(144)It should be clarified that, where financial instruments are combined with other forms of support from the Union budget, the rules on financial instruments should apply. Such rules should be complemented, where applicable, by specific requirements stemming from the sector specific legislation. \n\n\n(145)In addition, the implementation of financial instruments and budgetary guarantees should comply with Union's tax policy objectives and achievements regarding tax avoidance, in particular aggressive tax planning and tax good governance. In that respect, attention should be given to the Commission Recommendation on aggressive tax planning (C(2012)8806), the Commission Recommendation regarding measures to encourage third countries to apply minimum standards of good tax governance in tax matters (C(2012)8805), the Commission Communication on an Anti-Tax Avoidance Package: Next steps towards delivering effective taxation and greater tax transparency in the EU (COM(2016)23), includingin particular the Commission Communication on an External Strategy for Effective Taxation (COM(2016)24), and related developments at Union level.\n\n\n(146)Budgetary guarantees and financial assistance to Member States or third countries are off-budget operations that have a significant impact on the balance sheet of the Union. While remaining off-budget operations, their inclusion in the Financial Regulation provides a stronger protection of the financial interests of the Union and a clearer framework for their authorisation, management and accounting.\n\n\n(147)The Union has recently launched important initiatives based on budgetary guarantees such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) or the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD). The characteristics of those instruments are that they generate a contingent liability for the Union and imply the provisioning of funds to make available of a liquidity cushion that allows the budget to respond in an orderly manner to the payment obligations that may arise from those contingent liabilities. In order to guarantee the credit rating of the Union and, hence, its capacity to deliver effective financing, it is essential that the authorisation, provisioning and monitoring of contingent liabilities follow a robust set of rules that should be applied to all budgetary guarantees.\n\n\n(148)The contingent liabilities arising from budgetary guarantees may cover a wide range of financing and investment operations. The possibility of the budgetary guarantee being called cannot be scheduled with full certainty on a yearly basis as in the case of loans that have a defined schedule for repayment. It is, therefore, indispensable to set up a framework for the authorisation and monitoring of contingent liabilities ensuring the full respect, at any moment, of the annual ceiling for payments established in the Decision (EC, Euratom) 2007/436 on the system of own resources of the Union.\n\n\n(149)That framework should also provide for management and control, including reporting regularly on the financial exposure of the Union. The rate of provisioning of financial liabilities should be set on the basis of a proper risk assessment of the financial risks stemming from the related instrument. The sustainability of the contingent liabilities should be assessed annually in the context of the annual budgetary procedure. An early warning mechanism should be established to avoid a shortage of provisions to cover financial liabilities.\n\n\n(150)The increasing use of financial instruments, budgetary guarantees and financial assistance requires a significant volume of payment appropriations to be mobilised and provisioned. In order to deliver leverage while ensuring an adequate level of protection against financial liabilities, it is important to optimise the amount of provisioning required and to achieve efficiency gains by pooling those provisions into a common provisioning fund. In addition, the more flexible use of those pooled provisions permits an effective global provisioning rate that delivers the protection requested with an optimised amount of resources.\n\n\n(151)The rules applicable to provisioning and to the common provisioning fund should provide a solid internal control framework. The guidelines for the asset management of the provisions should be established at the level of the Commission after having consulted the accounting officer. The authorising officers should actively monitor the financial liabilities under their responsibility and the authorising officer for the common provisioning fund should manage the cash and the assets in the fund following the rules and procedures set out by the accounting officer.\n\n\n(152)Budgetary guarantees and financial assistance should follow the same set of principles already established for financial instruments. Budgetary guarantees, in particular, should comply with the following principles: they should be irrevocable, unconditional and on demand; they should be indirectly implemented or, only in exceptional cases, directly; they may only cover financing and investment operations and their counterparts should contribute with their own resources to the operations covered.\n\n\n(153)Financial assistance to Member States or third countries should take the form of a loan, of a credit line or any other instrument deemed appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the support. The resources to be provided are borrowed by the Commission that should be empowered to that end, on the capital markets or from financial institutions, avoiding the involvement of the Union in any transformation of maturities that would expose it to an interest risk or any other market risk.\n\n\n(154)The provisions related to financial instruments should apply as soon as possible and at the latest from 1 January 2018 in order to achieve the simplification and effectiveness sought. The provisions related to the budgetary guarantees and to financial assistance, as well as the common provisioning fund, should apply as from the post 2020 multiannual financial framework. That calendar will allow a thorough preparation of the new tools for managing contingent liabilities. It will also permit an alignment between the principles set out in the Title X and, on the one hand, the proposal for the multiannual financial framework after 2020 and, on the other hand, the specific programmes related to the latter.\n\n\n(155)On 22 October 2014 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 (5) repealing Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 and laying down new rules for, inter alia, the funding of political parties and political foundations at European level, in particular with regard to funding conditions, the award and distribution of funding, donations and contributions, financing of campaigns for elections to the European Parliament, reimbursable expenditure, the prohibition of funding, accounts, reporting and audit, implementation and control, penalties, cooperation between the Authority for European political parties and foundations, the Authorising Officer of the European Parliament and the Member States, and transparency. This Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2017.\n\n\n(156)Rules should be included on contributions from the general budget of the Union to European political parties as envisaged by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014. Those rules should allow political parties at European level to have a broader degree of flexibility as regards the time limits for using those contributions, as the nature of their activities so requires.\n\n\n(157)The financial support given to European political parties should take the form of a specific contribution, to match the specific needs of the European political parties.\n\n\n(158)Although financial support is awarded without an annual work programme being required, European political parties should justify ex post the sound use of Union funding. In particular, the authorising officer responsible should verify if the funding has been used to pay reimbursable expenditure as established in the call for contributions within the time limits laid down in this Regulation. Contributions to European political parties should be spent by the end of the financial year following that of their award, after which, any unspent funding should be recovered by the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\n(159)Union funding awarded to finance the operating costs of the European political parties should not be used for other purposes than those established in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014, in particular to directly or indirectly finance other entities such as national political parties. The European political parties should use the contributions to pay a percentage of current and future expenditure and not expenditure or debts incurred before the submission of their applications for contributions.\n\n\n\n\n(160)The award of contributions should also be simplified and adapted to the specificities of the European political parties, in particular by the absence of selection criteria, the establishment of a single full prefinancing payment as a general rule, and by the possibility to use lump sums, flat-rate, unit cost financing and financing not linked to costs of the relevant operations.\n\n\n(161)The contributions from the general budget of the Union should be suspended, reduced or terminated if the European political parties infringe the obligations laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014.\n\n\n(162)Penalties that are based both on the Financial Regulation and on Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014, should be imposed in a coherent way and should respect the principle of ne bis in idem. In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014, administrative and/or financial penalties provided for by the Financial Regulation are not to be imposed in one of the cases for which penalties have already been imposed on the basis of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014.\n\n\n(163)This Regulation should establish a general framework under which budget support may be used as an instrument in external action including the obligation for the third country to provide the Commission adequate and timely information to evaluate the fulfilment of the agreed conditions and provisions ensuring the protection of the financial interests of the Union.\u00a0\n\n\n(164)The Commission should be authorised to create and manage Union trust funds for emergency, post-emergency or thematic actions not only in external actions but also in EU-internal actions. Recent events in the European Union show the need for increased flexibility for funding within the EU. As the boundaries between external and internal policies are increasingly blurred, this would also provide a tool for replying to cross-border challenges. It is necessary to specify the principles applicable to the contributions to Union Trust Funds, to clarify the responsibilities of the financial actors and of the Board of the Trust Fund. It is also necessary to define rules ensuring a fair representation of the participating donors in the Board of the Trust Fund and a mandatory positive vote of the Commission for the use of the funds.\n\n\n(165)In line with the streamlining of the existing rules and in order to avoid undue repetition, the Part two of the Financial Regulation, dedicated to special provisions applicable to the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, to Research, external action and to specific EU funds, should be removed. The provisions of this Part two should be either introduced in the relevant parts of the Financial Regulation, or, in case the provisions are not used or no longer relevant, simply deleted.\n\n\n(166)The provisions on the presentation of accounts and accounting should be simplified and clarified.\u00a0It is therefore relevant to gather all provisions on annual accounts and other financial reporting under a specific Title.\n\n\n(167)The manner in which the institutions currently report on building projects to the European Parliament and the Council should be maintained. Institutions should be allowed to finance new building projects with the appropriations received for buildings already sold, therefore a reference to assigned revenue provisions should be introduced. This would allow meeting the changing needs in the building policy of the institutions, while saving costs and introducing more flexibility. \n\n\n(168)In order to adapt technical elements and detailed rules on procurement and on the rules applicable to certain Union bodies, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the Annex to this Regulation, the Framework Financial Regulation for bodies set up under the TFEU and the Euratom Treaty and the Model Financial Regulation for public-private partnership bodies. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(169)In order to improve agility of implementation of special instruments, it is appropriate to simplify mobilisation and transfer procedures by using Commission internal transfers for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Union Solidarity Fund. \n\n\n(170)In order to ensure that the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) provides swiftly adequate resources to support changing political priorities, the indicative shares for each of the three axis and the minimum percentages for each of the thematic priorities within the individual axis should allow for a greater flexibility. This should improve the management of the Programme and allow focussing budgetary resources on actions producing better employment and social results. \n\n\n(171)In order to facilitate investments in cultural and sustainable tourism infrastructure, without prejudice to the full application of EU environmental legislation, in particular the Directives on Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment as appropriate, certain restrictions as regards the scope of support for these investments should be removed.\n\n\n(172)With a view to responding to the challenges posed by increasing flows of migrants and refugees, the objectives to which the ERDF may contribute in its support of migrants and refugees should be spelled out. \n\n\n(173)As the amendment of provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n provides more favourable conditions for certain revenue generating operations for which amounts or rates of support are defined in Annex II to EMFF Regulation it is necessary to establish a different date of entry into force for these provisions to ensure equal treatment of operations supported on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n\n\n(174)With a view to facilitating the implementation of operations the scope of potential beneficiaries should be enlarged. Therefore, natural persons should be eligible for cohesion policy support.\n\n\n(175)With a view to ensure sound financial management in ESI Funds which are managed under shared implementation, and clarify Member States obligations, the general principles should explicitly refer to the principles of internal control of budget implementation and of avoidance of conflict of interests established in the Financial Regulation.\n\n\n(176)In view of maximising the synergies between all Union funds to address the challenges of migration and asylum in an effective way, it should be ensured that, when the thematic objectives are translated into priorities in the Fund-specific rules, such priorities cover the appropriate use of each Fund for these areas. \n\n\n(177)In order to ensure coherence of programming, an alignment between Partnership Agreements and operational programmes should be carried out once per year.\n\n\n(178)In view of optimising the use of the financial resources allocated to Member States under Cohesion policy, it is necessary to allow Member States to transfer ESI Funds allocation to instruments established under the Financial Regulation or under sector specific Regulations.\n\n\n(179)In order to facilitate the preparation and implementation of community-led local development strategies the lead fund should be allowed to cover preparatory, running and animation costs. \n\n\n\n\n(180)In order to facilitate the implementation of community-led local development and integrated territorial investments, the roles and responsibilities of local action groups in the case of community-led local development strategies and local authorities, regional development bodies or non-governmental organisations in the case of ITIs in relation to other programme bodies should be clarified. Designation as intermediate body should only be required in cases where the relevant bodies carry out tasks which go beyond those described in the relevant Article or where it is required by the Fund specific rules.\n\n\n(181)It is necessary to clarify that managing authorities should have the possibility to implement financial instruments through a direct contract award to the EIB and to international financial institutions (IFIs).\n\n\n(182)Many Member States have established publicly-owned banks or financial institutions that operate under a public policy mandate to promote economic development. Such banks or financial institutions have specific characteristics which differentiate them from private commercial banks in relation to their ownership, their development mandate and the fact that they do not have the objective of maximising profits. The role of such banks is notably to mitigate market failures, where in certain regions or for certain policy areas or sectors financial services are underprovided by commercial banks. These publicly-owned banks or financial institutions are well-placed to promote access to the ESI funds while maintaining competitive neutrality. Their specific role and characteristics can allow Member States to increase the use of financial instruments for delivering ESI funds in order to maximise the impact of these funds in the real economy. Such an outcome would be in line with the Commission policy to facilitate the role of such banks or institutions as fund managers both in the implementation of ESI funds as well as in the combination of ESI funds with EFSI financing, as set out in particular in the Investment Plan for Europe. It is justified therefore to allow managing authorities to award contracts directly to such public banks or financial institutions. Nevertheless, in order to ensure that this possibility of direct award remains consistent with the principles of the internal market, strict conditions to be fulfilled by public banks or institutions should be laid down for this provision to be applicable.\n\n\n(183)In order to maintain the option of the SME Initiative as an instrument to help increase the competitiveness of the SMEs, it is necessary to provide that Member States can contribute to joint uncapped guarantee and securitisation financial instruments in favour of SMEs during the entire programming period and to update relevant provisions relating to this option, such as those on ex-ante assessments and evaluations. \n\n\n(184)In adopting Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2015 on the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the European Investment Advisory Hub and the European Investment Project Portal \u2013 the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) \u2013 it was desired to enable\u00a0Member States to use ESI Funds to contribute to the financing of eligible projects that are supported by the EU guarantee covered by the EFSI.\u00a0A specific provision should be introduced to set out the terms and conditions to allow for better interaction and complementarity that will facilitate the possibility to combine ESI funds with EIB financial products under the EFSI's Union Guarantee.\n\n\n(185)In order to simplify and harmonise the control and audit requirements and to improve the accountability of the financial instruments implemented by EIB and other International Financial Institutions, it is necessary to amend the provisions on management and control for financial instruments to facilitate the assurance process.\n\n\n(186)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the model of the control reports and the annual audit reports as defined in Article 40(1) of this Regulation. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n.\n\n\n(187)In order to ensure consistency with the treatment of financial corrections during the 2007-2013 programming period, it is necessary to clarify that in the case of financial instruments, it should be possible to allow for an individual irregularity to be replaced by regular expenditure within the same operation so that the related financial correction will not have the consequence of a net loss for the financial instrument operation.\n\n\n(188)In order to incentivise private investors to co-invest in public policy projects, the concept of differentiated treatment of investors, which allows under specific conditions that ESI Funds can take a subordinated position to a private investor and EIB financial products under the EFSI's EU Guarantee, should be introduced. At the same time, the conditions for application of such a differentiated treatment when implementing ESI funds should be laid down.\n\n\n(189)Given the protracted low interest environment and in order not to unduly penalise bodies implementing financial instruments, it is necessary, subject to active and diligent treasury management, to enable financing of negative interest generated as a result of investments of ESI Funds pursuant to Article 43 of the Common Provisions Regulation from resources paid back into the financial instrument.\n\n\n(190)In order to align reporting requirements with the new Article 43(a) on differentiated treatment of investors and to avoid a duplication between the 'value of investments' in Article 46(2)(h) and 'equity investments' in Article 46(2)(i), it is necessary to update Article 46 of the Common Provisions Regulation. \n\n\n(191)In order to facilitate the implementation of the ESI funds, it is necessary to grant Member States the possibility of direct award for technical assistance actions implemented by EIB/EIF, other IFIs and publicly-owned banks or financial institutions. \n\n\n(192)With a view to facilitate the implementation of revenue generating operations, reduction of the co-financing rate should be allowed at any time of the programme implementation and possibilities for the establishment offlat rate net revenue percentages at national level should be provided. \n\n\n(193)Due to the late adoption of the Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0and the fact that aid intensity levels have been established by that Regulation, it is necessary to set out certain exemptions for the EMFF as regards revenue generating operations.\n\n\n(194)To reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries the threshold which exempts certain operations from calculating and taking into account revenue generated during their implementation should be raised. \n\n\n(195)In order to facilitate synergies between ESI Funds and other Union instruments, expenditure incurred may be reimbursed from different ESI Funds and Union instruments based on a proportion agreed in advance.\n\n\n(196)In order to promote the use of lump sums, and given the fact that lump sums need to be based on a fair, equitable and verifiable calculation method which should ensure sound financial management, the applicable upper limit for their use should be removed.\n\n\n(197)In view of the aim to reduce the addministrative burden of the implementation of projects by beneficiairies a new form of simplified costs option for financing based on conditions others than costs of operations should be introduced.\n\n\n(198)Taking into account the fact that, in accordance with Article 71 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the obligation to ensure the durability of investment operations applies from the last payment to the beneficiary, and that, when the investment consists in the lease purchase of a new machinery and equipment, the last payment occurs at the end of the contract period, this obligation should not apply to this type of investment.\n\n\n(199)In order to ensure a broad application of simplified cost options, an obligatory use of standard scales of unit costs, lump sums or flat rates should be set out for operations below a certain threshold for the ERDF and ESF. At the same time the use of draft budgets as an additional methodology for determining simplified costs should be introduced.\n\n\n\n\n(200)In order to facilitate earlier and more targeted application of simplified cost options, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the definition of the standard scales of unit costs or the flat rate financing, the fair, equitable and verifiable method on which they may be established, and the financing based on the fulfilment of conditions related to the realisation of progress in implementation or the achievement of objectives of programmes rather than on costs. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n\n(201)In order to reduce the administrative burden, the use of flat rates which do not require a methodology to be established by Member States should be increased. Two additional flat rates should therefore be introduced; one for calculating direct staff costs and the other one for calculating the remaining eligible costs based on staff costs. In addition, further clarification should be provided on the methods to calculate staff costs.\n\n\n(202)With a view to improving the effectiveness and impact of operations implementation of nation-wide operations or operations covering different programme areas should be facilitated and possibilities for expenditure outside the Union for certain investments should be increased .\n\n\n(203)In order to encourage Member States to make use of major projects appraisal by independent experts, the declaration of expenditure relating to the major project to the Commission prior to the positive appraisal by the independent expert should be allowed once the Commission has been informed about the submission of the relevant information to the independent expert.\n\n\n(204)In order to promote the use of joint action plans which will reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries it is necessary to reduce regulatory requirements linked to the setting up of a joint action plan.\n\n\n(205)In order to avoid unnecessary administrative burden for beneficiaries, the rules on information and communication should respect the principle of proportionality. Accordingly, it is important to clarify the scope of application of the rules on information and communication.\n\n\n(206)With a view to reducing the administrative burden and ensuring the effective use of technical assistance across Funds and categories of regions flexibility for the calculation and monitoring of the respective limits applicable to technical assistance of Member States should be increased \n\n\n(207)With a view to streamline implementation structures, it should be clarified that the possibility for the managing authority, certifying authority and the audit authority to be part of the same public body is also available to programmes under the European Territorial Cooperation Goal.\n\n\n(208)The responsibilities of the managing authorities regarding the verification of expenditure when simplified cost options are being used should be specified more in detail.\n\n\n(209)To ensure that beneficiaries can fully benefit from the simplification potential of e-governance solutions in the implementation of the ESI Funds and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), especially with a view to facilitating full electronic document management, it is necessary to clarify that a paper trail is not necessary if certain conditions are met. \n\n\n(210)In order to ensure equal treatment of operations supported on the basis of this Regulation, it is necessary to establish the date of application of certain amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n.\n\n\n(211)With a view to facilitate certain target groups' access to the ESF, the collection of data for certain indicators should be based on representative samples and twice in the programming period.\n\n\n(212)In order to ensure legal certainty and harmonised and non-discriminatory implementation of support to young farmers, it is necessary to provide that in the context of Rural Development the \"date of setting up\", referred to in the relevant rules, is the date when the setting up process begins by means of an action to be performed by the applicant, and that the application for support is to be submitted within 24 months from that date. Moreover, experience from the negotiations of the programmes has shown that rules for joint setting up of young farmers and thresholds for access to support required in Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 should be clarified, and that provisions on duration of the business plan should be streamlined.\n\n\n(213)In order to be sufficiently attractive to the private sector, it is essential that financial instruments are designed and implemented in a flexible manner. However, experience has shown that certain measure-specific eligibility rules limit the uptake of financial instruments in the rural development programmes, as well as the flexible use of financial instruments by fund managers. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide that certain measure-specific eligibility rules do not apply to financial instruments. For the same reason, it is also appropriate to provide that start-up support to young farmers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 may also be provided in the form of financial instruments. In view of these changes, it should be provided that where support for investments under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 is granted in the form of financial instruments, the investment must contribute to one or more Union priorities for rural development.\n\n\n(214)Nowadays farmers are exposed to increasing economic risks as a consequence of market developments. However, those economic risks do not affect all agricultural sectors equally. Consequently, Member States should have the possibility, in duly justified cases, to help farmers with sector-specific income stabilisation tools, in particular for sectors affected by a severe income drops, which would have a significant economic impact for a specific rural area, provided that the international obligations of the Union are respected. In addition, in order to monitor the expenditure made in relation to this new tool, the content of the financial plan of the programme should be adapted. Moreover, the specific reporting requirement for the risk management measure in 2018 referred to in Article 36(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 is already covered by the report to the European Parliament and the Council on the monitoring and evaluation of the CAP referred to in Article 110(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. Therefore the second subparagraph of Article 36(5) should be deleted.\n\n\n(215)Concerning mutual funds, it appears that the prohibition of any contribution by public funds to initial capital stock laid down in Articles 38(3) and 39(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 hinders the effective functioning of these funds. This prohibition should therefore be deleted\n\n\n(216)Support for investments for the restoration of production potential after natural disasters and catastrophic events under Articles 18(1)(b) and 24(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 is usually granted to all eligible applicants. Therefore, Member States should not be obliged to define selection criteria for restoration operations. Moreover, in duly justified cases, where it is not possible to define selection criteria due to the nature of the operations, Members States should be allowed to define alternative selection methods.\n\n\n(217)Article 59 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 defines the maximum EAFRD contribution rates. In order to ease the pressure on the national budget of some Member States and to accelerate much-needed investments in Cyprus, the maximum contribution rate of 100% referred to in Article 59(4)(f) should be extended until the programme closure. In addition, a reference to the specific contribution rate introduced in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 for the new financial instrument referred to in point (c) of Article 38(1) of the same Regulation should be mentioned in Article 59(4). \n\n\n(218)Pursuant to Article 60(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, in cases of emergency measures due to natural disasters, eligibility of expenditure relating to programme changes may start from the date when the natural disaster occurred. This possibility to make eligible expenditure made before the submission of a programme amendment should be extended to other circumstances, such as catastrophic events or a significant and sudden change in the socio-economic conditions of the Member State or region, including sudden and significant demographic changes resulting from migration or reception of refugees.\n\n\n(219)According to the second subparagraph of Article 60(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, in respect of investments in the agricultural sector, only expenditure incurred after the submission of an application is eligible. Members States should be given the possibility to provide in their programmes that, where the investment is related to emergency measures due to natural disasters, catastrophic events or adverse climatic events or a significant and sudden change in the socio-economic conditions of the Member State or region, expenditure incurred after the occurrence of event is eligible.\n\n\n\n\n(220)In order to increase the use of the simplified cost options referred to in points (b) to (d) of Article 67(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to limit the EAFRD specific rules laid down in Article 62(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 to aid granted in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 21(1), concerning income forgone and maintenance costs, and Articles 28 to 31, 33 and 34 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.\n\n\n(221)Article 74 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 requires the Member States to consult the Monitoring Committee of the rural development programme on the selection criteria within four months from the approval of the programme. This creates an indirect obligation for the Member States to have defined all the selection criteria by that date even for the calls for applications which will be launched subsequently. In order to reduce unnecessary administrative burden, whilst ensuring that financial resources are used in the best possible way, the Member States should be allowed to define the selection criteria and to ask for the opinion of the Monitoring Committee at any time before the publication of the calls for applications.\n\n\n(222)The financial discipline is used to ensure that the budget for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund complies with the respective annual ceilings and to establish the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector. Given the technical character of the determination of the adjustment rate and its inherent links with the Commission's estimates of expenditure set out in its annual Draft Budget, the procedure for setting the adjustment rate should be simplified by authorising the Commission to adopt it in accordance with the advisory procedure. The new Financial Regulation does not define the population of beneficiaries eligible for reimbursement of financial discipline. The present regulation should be adapted to that while maintaining the current definition of eligible beneficiaries.\n\n\n(223)In order to harmonise the rules on automatic decommitment of Article 87 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Article 38 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the date by which Member States have to send to the Commission information on exceptions to the decommitment, referred to in Article 38(3), should be adapted.\n\n\n(224)In order to provide for the legal clarity as regards the treatment of the recoveries generated from the temporary reductions under Article 41(2)\u00a0of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the latter should be included in the list of sources of the assigned revenue under Article 43 of that Regulation.\n\n\n(225)Experience has shown that the rule, first introduced with Regulation (EU) No 1290/2005, of equally sharing between the budget and the Member States the risk of the lack of recovery of sums due for irregularities when these sums had not been recovered within reasonable deadlines (so called 50/50 rule), has worked well for the safeguarding of the budget. However, such a system entails a heavy administrative and book-keeping burden for both the European Commission and the Member States. It is therefore considered appropriate to further change this approach and charge the related sums entirely to the Member States concerned after the expiry of the related deadlines allowing them, on the other side, to keep in their national budgets the sums subsequently recovered at the end of the related recovery procedures.\n\n\n(226)In order to ensure that the refusal or recovery of payments affected by a non-compliance with public procurement rules reflects the gravity of such non-compliance and respects the principle of proportionality, such refusal or recovery should be limited to the levels laid down by the Commission for financial corrections to be made to expenditure under shared implementation for non-compliance with such rules. It is further appropriate to clarify that such non-compliances affect the legality and regularity of the transactions only by the same level.\n\n\n(227)The experience gained so far shows that through implementing the three criteria for being regarded an active farmer, listed in the third subparagraph of Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n22\n, has proven difficult for many Member States. In order to reduce the administrative burden associated with the implementation of the three criteria, Member States should have the possibility of making available only one or two of them. The experience further shows that in some Member States the administrative costs of implementing the active farmer clause as a whole outweighs the benefit of excluding a very limited number of non-active beneficiaries from the direct support schemes. In order to allow Member States to address such situations in future claim years, the application of Article 9 as a whole should become optional for them.\n\n\n(228)The experience gained in the first year of implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 has shown that certain Member States applying the single area payment scheme did not use the entire amount of the funds available under the budgetary ceilings laid down in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2015/1089. Member States applying the basic payment scheme have already the possibility, within certain limits, of distributing payment entitlements for a higher value than the amount available for their basic payment scheme in order to ensure a more efficient use of the funds. Member States applying the single area payment scheme should also be allowed, within the same common limits and without prejudice to the respect of the net ceilings for direct payments, to calculate the necessary amount by which their single area payment scheme ceiling may be increased.\n\n\n(229)In order to ensure a maximum outreach of the young farmer payment under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, it is appropriate for Member States to limit the number of payment entitlements or eligible hectares but only in cases where this limitation serves to ensure respecting the relevant provisions on financing the young farmer payment.\n\n\n(230)Pursuant to Article 52 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, Member States may grant, under certain conditions, coupled support to farmers in specific agricultural sectors or types of farming, to the extent necessary to create an incentive to maintain current levels of production in the sectors or regions concerned. In order to avoid that the levels of production are to be maintained where this is not appropriate due to structural market imbalances, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts allowing that voluntary coupled support can continue to be paid until 2020 on the basis of the production units for which such support was granted in a past reference period. In the context of the current crisis this temporary derogation aims at attaining in the long term the objective of voluntary coupled support of maintaining the level of production in the areas concerned.\u00a0\n\n\n(231)One of the major obstacles to the formation of producer organisations, mainly in Member States which are lagging behind as regards the degree of organisation, appears to be the lack of mutual trust and past experiences. In this context, coaching, whereby producer organisations which are functioning show the way to other producer organisations, producer groups or individual producers of fruit and vegetables, could offset that obstacle and should thus be included among the objectives of producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector.\n\n\n(232)In addition to withdrawals for free distribution, it is also appropriate to grant coaching actions intended to encourage producers to set up organisations meeting the criteria to be recognised a full Union financing within the operational programmes of existing producer organisations.\n\n\n(233)Crisis prevention and management measures should be extended to cover refilling of mutual funds which could as new instruments help to combat crises.\n\n\n(234)In Member States where the organisation of production in the fruit and vegetables sector is weak, granting of additional national financial contributions should be allowed.\n\n\n(235)In order to ensure an efficient, targeted and sustainable support of producer organisations and their associations in the fruit and vegetables sector, the power to adopt certain acts should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the list of Member States that may grant national financial assistance to producer organisations.\n\n\n(236)In order to simplify the current procedure of first authorising Member States to grant additional national financial assistance to producer organisations in regions of the Union where the organisation degree is particularly low and second reimbursing a part of the national financial assistance if further conditions are complied with, a new system could be established. Member States where the organisation rate is particularly low was below 20% at national level in 2013 could grant an additional percentage of the value of the marketed production as national aid with a result similar to the current scheme of prior authorisation and subsequent Union reimbursement. The Commision should regularly review the list of Member States that may grant additional national assistance to keep it updated.\n\n\n(237)The experience gained through the application of Article 188 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n23\n has proven that the need to adopt implementing acts for the management of simple, mathematical processes linked to the way quotas are allocated is cumbersome and resource intense without any specific advantage linked to such an approach. The Commission has in fact no margin of discretion in this context considering that the related formula is already fixed by the provisions of Article 7 (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) 1301/2006\n24\n. In order to reduce the related administrative burden and streamline the process it should be provided that the Commission makes the results of the allocation of the import tariff quotas public through an appropriate web-publication. Moreover a specific provision should be included providing that Member States should only issue licences following the publication of the allocation results by the Commission.\n\n\n(238)The EGF should continue after 31 December 2017 to temporarily provide assistance to young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) who reside in regions eligible under the Youth Employment Initiative, since those regions are disproportionately impacted by major redundancies.\n\n\n(239)In order to increase the efficiency of the intervention, a blending facility or blending facilities may be established under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Such blending facilities should finance blending operations which are actions combining non-reimbursable forms of support and/or financial instruments from the Union budget, including combination of CEF equity and CEF debt financial instruments, and financing from EIB Group (including EIB financing under EFSI) development or other finance institutions as well as investors. \n\n\n\n\n(240)A blending facility under CEF should aim to enhance the multiplier effect of Union spending by attracting additional resources from private investors. In addition, it should ensure that the actions supported become economically and financially viable.\n\n\n(241)In order to support the implementation of projects with most value added for the Trans European Transport Network concerning the Core Network Corridors, cross border projects and projects on the other sections of the Core Network, it is necessary to allow flexibility in the use of the multiannual work programme allowing to reach up to 95% of the financial budgetary resources indicated in the Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.\n\n\n(242)Only grants and procurement may currently be used to support actions in the area of Digital Service Infrastructures. In order to ensure as efficient as possible, financial instruments should also be made available to support these actions.\n\n\n(243)The intervention in the area of Digital Service Infrastructures should be based on simple and flexible principles to enable the Union react to emerging political priorities and related funding needs. In particular, to achieve the objectives of an intervention in a given area it may be necessary to finance \"gateway services\" linking one or more national infrastructure(s) to core service platform(s) such as elements of a given Digital Service Infrastructure: computing, data storage and management, connectivity.\n\n\n(244)In order to avoid unnecessary administrative burden for managing authorities that could hinder efficient implementation of the FEAD, it is appropriate to simplify and facilitate the procedure for amendment of non-essential elements of operational programmes. \n\n\n(245)With a view to further simplify the use of the FEAD, it is appropriate to establish additional provisions as regards eligibility of expenditure, in particular, as regards the use of standard scales of unit costs, lump sums and flat rates.\n\n\n(246)In order to avoid unfair treatment of partner organisations, irregularities that are imputable only to the body in charge of purchasing the assistance, should not affect the eligibility of expenditure of partner organisations.\n\n\n(247)It is appropriate to clarify the definition of 'eligibility rules' in order to ensure legal certainty in operations supported by the FEAD.\n\n\n(248)In order to simplify the implementation of the FEAD and avoid legal uncertainty, certain responsibilities of Member States on management and control should be clarified.\n\n\n(249)In order to simplify the implementation of the ESI Funds and the FEAD and avoid legal uncertainty, certain responsibilities of Member States on management and control should be clarified.\n\n\n(250)Regulation (EU) No 652/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n25\n provides for the possibility to divide budgetary commitments into annual instalments only in the case of approval of multiannual programmes for the eradication, control and surveillance of animal diseases and zoonoses, for survey programmes concerning the presence of pests and for programmes concerning the control of pests in outermost regions of the Union. In the interest of simplification and in order to reduce the administrative burden this possibility should be extended to the other actions provided for in Regulation (EU) No 652/2014.\n\n\n(251)The Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) support framework established by Decision No 541/2014/EU is financed from the budgets of three Union funding programmes, Copernicus programme established by Regulation (EU) No 377/2014, satellite navigation programmes established by Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013 and specific programme implementing Horizon 2020 established by Council Decision No 2013/743/EU. As a result, the SST support framework has been subject to three sets of applicable rules. This has led to suboptimal implementation of the framework and caused disproportionate administrative burden for the Commission and the beneficiaries. While the aims, objectives and the scope of each of the three funding programmes need to be respected, in order to simplify the implementation of the SST support framework in the future, only one set of rules should be applicable to the award and management of grants within SST support framework.\n\n\n(252)This Regulation should be revised only when necessary, and at the latest two years before the end of each multiannual financial framework. Excessively frequent revisions generate a disproportionate cost in adjusting administrative structures and procedures to the new rules. Furthermore, time may be too short to allow for valid conclusions to be drawn from the application of the rules in force.\n\n\n(253)Transitional provisions should be set out. In order not to hamper the application of the relevant sector-specific rules which may refer to grant decisions, it is appropriate to specify that grants decisions may still be adopted in accordance with their basic act. In order to ensure the transition with the new adoption mechanism of decisions authorising the use of lump sum, unit costs or flat rates, it is appropriate to allow the authorising officer responsible to amend the relevant existing decisions.\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nPART ONE\n\nFINANCIAL REGULATION\n\n\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation lays down the rules for the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union and of Euratom and the presentation and auditing of the accounts.\n\n\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n1.\u2018applicant\u2019 means a natural person or an entity with or without a legal personality who has submitted an application in a grant award procedure or in a contest for prizes;\n\n\n2.\u2018application documents\u2019 means a tender, a request to\u00a0participate, a grant application or an application in a contest for prizes;\n\n\n3.\u2018award\u00a0procedure\u2019\u00a0means\u00a0a\u00a0procurement\u00a0procedure,\u00a0a\u00a0grant award procedure, a contest for prizes,\u00a0or a procedure for the selection of experts or entities implementing\u00a0Union funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61 (1);\n\n\n4.\u2018basic act\u2019 means a legal act which provides a legal basis for an action and for the implementation of the corresponding expenditure entered in the budget or of the budgetary guarantee or financial assistance backed by the budget.\n\n\nA basic act may take any of the following forms:\n\n\n(a)in implementation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (the Euratom Treaty), the form of a regulation, a directive or a decision within the meaning of Article 288 TFEU; or\n\n\n(b)in implementation of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), one of the forms specified in Articles 28(1), 31(2), 33, 42(4) and 43(1)TEU.\n\n\nRecommendations and opinions shall not constitute basic acts.\n\n\n5.\u2018beneficiary\u2019 means a natural person or\u00a0an entity with or without a legal personality with whom a grant agreement has been signed;\n\n\n6.\u2018blending operation\u2019 means an action carried out within a blending facility which combines non-repayable forms of support and/or financial instruments from the EU budget and financial instruments from development or other public finance institutions as well as from commercial finance institutions and investors.

However, for the cash-flow purposes referred to in Article 76, the accounting officer and, in the case of imprest accounts, the imprest administrators, and, for the needs of the administrative management of the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS), the authorising officer responsible, shall be authorised to carry out operations in other currencies.\n\n\n\n\n2.Without prejudice to specific provisions arising from the application of sector-specific regulations, or from specific procurement contracts, grant agreements, contribution agreements and financing agreements, conversion by the responsible authorising officer shall be made using the daily euro exchange rate published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union of the day on which the payment order or recovery order is drawn up by the authorising department.\n\n\nIf no such daily rate is published, the responsible authorising officer shall use the one referred to in paragraph 3.\n\n\n3.For the purposes of the accounts provided for in Articles 80\u00a0and\u00a081,\u00a0conversion between the euro and another currency shall be made using the monthly accounting rate of the euro. That accounting exchange rate shall be established by the Commission\u2019s accounting officer by means of any source of information regarded as reliable, on the basis of the exchange rate on the penultimate working day of the month preceding that for which the rate is established.\n\n\n4.Currency conversion operations shall be carried out in such a way as to avoid having a significant impact on the level of the Union co-financing or a detrimental impact on the Union budget. Where appropriate, the rate of conversion between the euro and other currencies may be calculated using the average of the daily exchange rate in a given period.\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\nPrinciple of universality\n\n\nArticle 19\n\nScope\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 20, total revenue shall cover total payment appropriations.

Those so empowered shall act within the limits of the powers expressly conferred upon them.\n\n\n\n\n2.However, the Commission may delegate its powers of budget implementation concerning the operational appropriations of its own section to the Heads of Union delegations and, in order to ensure business continuity during their absence, to the deputy Heads of Delegations. When Heads of Union delegations act as subdelegated authorising officers of the Commission and their deputies in the absence of the latter, they shall apply the Commission rules for the implementation of the budget and shall be subject to the same duties, obligations and accountability as any other subdelegated authorising officer of the Commission.\n\n\nThe Commission may withdraw the delegation in accordance with its own rules.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, the High Representative shall take the measures necessary to facilitate cooperation between Union delegations and Commission departments.\n\n\n3.The EEAS may exceptionally delegate its powers of budget implementation concerning the administrative appropriations of its own section to Commission staff of the delegation where this is necessary in order to ensure the continuity in the administration of Delegations\u00a0in the absence of the EEAS competent authorising officer. In the exceptional cases where Commission staff of Union Delegations act as sub-delegated authorising officers of the EEAS, they shall apply the EEAS internal rules for the implementation of the budget and shall be subject to the same duties, obligations and accountability as any other sub-delegated authorising officer of the EEAS.\n\n\nThe EEAS may withdraw the delegation in accordance with its own rules.\n\n\nArticle 59\n\nConflict of interest\n\n\n1.Financial actors as defined in Chapter 4 of Title IV and other persons involved under direct, indirect and shared implementation\u00a0in budget implementation and management, including acts preparatory thereto, audit or control shall not take any action which may bring their own interests into conflict with those of the Union. They shall also take appropriate measures to prevent conflict of interest from arising in the functions under their responsibility and to address situations which may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of paragraph 1, a conflict of interest exists where the impartial and objective exercise of the functions of a financial actor or other person, as referred to in paragraph 1, is compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect personal interest.\n\n\nArticle 60\n\nConflict of interest of members of the staff\n\n\nWhere the risk of conflict of interest referred to in Article 59 involves a member of the staff covered by the Staff Regulations, he or she shall refer the matter to the authorising officer by delegation who shall confirm in writing whether a conflict of interest exists. The member of the staff in question shall also inform his or her hierarchical superior. Where a conflict of interest is found to exist, the Appointing Authority shall relieve the official from responsibility in this matter. The authorising officer by delegation shall personally ensure that any further appropriate action is taken.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\nMethods of implementation\n\n\nArticle 61\nMethods of implementation of the budget\n\n\n1.The Commission shall implement the budget in any of the following ways:\n\n\n(a)directly (\u2018direct\u00a0implementation\u2019), by its departments, including its staff in the Union delegations under the authority of their respective Head of delegation, in accordance with Article 58(2), or through executive agencies as referred to in Article 68;\n\n\n(b)under shared implementation with Member States (\u2018shared implementation\u2019);\n\n\n(c)indirectly (\u2018indirect implementation'), where this is provided for in the basic act or in the cases referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 56(2), with:\n\n\n(i)third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\n\n(ii)international organisations or their agencies, as defined in Article 151;\n\n\n(iii)the European Investment Bank\u00a0or the European Investment Fund ('the EIB group');\n\n\n(iv)bodies referred to in Articles 69 and 70;\n\n\n\n\n(v)public law bodies;\n\n\n(vi)bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n(vii)bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\n\n(viii)bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act.\n\n\n2.The Commission is responsible for the implementation of the budget in accordance with Article 317 TFEU and shall not delegate implementation of the budget to third parties, where such tasks involve a large measure of discretion implying political choices.\n\n\nThe Commission shall not, through contracts in accordance with Title VII, outsource tasks involving the exercise of public authority and discretionary powers of judgement.\n\n\nArticle 62\n\nShared implementation with Member States\n\n\n1.Where the budget is implemented under shared implementation the Commission and the Member States shall respect the principles of sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination and shall ensure the visibility of Union action. To this end, the Commission and the Member States shall fulfil their respective control and audit obligations and assume the resulting responsibilities laid down in this Regulation. Complementary provisions shall be laid down in sector-specific rules. \n\n\n2.Member States shall take all the necessary measures, including legislative, regulatory and administrative measures, to protect the Union's financial interests, namely by:\n\n\n(a)ensuring that actions financed from the budget are implemented correctly and effectively and in accordance with the applicable sector-specific rules and, for that purpose, designating in accordance with paragraph 3, and supervising bodies responsible for the management and control of Union funds; \n\n\n(b)preventing, detecting and correcting irregularities and fraud.\n\n\nIn order to protect the Union's financial interests, Member States shall, respecting the principle of proportionality, and in compliance with this Article, and the relevant sector-specific rules, carry out ex ante and ex post controls including, where appropriate, on-the-spot checks on representative and/or risk- based samples of transactions. They shall also recover funds unduly paid and bring legal proceedings where necessary in this regard. \n\n\nMember States shall impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties on recipients where provided for in sector- specific rules and in specific provisions in national legislation. \n\n\nAs part of its risk assessment and in accordance with sector- specific rules, the Commission shall monitor the management and control systems established in the Member States. The Commission shall, in its audit work, respect the principle of proportionality and shall take into account the level of assessed risk in accordance with the sector-specific rules. \n\n\n3.In accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in sector-specific rules, Member States shall, at the appropriate level, designate bodies to be responsible for the management and control of Union funds. Such bodies may also carry out tasks not related to the management of Union funds and may entrust certain of their tasks to other bodies, including the bodies indicated in Article 61(1) (c) (ii) and (iii).\n\n\nWhen deciding on the designation of bodies, Member States may base their decision on whether the management and control systems are essentially the same as those already in place for the previous period and whether they have functioned effectively.\n\n\nIf audit and control results show that the designated bodies no longer comply with the criteria set out in the sector-specific rules, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that deficiencies in the implementation of the tasks of these bodies are remedied, including by ending the designation in accordance with the sector-specific rules.\n\n\nThe sector-specific rules shall define the role of the Commission in the process set out in this paragraph.\n\n\n4.Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall:\n\n\n(a)set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system; \n\n\n\n\n(b)use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner; \n\n\n(c)provide the information required under paragraph 5; \n\n\n(d)ensure ex post publication in accordance with Article 36(2). Any processing of personal data shall comply with national provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC. \n\n\n5.Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall, by 15 February of the following financial year, provide the Commission with:\n\n\n(a)their accounts on the expenditure that was incurred, during the relevant reference period as defined in the sector-specific rules, in the execution of their tasks and that was presented to the Commission for reimbursement. Those accounts shall include pre-financing and sums for which recovery procedures are underway or have been completed. They shall be accompanied by a management declaration confirming that, in the opinion of those in charge of the management of the funds: \n\n\n(i)the information is properly presented, complete and accurate, \n\n\n(ii)the expenditure was used for its intended purpose, as defined in the sector-specific rules, \n\n\n(iii)the control systems put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions; \n\n\n(b)an annual summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and extent of errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned.\n\n\nThe accounts referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph and the summary referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the accounts give a true and fair view, whether expenditure for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular, and whether the control systems put in place function properly. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph. \n\n\nThe deadline of 15 February may exceptionally be extended by the Commission to 1 March, upon communication by the Member State concerned. \n\n\nMember States may, at the appropriate level, publish the information referred to in this paragraph. \n\n\nIn addition, Member States may provide declarations signed at the appropriate level based on the information referred to in this paragraph.\n\n\n6.In order to ensure that Union funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules, the Commission shall:\n\n\n(a)apply procedures for the examination and acceptance of the accounts of the designated bodies, ensuring that the accounts are complete, accurate and true; \n\n\n(b)exclude from Union financing expenditure for which disbursements have been made in breach of applicable law; \n\n\n(c)interrupt payment deadlines or suspend payments where provided for in the sector-specific rules. \n\n\nThe Commission shall end all or part of the interruption of payment deadlines or suspension of payments after a Member State has presented its observations and as soon as it has taken any necessary measures. The annual activity report referred to in Article 73(9) shall cover all the obligations under this subparagraph. \n\n\n7.Sector-specific rules shall take account of the needs of European Territorial Cooperation programmes as regards, in particular, the content of the management declaration, the process set out in paragraph 3 and the audit function.\n\n\n8.The Commission shall compile a register of bodies responsible for management, certification and audit activities under the sector-specific regulations.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to promote best practices in the implementation of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the EAGF and the European Fisheries Fund, the Commission may, for information purposes, make available a methodological guide setting out its own control strategy and approach, including checklists, and best practice examples to bodies responsible for management and control activities. That guide shall be updated whenever necessary.\n\n\n9.Resources allocated to Member States under shared implementation may also be used in combination with operations and instruments carried out under Regulation 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2015 on the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the European Investment Advisory Hub and the European Investment Project Portal and amending Regulations (EU) No 1291/2013 and (EU) No 1316/2013.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nEUROPEAN OFFICES AND UNION BODIES\n\n\nSection 1\n\neuropean offices\n\n\nArticle 63\n\nDefinition and scope\n\n\n1.\"European offices\" are administrative structures set up by the Commission or by the Commission with one or more institutions to perform specific cross-cutting tasks, provided that that can be justified by a cost-benefit study and an assessment of the associated risks.\n\n\n2.Within their scope of their competences, European offices:\n\n\n(a)shall perform obligatory tasks\u00a0provided for in their act of establishment or in other Union legislation;\n\n\n(b)may perform non-obligatory tasks authorised by their Management Committees having considered the costs-benefits and associated risks for the parties involved. For the performance of these tasks the office may receive delegation of authorising officer powers, or may conclude\u00a0ad hoc service-level agreements with the Union institutions, Union bodies, other European offices or third parties.\n\n\n3.This Section shall apply to the operation of European Anti-Fraud Office, with the exception of paragraph 4 of this Article, Article 65 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 66.\n\n\n4.The internal auditor of the Commission shall exercise all responsibilities laid down in Chapter 8 of this Title.\n\n\nArticle 64\n\nAppropriations regarding the European Offices\n\n\n1.The appropriations authorised to implement obligatory tasks of each European office shall be entered in a specific budget line within the section of the budget relating to the Commission and shall be set out in detail in an Annex to that section.\n\n\nThe Annex referred to in the first subparagraph shall take the form of a statement of revenue and expenditure, subdivided in the same way as the sections of the budget.\n\n\nThe appropriations entered in that Annex: \n\n\n(a)shall cover all the financial requirements of each European office in the performance of the obligatory tasks provided for in its act of establishment or in other Union legislation;\n\n\n(b)may cover financial requirements of a European office in the performance of tasks requested by the Union institutions, Union bodies, European offices and agencies established by or under the Treaties and authorised in accordance with the act of establishment of the office;\n\n\n2.The Commission shall, in respect of the appropriations entered in the Annex for each European office delegate the powers of authorising officer to the Director of the European office concerned, in accordance with Article 72.\n\n\n3.Each European office's establishment plan shall be annexed to that of the Commission.\n\n\n4.The Director of each European office shall take decisions on transfers within the Annex referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of such transfers.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 65\n\nNon-obligatory tasks\n\n\nFor the non-obligatory tasks referred to in point (b) of Article 63(2), a European office may: \n\n\n(a)receive delegation to its Director from Union institutions, Union bodies and other European offices, together with a delegation of the authorising officer powers concerning appropriations entered in the section of the budget of the Union institution, Union body or other European office. The Union institutions, Union bodies and other European offices concerned shall set the limits and conditions for this delegation of powers. Such delegation shall be agreed in accordance with the act of establishment of the European office, notably on the conditions and modalities of this delegation;\n\n\n(b)conclude ad hoc service-level agreements. In such cases, the Director of the European office shall adopt, in accordance with its act of establishment, the specific provisions governing the implementation of those tasks, the recovery of costs incurred, and the keeping of the corresponding accounts. The office shall report to the institutions, Union bodies or other European offices concerned of the results of such accounts.\n\n\nArticle 66\n\nAccounts of the European offices\n\n\n1.Each European office shall draw up accounting records of its expenditure, enabling the proportion of its services supplied to each of the institutions, Union bodies or other European offices to be determined. The Director of the European office concerned shall adopt, after approval by its Management Committee, the criteria upon which the accounting records shall be based.\n\n\n2.The remarks concerning the specific budget line in which the total appropriations for each European office to which authorising officer powers have been delegated in accordance with point (a) of Article 65\u00a0are entered shall show an estimate of the costs of services supplied by that office to each of the Union institutions, Union bodies and other European offices concerned. This shall be based on the accounting records provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n\n3.Each European office to which authorising officer powers have been delegated in accordance with point (a) of Article 65 shall notify the Union institutions, Union bodies and other European offices concerned of the results of the accounting records provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n\n4.Each European office's accounts shall form an integral part of the Union's accounts in accordance with\u00a0Article 234.\n\n\n5.The Commission accounting officer, acting on a proposal from the Management Committee of the European office in question, may delegate to a member of the staff of the office some of his tasks relating to the collection of revenue and the payment of expenditure made directly by the European office in question.\n\n\n6.To meet the cash requirements of the European office, bank accounts or post office giro accounts may be opened in its name by the Commission, acting on a proposal from the Management Committee. The final cash position for each year shall be reconciled and adjusted between the European office in question and the Commission at the end of the financial year.\u00a0\n\n\nSection 2\n\nUnion bodies\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 67\n\nApplicability to the Euratom Supply Agency\u00a0\n\n\nThis Regulation shall apply to the implementation of the budget for the Euratom Supply Agency.\n\n\nArticle 68\n\nExecutive agencies\u00a0\n\n\n1.The Commission may delegate powers to the executive agencies to implement all or part of a Union programme or project, including pilot projects and preparatory actions and the implementation of administrative expenditures, on its behalf and under its responsibility, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a058/2003\u00a0(\n36\n). The executive agencies shall be created by means of a Commission Decision and shall be legal persons under Union law. They shall receive an annual contribution.\n\n\n2.The directors of the executive agencies shall act as authorising officers by delegation as regards the implementation of the operational appropriations relating to the Union programmes which they manage in whole or in part.\n\n\n3.The steering committee of the executive agencies may agree with the Commission that the accounting officer of the Commission shall also act as accounting officer of the executive agency. The steering committee may also entrust the accounting officer of the Commission with part of the tasks of the accounting officer of the executive agency taking into account cost-benefit considerations. In both cases, necessary arrangements shall be made in order to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\n\nArticle 69\n\nBodies set up under the TFEU and the Euratom Treaty\n\n\n1.The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 261 to supplement the Financial Regulation with a framework financial regulation for bodies which are set up under the TFEU and the Euratom Treaty and which have legal personality and receive contributions charged to the budget.\n\n\n\n\n2.The framework financial regulation shall be based on the principles and rules set out in this Regulation.\n\n\n3.The financial rules of those bodies shall not depart from the framework financial regulation except where their specific needs so require and with the Commission's prior consent.\n\n\n4.Discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1, shall be given by the European Parliament on the recommendation of the Council. The bodies referred to in paragraph 1 shall fully cooperate with the institutions involved in the discharge procedure and provide, as appropriate, any additional necessary information, including through attendance at meetings of the relevant bodies.\n\n\n5.The Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the same powers over the bodies referred to in paragraph 1 as those exercised in respect of the Commission.\n\n\n6.An independent external auditor shall verify that the annual accounts of each of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article properly present the income, expenditure and financial position of the relevant body prior to the consolidation in the Commission's final accounts. Unless otherwise provided in the basic act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Court of Auditors shall prepare a Specific Annual Report on each body in line with the requirements of Article 287(1) TFEU. In preparing this report, the Court shall consider the audit work performed by the independent external auditor and the action taken in response to the auditor's findings.\n\n\nArticle 70\n\nPublic-private partnership bodies\n\n\nThe bodies having legal personality set up by a basic act and entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership shall adopt their financial rules.\n\n\nThose rules shall include a set of principles necessary to ensure sound financial management of Union funds.\n\n\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 261 to supplement the Financial Regulation with a model financial regulation laying down the principles necessary to ensure sound financial management of Union funds and which shall be based on Article 149.\n\n\nThe financial rules of those bodies shall not depart from the model financial regulation except where their specific needs so require and with the Commission's prior consent.\n\n\nParagraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 69 shall apply to public-private partnership bodies.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nFinancial actors\n\n\nSECTION 1\nPRINCIPLE OF SEGREGATION OF DUTIES\n\n\nArticle 71\nSegregation of duties\n\n\n1.The duties of authorising officer and accounting officer shall be segregated and mutually exclusive.\n\n\n2.Each institution shall provide each financial actor with the resources required to perform his duties and a charter describing in detail his tasks, rights and obligations.\n\n\nSECTION 2\nAUTHORISING OFFICER\n\n\nArticle 72\n\nAuthorising officer\n\n\n1.Each institution shall perform the duties of authorising officer.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of this Title, the term \u2018staff\u2019 refers to persons covered by the Staff Regulations.\n\n\n\n\n3.Each institution shall delegate, in compliance with the conditions in its rules of procedure, the duties of authorising officer to staff of an appropriate level. It shall indicate, in its internal administrative rules, the staff to whom it delegates those duties, the scope of the powers delegated and whether the persons to whom those powers are delegated may subdelegate them. \n\n\n4.The powers of authorising officer shall be delegated or subdelegated only to staff.\n\n\n5.Authorising officers responsible shall act within the limits set by the instrument of delegation or subdelegation. The authorising officer responsible may be assisted by one or more members of staff entrusted, under his or her responsibility, with the carrying out of certain operations necessary for the implementation of the budget and the production of the financial and management information.\n\n\n6.Each institution or each body referred to in Article 69 shall inform the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament, the Council and the accounting officer of the Commission within two weeks of the appointment and release of authorising officers by delegation, internal auditors and accounting officers, and of any internal rules it adopts in respect of financial matters.\n\n\n7.Each institution shall inform the Court of Auditors of the appointment of imprest administrators and of delegation decisions under Article 78 and Article 85.\n\n\nArticle 73\n\nPowers and duties of the authorising officer\n\n\n1.The authorising officer shall be responsible in each institution for implementing revenue and expenditure in accordance with the principle of sound financial management and for ensuring compliance with the requirements of legality and regularity and equal treatment of recipients of a programme.\n\n\n2.For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the authorising officer by delegation shall, in accordance with Article 34\u00a0and the minimum standards adopted by each institution and having due regard to the risks associated with the management environment and the nature of the actions financed, put in place the organisational structure and the internal control systems suited to the performance of his or her duties. The establishment of such structure and systems shall be supported by a comprehensive risk analysis, which takes into account their cost effectiveness.\n\n\n3.To implement expenditure, the authorising officer responsible shall make budgetary and legal commitments, shall validate expenditure and authorise payments and shall undertake the preliminary steps for the implementation of appropriations.\n\n\n4.Implementation of revenue shall comprise drawing up estimates of amounts receivable, establishing entitlements to be recovered and issuing recovery orders. It shall involve waiving established entitlements, where appropriate.\n\n\n5.Each operation shall be subject at least to an ex ante control relating to the operational and financial aspects of the operation, on the basis of a multiannual control strategy which takes risk into account. The purpose of the ex ante controls is to prevent errors and irregularities before the authorisation of operations.\n\n\nThe extent in terms of frequency and intensity of the ex ante controls shall be determined by the authorising officer responsible taking into account the results of prior controls as well as risk-based and cost-effectiveness considerations. In case of doubt, the authorising officer responsible for validating the relevant operations shall request complementary information or perform an on-the-spot control in order to obtain reasonable assurance as part of the ex ante control. \n\n\nFor a given operation, the verification shall be carried out by staff other than those who initiated the operation. The staff who carry out the verification shall not be subordinate to the members of staff who initiated the operation.\n\n\n6.The authorising officer by delegation may put in place ex post controls to detect and correct errors and irregularities or operations after they have been authorised. Such controls may be organised on a sample basis according to risk and shall take account of the results of prior controls and cost-effectiveness considerations.\n\n\nThe ex post controls shall be carried out by staff other than those responsible for the ex ante controls. The staff responsible for the ex post controls shall not be subordinate to the members of staff responsible for the ex ante controls. \n\n\nWhere the authorising officer by delegation implements financial audits of beneficiaries as ex-post controls, the related audit rules shall be clear, consistent and transparent, and shall respect the rights of both the Commission and the auditees.\n\n\n7.Authorising officers responsible and staff responsible for budget implementation shall have the necessary professional skills.\n\n\nIn each institution, the authorising officer by delegation shall ensure the following:\n\n\n(a)that the authorising officers by sub-delegation and their staff receive regularly updated and appropriate information concerning the control standards and the methods and techniques available for that purpose;\n\n\n(b)that measures are taken, where needed, to ensure the effective and efficient functioning of the control systems in accordance with paragraph 2.\n\n\n\n\n8.If a member of staff, involved in the financial management and control of transactions, considers that a decision he or she is required by his or her superior to apply or to agree to is irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial management or the professional rules which that member of staff is required to observe, he or she shall inform his or her hierarchical superior accordingly. If the member of staff does so in writing, the hierarchical superior shall reply in writing. If the hierarchical superior fails to take action or confirms the initial decision or instruction and the member of staff believes that such confirmation does not constitute a reasonable response to his or her concern, the member of staff shall inform the authorising officer by delegation in writing. If that officer does not reply within a reasonable time given the circumstances of the case and, in any event, within a month at most, the member of staff shall inform the relevant panel referred to in Article 139. \n\n\nIn the event of any illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the interests of the Union, the member of staff shall inform the authorities and bodies designated in the Staff Regulations and the decisions of the Union institutions concerning the terms and conditions for internal investigations in relation to the prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity detrimental to the Union's interests. Contracts with external auditors carrying out audits of the financial management of the Union shall provide for an obligation of the external auditor to inform the authorising officer by delegation of any suspected illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the interests of the Union.\n\n\n9.The authorising officer by delegation shall report to his or her institution on the performance of his or her duties in the form of an annual activity report containing financial and management information, including the results of controls, declaring that, except as otherwise specified in any reservations related to defined areas of revenue and expenditure, he or she has reasonable assurance that:\n\n\n(a)the information contained in the report presents a true and fair view;\n\n\n(b)the resources assigned to the activities described in the report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principle of sound financial management;\n\n\n(c)the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.\n\n\nThe annual activity report shall include information on the operations carried out, by reference to the objectives set in the strategic plans, the risks associated with those operations, the use made of the resources provided and the efficiency and effectiveness of internal control systems. This includes an overall assessment of the costs and benefits of controls and information on the extent to which the operational expenditure authorised contributes to the achievement of EU strategic objectives and generates EU added value. The Commission shall prepare a summary of the annual activity reports for the preceding year.\n\n\n10.The authorising officer by delegation shall record, for each financial year, contracts concluded by the negotiated procedures referred to in points (a) to (f) of point\u00a011.1 and point\u00a039 of the Annex to this Regulation. If the proportion of negotiated procedures in relation to the number of contracts awarded by the same authorising officer by delegation increases significantly in relation to earlier years or if that proportion is distinctly higher than the average recorded for the institution, the authorising officer responsible shall report to the institution setting out any measures taken to reverse that trend. Each institution shall send a report on negotiated procedures to the European Parliament and Council. In the case of the Commission, that report shall be annexed to the summary of the annual activity reports referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article.\n\n\nArticle 74\n\nKeeping of supporting documents by authorising officers\n\n\nThe authorising officer shall set up paper-based or electronic systems for the keeping of original supporting documents relating to and subsequent to budget implementation and budget implementation measures.

The recovery order and the debit note shall be both drawn up by the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\nThe authorising officer shall send the debit note immediately after establishing the amount receivable and at the latest within a period of five years from the point at which the institution was, in normal circumstances, in a position to claim its debt. Such period shall not apply where the authorising officer responsible establishes that, despite the efforts which the institution has made, the delay in acting was caused by the debtor\u2019s conduct, particularly time-wasting manoeuvres or bad faith.\n\n\nThe recovery order shall be the operation by which the authorising officer responsible instructs the accounting officer to recover the amount established.\n\n\n3.To establish an amount receivable the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that:\n\n\n(a)the receivable is certain, meaning that it is not subject to any condition;\n\n\n(b)the receivable is of fixed amount, expressed precisely in cash terms;\n\n\n(c)the receivable is due and is not subject to any payment time;\n\n\n(d)the particulars of the debtor are correct;\n\n\n(e)the amount to be recovered is booked to the correct budget item;\n\n\n(f)the supporting documents are in order; and\n\n\n(g)the principle of sound financial management is complied with, in particular with regard to the criteria referred to in point (a) or (b) of second subparagraph of Article 99(2).\n\n\n4.The debit note shall be to inform the debtor that\n\n\n(a)the Union has established the amount receivable;\n\n\n(b)if payment of the debt is made before the deadline, as specified in the debit note, no default interest will be due;\n\n\n(c)failing reimbursement by the deadline referred to in point (b) the debt shall bear interest at the rate referred to in Article\u00a097, without any prejudice to any specific regulations applicable;\n\n\n(d)failing reimbursement by the deadline referred to in point (b) the institution shall effect recovery either by offsetting or by enforcement of any guarantee lodged in advance;\n\n\n(e)the accounting officer may in exceptional circumstances effect recovery by offsetting before the deadline referred to in point (b), where it is necessary to protect the Union\u2019s financial interests when he has justified grounds to believe that the amount due to the Commission would be lost, after the debtor has been informed of the reasons and date of the recovery by offsetting;\n\n\n(f)if, after taking all the steps set out in points (a) to (e) of this subparagraph, the amount has not been recovered in full, the institution shall effect recovery by enforcement of a decision secured either in accordance with Article 98(2) or by legal action.\n\n\nWhere following the verification of the particulars of the debtor or on the basis of other relevant information available at the time, it is clear that the debt falls under cases referred to in points (a) or (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 99(2), or that the debit note has not been sent according to paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorising officer may, after establishing the amount receivable, decide to proceed directly to the waiver according to the provisions laid down in Article 99 without sending a debit note, in agreement with the accounting officer. \n\n\nIn all other cases, the authorising officer shall print out the debit note and send it to the debtor. The accounting officer shall be informed of that dispatch through the financial information system.\n\n\n\n\n5.Amounts wrongly paid shall be recovered.\n\n\nArticle 97\nDefault interest\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to any specific provisions deriving from the application of specific regulations, any amount receivable not repaid on the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4) shall bear interest in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.\n\n\n2.Except in the case referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, the interest rate for amounts receivable not repaid on the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4) shall be the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in force on the first calendar day of the month in which the deadline falls, increased by:\n\n\n(a)eight percentage points where the obligating event is a public supply and service contract referred to in Title V;\n\n\n(b)three and a half percentage points in all other cases.\n\n\n3.Interest shall be calculated from the calendar day following the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4) and specified in the debit note up to the calendar day on which the debt is repaid in full.\n\n\nThe recovery order corresponding to the amount of the default interest shall be issued when this interest is actually received.\n\n\n4.In the case of fines or other penalties, the interest rate for amounts receivable not paid by the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4) shall be the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in force on the first calendar day of the month in which the decision imposing a fine or other penalty has been adopted, increased by:\n\n\n(a)one and a half percentage points where the debtor provides a financial guarantee which is accepted by the accounting officer instead of payment;\n\n\n(b)three and a half percentage points in all other cases.\n\n\nWhere the Court of Justice of the European Union, in the exercise of its competence under Article 261 TFEU, increases the amount of a fine or other penalty, interest on the amount of the increase shall run from the date of the judgment of the Court.\n\n\nIn cases where the overall interest rate would be negative it will be set at zero percentage points.\n\n\nSECTION 4\nAUTHORISATION OF RECOVERY\n\n\nArticle 98\nAuthorisation of recovery\n\n\n1.The authorisation of recovery is the act by which the authorising officer responsible instructs the accounting officer, by issuing a recovery order, to recover an amount receivable which that authorising officer responsible has established.\n\n\n2.The institution may formally establish an amount as being receivable from persons other than Member States by means of a decision which shall be enforceable within the meaning of Article 299 TFEU.\n\n\nIf the efficient and timely protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests so requires, the Commission may also, in exceptional circumstances, adopt such an enforceable decision for the benefit of other institutions at their request with respect to claims arising in relation to staff to whom the Staff Regulations apply or in relation to Members or former Members of an Union institution.\n\n\nThe exceptional circumstances are met when the possibility to have a voluntary payment and to recover the debt by offsetting as provided for in Article 99(1) of this Regulation have been exhausted by the institution concerned and the debt represents a significant amount. In such case, the institutions concerned other than those mentioned under Article 299 TFEU may request the Commission to adopt an enforceable decision.\n\n\nIn all cases, the enforceable decision shall specify that the amounts claimed shall be entered in the section of the budget corresponding to the institution concerned, which shall act as authorising officer. The revenue shall be entered as general revenue except if it falls within the specified cases of assigned revenues as provided for in Article 20(3).\n\n\n\n\nThe requesting institution shall inform the Commission of any event likely to alter the recovery and shall intervene in support of the Commission in case of appeal against the enforceable decision.\n\n\nThe Commission and the institution concerned shall agree on the practical modalities for the implementation of this Article.\n\n\nSECTION 5\nRECOVERY\n\n\nArticle 99\nRules on recovery\n\n\n1.The accounting officer shall act on recovery orders for amounts receivable duly established by the authorising officer responsible. The accounting officer shall exercise due diligence to ensure that the Union receives its revenue and shall ensure that the Union\u2019s rights are safeguarded.\n\n\nPartial reimbursement by a debtor subject to several recovery orders shall first be posted on the oldest entitlement unless otherwise specified by the debtor. Any partial payments shall first cover the interest.\n\n\nThe accounting officer shall recover amounts due to the Union budget by offsetting them against amounts owed to the debtor by the Union or an executive agency executing the Union budget. The claims related to those amounts shall be certain, of a fixed amount and due.\n\n\n2.Where the authorising officer responsible plans to waive or partially waive recovery of an established amount receivable, he or she shall ensure that the waiver is in order and is in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and proportionality. The waiver decision shall be substantiated. The authorising officer may delegate the waiver decision.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible may waive recovery of all or part of an established amount receivable only in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the waiver would not harm the image of the Union;\n\n\n(b)where the amount receivable cannot be recovered in view of its age, delay in the dispatch of the debit note in the terms defined in Article 96(2), or the insolvency of the debtor, or as a result of any other insolvency proceedings;\n\n\n(c)where recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.\n\n\n3.In the case referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2, the authorising officer responsible shall act in accordance with predetermined procedures established within each institution and shall apply the following criteria which are compulsory and applicable in all circumstances:\n\n\n(a)the facts, having regard to the gravity of the irregularity giving rise to the establishment of the amount receivable (fraud, repeated offence, intent, diligence, good faith, manifest error);\n\n\n(b)the impact that waiving recovery would have on the operation of the Union and its financial interests (amount involved, risk of setting a precedent, undermining of the authority of the law).\n\n\n4.Depending on the circumstances of the case, the authorising officer responsible may also have to take the following additional criteria into account:\n\n\n(a)any distortion of competition that would be caused by the waiving of recovery;\n\n\n(b)the economic and social damage that would be caused were the debt to be recovered in full.\n\n\n5.Each institution shall send to the European Parliament and Council each year a report on the waivers referred to in this paragraph involving EUR 100 000 or more. In the case of the Commission, that report shall be annexed to the summary of the annual activity reports referred to in Article 73(9).\n\n\n6.The authorising officer responsible may cancel an established amount receivable in full or in part. The partial cancellation of an established amount receivable does not imply the waiver of the remaining established Union entitlement.\n\n\n\n\nIn the event of a mistake, the authorising officer responsible shall cancel totally or partially the established amount receivable and include adequate reasons.\n\n\nEach institution shall lay down in its internal rules the conditions and procedure for delegating the power to cancel an established amount receivable.\n\n\n7.The Member States shall in the first instance be responsible for carrying out controls and audits and for recovering amounts unduly spent, as provided for in the sector-specific rules. To the extent that Member States detect and correct irregularities on their own account, they shall be exempt from financial corrections by the Commission concerning those irregularities.\n\n\n8.The Commission shall make financial corrections on Member States in order to exclude from Union financing expenditure incurred in breach of applicable law. The Commission shall base its financial corrections on the identification of amounts unduly spent, and the financial implications for the budget. Where such amounts cannot be identified precisely, the Commission may apply extrapolated or flat-rate corrections in accordance with the sector-specific rules.\n\n\nThe Commission shall, when deciding on the amount of a financial correction, take account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and the financial implications for the budget, including the case of deficiencies in management and control systems.\n\n\nThe criteria for establishing financial corrections and the procedure to be applied may be laid down in the sector-specific rules.\n\n\n9.The methodology for applying extrapolated or flat-rate corrections shall be laid down in accordance with the sectorspecific rules with a view to enabling the Commission to protect the financial interests of the Union.\n\n\nArticle 100\n\nRecovery by offsetting\n\n\n1.Where the debtor has a claim on the Union or on the executive agency when it implements the Union budget that is certain as defined in point (a) of Article 96(3), of a fixed amount and due relating to a sum established by a payment order, the accounting officer shall, following the deadline referred to in point (b) of first subparagraph of Article 96(4) recover established amounts receivable by offsetting.\n\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and where the accounting officer has justified grounds to believe that the amount due to the Union would be lost, the accounting officer may recover by offsetting before the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4).\n\n\nThe accounting officer shall also recover by offsetting before the deadline referred to in point (b) of first subparagraph of Article 96(4) when the debtor agrees.\n\n\n2.Before proceeding with any recovery in accordance with paragraph 1, the accounting officer shall consult the authorising officer responsible and inform the debtors concerned, including the means of redress in accordance with Article 129.\n\n\nWhere the debtor is a national authority or one of its administrative entities, the accounting officer shall also inform the Member State concerned at least 10 working days in advance of his intention to resort to recovery by offsetting. However, in agreement with the Member State or administrative entity concerned, the accounting officer may proceed with the recovery by offsetting before the deadline has passed.\n\n\n3.The offsetting referred to in paragraph 1 shall have the same effect as a payment and discharge the Union for the amount of the debt and, where appropriate of the interest due.\n\n\nArticle 101\nRecovery procedure failing voluntary payment\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to Article 100, if the full amount has not been recovered by the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4) and specified in the debit note, the accounting officer shall inform the authorising officer responsible and shall without delay launch the procedure for effecting recovery by any means offered by the law, including, where appropriate, by enforcement of any guarantee lodged in advance.\n\n\n2.Without prejudice to Article 100, where the recovery method referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be used and the debtor has failed to pay in response to the letter of formal notice sent by the accounting officer, the accounting officer shall enforce a recovery decision secured either in accordance with Article 98(2) or by legal action.\n\n\nArticle 102\nAdditional time for payment\n\n\nThe accounting officer, in collaboration with the authorising officer responsible, may allow additional time for payment only at the written request of the debtor, with due indication of the reasons, and provided that the following two conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(a)the debtor undertakes to pay interest at the rate specified in Article 97 for the entire additional period allowed, starting from the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(4);\n\n\n\n\n(b)in order to safeguard the rights of the Union, the debtor lodges a financial guarantee covering the debt outstanding in both the principal sum and the interest, which is accepted by the institution\u2019s accounting officer.\n\n\nThe guarantee referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph may be replaced by a joint and several guarantee by a third party approved by the institution\u2019s accounting officer.\n\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, following a request by the debtor, the accounting officer may waive the requirement of a guarantee referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph when, on the basis of his assessment, the debtor is willing and able to make the payment in the additional time period but is not able to lodge such guarantee and is in a distressed situation.\n\n\nArticle 103\nLimitation period\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to the provisions of specific regulations and the application of Council Decision on the system of own resources of the European Union , entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties and entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall be subject to a limitation period of five years.\n\n\n2.The limitation period for entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties shall begin to run on the expiry of the deadline communicated to the debtor in the debit note as specified in point (b) of the first subparagraph of\u00a0Article 96(4).\n\n\nThe limitation period for entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall begin to run on the date on which the payment of the third party\u2019s entitlement is due according to the corresponding legal commitment.\n\n\n3.The limitation period for entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties shall be interrupted by any act of an institution or Member State acting at the request of an institution, notified to the third party and aiming at recovering the debt.\n\n\nThe limitation period for entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall be interrupted by any act notified to the Union by its creditors or on behalf of its creditors aiming at recovering the debt.\n\n\n4.A new limitation period of five years shall begin to run on the day following the interruptions referred to in paragraph 3.\n\n\n5.Any legal action relating to an amount receivable as referred to in paragraph 2, including actions brought before a court which later declares itself not to have jurisdiction, shall interrupt the limitation period. The new limitation period of five years shall not begin until a judgment having the force of res judicata is given or there is an extrajudicial settlement between the same parties on the same action.\n\n\n6.Where the accounting officer allows the debtor additional time for payment in accordance with Article 102, this shall be considered as an interruption of the limitation period. The new limitation period of five years shall begin to run on the day following the expiry of the extended time for payment.\n\n\n7.Entitlements of the Union shall not be recovered after the expiry of the limitation period, as established in paragraphs 2 to 6.\n\n\nArticle 104\nNational treatment for Union entitlements\n\n\nIn the event of insolvency proceedings, Union entitlements shall be given the same preferential treatment as entitlements of the same nature due to public bodies in the Member States where the recovery proceedings are being conducted.\n\n\nArticle 105\nFines, penalties, sanctions and accrued interest imposed by the institutions\n\n\n1.Amounts received by way of fines, penalties and sanctions, and any accrued interest or other\u00a0income generated by them shall not be recorded as budgetary revenue as long as the decisions imposing them may be overruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n\n2.The amounts referred to in paragraph 1 shall be recorded as budgetary revenue as soon as possible and at the latest in the year following the exhaustion of all legal remedies. Amounts that are to be returned to the entity that paid them, following a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, shall not be recorded as budgetary revenue.\n\n\n3.Paragraph 1 shall not apply to decisions on clearance of accounts or financial corrections.\n\n\nArticle 106\nRecovery of fines,other penalties or sanctions imposed by the institutions\n\n\n\n\n1.Where an action is brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union against a decision of an institution imposing a fine or other penalty under the TFEU or Euratom Treaty and until such time as all legal remedies have been exhausted, the debtor shall either provisionally pay the amounts concerned on the bank account designated by the accounting officer of the Commission or provide a financial guarantee acceptable to the accounting officer of the Commission. The guarantee shall be independent of the obligation to pay the fine or penalty payment or other penalties and shall be enforceable upon first demand. It shall cover the claim as to principal and the interest due as specified in Article 97(4).\n\n\n2.The Commission shall secure the provisionally cashed amounts by having them invested in financial assets thus ensuring the security and liquidity of the monies whilst also aiming at yielding a positive return.\n\n\n3.After the exhaustion of all legal remedies and where the fine or penalty has been confirmed any of the following measures shall be taken:\n\n\n(a)the provisionally collected amounts and the return on them shall be entered into the budget in accordance with Article 105 at the latest during the financial year following the year in which all legal remedies have been exhausted;\n\n\n(b)where a financial guarantee has been lodged, the latter shall be enforced and the corresponding amounts entered in the budget.\n\n\nWhere the amount of the fine or of the penalty has been increased by the Court of Justice of the European Union, points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall apply up to the amounts of the original decision of the institution or, if applicable, to the amount defined in a former judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the same proceedings. The accounting officer of the Commission shall collect the amount corresponding to the increase and the interest due as specified in Article 97(4), which will be entered into the budget.\n\n\n4.After all legal remedies have been exhausted and where the fine or penalty has been cancelled or reduced any of the following measures shall be taken:\n\n\n(a)the amounts provisionally cashed,\u00a0or part thereof,\u00a0taking into account\u00a0any return\u00a0shall be repaid to the third party concerned;\u00a0\n\n\n(b)where a financial guarantee has been lodged, it shall be released accordingly.\n\n\nArticle 107\n\nCompensatory interests\n\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 97(2) and for cases other than those referred to in Article 105, when an amount has to be reimbursed following a Court of Justice of the European Union judgment or within an amicable settlement, the interest rate shall be the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in force on the first calendar day of the month, from the date of payment of this amount until the date at which the reimbursement is due increased by zero percentage points.\n\n\nIn cases where the overall interest rate would be negative it will be set at zero percentage points.\n\n\nCHAPTER\u00a07\nExpenditure operations\n\n\nArticle 108\n\nFinancing decisions\n\n\n1.The budgetary commitment shall be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution. This shall not apply in the case of appropriations for the operations of each institution under its administrative autonomy that can be implemented without a basic act in accordance with point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 56(2), of administrative support expenditure and of contributions to the bodies referred to in Articles\u00a069 and 70. The financing decisions shall be annual or multiannual.\n\n\n2.The financing decision shall also constitute at the same time the annual or multiannual work programme and shall be adopted as soon as possible after the adoption of the draft budget and in principle no later than 31 March of the year of implementation.\u00a0The part which contains the work programme shall be published on the internet site of the institution concerned immediately after its adoption and prior to its implementation. The financing decision shall indicate the total amount covered by the financing decision and contain a description of the actions to be financed. It shall specify:\n\n\n(a)the basic act and the budgetary line;\n\n\n(b)the objectives pursued and, the expected results;\n\n\n(c)the methods of implementation;\n\n\n(d)any additional information required by the basic act for the work programme.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, it shall set out the following:\n\n\n(a)for grants: type of applicants targeted by the call for proposals or direct award; global budgetary envelope reserved for grants;\n\n\n(b)for procurement: the global budgetary envelope reserved for the procurements;\n\n\n(c)for contributions to trust funds referred to in Article 227 the appropriations reserved for the trust fund for the year together with the amounts planned over its duration;\n\n\n(d)for prizes: the type of participants targeted by the contest, the global budgetary envelope reserved for the contest and specific reference to prizes with a unit value of EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\u00a0000 or more;\n\n\n(e)for financial instruments: the amount allocated to the financial instrument;\n\n\n(f)in the case of indirect implementation: the entity or person pursuant to point\u00a0(c) of Article 61(1) or, the criteria to be used to select the entity or person;\n\n\n(g)for contributions to blending facilities: the amount allocated to the blending facility and the list of entities participating in the blending facility;\n\n\n(h)for budgetary guarantees: the amount of annual provisioning and, when applicable, the amount of the budgetary guarantee to be released.\n\n\nThe authorising officer by delegation may add any additional information considered appropriate either in the respective financing decision constituting the work programme or in any other document published on the internet site of the institution.\n\n\nA multiannual financing decision shall be consistent with the financial programming referred to in Article\u00a039(2) and shall specify that the implementation of the decision is subject to the availability of budget appropriations for the respective financial years after the adoption of the annual budget or as provided for in the system of provisional twelfths, unless it is the basis for budgetary commitments broken down into annual instalments as referred to in Article 110(2).\n\n\n3.Without prejudice to any specific provision of a basic act, any substantial change in a financing decision already adopted shall follow the same procedure as the initial decision.\n\n\nArticle 109\n\nExpenditure operations\n\n\n1.Every item of expenditure shall be committed, validated, authorised and paid.\n\n\nAt the end of the periods referred to in Article\u00a0112, the unused balance of budgetary commitments shall be subject of a de-commitment.\n\n\nWhen executing operations, the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that the expenditure is in compliance with the Treaties, the budget, this Regulation, and other acts and regulations adopted pursuant to the Treaties as well as with the principle of sound financial management.\n\n\n2.Budgetary commitments and legal commitments shall be adopted by the same authorising officer, except in duly justified cases.\u00a0In particular, in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations, legal commitments may be signed by the Heads of Union delegations, or in their absence by their deputies, on the instruction of the Commission's authorising officer responsible who remains\u00a0fully responsible, however, for the underlying transaction. The personnel employed by the Commission in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations may sign legal commitments linked to the payment executed from the imprest accounts of a value not exceeding EUR 2\u00a0500.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible shall make a budgetary commitment before entering into a legal commitment with third parties or transferring funds to a trust fund referred to in Article 227.\n\n\nThis obligation shall not be applicable to:\n\n\n(a)legal commitments concluded following a declaration of a crisis situation in the framework of a business continuity plan, in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Commission or by any other institution under its administrative autonomy;\n\n\n\n\n(b)in the case of humanitarian aid operations, civil protection operations and crisis management aid, if efficient delivery of the Union's intervention requires that the Union enter into a legal commitment with third parties immediately and prior booking of the individual budgetary commitment is not possible. The booking of the budgetary commitment shall be done without delay after entering into a legal commitment with third parties.\n\n\n3.The validation of expenditure is the act whereby the authorising officer responsible accepts charging an item of expenditure, after checking the supporting documents attesting the creditor's entitlement as per the conditions set in the legal commitment when there is a legal commitment. For this purpose, the authorising officer responsible shall:\n\n\n(a)verify the existence of the creditor's entitlement;\n\n\n(b)determine or verify the reality and the amount of the claim through the endorsement \"certified correct\";\n\n\n(c)verify the conditions according to which payment is due.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the validation of expenditure shall not be limited to expenditure that is charged to the budget. It shall also apply to interim or final reports not associated with a request for payment in which case the impact on the accounting system will be limited to the general accounts. The validation decision shall be expressed through electronically secured signature as referred to in Article\u00a0141 by the authorising officer or by technically competent member of staff, duly empowered by a formal decision of the authorising officer or, exceptionally, for paper workflow, take the form of a stamp incorporating that signature.\n\n\nWith the endorsement \"certified correct\" the authorising officer responsible or a technically competent member of staff, duly empowered by the authorising officer responsible shall certify that:\n\n\n(a)for the pre-financing the conditions required in the legal commitment for the payment of the pre-financing are met;\n\n\n(b)for interim and balance payments in contracts the services provided for in the contract have been properly provided, the supplies properly delivered or that the work has been properly carried out;\n\n\n(c)for interim and balance payments in grants the action or work programme carried out by the beneficiary is in all respects in compliance with the grant agreement, including, where applicable that the costs declared by the beneficiary are eligible. The same principle is valid also for interim and final reports not associated to a payment request.\n\n\n4.The authorisation of expenditure is the act whereby the authorising officer responsible, having verified that the appropriations are available, instructs the accounting officer, by issuing a payment order, to pay an amount of expenditure which has been previously validated.\n\n\nWhere periodic payments are made with regard to services rendered, including rental services, or goods delivered, and subject to the authorising officer's risk analysis, the authorising officer may order the application of a direct debit system from an imprest account, or if specifically authorised by the accounting officer in accordance with Article 83(3).\n\n\n5.The de-commitment is the operation whereby the responsible authorising officer cancels wholly or partly the reservation of appropriations previously made with a budgetary commitment.\n\n\nArticle 110\n\nTypes of budgetary commitments\n\n\n1.Budgetary commitments shall fall into one of the following categories:\n\n\n(a)individual: when the recipient and the amount of the expenditure are known;\n\n\n(b)global: when at least one of the elements necessary to identify the individual commitment is still not known;\n\n\n(c)provisional: to cover routine management expenditure for the EAGF as referred to in Article 11(2) and routine administrative expenditure where either the amount or the final payees are not definitively known.\n\n\nRoutine administrative expenditure relating to Union delegations and Union Representations may however be covered by provisional commitments also when the amount and final payee are known.\n\n\n2.Budgetary commitments for actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into annual instalments only where the basic act so provides or where they relate to administrative expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n3.A global budgetary commitment shall be made on the basis of a financing decision.\n\n\nThe global budgetary commitment shall be made at the latest before the decision on the recipients and amounts is taken and, where implementation of the appropriations concerned involves the adoption of a work programme, at the earliest after that programme has been adopted. \n\n\n4.The global budgetary commitment shall be implemented either by the conclusion of a financing agreement, itself providing for the subsequent conclusion of one or more legal commitments, or by the conclusion of one or more legal commitments. \n\n\nFinancing agreements in the field of direct financial assistance to third countries, including budget support, which constitute legal commitments may give rise to payments without the conclusion of other legal commitments.\n\n\nWhere the global commitment is implemented by the conclusion of a financing agreement, the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 shall not apply.\n\n\n5.Each individual legal commitment adopted following a global budgetary commitment shall, prior to signature, be registered by the authorising officer responsible in the central budgetary accounts and booked to the global budgetary commitment.\n\n\n6.Provisional budgetary commitments shall be implemented by the conclusion of one or more legal commitments giving rise to an entitlement to subsequent payments. However, in cases relating to expenditure on staff management or relating to communication expenditures engaged in by the institutions for the coverage of Union events or in cases referred to in point 14.5 of the Annex to this Regulation, they may be implemented directly by payments.\n\n\nArticle 111\n\nCommitments for EAGF appropriations\n\n\n1.For each financial year, the EAGF appropriations shall include non-differentiated appropriations, with the exception of the expenditure related to the measures referred to in Article 4(2) and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1306/2013, with the exception of measures financed under non-operational technical assistance and contributions to executive agencies, which shall be covered by differentiated appropriations.\n\n\n2.The Commission decisions fixing the amount of reimbursement of such expenditure shall constitute global provisional commitments, which may not exceed the total appropriations entered for the EAGF.\n\n\n3.Global provisional commitments for the EAGF which have been made for a financial year and which have not given rise to a commitment on specific lines in the budget nomenclature by 1 February of the following financial year shall be cancelled in respect of the financial year concerned.\n\n\n4.Expenditure effected by the authorities and bodies referred to in the rules relating to the EAGF shall, within two months of receipt of the statements sent in by Member States, be the subject of a commitment by chapter, article and item. Such \n\n\n5.commitments may be made after the lapse of that two-month period where a procedure for a transfer of appropriations concerning the relevant budget lines is necessary.

Where such a decision is taken on the basis of paragraph 4 of Article 132, the information registered in the database shall include the information concerning the persons referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 132.\n\n\n3.The decision to exclude or impose financial penalties may be based on a final judgment or on a final administrative decision in the situations referred to in Article 132(1) or on a preliminary classification in law by the panel referred to in Article 139\u00a0in the situations referred to in Article 132(2) in order to ensure a centralised assessment of those situations. In the cases referred to in Article 137, the authorising officer responsible shall reject a participant from a given procedure.\n\n\nArticle 132\n\nExclusion criteria and administrative sanctions\n\n\n1.The authorising officer responsible shall exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) from participating in award procedures governed by this Regulation or from being selected for implementing Union funds where:\n\n\n(a)the person or entity is bankrupt, subject to insolvency or winding-up procedures, where its assets are being administered by a liquidator or by a court, where it is in an arrangement with creditors, where its business activities are suspended, or where it is in any analogous situation arising from a similar procedure provided for under EU or\u00a0national laws or regulations;\n\n\n(b)it has been established by a final judgment or a final administrative decision that the person or entity is in breach of its obligations relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions in accordance with the applicable law;\n\n\n(c)it has been established by a final judgment or a final administrative decision that the person or entity is guilty of grave professional misconduct by having violated applicable laws or regulations or ethical standards of the profession to which the person or entity belongs, or by having engaged in any wrongful conduct which has an impact on its professional credibility where such conduct denotes wrongful intent or gross negligence, including, in particular, any of the following:\n\n\n(i)fraudulently or negligently misrepresenting information required for the verification of the absence of grounds for exclusion or the fulfilment of eligibility or selection criteria or in the performance of the legal commitment;\n\n\n(ii)entering into agreement with other persons or entities with the aim of distorting competition;\n\n\n(iii)violating intellectual property rights;\n\n\n(iv)attempting to influence the decision-making of the authorising officer responsible during the award procedure;\n\n\n(v)attempting to obtain confidential information that may confer upon it undue advantages in the award procedure;\n\n\n(d)it has been established by a final judgment that the person or entity is guilty of any of the following: \n\n\n\n\n(i)fraud, within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, drawn up by the Council Act of 26 July 1995\n37\n; \n\n\n(ii)corruption, as defined in Article 3 of the Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union, drawn up by the Council Act of 26 May 1997\n38\n, and in Article 2(1) of Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA\n39\n, as well as corruption as defined in the applicable law;\n\n\n(iii)participation in a criminal organisation, as defined in Article 2 of Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA\n40\n;\n\n\n(iv)money laundering or terrorist financing, as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n41\n;\n\n\n(v)terrorist-related offences or offences linked to terrorist activities, as defined in Articles 1 and 3 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA\n42\n, respectively, or inciting, aiding, abetting or attempting to commit such offences, as referred to in Article 4 of that Decision; \n\n\n(vi)child labour or other forms of trafficking in human beings as defined in Article 2 of Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n43\n; \n\n\n(e)the person or entity has shown significant deficiencies in complying with main obligations in the performance of a legal commitment financed by the budget;\u00a0\n\n\n(f)it has been established by a final judgment or final administrative decision that the person or entity has committed an irregularity within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95\n44\n.\n\n\n2.In the absence of a final judgment or, where applicable, a final administrative decision in the cases referred to in points (c), (d) and (f) of paragraph 1, or in the case referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, the authorising officer responsible shall exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0on the basis of a preliminary classification in law of a conduct referred to in those points, having regard to established facts or other findings contained in the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139.\u00a0\n\n\nThe preliminary classification referred to in the first subparagraph does not prejudge the assessment of the conduct of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned by the competent authorities of the Member States under national law. The authorising officer responsible shall review its decision to exclude the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) and/or to impose a financial penalty on a recipient without delay following the notification of a final judgment or a final administrative decision. In cases where the final judgment or the final administrative decision does not set the duration of the exclusion, the authorising officer responsible shall set this duration on the basis of established facts and findings and having regard to the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139.\n\n\nWhere such final judgment or final administrative decision holds that the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) is not guilty of the conduct subject to a preliminary classification in law, on the basis of which it has been excluded, the authorising officer responsible shall, without delay, bring an end to that exclusion and/or reimburse, as appropriate, any financial penalty imposed. \n\n\nThe facts and findings referred to in the first subparagraph shall include, in particular: \n\n\n(a)facts established in the context of audits or investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors, European Anti-Fraud Office or internal audit, or any other check, audit or control performed under the responsibility of\u00a0the authorising officer;\n\n\n(b)non-final administrative decisions which may include disciplinary measures taken by the competent supervisory body responsible for the verification of the application of standards of professional ethics;\n\n\n(c)decisions of entities and persons implementing Union funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1)\u00a0or of entities implementing the budget pursuant to Article 62;\n\n\n(d)decisions of the Commission relating to the infringement of the Union's competition rules or of a national competent authority relating to the infringement of Union or national competition law.\n\n\n3.Any decision of the authorising officer responsible taken under Articles 131 to 138 or, where applicable, any recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, shall be made in compliance with the principle of proportionality, in particular taking into account: \n\n\n(a)the seriousness of the situation, including the impact on the Union's financial interests and image;\n\n\n(b)the time which has elapsed since the relevant conduct;\n\n\n(c)its duration and its recurrence;\n\n\n\n\n(d)the intention or degree of negligence;\n\n\n(e)the limited amount at stake for point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article;\n\n\n(f)any other mitigating circumstances, such as the degree of collaboration of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned with the relevant competent authority and its contribution to the investigation as recognised by the authorising officer responsible, or the disclosure of the exclusion situation by means of the declaration referred to in Article 133(1).\n\n\n4.The authorising officer responsible shall exclude the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0where:\n\n\n(a)a n\u0430tural or legal person who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the et person or entity referred to in Article 131(1), or who has powers of representation, decision or control with regard to these persons or entities is in one or more of the situations referred to in points (c) to (f) of paragraph 1;\n\n\n(b)a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of that person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) is in one or more of the situations referred to in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 1;\n\n\n(c)a natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the legal commitment and is in one or more of the situations referred to in point (c) to (f) of paragraph 1.\n\n\n5.In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorising officer responsible may exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0provisionally without the prior recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, where their participation in an award procedure or their selection for implementing Union\u00a0fundswould constitute a serious and imminent threat to the Union's financial interests. In such cases, the authorising officer responsible shall immediately refer the case to the panel and shall take a final decision no later than 14 days after having received the recommendation of the panel.\n\n\n6.The authorising officer responsible, having regard, where applicable, to the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, shall not exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0from participating in an award procedure and from being selecting to implementUnion funds where:\n\n\n(a)the person or entity has taken remedial measures specified in paragraph 7, to an extent that is sufficient to demonstrate its reliability. This point shall not apply in the case referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article;\n\n\n(b)it is indispensable to ensure the continuity of service, for a limited duration and pending the adoption of remedial measures specified in paragraph 7;\n\n\n(c)such an exclusion would be disproportionate on the basis of the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.\n\n\nIn addition, point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply in the case of the purchase of supplies on particularly advantageous terms from either a supplier which is definitively winding up its business activities or the liquidators in an insolvency procedure, an arrangement with creditors, or a similar procedure under EU or national laws or regulations.\n\n\nIn the cases of non-exclusion referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph, the authorising officer responsible shall specify the reasons for not excluding the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) and inform the panel referred to in Article 139 of those reasons.\n\n\n7.The measures referred to in paragraph 6, which remedy the exclusion situation may include, in particular:\n\n\n(a)measures to identify the origin of the situations giving rise to exclusion and concrete technical, organisational and personnel measures within the relevant business or activity area of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1), appropriate to correct the conduct and prevent its further occurrence;\n\n\n(b)proof that the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0has undertaken measures to compensate or redress the damage or harm caused to the Union's financial interests by the underlying facts giving rise to the exclusion situation;\n\n\n(c)proof that the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) has paid or secured the payment of any fine imposed by the competent authority or of any taxes or social security contributions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1.\n\n\n8.The authorising officer responsible, having regard, where applicable, to the revised recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, shall, without delay, revise its decision to exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0ex officio or on request from that person or entity , where the latter has taken remedial measures sufficient to demonstrate its reliability or has provided new elements demonstrating that the exclusion situation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article no longer exists.\n\n\nArticle 133\n\nDeclaration and evidence of absence of situation of exclusion\n\n\n\n\n1.A participant shall declare whether it is in one of the situations referred to Article 132(1) or Article 137(1), and, where applicable, whether it has taken any remedial measures referred to in point (a) of Article 132(6).\n\n\nThe candidate or tenderer shall provide the same declaration signed by a subcontractor or by any other entity on whose capacity it intends to rely, as the case may be. In case where an entity on whose capacity the candidate or tenderer intends to rely or a subcontractor of a contractor is in an exclusion situation, the authorising officer responsible shall require that the candidate or tenderer replaces them.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible shall not request such a declaration when this declaration has already been submitted for the purposes of another award procedure, provided that the situation has not changed, and that the time that has elapsed since the issuing date of the declaration does not exceed one year.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible may waive the requirements under the first and second subparagraphs for very low value contracts to be defined in the Annex.\n\n\n2.Whenever requested by the authorising officer responsible and where this is necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the procedure, the participant, the entity on whose capacity a candidate or tenderer intends to rely or a subcontractor of such a candidate or tenderer shall provide:\n\n\n(a)appropriate evidence that it is not in one of the exclusion situations referred to in Article 132(1);\n\n\n(b)information on natural or legal persons that are members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the participant or that have powers of representation, decision or control with regard to that participant and appropriate evidence that one or several of those persons are not in one of the exclusion situations referred to in points (c) to (f) of Article 132(1).\n\n\n(c)appropriate evidence that natural or legal persons that assume unlimited liability for the debts of that participant are not in an exclusion situation referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 132(1).\n\n\n3.The authorising officer responsible shall accept as satisfactory evidence that a participant or\u00a0an entity referred to in paragraph 2 is not in one of the situations described in points (a), (c), (d) or (f) of Article 132(1), a recent extract from the judicial record or, failing that, an equivalent document recently issued by a judicial or administrative authority in its country of establishment showing that those requirements are satisfied.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible shall accept, as satisfactory evidence that a participant or an entity referred to in paragraph 2 is not in the situation described in point (a) or (b) of Article 132(1), a recent certificate issued by the competent authority of the State concerned. Where the certificate is not issued in the country concerned the participant may provide a sworn statement made before a judicial authority or notary or, failing that, a solemn statement made before an administrative authority or a qualified professional body in its country of establishment.\n\n\n4.The authorising officer responsible shall waive the obligation of a participant or an entity referred to in paragraph 2 to submit the documentary evidence referred to in paragraph 2 and 3:\n\n\n(a)if it can access it on a national database free of charge;\n\n\n(b)if such evidence has already been submitted to it for the purposes of another procedure and provided that any submitted documents are still valid and that the time that has elapsed since the issuing date of the documents does not exceed one year;\n\n\n(c)if there is a material impossibility to provide such evidence recognised by the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\n5.Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply to persons and entities implementing\u00a0Union funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1) or to bodies within the meaning of Articles 69 and 70.\n\n\nArticle 134\n\nFinancial penalties\n\n\n1.In order to ensure a deterrent effect, the authorising officer responsible may, having regard, where applicable, to the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, impose a financial penalty on a recipient with whom a legal commitment has been concluded and who is in a situation referred to in points (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Article 132(1).\n\n\nRegarding the situations referred to in points (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Article 132(1), the financial penalty may be imposed as an alternative to a decision to exclude a recipient, where such an exclusion would be disproportionate on the basis of the criteria referred to in Article 132(3).\n\n\nRegarding the situations referred to in points (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Article 132(1), the financial penalty may be imposed in addition to an exclusion which is necessary to protect the Union's financial interests, where the recipient\u00a0has adopted a systemic and recurrent conduct with the intention to unduly obtain Union funds.\n\n\n2.The amount of the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the total value of the legal commitment.\u00a0In case of a grant agreement signed with a number of beneficiaries the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the grant amount the beneficiary concerned is entitled to in accordance with the grant agreement.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 135\n\nDuration of exclusion and limitation period\n\n\n1.The duration of exclusion shall not exceed any of the following:\n\n\n(a)the\u00a0duration, if any, set by the final judgement or the final administrative decision of a Member State;\n\n\n(b)five years for the cases referred to in point (d) of of Article 132(1);\n\n\n(c)three years for the cases referred to in points (c), (e) and (f) of Article 132(1).\n\n\nA person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) shall be excluded as long as it is in one of the situations referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 132(1).\n\n\n2.The limitation period to exclude and/or impose financial penalties on a person or entity referred to Article 131(1)\u00a0shall be five years calculated from any of the following:\n\n\n(a)the date of the conduct giving rise to exclusion or, in the case of continued or repeated acts, the date on which the conduct ceases, in the cases referred to in points (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Article 132(1); \n\n\n(b)the date of the final judgment of a national jurisdiction or of the final administrative decision in the cases referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 132(1).\n\n\nThe limitation period shall be interrupted by an act of a national authority, of the Commission, European Anti-Fraud Office, the panel referred to in Article 139 or of any entity involved in the implementation of the budget, if such an act is notified to the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) and is relating to investigations or judicial proceedings. A new limitation period shall begin to run on the day following the interruption.\n\n\nFor the purpose of point (f) of Article 132(1), the limitation period to exclude person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) and/or impose financial penalties on a recipient provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 shall apply.\n\n\nWhere the conduct of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned qualifies under several of the grounds listed in Article 132(1), the limitation period of the most serious of those grounds shall apply.\n\n\nArticle 136\n\nPublication of exclusion and financial penalties\n\n\n1.In order to, where necessary, reinforce the deterrent effect of the exclusion and/or financial penalty, the Commission shall, subject to a decision of the authorising officer responsible, publish on its internet site the following information related to the exclusion and, where applicable, the financial penalty in the cases referred to in points (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Article 132(1):\n\n\n(a)the name of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0concerned;\n\n\n(b)the exclusion situation ;\n\n\n(c)the duration of the exclusion and/or the amount of the financial penalty.\n\n\nWhere the decision on the exclusion and/or financial penalty has been taken on the basis of a preliminary classification as referred to in Article 132(2) the publication shall indicate that there is no final judgment or, where applicable, final administrative decision. In those cases, information about any appeals, their status and their outcome, as well as any revised decision of the authorising officer responsible shall be published without delay. Where a financial penalty has been imposed, the publication shall also indicate whether that penalty has been paid.\n\n\nThe decision to publish the information is taken by the authorising officer responsible either following the relevant final judgment or, where applicable, final administrative decision, or following the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 139, as the case may be. That decision shall take effect three months after its notification to the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned.\n\n\nThe information published shall be removed as soon as the exclusion has come to an end. In the case of a financial penalty, the publication shall be removed six months after payment of that penalty.\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, where personal data is concerned, the authorising officer responsible shall inform the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned of its rights under the applicable data protection rules and of the procedures available for exercising those rights.\n\n\n2.The information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be published in any of the following circumstances: \n\n\n(a)where it is necessary to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings; \n\n\n(b)where publication would cause disproportionate damage to the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1)\u00a0concerned or would otherwise be disproportionate on the basis of the proportionality criteria set out in Article 132(3) and to the amount of the financial penalty; \n\n\n(c)where a natural person is concerned, unless the publication of personal data is exceptionally justified, inter alia, by the seriousness of the conduct or its impact on the Union's financial interests. In such cases, the decision to publish the information shall duly take into consideration the right to privacy and other rights provided for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n\n\nArticle 137\n\nRejection from a given award procedure\n\n\n1.The authorising officer responsible shall reject from a given award procedure a participant who:\n\n\n(a)is in an exclusion situation established in accordance with Article 132;\n\n\n(b)has misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the procedure or has failed to supply that information;\n\n\n(c)was previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure where this entails a breach of the principle of equality of treatment, including\u00a0distortion of competition that cannot be remedied otherwise.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible shall communicate to the other participants in the award procedure the relevant information exchanged in the context of or resulting from the involvement of the participant in the preparation of the award procedure as referred to in point (c). The authorising officer responsible shall fix adequate time limits for the receipt of tenders or applications. Prior to any such rejection the participant shall be given the opportunity to prove that its involvement in preparing the award procedure does not breach the principle of equality of treatment.\n\n\n2.Article 129(1)\u00a0shall apply unless the rejection has been justified in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1 by an exclusion decision taken with regard to the participant, following an examination of its observations.\n\n\nArticle 138\n\nThe early detection and exclusion system\n\n\n1.Information exchanged within the early detection and exclusion system referred to in Article 131 shall be centralised in a database set up by the Commission (\u2018the database\u2019) and shall be managed in accordance with the right to privacy and other rights provided for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n\n\nInformation on early detection, exclusion and/or financial penalty cases shall be entered in the database by the authorising officer responsible after notifying the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned. Such notification may be exceptionally deferred, where there are compelling legitimate grounds to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings, until such compelling legitimate grounds to preserve the confidentiality cease to exist.\n\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, any person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) subject to the early detection and exclusion system shall have the right to be informed of the data stored in the database upon its request to the Commission.\n\n\nThe information contained in the database shall be updated, where appropriate, following a rectification or an erasure or any modification of data. It shall only be published in accordance with Article 136.\n\n\n2.The early detection and exclusion system, as referred to Article 131(1) of this Regulation, shall be based\u00a0on information as referred to in the fourth subparagraph of Article 132(2) and on the transmission of information to the Commission, in particular, by:\n\n\n(a)the European Anti-Fraud Office in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n45\n where an European Anti-Fraud Office investigation completed or in progress shows that it might be appropriate to take precautionary measures or actions to protect the Union's financial interests, with due regard to the respect for procedural and fundamental rights, and to the protection of whistle-blowers;\n\n\n(b)an authorising officer of the Commission, of a European office set up by the Commission or of an executive agency;\n\n\n\n\n(c)an institution, a European office or an agency other than those referred to in point (b) of this paragraph, a body or a person entrusted with implementation of CFSP actions;\n\n\n(d)entities implementing the budget in accordance with Article 62, in cases of detected fraud and/or irregularity and their follow up, where required by sector-specific rules;\n\n\n(e)entities or persons implementing Union funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1), in cases of detected fraud and/or irregularity and their follow up.\n\n\n3.Except where information is to be submitted in accordance with sector-specific rules, the information to be transmitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall include:\n\n\n(a)the identification of the entity or person concerned;\n\n\n(b)a summary of the risks detected or the facts in question;\n\n\n(c)information that could assist the authorising officer in carrying out the verification referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article or in taking a decision on exclusion as referred to in Article 132(1) or (2), or a decision to impose a financial penalty as referred to in Article 134;\n\n\n(d)where applicable, any special measures necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the information transmitted, including measures for the safeguarding of evidence to protect the investigation or the national judicial proceedings.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall transmit the information referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article without delay to its authorising officers and those of its executive agencies, all other institutions, bodies, European offices and agencies through the database referred to in paragraph 1 in order to allow them to carry out the necessary verification in respect of their ongoing award procedures and existing legal commitments.\n\n\nIn carrying out this verification, the authorising officer responsible shall exercise his or her powers as foreseen under Article 73 and shall not go beyond what is foreseen in the terms and conditions of the award procedure and contractual provisions.\n\n\nThe retention period for the information related to the early detection transmitted in accordance with paragraph 3 shall not exceed one year. If, during this period, the authorising officer responsible requests the panel to issue a recommendation in an exclusion or financial penalty case, the retention period may be extended until such time as the authorising officer responsible has taken a decision.\n\n\n5.The authorising officer responsible may take a decision to exclude and/or to impose a financial penalty and a decision to publish the related information only after having obtained a recommendation of the panel where such a decision is based on a preliminary classification as referred to in Article 132(2).\n\n\n6.All entities participating in the implementation of the budget in accordance with Article 61 shall be granted access by the Commission to the information on exclusion decisions pursuant to Article 132 to enable them to verify whether there is an exclusion in the system with a view to taking this information into account, as appropriate and on their own responsibility, when awarding contracts in the implementation of the budget.\n\n\n7.As part of the annual report of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council, as referred to in Article 325(5) TFEU, the Commission shall provide aggregate information on the decisions taken by the authorising officers under Articles 131 to 138. That report shall also provide further information on any decisions taken by the authorising officers pursuant to point (b) of Article 132(6) and Article 136(2) and on any decisions by the authorising officers to deviate from the recommendation of the panel pursuant to the last subparagraph of Article 139(6).\n\n\nThe information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be provided with due regard to confidentiality requirements and shall, in particular, not allow for the identification of the person or entity referred to in Article 131(1) concerned.\n\n\nArticle 139\n\nPanel\n\n\n1.A panel shall be convened at the request of an authorising officer of any institution , Union bodies, European Offices and bodies and persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU.\n\n\n2.The panel shall be composed of:\n\n\n(a)a standing high-level independent chair appointed by the Commission;\n\n\n(b)two permanent representatives of the Commission as the owner of the system, who shall express a joint position; and\n\n\n\n\n(c)one representative of the requesting authorising officer.\n\n\nThe composition of the panel shall ensure the appropriate legal and technical expertise. The panel shall be assisted by a permanent secretariat, provided by the Commission, which shall ensure the continuous administration of the panel.\n\n\n3.The Chair shall be chosen from among former members of the Court of Auditors, the Court of Justice or former officials who have had at least the rank of Director-General in an institution of the Union other than the Commission. He or she shall be selected on the basis of his/her personal and professional qualities, extensive experience in legal and financial matters and proven competence, independence and integrity. The term of office shall be five years and shall not be renewable.

Any electronic communication system used to support communications and information exchanges shall be non-discriminatory, generally available and interoperable with information and communication technology (ICT) products in general use and shall not restrict participants' access to the award procedure.\n\n\n3.Devices for the electronic receipt of application documents shall guarantee, through technical means and appropriate procedures, that:\n\n\n(a)the participant can be authenticated with certainty;\n\n\n(b)the exact time and date of the receipt of application documents can be determined precisely;\n\n\n(c)only authorised persons have access to data transmitted under these requirements and may set or change the dates for opening them;\n\n\n(d)during the different stages of the award procedure only authorised persons may have access to all data submitted and may give access to these data as needed for the procedure;\n\n\n(e)it may be reasonably ensured that any attempt to infringe any of the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) can be detected.\n\n\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply to contracts below the thresholds laid down in paragraph 1 of Article\u00a0169. \n\n\n4.Where the authorising officer responsible authorises submission of application documents by electronic means, the electronic documents submitted by means of such systems shall be deemed to be the originals.\n\n\n5.Where submission is by letter, participants may choose to submit application documents:\n\n\n(a)either by post or by courier service, in which case the evidence shall be constituted by the postmark or the date of the deposit slip;\n\n\n(b)by hand-delivery to the premises of the authorising officer responsible by the participant in person or by an agent, in which case the evidence shall be constituted by the acknowledgement of receipt.\n\n\n6.By submitting application documents, participants accept to receive notification of the outcome of the procedure by electronic means.\n\n\n7.Paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to the selection of persons or entities implementing\u00a0Union funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61 (1).\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\nRULES APPLICABLE TO DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\n\nArticle 145\nEvaluation committee \n\n\n1.Application documents shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee.\n\n\n2.The evaluation committee shall be appointed by the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\nThe committee shall be made up of at least three persons. \n\n\n3.The members of the committee evaluating grant applications or tenders shall represent at least two organisational entities of the institutions or bodies referred to in Articles 67, 69 and 70 with no hierarchical link between them, at least one of which does not come under the authorising officer responsible. In the representations and local units outside the Union and in the bodies referred to in Articles 67, 69 and 70, if there are no separate entities, the requirement of organisational entities with no hierarchical link between them shall not apply. A local unit shall be, for instance, a Union delegation, office or branch office in a third country.\n\n\nExternal experts may assist the committee by decision of the authorising officer responsible.\n\n\nMembers of the committee may be external experts where that possibility is provided for in the basic act.\n\n\n4.The members of the committee evaluating applications in a contest for prizes may be persons referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 or external experts.\n\n\n5.The members of the evaluation committee and the external experts shall comply with the obligations laid down in Article 59.\n\n\nArticle 146\nClarification and correction of application documents \n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible may correct obvious clerical errors in the application documents after confirmation of the intended correction by the participant.\n\n\nWhere a participant fails to submit evidence or to make statements, the evaluation committee or, where appropriate, the authorising officer responsible shall, except in duly justified cases, ask the participant to provide the missing information or clarify supporting documents.\n\n\nSuch information, clarification or confirmation shall not substantially change the application documents.\n\n\nArticle 147\nGuarantees\n\n\n1.Except for low value contracts and low value grants, the authorising officer responsible may, if proportionate and subject to a risk-analysis, require a guarantee to be submitted:\n\n\n(a)by contractors or beneficiaries in order to limit the financial risks connected with payment of pre-financing ('guarantee on pre-financing');\n\n\n(b)by contractors to ensure compliance with substantial contractual obligations in the case of works, supplies or complex services ('performance guarantee');\n\n\n(c)by contractors to ensure full performance of the contract during the contract liability period ('retention money guarantee').\n\n\nThe JRC shall be exempted from lodging guarantees.\n\n\n\n\nAs an alternative to requesting a guarantee on pre-financing, for grants, the authorising officer responsible may decide to split the payment into several instalments.\n\n\n2.The authorising officer responsible shall decide whether the guarantee shall be denominated in euro or in the currency of the contract or of the grant agreement.\n\n\n3.The guarantee shall be supplied by a bank or by an authorised financial institution accepted by the authorising officer responsible. \n\n\nAt the request of the contractor or the beneficiary and provided it is accepted by the authorising officer responsible:\n\n\n(a)the guarantee referred to points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 may be replaced by a joint and several guarantee by a third party;\n\n\n(b)the guarantee referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 may be replaced by the irrevocable and unconditional joint guarantee of the beneficiaries who are parties to the same grant agreement.\n\n\n4.The guarantee shall have the effect of making the bank or financial institution or the third party stand as irrevocable collateral security, or first-call guarantor of the contractor's or beneficiary's obligations.\n\n\n5.Where in the course of implementation of the contract or the grant agreement the authorising officer responsible discovers that a guarantor is not or no longer authorised to issue guarantees in accordance with the applicable national law, he shall require that the contractor or the beneficiary replaces the guarantee supplied by such a guarantor.\n\n\nArticle 148\nGuarantee on pre-financing\n\n\n1.The guarantee shall be for an amount not exceeding the amount of the pre-financing.\n\n\n2.The guarantee shall be released as and when the pre-financing is deducted from interim payments or payments of the balance to the contractor or the beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the contract or the conditions of the grant agreement.\n\n\nTitle VI\nIndirect implementation\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 149\nIndirect implementation\n\n\n1.The selection of the entities and persons implementing Union funds or budgetary guarantees pursuant to point (c) of Article 61 (1) shall be transparent, justified by the nature of the action and shall not give rise to a conflict of interests. For entities mentioned in points (ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Article 61(1)(c) the selection shall also take due account of their operational and financial capacity.\n\n\nWhere the entity or person is identified in a basic act, the financial statement provided for in Article 33 shall include a reasoned justification for the choice of that particular entity or person. \n\n\nIn cases of implementation by a network, requiring the designation of at least one body or entity by Member State or by country concerned, the body or entity shall be designated by the Member State or the country concerned in accordance with the basic act. In all other cases, the Commission shall designate such bodies or entities in agreement with the Member States or countries concerned.\n\n\n2.Entities and persons implementing Union funds\u00a0or budgetary guarantees pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1) shall respect the principles of sound financial management, transparency, non-discrimination and visibility of Union action.\u00a0Where the Commission establishes financial partnership agreements in accordance with Article 126\u00a0those principles shall be further described in such agreements.\n\n\n3.Prior to signing contribution agreements, financing agreements\u00a0or guarantee agreements, the Commission shall ensure a level of protection of the financial interests of the Union equivalent to that when the Commission implements the funds in accordance with point (a) of Article 61(1). It shall do so by carrying out an assessment of the systems and procedures of the entities or persons implementing the Union funds if it intends to rely on them for the implementation of the action or by applying appropriate supervisory measures.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall assess in accordance with the principle of proportionality and with due consideration for the nature of the action and the financial risks involved, that the entities and persons implementing EU funds pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1):\n\n\n(a)set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system based on international best practices and allowing in particular to prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud;\n\n\n\n\n(b)use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner;\n\n\n(c)are subject to an independent external audit, performed in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards by an audit service functionally independent of the entity or person concerned;\n\n\n(d)apply appropriate rules and procedures for providing financing to third parties including appropriate review procedures, rules for recovering funds unduly paid and rules for excluding from access to funding;\n\n\n(e)make public adequate information on their recipients;\n\n\n(f)ensure equivalent protection of personal data to that referred to under Article\u00a05.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, in agreement with the entities or persons, the Commission may assess other rules and procedures such as the administration cost accounting practices of the entities. On the basis on the results of this assessment the Commission may decide to rely on those\u00a0rules and procedures.\n\n\nEntities or persons which have been assessed under these requirements shall inform the Commission without undue delay if any substantive changes are made to the rules, systems or to the procedures of the entity or person which may impact the reliability of the Commission's assessment. \n\n\n5.Where these entities or persons comply only in part with the requirements referred to in paragraph 4, the Commission shall take appropriate supervisory measures ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests. These measures shall be specified in the relevant agreements.\n\n\n6.An ex-ante assessment may not be required:\n\n\n(a)for the bodies referred to in Articles 69 and 70\u00a0and for persons referred to in point (viii) of Article 61(1)(c) which have adopted financial rules with prior consent of the Commission;\n\n\n(b)for third countries or the bodies they designate, in so far as the\u00a0Commission retains financial management responsibilities that guarantee a sufficient protection of the financial interests of the Union; or\n\n\n(c)for those procedures specifically required by the Commission, including its own or those specified in basic acts.\n\n\n7.Where the systems or procedures of the entities or persons referred to in point (c ) of Article 61(1) are assessed as appropriate, Union contributions to these entities or persons may be implemented in accordance with this Title. Where such entities or persons participate in a call for proposals they shall abide by the rules of the call for proposals in accordance with Title VIII. In such a case the authorising officer may decide to sign a contribution agreement or a financing agreement instead of a grant agreement.\n\n\nArticle 150\n\nImplementation \n\n\n1.Entities and persons implementing EU funds or budgetary gurantees shall provide the Commission with:\n\n\n(a)a report on the implementation of the Union funds or the budgetary guarantee, including the fulfilment of the conditions or results referred to in point (e) of Article 121(1);\n\n\n(b)where the contribution reimburses expenditure, their accounts drawn up for the expenditure incurred;\n\n\n(c)a management declaration covering the information referred to in point(a) and where appropriate point (b) confirming that:\n\n\n(i)the information is properly presented, complete and accurate;\n\n\n(ii)the EU contribution was used for its intended purpose, as defined in the contribution agreements, financing agreements or guarantee agreements, where applicable, in the relevant sector-specific rules;\n\n\n\n\n(iii)the control systems put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions;\n\n\n(d)a summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and extent of errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned.\n\n\nIn case of actions terminating before the end of the financial year concerned, the final report for such action may replace the management declaration referred to in point (c), provided it is submitted before 15 February of the year following the financial year concerned.\n\n\nThe documents referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the control systems put in place function properly and are cost-effective, and whether the underlying transactions are legal and regular. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration under point (c) of the first subparagraph. Where such an opinion is absent, the authorising officer may seek an equivalent level of assurance through other independent means.\n\n\nThe documents referred to in the first subparagraph shall be provided to the Commission no later than 15 February of the following financial year. The opinion referred to in the third subparagraph shall be provided to the Commission no later than 15 March.\n\n\nThe obligations set out in this paragraph shall be without prejudice to agreements concluded with the EIB group, international organisations and third countries. With regard to the management declaration, such agreements shall include at least the obligation of those entities to provide the Commission annually with a statement that, during the financial year concerned, the Union contribution was used and accounted for in compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 149 and with the obligations laid down in such agreements. Such statement may be incorporated in the final report if the action implemented is limited to 18 months.\n\n\n2.Entities and persons implementing EU funds or budgetary guarantees\u00a0shall:\n\n\n(a)comply with relevant standards and applicable legislation on the prevention of money laundering, and the fight against terrorism, tax fraud and tax evasion;\n\n\n(b)not make use of or engage in tax avoidance structures, in particular aggressive tax planning schemes, or practices not complying with good governance criteria on taxation, as set out in\u00a0EU legislation or communications and recommandations or any formal instruction by the Commission;\n\n\n(c)not be established, and, in relation to the implementation of the financial instruments and budgetary guaranties, not maintain business relations with entities incorporated in jurisdictions that do not co-operate with the Union in relation to the application of the internationally agreed tax standards on transparency and exchange of information.\n\n\n3.The Commission shall verify that the Union funds or budgetary guarantee has been used in accordance with the conditions laid down in the relevant agreements. Where the costs of the entity or person are reimbursed based on a simplified cost option in accordance with points (b) to (d) of Article 121 the provisions of points (1) to (4) of Article 175 and Articles 176 to 178 shall apply mutatis mutandis. Where the Union funds or budgetary guarantee has been used in breach of the obligations laid down in the relevant agreements, Article 127 shall apply.\n\n\n4.In multi-donor actions, where the Union contribution reimburses expenditure, the procedure referred to in paragraph 3 shall consist in verifying that an amount corresponding to that paid by the Commission for the action concerned has been used by the entity in accordance with the conditions laid down in the relevant grant, contribution agreement or financing agreement.\n\n\n5.Contribution agreements,\u00a0financing agreements or guarantee agreements shall clearly define the responsibilities and obligations of the entity implementing EU funds, including the obligations referred to in Article 124, the conditions for payment of the contribution as well as, where applicable, the remuneration which should,\u00a0where appropriate, be performance-based. Those agreements shall also include rules on reporting to the Commission on how the tasks are performed, the results expected including indicators on measuring performance\u00a0and the obligation for entities implementing EU funds to notify the Commission without delay of cases of detected fraud and irregularities and their follow-up.\n\n\n6.All contribution agreements,\u00a0financing agreements and guarantee agreements shall be made available to the European Parliament and the Council at their request.\n\n\n7.Article\u00a0150 shall not apply to the contribution of the Union to entities which are subject to a separate discharge procedure under Articles 69 and 70, with the exception of possible ad hoc contribution agreements.\n\n\nArticle 151\n\nIndirect implementation\u00a0with International Organisations \n\n\n1.International organisations shall be international public-sector organisations set up by international agreements and specialised agencies set up by such organisations.

interinstitutional basis under the lead of one of the contracting authorities.\n\n\nThe bodies and persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU as well as the Office of the Secretary of the Board of Governors of the European Schools may also participate in interinstitutional procedures.\n\n\nThe terms of a framework contract may only apply between those contracting authorities that are identified for that purpose in the procurement documents and those economic operators that are party to the framework contract.\n\n\n2.Where a contract or framework contract is necessary for the implementation of a joint action between an institution and one or more contracting authorities from Member States, the procurement procedure may be carried out jointly by the institution and the contracting authorities.\n\n\nJoint procurement may be conducted with EFTA states and Union candidate countries if this possibility has been specifically provided for in a bilateral or multilateral treaty.\n\n\nIn the case of a joint procurement procedure, the procedural provisions applicable to the institutions shall apply.\n\n\nWhere the share pertaining to or managed by the contracting authority of a Member State in the total estimated value of the contract is equal to or above 50 %, or in other duly justified cases, the institution may decide that the procedural rules applicable to the contracting authority of a Member State shall apply to joint procurement, provided that those rules may be considered as equivalent to those of the institution.\n\n\nThe institution and the contracting authority from a Member State, an EFTA State or a Union candidate country, concerned by the joint procurement shall agree in particular upon the detailed practical arrangements for the evaluation of the requests for participation or of the tenders, the award of the contract, the law applicable to the contract and the competent court for hearing disputes.\n\n\nArticle 160\nPreparation of a procurement procedure\n\n\n1.Before launching a procurement procedure, the contracting authority may conduct a preliminary market consultation with a view to preparing the procedure.\n\n\n2.In the procurement documents, the contracting authority shall identify the subject matter of the procurement by providing a description of its needs and the characteristics required of the works, supplies or services to be bought, and shall specify the applicable exclusion, selection and award criteria. The contracting authority shall also indicate which elements define the minimum requirements to be met by all tenders. Minimum requirements shall include compliance with applicable environmental, social and labour law obligations established by Union law, national legislation, collective agreements or the applicable international social and environmental conventions listed in Annex X to Directive 2014/24/EU.\n\n\nArticle 161\nAward of contracts\n\n\n1.Contracts shall be awarded on the basis of award criteria provided that the contracting authority has verified the following:\n\n\n(a)the tender complies with the minimum requirements specified in the procurement documents;\n\n\n(b)the candidate or tenderer is not excluded under Article 132 or rejected under Article 137,\n\n\n(c)the candidate or tenderer meets the selection criteria specified in the procurement documents and is not subject to conflicting interests which may negatively affect the performance of the contract.\n\n\n\n\n2.The contracting authority shall apply the selection criteria to evaluate the capacity of the candidate or tenderer. Selection criteria may only relate to the legal and regulatory capacity to pursue the professional activity, the economic and financial capacity, and the technical and professional capacity.\u00a0The JRC shall be presumed to meet the requirements relating to financial capacity.\n\n\n3.The contracting authority shall apply the award criteria to evaluate the tender.\n\n\n4.The contracting authority shall base the award of contracts on the most economically advantageous tender, which shall consist in one of three award methods: lowest price, lowest cost or best price-quality ratio.\n\n\nFor the lowest cost method, the contracting authority shall use a cost-effectiveness approach including life-cycle costing.\n\n\nFor the best price-quality ratio, the contracting authority shall take into account the price or cost and other quality criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract.\n\n\nArticle 162\nSubmission, electronic communication and evaluation\n\n\n1.The contracting authority shall lay down time limits for the receipt of tenders and requests to participate in accordance with point 24 of the Annex and taking into account the complexity of the purchase, leaving an\u00a0adequate period for economic operators to prepare their tenders.\n\n\n2.If deemed appropriate and proportionate, the contracting authority may require tenderers to submit a guarantee to make sure that the tenders submitted are not withdrawn before contract signature. The required guarantee shall represent 1 to 2% of the total estimated value of the contract.\n\n\n3.The contracting authority shall open all requests to participate and tenders. However, it shall reject:\n\n\n(a)requests to participate and tenders which do not comply with the time limit for receipt, without opening them;\n\n\n(b)tenders received already open, without examining their content.\n\n\n4.The contracting authority shall evaluate all requests to participate or tenders not rejected during the opening phase laid down in paragraph 3 on the basis of the criteria specified in the procurement documents with a view to awarding the contract or to proceeding with an electronic auction.\n\n\n5.The authorising officer may waive the appointment of an evaluation committee as provided for Article 145(2) in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)the value of the contract is below the thresholds referred to in Article\u00a0169(1); \n\n\n(b)on the basis of a risk analysis for the cases set out in points (c), (e), (f) (i), (f) (iii) and (h) of point\u00a011.1 of the Annex;\n\n\n(c)on the basis of a risk analysis when reopening competition within a framework contract; \n\n\n(d)for procedures in the field of external actions having a value of less than or equal to EUR 20 000.\n\n\n6.Requests to participate and tenders which do not comply with all the minimum requirements set out in the procurement documents shall be rejected.\n\n\nArticle 163\nContacts during the procurement procedure\n\n\n1.Before the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, the contracting authority may communicate additional information about the procurement documents if it discovers an error or omission in the text or upon request from candidates or tenderers. Information provided shall be disclosed to all candidates or tenderers.\n\n\n\n\n2.After the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, in every case where contact has been made, and in the duly justified cases where contact has not been made as provided for in Article\u00a0146, a record shall be kept in the procurement file.\n\n\nArticle 164\nAward decision and information to candidates or tenderers\n\n\n1.The authorising officer responsible shall decide to whom the contract is to be awarded, in compliance with the selection and award criteria specified in the procurement documents.\n\n\n2.The contracting authority shall notify all candidates or tenderers, whose requests to participate or tenders are rejected, of the grounds on which the decision was taken, as well as the duration of the standstill period referred to in Article 169(2).\n\n\nFor the award of specific contracts under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the contracting authority shall inform the tenderers of the result of the evaluation.\n\n\n3.The contracting authority shall inform each tenderer who is not in an exclusion situation, who is not rejected under Article 137, whose tender is compliant with the procurement documents and who makes a request in writing, of any of the following:\n\n\n(a)the name of the tenderer, or tenderers in the case of a framework contract, to whom the contract is awarded and, except in the case of a specific contract under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender, the price paid or contract value, whichever is appropriate;\n\n\n(b)the progress of negotiation and dialogue with tenderers.\n\n\nHowever, the contracting authority may decide to withhold certain information where its release would impede law enforcement, would be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of economic operators or might distort fair competition between them.\n\n\nArticle 165\nCancellation of the procurement procedure\n\n\nThe contracting authority may, before the contract is signed, cancel the procurement procedure without the candidates or tenderers being entitled to claim any compensation.\n\n\nThe decision shall be justified and brought to the attention of the candidates or tenderers as soon as possible.\n\n\nArticle 166\nPerformance and modifications of the contract\n\n\n1.Performance of the contract shall not start before the contract is signed.\n\n\n2.The contracting authority may modify a contract or framework contract without a procurement procedure only in the cases provided for in paragraph 3 and provided the modification does not alter the subject matter of the contract or framework contract.\n\n\n3.A contract, a framework contract or a specific contract under a framework contract may be modified without a new procurement procedure in any of the following cases:\n\n\n(a)for additional works, supplies or services by the original contractor that have become necessary and that were not included in the initial procurement, where the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(i)a change of contractor cannot be made for technical reasons linked to interchangeability or interoperability requirements with existing equipment, services or installations;\n\n\n(ii)a change of contractor would cause substantial duplication of costs for the contracting authority;\n\n\n(iii)any increase in price, including the net cumulative value of successive modifications, does not exceed 50 % of the initial contract value;\n\n\n\n\n(b)where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n\n(i)the need for modification has been brought about by circumstances which a diligent contracting authority could not foresee;\n\n\n(ii)any increase in price does not exceed 50 % of the initial contract value;\n\n\n(c)where the value of the modification is below the following thresholds:\n\n\n(i)the thresholds referred to in Article 169(1) and in point 38 of the Annex of this Regulation in the field of external actions applicable at the time of the modification;\n\n\n(ii)10 % of the initial contract value for public service and supply contracts and works or services concession contracts and 15 % of the initial contract value for public works contracts;\n\n\n(d)where the minimum requirements of the initial procurement procedure are not altered. In that case any ensuing modification of value shall comply with the conditions set under point (c) of this subparagraph, unless such modification of value results from the strict application of the procurement documents or contractual provisions.\n\n\nThe initial contract value shall not take into account price revisions.\n\n\nThe net cumulative value of several successive modifications under point (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not exceed any threshold referred to therein.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall apply the ex post publicity measures set out in Article 157.\n\n\nArticle 167\nPerformance guarantees and retention money guarantees\n\n\n1.The performance guarantee shall amount to a maximum of 10 % of the total value of the contract.\n\n\nIt shall be fully released after final acceptance of the works, supplies or complex services, within a period subject to Article\u00a0114(1) to be specified in the contract. It may be released partially or fully upon provisional acceptance of the works, supplies or complex services.\n\n\n2.A retention money guarantee amounting to a maximum of 10 % of the total value of the contract may be constituted by deductions from interim payments as and when they are made or by deduction from the final payment.\n\n\nThe retention money guarantee shall not be used in a contract where a performance guarantee has been requested and not released.\n\n\n3.Subject to approval by the contracting authority, the contractor may request to replace the retention money guarantee by a guarantee referred to in Article 147.\n\n\n4.The contracting authority shall release the retention money guarantee after the expiry of the contractual liability period, within a period subject to Article\u00a0114(1) to be specified in the contract.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\nProvisions applicable to contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account\n\n\nArticle 168\nThe contracting authority\n\n\n1.The Union institutions, executive agencies and bodies within the meaning of Articles 69 and 70 shall be deemed to be contracting authorities in the case of contracts awarded on their own account, except where they purchase from a central purchasing body. Departments of those institutions shall not be deemed to be contracting authorities where they conclude service-level agreements amongst themselves.\n\n\n\n\nThose institutions shall delegate, in accordance with Article 58, the necessary powers for the exercise of the function of contracting authority.\n\n\n2.Each authorising officer by delegation or subdelegation within each institution shall assess whether the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1) have been reached.\n\n\nArticle 169\nThresholds applicable and standstill period\n\n\n1.To award public and concession contracts, the contracting authority shall respect the thresholds laid down in points (a) and (b) of Article 4 of Directive 2014/24/EU when selecting a procedure set out in Article 158(1) of this Regulation. Those thresholds shall determine the publicity measures set out in Article 157(1) and (2) of this Regulation.\n\n\n2.Subject to exceptions and conditions to be specified in the Annex\u00a0to this Regulation, in the case of contracts the value of which exceeds the thresholds referred to in paragraph 1, the contracting authority shall not sign the contract or framework contract with the successful tenderer until a standstill period has elapsed.\n\n\n3.The standstill period shall have a duration of 10 days when using electronic means of communication and 15 days when using other means.\n\n\nArticle 170\nRules on access to procurement\n\n\n1.Participation in procurement procedures shall be open on equal terms to all natural and legal persons within the scope of the Treaties and to all natural and legal persons established in a third country which has a special agreement with the Union in the field of public procurement under the conditions laid down in that agreement. It shall also be open to international organisations.\n\n\n2.For the purpose of Article 154(4), the JRC shall be considered as a legal person established in a Member State.\n\n\nArticle 171\nProcurement rules of the World Trade Organisation\n\n\nWhere the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement concluded within the World Trade Organisation applies, the procurement procedure shall also be open to economic operators established in the states which have ratified that agreement, under the conditions laid down therein.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\nProvisions applicable for procurement in the field of external actions\n\n\nArticle 172\nExternal action procurement\n\n\n1.The provisions of Chapter 1 of Title VII relating to the general provisions on procurement shall be applicable to contracts covered by this Chapter subject to the special provisions relating to the arrangements for awarding external contracts laid down in the Annex. Articles 168 to 171 shall not be applicable to the procurement set out in this Chapter.\n\n\nArticle 157 and points (a) and (b) of Article 158(1) shall only apply as from:\n\n\n(a)EUR 300 000 for service and supply contracts;\n\n\n(b)EUR 5 000 000 for works contracts.\n\n\n2.This Chapter shall apply to:\n\n\n(a)procurement where the Commission does not award contracts for its own account;\n\n\n(b)procurement by entities or persons pursuant to point (c) of Article 61(1) where provided for in the contribution or financing agreements referred to in Article\u00a0149.\n\n\n\n\n3.The procurement procedures shall be laid down in the financing agreements provided for in Article 152.\n\n\n4.This Chapter shall not apply to actions under sector-specific basic acts relating to humanitarian crisis management aid, civil protection operations and humanitarian aid operations.\n\n\nArticle 173\nRules on access to procurement\n\n\n1.Participation in procurement procedures shall be open on equal terms to all persons within the scope of the Treaties and to any other natural or legal person in accordance with the specific provisions in the basic instruments governing the cooperation sector concerned. It shall also be open to international organisations.\n\n\n2.In the cases referred to in Article 56(2), it may be decided, under exceptional circumstances duly justified by the authorising officer responsible, to allow third-country nationals, other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, to tender for contracts.\n\n\n3.Where an agreement on widening the market for procurement of goods or services to which the Union is party applies, the procurement procedures for contracts financed by the budget shall also be open to natural and legal persons established in a third country other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, under the conditions laid down in that agreement.\n\n\nTITLE VIII\nGRANTS\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\nScope and form of grants\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 174\n\nScope and form of grants\n\n\n1.This Title applies to grants awarded under direct implementation.\n\n\n2.Grants are direct financial contributions, by way of donation, from the budget in order to finance any of the following:\n\n\n(a)an action intended to help achieve a Union policy objective ('action grants');\n\n\n(b)the functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of, and supporting, a Union policy ('operating grants'). \n\n\nIn the case of an operating grant, the grant shall take the form of a financial contribution to the work programme of the body.\n\n\n3.Grants may take any of the forms provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 121. Where the grant takes the form referred to in point (e) of Article 121(1) the application of the provisions related to eligibility and verification of costs laid down in this Title shall not apply. \n\n\n4.Each institution may award grants for communication activities where this is justified by the nature of those activities.\n\n\n5.The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may receive funding charged to appropriations other than research and technological development appropriations in respect of its participation in grant award procedures financed in whole or in part from the budget. In such cases paragraph 4 of Article 191, as far as financial capacity is concerned, and points (a) to (d) of Article 189(1) shall not apply.\n\n\nArticle 175\n\nLump sums, unit costs and flat-rate financing \n\n\n1.This Article shall apply to grants which take the form of lump sums, unit costs or flat rate financing referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 121(1).\n\n\n2.Where possible and appropriate, lump sums, unit costs or flat rates shall be determined in such a way as to allow their payment upon achievement of concrete outputs.\n\n\n\n\n3.Unless provided otherwise in\u00a0the basic act, the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing shall be authorised by the authorising officer responsible, who shall act in accordance with a predetermined procedure established within each institution.\n\n\n4.The authorisation shall contain at least the following:\n\n\n(a)justification concerning the appropriateness of such forms of financing with regard to the nature of the supported actions or work programmes, as well as to the risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control;\n\n\n(b)identification of the costs or categories of costs covered by lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing, which shall exclude ineligible costs under the applicable Union rules;\n\n\n(c)description of the methods for determining lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing. Those methods shall be based on one of the following:\n\n\n(i)statistical data,\u00a0similar objective means or an expert judgement; or\n\n\n(ii)beneficiary-by-beneficiary approach, by reference to certified or auditable historical data of the beneficiary or to its usual cost accounting practices;\n\n\n(d)where possible, the essential conditions triggering the payment, including, where applicable, the achievement of outputs;\n\n\n(e)description of the conditions for ensuring that the principle of sound financial management is respected and the co-financing principle is reasonably complied with;\n\n\n(f)where lump sums, unit costs and flat rates are not output based, a justification on why an output based approach is not possible or appropriate.\n\n\n5.The authorisation shall apply for the duration of the programme or programmes unless otherwise provided in the authorising decision.\n\n\nThe authorisation may cover the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates applicable beyond a specific funding programme where the nature of the activities or of the expenditure allow for a common approach. The authorising decision may be adopted by the following:\n\n\n(a)the authorising officers responsible where all concerned activities fall under their responsibility;\n\n\n(b)the Commission where this is appropriate in view of the nature of the activities or of the expenditure or in view of the number of authorising officers concerned.\n\n\n6.The authorising officer responsible may authorise or impose, in the form of flat-rates, funding of the beneficiary's indirect costs up to a maximum of 7 % of total eligible direct costs for the action. A higher flat rate may be authorised by a reasoned Commission decision.\n\n\n7.SME owners and other natural persons who do not receive a salary may declare eligible personnel costs for the work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme, on the basis of unit costs authorised in accordance with\u00a0paragraphs 1 to 6.\n\n\n8.Beneficiaries may declare personnel costs for the work carried out by volunteers under an action or work programme, on the basis of unit costs authorised in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6.\n\n\nArticle 176\n\nSingle lump sums\n\n\n1.A lump sum may cover the entire eligible costs of an action or a work programme ('single lump sum').\n\n\n2.Single lump sums may be determined on the basis of the estimated budget. The budget shall comply with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The compliance with those principles shall be verified ex-ante at the time of evaluation of the grant application.\n\n\n\n\n3.When authorising single lump sums the authorising officer responsible shall comply with Article 175.\n\n\nArticle 177\n\nChecks and controls on beneficiaries related to lump sums, unit costs and flat rates\n\n\n1.The authorising officer responsible shall check, at the latest before the payment of the balance, the fulfilment of the conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates, including, where required, the achievement of outputs. In addition, the fulfilment of those conditions may be subject to ex post controls.\n\n\nThe amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing determined ex ante by application of the method authorised by the authorising officer responsible or the Commission in accordance with Article 175 shall not be challenged by ex-post controls without prejudice to the right of the authorising officer responsible to reduce the grant in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 127. Where lump sums, unit costs or flat rates are established on the basis of the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary paragraph 2 of Article 179 shall apply. \n\n\n2.The conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates shall not require reporting on the costs actually incurred by the beneficiary.\n\n\n3.Payment of the grant on the basis of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing shall not affect the right of access to the statutory records of the beneficiaries for the purposes referred to in Articles\u00a0178 and 124.\n\n\nArticle 178\n\nPeriodic assessment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates\n\n\nThe method for determining lump sums, unit costs or flat rates, the underlying data and the resulting amounts shall be assessed periodically, and, where appropriate, adjusted in accordance with Article 175.\n\n\nArticle 179\n\n Usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary\n\n\n1.Where recourse to the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary\u00a0is authorised, the authorising officer responsible may assess compliance of those practices ex ante with the conditions set out in paragraph 4 of Article 175 or through an appropriate strategy for ex post controls.\n\n\n2.If the compliance of the beneficiary's usual cost accounting practices with the conditions referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 175 has been established ex ante, the amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing determined by application of those practices shall not be challenged by ex post controls. This does not affect the right of the authorising officer responsible to reduce the grant in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 127.\n\n\n3.The authorising officer responsible may consider that the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary are compliant with the conditions referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 175 if they are accepted by national authorities under comparable funding schemes.\n\n\nArticle 180\n\nEligible costs\n\n\n1.Grants shall not exceed an overall ceiling expressed in terms of an absolute value which shall be established, where possible, on the basis of estimated eligible costs. Without prejudice to the basic act, grants may in addition be expressed as a percentage of the estimated eligible costs.\n\n\nWhere, due to specificities of an action, grants can only be expressed in terms of an absolute value, the verification of the eligible costs shall be done in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 150.\n\n\n2.Without prejudice to the maximum co-financing rate specified in the basic act:\n\n\n(a)the grant shall not exceed the eligible costs;\n\n\n(b)where the estimated eligible costs include costs for volunteers' work referred to in paragraph 8 of Article 175, the grant shall not exceed the estimated eligible costs other than the costs for volunteers' work.\n\n\n3.Eligible costs are costs actually incurred by the beneficiary of a grant which shall meet all of the following criteria:\n\n\n(a)they are incurred during the duration of the action or of the work programme, with the exception of costs relating to final reports and audit certificates;\n\n\n\n\n(b)they are indicated in the estimated overall budget of the action or work programme;\n\n\n(c)they are necessary for the implementation of the action or of the work programme which is the subject of the grant;\n\n\n(d)they are identifiable and verifiable, in particular being recorded in the accounting records of the beneficiary and determined according to the applicable accounting standards of the country where the beneficiary is established and according to the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary;\n\n\n(e)they comply with the requirements of applicable tax and social legislation;\n\n\n(f)they are reasonable, justified, and comply with the principle of sound financial management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency.\n\n\n4.Calls for proposals shall specify the categories of costs considered as eligible for Union funding.\n\n\nUnless provided otherwise in the basic act and in addition to paragraph 3, the following categories of costs shall be eligible where the authorising officer responsible has declared them as such under the call for proposals:\n\n\n(a)costs relating to a pre-financing guarantee lodged by the beneficiary of the grant, where that guarantee is required by the authorising officer responsible pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 147;\n\n\n(b)costs relating to certificates on the financial statements and operational verification reports where such certificates or reports are required by the authorising officer responsible;\n\n\n(c)VAT where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT legislation and is paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person as defined in the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC\n47\n;\n\n\nVAT shall be considered as not recoverable if according to national law it is attributable to any of the following activities:\n\n\n(i)exempt activities without right of deduction;\n\n\n(ii)activities which fall outside the scope of VAT;\n\n\n(iii)activities, as referred to in points (i) or (ii), in respect of which VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of specific refund schemes or compensation funds not foreseen by Directive 2006/112/EC, even if that scheme or fund is established by national VAT legislation.\n\n\nVAT relating to the activities listed in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be regarded as paid by a beneficiary other than a non-taxable person as defined in the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of that Directive, regardless of whether those activities are regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in by bodies governed by public law acting as public authorities.\n\n\n(d)depreciation costs, provided they are actually incurred by the beneficiary;\n\n\n(e)salary costs of the personnel of national administrations to the extent that they relate to the cost of activities which the relevant public authority would not carry out if the project concerned were not undertaken.\n\n\n5.Costs incurred by entities affiliated to a beneficiary referred to in Article 181 may be accepted as eligible, unless the authorising officer responsible declares them as ineligible under the call for proposals. The following conditions shall apply cumulatively:\n\n\n(a)the entities concerned are identified in the grant agreement;\n\n\n(b)the entities concerned abide by the rules applicable to the beneficiary under the grant agreement with regard to eligibility of costs and rights of checks and audits by the Commission, European Anti-Fraud Office and the Court of Auditors.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 181\n\nAffiliated entities and sole beneficiary\n\n\n1.For the purpose of this Title, the following entities shall be considered as entities affiliated to the beneficiary:\n\n\n(a)entities forming the beneficiary in accordance with paragraph\u00a02;\n\n\n(b)entities that satisfy the eligibility criteria and that do not fall within one of the situations referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 132 and in paragraph 1 of Article 137 and that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation.\n\n\nSection 2 of Chapter 2 of Title V shall apply also to affiliated entities. \n\n\n2.Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be treated as the sole beneficiary, including where the entity is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action to be financed by the grant.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\nPrinciples\u00a0\n\n\nArticle 182\n\nGeneral principles applicable to grants\n\n\nGrants shall be subject to the principles of: \n\n\n(a)equal treatment;\u00a0\n\n\n(b)transparency;\n\n\n(c)co-financing;\n\n\n(d)non cumulative award and no double financing;\n\n\n(e)non retroactivity.\n\n\nArticle 183\nTransparency\n\n\n1.Grants shall be awarded following a publication of calls for proposals, except in the cases referred to in Article 188.\n\n\n2.All grants awarded in the course of a financial year shall be published in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 36.\n\n\n3.Following the publication referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, when requested by the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission shall forward a report to them on:\n\n\n(a)the number of applicants in the past year;\n\n\n(b)the number and percentage of successful applications per call for proposals;\n\n\n\n\n(c)the average duration of the procedure from date of closure of the call for proposals to the award of a grant;\n\n\n(d)the number and amount of grants where the ex post publication obligation was waived in the past year in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 36.\n\n\nArticle 184\n\nCo-financing \n\n\n1.Grants shall involve co-financing. This means that the resources necessary to carry out the action or the work programme shall not be provided entirely by the grant.\n\n\nCo-financing may take the form of the beneficiary\u2019s own resources, income generated by the action or work programme or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties.\n\n\n2.Contributions in kind from third parties in the form of volunteers' work referred to in paragraph 8 of Article 175 shall be presented as eligible costs in the estimated budget.

Paragraph 4 of Article 127\u00a0shall apply even after the amount of the grant has become final.\n\n\n2.Where controls or audits demonstrate systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations attributable to the beneficiary and having a material impact on a number of grants awarded to that beneficiary under similar conditions, the authorising officer responsible may suspend the implementation of the grant agreement or payments under all the grants concerned or, where appropriate, terminate the concerned grant agreements with that beneficiary, in proportion to the seriousness of the findings.\n\n\nThe authorising officer responsible may, in addition, reduce the grants, reject ineligible costs and recover, if necessary, amounts unduly paid in respect of all the grants affected by the systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations referred to in the first subparagraph that may be subject to audits, checks and investigations in accordance with the grant agreements affected.\n\n\n3.The authorising officer responsible shall determine the amounts to be reduced or recovered, wherever possible and practicable, on the basis of costs unduly declared as eligible for each grant concerned, following acceptance of the revised reports and financial statements submitted by the beneficiary.\n\n\n4.Where it is not possible or practicable to quantify precisely the amount of ineligible costs for each grant concerned, the amounts to be reduced or recovered may be determined by extrapolating the reduction or recovery rate applied to the grants for which the systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations have been demonstrated, or, where ineligible costs cannot serve as a basis for determining the amounts to be reduced or recovered, by applying a flat rate, having regard to the principle of proportionality. The beneficiary shall be given the opportunity to propose a duly substantiated alternative method or rate before the reduction or recovery is made.\n\n\nArticle 196\nSupporting documents for payment requests\n\n\n1.The authorising officer responsible shall specify the supporting documents required to accompany payment requests. \n\n\n2.For each grant, prefinancing may be split into several instalments in accordance with sound financial management.

Otherwise, the instalment shall be reduced by the amounts still to be consumed until that threshold is reached.\n\n\n3.The beneficiary shall, without prejudice to the obligation to provide supporting documents, certify on its honour that information contained in payment requests is full, reliable and true.

Such a certificate shall be requested on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account, in particular, the amount of the grant, the amount of the payment, the nature of the beneficiary and the nature of the supported activities.\n\n\nThe certificate shall be produced by an approved external auditor or in case of public bodies, by a competent and independent public officer.\n\n\nThe certificate shall certify, in accordance with a methodology approved by the authorising officer responsible and on the basis of agreed-upon procedures compliant with international standards, that the costs declared by the beneficiary in the financial statements on which the payment request is based are real, accurately recorded and eligible in accordance with the grant agreement. In specific and duly justified cases, the authorising officer responsible may request the certificate in the form of an opinion or other format in accordance with international standards.\n\n\n\n\n5.An operational verification report, produced by an independent third party approved by the authorising officer responsible, may be requested by the authorising officer responsible in support of any payment, on the basis of a risk assessment. The verification report shall state that the operational verification was done in accordance with a methodology approved by the authorising officer responsible and whether the action or work programme was actually implemented in accordance with the conditions set out in the grant agreement.\n\n\nArticle 197\n\nFinancial support to third parties\n\n\nWhere implementation of an action or a work programme requires financial support to be given to third parties, the beneficiary may give such financial support provided that the conditions for the giving of such support are strictly defined in the grant agreement between the beneficiary and the Commission, in order to avoid the exercise of discretion by the beneficiary.\n\n\nThe discretion is considered exhausted\u00a0if the grant agreement specifies the following:\n\n\n(a)the maximum amount of financial support that can be paid to a third party which shall not exceed EUR 60 000 and the criteria for determining the exact amount. This threshold can be exceeded where achieving the objectives of the actions would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult;\n\n\n(b)the different types of activities that may receive such financial support, on the basis of a fixed list;\n\n\n(c)the definition of the persons or categories of persons which may receive such financial support and the criteria to give it.\n\n\nArticle 198\n Implementation contracts\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to the application of the Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU\n49\n, where implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a procurement contract, the beneficiary may award the contract in accordance with its usual purchasing practices provided that the contract is awarded to the tender offering best value for money or, as appropriate, to the tender offering the lowest price, while avoiding any conflict of interests.\n\n\n2.Where implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a procurement contract with a value of more than EUR 60 000, the authorising officer responsible may, if duly justified, require the beneficiary to abide by special rules in addition to those referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\nThose special rules shall be based on rules contained in this Regulation and shall be proportionate to the value of the contracts concerned, the relative size of the Union contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Such special rules shall be included in the grant agreement.\n\n\nTITLE IX\nPRIZES\n\n\nArticle 199\nGeneral rules\n\n\n1.Prizes shall respect the principles of transparency and equal treatment and shall promote the achievement of policy objectives of the Union. \n\n\n2.Prizes may not be awarded directly without a contest.\n\n\nContests for prizes with a unit value of EUR 1 000 000 or more may only be published where those prizes are mentioned in the financing decision referred to in Article 108 and after information on such prizes has been submitted to the European Parliament.\n\n\n3.The amount of the prize shall not be linked to costs incurred by the winner. \n\n\n4.Where implementation of an action or work programme requires prizes to be given to third parties by a beneficiary of a Union grant, that beneficiary may give such prizes provided that the eligibility and award criteria, the amount of the prizes and the payment arrangements are defined in the grant agreement between the beneficiary and the Commission, with no margin for discretion. \n\n\nArticle 200\nRules of contest, award and publication\n\n\n1.Rules of contests shall:\n\n\n\n\n(a)specify the eligibility criteria;\n\n\n(b)specify the arrangements and final date for the registration of applicants, if required, and for the submission of applications;\n\n\n(c)specify the exclusion criteria;\n\n\n(d)provide for the sole liability of applicant in case of claim relating to the activities carried out in the framework of the contest;\n\n\n(e)provide for acceptance by the winners of obligations referred to in Article 124 and of the publicity obligations as specified in the rules of the contest;\n\n\n(f)state that Union law is the law which applies to the contest, complemented, where necessary, by national law as specified in the rules of contest;\n\n\n(g)specify the competent court or arbitration tribunal to hear disputes;\n\n\n(h)the award criteria, which shall be such as to make possible to assess the quality of the applications with regard to the objectives pursued and the expected results and to determine objectively whether applications qualify as the winners;\n\n\n(i)the amount of the prize or prizes;\n\n\n(j)the arrangements for the payment of prizes to the winners after their award.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, beneficiaries of Union grants shall be eligible, unless stated otherwise in the rules of contest.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (f) of the first subparagraph, derogation may be made in the case of participation of international organisations.\n\n\nParagraph 3 of Article 187 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the publication of contests.\n\n\n2.Rules of contests may set the conditions for cancelling the contest, in particular where its objectives cannot be fulfilled.\n\n\n3.Prizes shall be awarded by the authorising officer responsible following an evaluation by the evaluation committee referred to in Article 145.\n\n\nParagraph 6 of Article 193 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the award decision.\n\n\n4.Applicants shall be informed as soon as possible of the outcome of the evaluation of their application and in any case within 15 calendar days after the award decision has been taken by the authorising officer.\n\n\nThe decision to award the prize shall be notified to the winning applicant and shall serve as the legal commitment..\n\n\n5.All prizes awarded in a course of a financial year shall be published in accordance with paragraph 1 to 4 of Article 36.\n\n\nFollowing the publication when requested by the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission shall forward them a report on:\n\n\n\n\n(a)the number of applicants in the past year;\n\n\n(b)the number of applicants and the percentage of successful applications per contest;\n\n\n(c)a list of the experts having taken part in evaluation committees in the past year, together with a reference to the procedure for their selection.\n\n\nTITLE X\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, BUDGETARY GUARANTEES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\nCommon provisions\n\n\nArticle 201\nScope and implementation\n\n\n1.The Union may establish financial instruments or provide budgetary guarantees or financial assistance backed by the general budget by means of a basic act.\n\n\n2.Member States may contribute to the Union's financial instruments, budgetary guarantees or financial assistance.

541/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council \n\n\nChapter 1\nCommon provisions\n\n\nSection 1\n\n\nFramework contracts and publicity\n\n\n1.Framework contracts and specific contracts\n\n\n1.1.The duration of a framework contract may not exceed four years, save in exceptional cases duly justified in particular by the subject matter of the framework contract.\n\n\nSpecific contracts based on framework contracts shall be awarded in accordance with the terms of the framework contract.\n\n\nWhen awarding specific contracts, the parties may not make substantial changes to the framework contract.\n\n\n1.2.Where a framework contract is concluded with a single economic operator, the specific contracts shall be awarded within the limits of the terms laid down in the framework contract.\n\n\nIn duly justified circumstances, contracting authorities may consult in writing the contractor, requesting it to supplement its tender if necessary.\n\n\n1.3.Where a framework contract is to be concluded with several economic operators (\u2018multiple framework contract\u2019), it may take the form of separate contracts signed in identical terms with each contractor.\n\n\nSpecific contracts based on framework contracts concluded with several economic operators shall be implemented in one of the following ways:\n\n\n(a)following the terms of the framework contract: without reopening of competition, where it sets out all the terms governing the provision of the works, supplies or services concerned and the objective conditions for determining which of the contractors shall perform them;\n\n\n(b)where not all the terms governing the provision of the works, supplies or services concerned are laid down in the framework contract: through reopening of competition among the contractors, in accordance with point 1.4 and on the basis of any of the following:\n\n\n(i)the same and, where necessary, more precisely formulated terms,\n\n\n(ii)where appropriate, on the basis of other terms referred to in the procurement documents relating to the framework contract.\n\n\n\n\n(c)partly without reopening of competition in accordance with point (a) and partly with reopening of competition amongst the contractors in accordance with point (b), where this possibility has been stipulated by the contracting authority in the procurement documents relating to the framework contract.\n\n\nThe procurement documents referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph shall also specify which terms may be subject to reopening of competition.\n\n\n1.4.A multiple framework contract with reopening of competition shall be concluded with at least three economic operators, provided that there is a sufficient number of admissible tenders as referred to in point\u00a029.3 of the Annex.\n\n\nWhen awarding a specific contract through reopening of competition among the contractors, the contracting authority shall consult them in writing and fix a time limit which is sufficiently long to allow specific tenders to be submitted. Specific tenders shall be submitted in writing. The contracting authority shall award each specific contract to the tenderer who has submitted the most economically advantageous specific tender on the basis of the award criteria set out in the procurement documents relating to the framework contract.\n\n\n1.5.In sectors subject to a rapid price and technological evolution, framework contracts without reopening of competition shall contain a clause either on a mid-term review or on a benchmarking system. After the mid-term review, if the conditions initially laid down are no longer adapted to the price or technological evolution, the contracting authority shall not use the framework contract concerned and shall take appropriate measures to terminate it.\n\n\n2.Specific contracts based on framework contracts shall be preceded by a budgetary commitment.\n\n\n2.1.Advertising of procedures equal to or greater than the thresholds under Article\u00a0169(1) or for contracts falling within the scope of Directive 2014/24/EU\n\n\n2.2.The notices for publication in the Official Journal of the European Union shall include all the information set out in the relevant standard forms referred to in Directive 2014/24/EU to ensure transparency of the procedure.\n\n\n2.3.The contracting authority may make known its intentions of planned procurement for the financial year through the publication of a prior information notice. It shall cover a period equal to or less than 12 months from the date on which the notice is sent to the Publications Office.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may publish the prior information notice either in the Official Journal of the European Union or on its buyer profile. In the latter case, a notice of publication on the buyer profile shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n\n2.4.The contracting authority shall send to the Publications Office an award notice on the results of the procedure no later than 30 days after the signature of a contract or framework contract with a value equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1). \n\n\nHowever, notices relating to contracts based on a dynamic purchasing system may be grouped together on a quarterly basis. In such cases, the contracting authority shall send the notice no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter.\n\n\n2.5.The contracting authority shall publish an award notice:\n\n\n(a)before signing a contract or a framework contract with a value equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1)\u00a0and awarded pursuant to the procedure under point\u00a011.1(b);\n\n\n(b)after signing a contract or a framework contract with a value equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1) including awarded pursuant to the procedures under points (a) and (c) to (f) of point\u00a011.1 .\n\n\n2.6.The contracting authority shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union a notice of modification of contract during its duration in the cases set out in points (a) and (b) of Article\u00a0166(3) where the value of the modification is equal to or greater than the thresholds set in Article\u00a0169(1) or is equal to or greater than the thresholds set in Article\u00a0172(1) for procedures in the field of external actions.\n\n\n2.7.In case of interinstitutional procedure, the contracting authority responsible for the procedure shall be in charge of the applicable publicity measures.\n\n\n3.Advertising of procedures falling below the thresholds under Article\u00a0169(1) or falling outside the scope of Directive 2014/24/EU\n\n\n3.1.Procedures with an estimated contract value below the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1) shall be advertised by appropriate means. Such advertising shall involve appropriate ex ante publicity on the internet or a contract notice or, for contracts awarded in accordance with the procedure set out in point\u00a013, the publication of a notice for a call for expressions of interest in the Official Journal of the European Union. This obligation shall not apply to the procedure set out in point\u00a011 and the negotiated procedure for very low value contracts under point\u00a014.4.\n\n\n3.2.For contracts awarded in accordance with points (g) and (i) of point\u00a011, the contracting authority shall send a list of contracts no later than 30\u00a0June of the following financial year, to the European Parliament and Council. In the case of the Commission, it shall be annexed to the summary of the annual activity reports referred to in Article\u00a073(9).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.Contract award information shall contain the name of the contractor, the amount legally committed\u00a0and the subject matter of the contract and, in the case of direct and specific contracts, it shall comply with Article\u00a036(3).\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall publish a list of contracts on its internet site no later than 30\u00a0June of the following financial year for:\n\n\n(a)contracts below the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1);\n\n\n(b)contracts awarded in accordance with points (h) and (j) to (m) of point\u00a011;\n\n\n(c)modifications of contracts as set out in point (c) of Article\u00a0166(3);\n\n\n(d)modifications of contracts as set out in points (a) and (b) of Article\u00a0166(3) where the value of the modification is below the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1);\n\n\n(e)specific contracts under a framework contract.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (e) of the second subparagraph the published information may be aggregated per contractor for the same subject matter.\n\n\n3.4.In case of interinstitutional framework contracts, each contracting authority shall be responsible for advertising its specific contracts and their modifications under the conditions set in point 3.3.\n\n\n4.Publication of notices\n\n\n4.1.The contracting authority shall draw up and transmit the notices referred to in points\u00a02 and 3\u00a0by electronic means to the Publications Office.\n\n\n4.2.The Publications Office shall publish the notices referred to in points\u00a02 and 3\u00a0in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than:\n\n\n(a)seven days after their dispatch if the contracting authority uses the electronic system for filling the standard forms referred to in point 2.1 of the Annex and limits free text to 500 words;\n\n\n(b)12 days after their dispatch in all other cases.\n\n\n4.3.The contracting authority must be able to provide evidence of the date of dispatch.\n\n\n5.Other forms of advertising\n\n\nIn addition to the advertising provided for in points\u00a02 and 3 procurement procedures may be advertised in any other way, notably in electronic form. Any such advertising shall refer to the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union if the notice has been published, and may not precede the publication of that notice, which alone is authentic.\n\n\nSuch advertising may not introduce any discrimination between candidates or tenderers nor contain details other than those contained in the contract notice, if the notice has been published.\n\n\nSection 2\n\n\nProcurement procedures\n\n\n\n\n6.Minimum number of candidates and arrangements for negotiation\n\n\n6.1.In a restricted procedure and in the procedures referred to in points (a) and (b) of point\u00a013.1 and in point\u00a014.2, the minimum number of candidates shall be five.\n\n\n6.2.In the competitive procedure with negotiation, the competitive dialogue, the innovation partnership, the prospection of the local market under point\u00a011.1(g)\u00a0and the negotiated procedure for low value contracts under point\u00a014.3\u00a0the minimum number of candidates shall be three.\n\n\n6.3.Points 6.1 and 6.2 shall not apply in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)negotiated procedures for very low value contracts under point\u00a014.4;\n\n\n(b)negotiated procedures without prior publication under point\u00a011\u00a0except for design contests under point\u00a011.1(d) and prospection of the local market under point\u00a011.1(g).\n\n\n6.4.Where the number of candidates meeting the selection criteria is below the minimum number specified in points 6.1 and 6.2, the contracting authority may continue the procedure by inviting the candidates with the required capacities. The contracting authority may not include other economic operators that did not initially request to participate or that it did not initially invite.\n\n\n6.5.During a negotiation, the contracting authority shall ensure equal treatment for all tenderers.\n\n\n6.6.A negotiation may take place in successive stages in order to reduce the number of tenders to be negotiated by applying the award criteria specified in the procurement documents. The contracting authority shall indicate whether it will use that option in the procurement documents.\n\n\n6.7.For the procedures laid down in points (d) and (g) of point\u00a011.1 and points\u00a014.2 and 14.3, the contracting authority shall invite at least all economic operators who have expressed interest following ex ante publicity as set out in point\u00a03.1\u00a0or prospection of the local market or a design contest.\n\n\n7.Innovation partnership\n\n\n7.1.The innovation partnership shall aim at the development of an innovative product, service or innovative works and the subsequent purchase of the resulting works, supplies or services, provided that they correspond to the performance levels and maximum costs agreed between the contracting authorities and the partners.\n\n\nThe innovation partnership shall be structured in successive phases following the sequence of steps in the research and innovation process, which may include the completion of the works, the manufacturing of the products or the provision of the services. The innovation partnership shall set intermediate targets to be attained by the partners.\n\n\nBased on those intermediate targets, the contracting authority may decide after each phase to terminate the innovation partnership or, in the case of an innovation partnership with several partners, to reduce the number of partners by terminating individual contracts, provided that the contracting authority has indicated in the procurement documents those possibilities and the conditions for their use.\n\n\n7.2.Before launching an innovation partnership, the contracting authority shall consult the market as provided for in point\u00a015 in order to ascertain that the work, supply or service does not exist on the market or as near-to-market development activity.\n\n\nThe arrangements on negotiation set out in Article\u00a0158(4) and in point\u00a06.5 shall be followed.\n\n\nIn the procurement documents, the contracting authority shall identify the need for innovative works, supplies or services that cannot be met by purchasing works, supplies or services already available on the market. It shall indicate which elements of this description define the minimum requirements. The information provided shall be sufficiently precise to enable economic operators to identify the nature and scope of the required solution and decide whether to request to participate in the procedure.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may decide to set up the innovation partnership with one partner or with several partners conducting separate research and development activities.\n\n\nThe contracts shall be awarded on the sole basis of the best price-quality ratio as set out in Article\u00a0161(4).\n\n\n7.3.In the procurement documents, the contracting authority shall specify the arrangements applicable to intellectual property rights.\n\n\n\n\nIn the framework of the innovation partnership, the contracting authority shall not reveal to the other partners solutions proposed or other confidential information communicated by a partner without its agreement.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall ensure that the structure of the partnership and, in particular, the duration and value of the different phases reflect the degree of innovation of the proposed solution and the sequence of the research and innovation activities required for the development of an innovative solution not yet available on the market. The estimated value of works, supplies or services shall not be disproportionate in relation to the investment required for their development.\n\n\n8.Design contests\n\n\n8.1.Design contests shall be subject to the rules on advertising set out in point\u00a02\u00a0and may include the award of prizes.\n\n\nWhere design contests are restricted to a limited number of candidates, the contracting authority shall lay down clear and non-discriminatory selection criteria.\n\n\nThe number of candidates invited to participate must be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.\n\n\n8.2.The jury shall be appointed by the authorising officer responsible. It shall be composed exclusively of natural persons who are independent of candidates in the contest. Where a particular professional qualification is required from candidates in a contest, at least one third of the members of the jury must have the same or an equivalent qualification.\n\n\nThe jury shall be autonomous in its opinions. Its opinions shall be adopted on the basis of projects submitted to it anonymously by the candidates and solely in the light of the criteria set out in the contest notice.\n\n\n8.3.The proposals of the jury, based on the merits of each project, and its ranking and remarks, shall be recorded in a report signed by its members.\n\n\nCandidates shall remain anonymous until the jury has given its opinion.\n\n\nCandidates may be asked by the jury to answer the questions recorded in the report in order to clarify a project. A full report of the resulting dialogue shall be drawn up.\n\n\n8.4.The contracting authority shall then take an award decision giving the name and address of the candidate selected and the reasons for the choice by reference to the criteria announced in the contest notice, especially if it departs from the proposals made in the jury's opinion.\n\n\n9.Dynamic purchasing system\n\n\n9.1.The dynamic purchasing system is a completely electronic process for making commonly used purchases, which is open throughout its duration to any economic operator who satisfies the selection criteria. It may be divided into categories of works, supplies or services that are objectively defined on the basis of characteristics of the procurement to be undertaken under the category concerned. In this case, selection criteria must be defined for each category.\n\n\n9.2.The contracting authority shall indicate in the procurement documents the nature and estimated quantity of the purchases envisaged and all the necessary information concerning the purchasing system, the electronic equipment used and the technical connection arrangements and specifications.\n\n\n9.3.The contracting authority shall give any economic operator, throughout the period of validity of the dynamic purchasing system, the possibility of requesting to participate in the system. It shall complete its evaluation of such requests within 10 working days of receipt of that request. This deadline may be prolonged to 15 working days where justified. However, the contracting authority may extend the evaluation period provided that no invitation to tender is issued in the meantime.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall inform the candidate at the earliest possible opportunity of whether or not it has been admitted to the dynamic purchasing system.\n\n\n9.4.The contracting authority shall invite all candidates admitted to the system under the relevant category to submit a tender within a reasonable time. The contracting authority shall award the contract to the tenderer who has submitted the most economically advantageous tender on the basis of the award criteria set out in the contract notice. Those criteria may, if appropriate, be formulated more precisely in the invitation to tender.\n\n\n9.5.The contracting authority shall indicate the period of validity of the dynamic purchasing system in the contract notice.\n\n\nA dynamic purchasing system may not last for more than four years, except in duly justified exceptional cases.\n\n\n\n\nThe contracting authority may not resort to this system to prevent, restrict or distort competition.\n\n\n10.Competitive dialogue\n\n\n10.1.The contracting authority shall specify its needs and requirements, the award criteria and an indicative timeframe in the contract notice or in a descriptive document.\n\n\nIt shall award the contract to the tender offering the best price-quality ratio.\n\n\n10.2.The contracting authority shall open a dialogue with the candidates satisfying the selection criteria in order to identify and define the means best suited to satisfying its needs. It may discuss all aspects of the procurement with the selected candidates during this dialogue but it cannot alter its needs and requirements and award criteria as provided for in point 10.1.\n\n\nDuring the course of dialogue, the contracting authority shall ensure equality of treatment among all tenderers and shall not reveal the solutions proposed or other confidential information communicated by a tenderer without its agreement to waive that confidentiality.\n\n\nThe competitive dialogue may take place in successive stages in order to reduce the number of solutions to be discussed by applying the announced award criteria if provision is made for this possibility in the contract notice or the descriptive document.\n\n\n10.3.The contracting authority shall continue the dialogue until it can identify the solution or solutions which are capable of meeting its needs.\n\n\nAfter informing the remaining tenderers that the dialogue is concluded, the contracting authority shall ask each of them to submit their final tenders on the basis of the solution or solutions presented and specified during the dialogue. These tenders shall contain all the elements required and necessary for the performance of the project.\n\n\nAt the request of the contracting authority, these final tenders may be clarified, specified and optimised provided this does not involve substantial changes to the tender or to the procurement documents.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may negotiate with the tenderer having submitted the tender offering the best price-quality ratio to confirm commitments contained in the tender provided this does not have the effect of modifying substantial aspects of the tender and does not risk distorting competition or causing discrimination.\n\n\n10.4.The contracting authority may specify payments to the selected candidates taking part in the dialogue.\n\n\n11.Use of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice\n\n\n11.1.When the contracting authority uses the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice, it shall follow the arrangements on negotiation set out in Article\u00a0158(4) and in point\u00a06.5.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may use the negotiated procedure regardless of the estimated value of the contract, in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)where no tenders, or no suitable tender, or no request to participate or no suitable request to participate as provided for in point 11.2 have been submitted in response to an open procedure or restricted procedure after this procedure has been completed, provided that the original procurement documents are not substantially altered;\n\n\n(b)where the works, supplies or services can only be provided by a single economic operator under the conditions set out in point 11.3 and for any of the following reasons:\n\n\n(i)the aim of the procurement is the creation or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic performance;\n\n\n(ii)competition is absent for technical reasons;\n\n\n(iii)the protection of exclusive rights including intellectual property rights must be ensured;\n\n\n\n\n(c)in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events, it is impossible to comply with the time limits laid down in points\u00a024, 26 and 41\u00a0and where the justification of such extreme urgency is not attributable to the contracting authority;\n\n\n(d)where a service contract follows a design contest and is to be awarded to the winner or to one of the winners; in the latter case, all winners must be invited to participate in the negotiations;\n\n\n(e)for new services or works consisting in the repetition of similar services or works entrusted to the economic operator to which the same contracting authority awarded an original contract, provided that these services or works are in conformity with a basic project for which the original contract was awarded after publication of a contract notice, subject to the conditions set out in point 11.4;\n\n\n(f)for supply contracts:\n\n\n(i)for additional deliveries which are intended either as a partial replacement of supplies or installations or as the extension of existing supplies or installations, where a change of supplier would oblige the contracting authority to acquire supplies having different technical characteristics which would result in incompatibility or disproportionate technical difficulties in operation and maintenance; when the institutions award contracts on their own account, the duration of such contracts may not exceed three years;\n\n\n(ii)where the products are manufactured purely for the purpose of research, experimentation, study or development; however such contracts shall not include quantity production to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs;\n\n\n(iii)for supplies quoted and purchased on a commodity market;\n\n\n(iv)for purchases of supplies on particularly advantageous terms, from either an economic operator which is definitively winding up its business activities, or the liquidators in an insolvency procedure, an arrangement with creditors, or a similar procedure under national law;\n\n\n(g)for building contracts, after prospecting the local market;\n\n\n(h)for contracts for any of the following:\n\n\n(i)legal representation by a lawyer within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Council Directive 77/249/EEC\n1\n\u00a0in arbitration or conciliation or judicial proceedings;\n\n\n(ii)legal advice given in the preparation of the proceedings referred to above or where there is tangible indication and high probability that the matter to which the advice relates will become the subject of such proceedings, provided that the advice is given by a lawyer within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Directive 77/249/EEC;\n\n\n(iii)for arbitration and conciliation services;\n\n\n(iv)document certification and authentication services which must be provided by notaries;\n\n\n(i)for contracts declared to be secret or for contracts whose performance must be accompanied by special security measures, in accordance with the administrative provisions in force or when the protection of the essential interests of the Union so requires, provided the essential interests concerned cannot be guaranteed by other measures; these measures may consist of requirements to protect the confidential nature of information which the contracting authority makes available in the procurement procedure;\n\n\n(j)for financial services in connection with the issue, sale, purchase or transfer of securities or other financial instruments within the meaning of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n2\n\u00a0, central bank services and operations conducted with the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism;\n\n\n(k)loans, whether or not in connection with the issue, sale, purchase or transfer of securities or other financial instruments;\n\n\n(l)for the purchase of public communication networks and electronic communications services within the meaning of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n3\n\u00a0;\n\n\n(m)services provided by an international organisation where it cannot participate in competitive procedures according to its statute or act of establishment.\n\n\n11.2.A tender shall be considered unsuitable where it does not relate to the subject matter of the contract and a request to participate shall be considered unsuitable where the economic operator is in an exclusion situation under Article\u00a0132(1) or does not meet the selection criteria.\n\n\n\n\n11.3.The exceptions set out in points (ii) and (iii) of point (b) of point 11.1 shall only apply when no reasonable alternative or substitute exists and the absence of competition is not the result of an artificial narrowing down of the parameters when defining the procurement.\n\n\n11.4.In the cases referred to in point (e) of point 11.1, the basic project shall indicate the extent of possible new services or works and the conditions under which they will be awarded. As soon as the basic project is put up for tender, the possible use of the negotiated procedure shall be disclosed, and the total estimated amount for the subsequent services or works shall be taken into consideration in applying the thresholds referred to in Article\u00a0169(1) or in Articles\u00a0172(1) in the field of external actions. When the institutions award contracts on their own account, that procedure may only be used during the performance of the original contract and at the latest during the three years following its signature.\n\n\n12.Use of a competitive procedure with negotiation or competitive dialogue\n\n\n12.1.When the contracting authority uses the competitive procedure with negotiation or the competitive dialogue, it shall follow the arrangements on negotiation set out in Article\u00a0158(4) and in point\u00a06.5. The contracting authority may use these procedures regardless of the estimated value of the contract, in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)where only irregular or unacceptable tenders as specified in points 12.2 and 12.3 have been submitted in response to an open or restricted procedure after this procedure has been completed provided that the original procurement documents are not substantially altered; the publication of a contract notice may be waived under the conditions set out in point 12.4;\n\n\n(b)with regard to works, supplies or services fulfilling one or more of the following criteria:\n\n\n(i)where the needs of the contracting authority cannot be met without the adaptation of a readily available solution;\n\n\n(ii)the works, supplies or services include design or innovative solutions;\n\n\n(iii)the contract cannot be awarded without prior negotiations because of specific circumstances related to the nature, complexity or the legal and financial make-up of the contract or the risks attached to the subject matter of the contract;\n\n\n(iv)the technical specifications cannot be established with sufficient precision by the contracting authority with reference to a standard, as set out in point\u00a017.3;\n\n\n(c)for concession contracts;\n\n\n(d)for the service contracts referred to in Annex XIV to Directive 2014/24/EU;\n\n\n(e)for research and development services other than those covered by CPV codes 73000000-2 to 73120000-9, 73300000-5, 73420000-2 and 73430000-5 unless the benefits accrue exclusively to the contracting authority for its use in the conduct of its own affairs, or unless the service provided is wholly remunerated by the contracting authority;\n\n\n(f)for service contracts for the acquisition, development, production or co-production of programme material intended for audiovisual or radio media services as defined in Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\n4\n or contracts for broadcasting time or programme provision.\n\n\n12.2.A tender shall be considered irregular in any of the following cases:\n\n\n(a)when it does not comply with the minimum requirements specified in the procurement documents;\n\n\n(b)when it does not comply with the requirements for submission set out in Article\u00a0162(3) ;\n\n\n(c)when the tenderer is rejected under points (b) or (c) of Article\u00a0137(1);\n\n\n(d)when the contracting authority has declared the tender to be abnormally low.\n\n\n12.3.A tender shall be considered unacceptable in any of the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n(a)when the price of the tender exceeds the contracting authority's maximum budget as determined and documented prior to the launching of the procurement procedure;\n\n\n(b)when the tender fails to meet the minimum quality levels for award criteria.\n\n\n12.4.In the cases referred to in point (a) of point 12.1, the contracting authority shall not be required to publish a contract notice if it includes in the competitive procedure with negotiation all those tenderers who satisfied exclusion and selection criteria except those who submitted a tender declared to be abnormally low.\n\n\n13.Procedure involving a call for expressions of interest\n\n\n13.1.For contracts with a value below the thresholds referred to in Article\u00a0169(1) or in Article\u00a0172\u00a0(1) and without prejudice to points\u00a011 and 12 the contracting authority may use a call for expressions of interest to do either of the following:\n\n\n(a)to pre-select candidates to be invited to submit tenders in response to future restricted invitations to tender;\n\n\n(b)to collect a list of vendors to be invited to submit requests to participate or tenders.\n\n\n13.2.The list drawn up following a call for expressions of interest shall be valid for not more than four years from the date on which the notice referred to in point\u00a03.1\u00a0is published.\n\n\nThe list referred to in the first subparagraph may include sub-lists.\n\n\nAny interested economic operator may express interest at any time during the period of validity of the list, with the exception of the last three months of that period.\n\n\n13.3.Where a contract is to be awarded, the contracting authority shall invite all candidates or vendors entered on the relevant list or sub-list to do either of the following:\n\n\n(a)to submit a tender in the case referred to in point (a) of point 13.1;\n\n\n(b)to submit, in case of the list referred to in point (b) of point 13.1, either of the following:\n\n\n(i)tenders including documents relating to exclusion and selection criteria;\n\n\n(ii)documents relating to exclusion and selection criteria and, in a second step, tenders, for those fulfilling these criteria.\n\n\n14.Middle, low and very low value contracts\n\n\n14.1.Middle, low and very low value contracts may be awarded by negotiated procedure following the arrangements on negotiation set out in Article\u00a0158(4) and in point\u00a06.5. Only candidates invited simultaneously and in writing by the contracting authority may submit an initial tender.\n\n\n14.2.A contract of a value exceeding EUR 60 000 and below the thresholds referred to in Article\u00a0169(1) shall be deemed of middle value. Point\u00a03.1 and points 6.1 and 6.4 shall apply to such procedures.\n\n\n14.3.A contract of a value not exceeding EUR 60 000 shall be deemed of low value. Points\u00a03.1 and points 6.2 and 6.4 shall apply to such procedures. \n\n\n14.4.A contract of a value not exceeding EUR 15 000 shall be deemed of very low value. Point\u00a06.3 shall apply to such procedures.\n\n\n\n\n14.5.Payments of amounts not exceeding EUR 1\u00a0000 in respect of items of expenditure may consist simply in payment against invoices, without prior acceptance of a tender.\n\n\n15.Preliminary market consultation\n\n\n15.1.For preliminary market consultation, the contracting authority may seek or accept advice from independent experts or authorities or from economic operators. That advice may be used in the planning and conduct of the procurement procedure, provided that such advice does not have the effect of distorting competition and does not result in a violation of the principles of non-discrimination and transparency.\n\n\n15.2.Where an economic operator has advised the contracting authority or has otherwise been involved in the preparation of the procurement procedure, the contracting authority shall take appropriate measures as set out in Article\u00a0137 to ensure that competition is not distorted by the participation of that economic operator.\n\n\n16.Procurement documents\n\n\n16.1.The procurement documents shall include the following:\n\n\n(a)if applicable, the contract notice or other advertising measure as provided for in points\u00a02 to 5;\n\n\n(b)the invitation to tender;\n\n\n(c)the tender specifications or the descriptive documents in the case of a competitive dialogue; they shall include the technical specifications and the relevant criteria;\n\n\n(d)the draft contract based on the model contract.\n\n\nPoint (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to cases where, due to exceptional and duly justified circumstances, the model contract cannot be used.\n\n\n16.2.The invitation to tender shall contain the following:\n\n\n(a)specify the rules governing the submission of tenders, including in particular the conditions to maintain them confidential until opening, the closing date and time for receipt and the address to which they must be sent or delivered or the internet address in case of electronic submission;\n\n\n(b)state that submission of a tender implies acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in the procurement documents and that this submission binds the contractor to whom the contract is awarded during performance of the contract;\n\n\n(c)specify the period during which a tender will remain valid and may not be modified in any respect;\n\n\n(d)forbid any contact between the contracting authority and the tenderer during the procedure, save, exceptionally, under the conditions laid down in Article\u00a0163, and, where provision is made for an on-the-spot visit, specify the arrangements for such a visit;\n\n\n(e)specify the means of proof for compliance with the time-limit for receipt of tenders;\n\n\n(f)state that submission of a tender implies acceptance of receiving notification of the outcome of the procedure by electronic means.\n\n\n16.3.The tender specifications shall contain the following:\n\n\n(a)the exclusion and selection criteria;\n\n\n\n\n(b)the award criteria and their relative weighting or, where weighting is not possible for objective reasons, their decreasing order of importance, which shall also apply to variants if they are authorised in the contract notice;\n\n\n(c)the technical specifications referred to in point\u00a017;\n\n\n(d)if variants are authorised, the minimum requirements which they must meet;\n\n\n(e)information whether the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union or, where appropriate, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or Vienna Convention on Consular Relations applies;\n\n\n(f)the evidence of access to procurement;\n\n\n(g)in the case of a dynamic purchasing system or electronic catalogues, the electronic equipment used and the technical connection arrangements and specifications needed.\n\n\n16.4.The draft contract shall contain the following:\n\n\n(a)specify the liquidated damages for failure to comply with its clauses;\n\n\n(b)specify the details which must be contained in invoices and in the relevant supporting documents in accordance with Article\u00a0109;\n\n\n(c)state that, when the institutions award contracts on their own account, the law which applies to the contract is Union law complemented, where necessary, by a national law or, if necessary for building contracts, exclusively national law;\n\n\n(d)specify the competent court for hearing disputes;\n\n\n(e)specify that the contractor shall comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X of Directive 2014/24/EU;\n\n\n(f)specify whether the transfer of intellectual property rights will be required;\n\n\n(g)state that the price quoted in the tender is firm and non-revisable or lay down the conditions or formulas for revision of prices during the lifetime of the contract.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (g) of the first subparagraph, if a revision of prices is set out in the contract, the contracting authority shall take particular account of:\n\n\n(i)the subject matter of the procurement and the economic situation in which it is taking place;\n\n\n(ii)the type of contract and tasks and its duration;\n\n\n(iii)its financial interests.\n\n\nPoints (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph may be waived for contracts signed in accordance with point (m) of point\u00a011.1.\n\n\n17.Technical specifications\n\n\n\n\n17.1.Technical specifications shall allow equal access of economic operators to the procurement procedures and not have the effect of creating unjustified obstacles to the opening up of procurement to competition.\n\n\nTechnical specifications shall include the characteristics required for works, supplies or services, including minimum requirements, so that they fulfil the use for which they are intended by the contracting authority.\n\n\n17.2.The characteristics referred to in point 17.1 may include as appropriate:\n\n\n(a)the quality levels;\n\n\n(b)environmental performance and climate performance;\n\n\n(c)for purchases intended for use by natural persons, the accessibility criteria for people with disabilities or the design for all users, except in duly justified cases;\n\n\n(d)the levels and procedures of conformity assessment;\n\n\n(e)performance or use of the supply;\n\n\n(f)safety or dimensions, including, for supplies, the sales name and user instructions, and, for all contracts, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking and labelling, production processes and methods;\n\n\n(g)for works contracts, the procedures relating to quality assurance and the rules relating to design and costing, the test, inspection and acceptance conditions for works and methods or techniques of construction and all the other technical conditions which the contracting authority is in a position to prescribe under general or specific regulations in relation to the finished works and to the materials or parts which they involve.\n\n\n17.3.The technical specifications shall be formulated in any of the following ways:\n\n\n(a)in order of preference, by reference to European standards, European technical assessments, common technical specifications, international standards, other technical reference systems established by European standardisation bodies or, failing this, their national equivalents; every reference shall be accompanied by the words \u2018or equivalent\u2019;\n\n\n(b)in terms of performance or of functional requirements, including environmental characteristics, provided that the parameters are sufficiently precise to allow tenderers to determine the subject matter of the contract and to allow the contracting authority to award the contract;\n\n\n(c)by a combination of the two methods set out in points (a) and (b).\n\n\n17.4.Where the contracting authority uses the option of referring to the specifications provided for in point (a) of point 17.3, it shall not reject a tender on the grounds that it does not comply with those specifications once the tenderer proves, by any appropriate means, that the solution proposed satisfies in equivalent manner the requirements defined in the technical specifications.\n\n\n17.5.Where the contracting authority uses the option provided for in point (b) of point 17.3, to formulate technical specifications in terms of performance or functional requirements, it shall not reject a tender which complies with a national standard transposing a European standard, a European technical approval, a common technical specifications, an international standard or technical reference systems established by a European standardisation body, if those specifications address the performance or functional requirements which it has laid down.\n\n\nThe tenderer shall prove by any appropriate means that the work, supply or service in compliance with the standard meets the performance or functional requirements set by the contracting authority.\n\n\n17.6.Where a contracting authority intends to purchase works, supplies or services with specific environmental, social or other characteristics, it may require a specific label or specific requirements from a label, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\n(a)the label requirements only concern criteria which are linked to the subject matter of the contract and are appropriate to define the characteristics of the purchase;\n\n\n(b)the label requirements are based on objectively verifiable and non-discriminatory criteria;\n\n\n\n\n(c)the labels are established in an open and transparent procedure in which all the relevant stakeholders may participate;\n\n\n(d)the labels are accessible to all interested parties;\n\n\n(e)the label requirements are set by a third party over which the economic operator applying for the label cannot exercise a decisive influence.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may require that economic operators provide a test report or a certificate as means of proof of conformity with the procurement documents from a conformity assessment body accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a0765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n5\n or an equivalent conformity assessment body.\n\n\n17.7.The contracting authority shall accept any other appropriate means of proof than those referred to in point 17.6, such as a technical dossier from the manufacturer, where the economic operator had no access to the certificates or test reports, or no possibility of obtaining them or obtaining a specific label within the relevant time limits, for reasons that are not attributable to that economic operator and provided that the economic operator concerned proves that the works, supplies or services to be provided fulfil the requirements of the specific label or specific requirements indicated by the contracting authority.\n\n\n17.8.Unless justified by the subject matter of the contract, technical specifications shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process which characterises the products or services provided by a specific economic operator, or to trade marks, patents, types or a specific origin or production with the effect of favouring or eliminating certain products or economic operators.\n\n\nSuch reference shall be permitted on an exceptional basis where a sufficiently detailed and intelligible description of the subject matter of the contract is not possible. Such reference shall be accompanied by the words \u2018or equivalent\u2019.\n\n\n18.Exclusion and selection criteria\n\n\n18.1.For the purpose of Article 133, the contracting authority shall accept the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) referred to in Directive 2014/24/EU, or, failing that, a declaration on honour signed and dated. \n\n\nAn economic operator may reuse an ESPD which has already been used in a previous procedure, provided that the economic operator confirms that the information contained therein continues to be correct. \n\n\n18.2.The contracting authority shall indicate in the procurement documents the selection criteria, the minimum levels of capacity and the evidence required to prove this capacity. All requirements shall be related and proportionate to the subject matter of the contract.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall specify in the procurement documents how groups of economic operators are to meet the selection criteria taking into account point 18.6.\n\n\nWhere a contract is divided into lots, the contracting authority may set minimum levels of capacity for each lot. It may set additional minimum levels of capacity in case several lots are awarded to the same contractor.\n\n\n18.3.With regard to capacity to pursue the professional activity, the contracting authority may require an economic operator to fulfil at least one of the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)be enrolled in a relevant professional or trade register, except for international organisations;\n\n\n(b)for service contracts, hold a particular authorisation proving that it is authorised to perform the contract in its country of establishment or be a member of a specific professional organisation.\n\n\n18.4.When receiving requests to participate or tenders, the contracting authority shall accept the ESPD or, failing that, a declaration on honour stating that the candidate or tenderer fulfils the selection criteria. The request for ESPD or declaration on honour may be waived for very low value contracts. \n\n\nThe contracting authority may ask tenderers and candidates at any moment during the procedure to submit an updated declaration or all or part of the supporting documents where this is necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the procedure.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall require the candidates or successful tenderer to submit up-to-date supporting documents except where it has already received them for the purpose of another procedure and provided that the documents are still up-to-date or it can access them on a national database free of charge.\n\n\n18.5.The contracting authority may, depending on its assessment of risks, decide not to require evidence of the legal, regulatory, financial, economic, technical and professional capacity of economic operators in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n(a)procedures for contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account, with a value not exceeding the value referred to in Article\u00a0169(1);\n\n\n(b)procedures for contracts awarded in the field of external actions, with a value not exceeding the thresholds referred to in Articles\u00a0172(1);\n\n\n(c)procedures under points (b), (e), points (i) and (iv) of point (f), (h) and (m) of point 11.1.\n\n\nWhere the contracting authority decides not to require evidence of the legal, regulatory, financial, economic, technical and professional capacity of economic operators, no pre-financing shall be made except in duly justified cases \n\n\n18.6.An economic operator may, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them. It must in that case prove to the contracting authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for the performance of the contract by producing a commitment by those entities to that effect.\n\n\nWith regard to technical and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the works or services for which these capacities are required.\n\n\nWhere an economic operator relies on the capacities of other entities with regard to criteria relating to economic and financial capacity, the contracting authority may require that the economic operator and those entities be jointly liable for the performance of the contract.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may request information from the tenderer on any part of the contract that the tenderer intends to subcontract and on the identity of any subcontractors.\n\n\nFor works or services provided at a facility directly under the oversight of the contracting authority, the contracting authority shall require the contractor to indicate the names, contacts and authorised representatives of subcontractors involved in the performance of the contract, including any changes of subcontractors.\n\n\n18.7.The contracting authority shall verify whether the entities on whose capacity the economic operator intends to rely and the envisaged subcontractors, when subcontracting represents a significant part of the contract, fulfil the relevant selection criteria.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity or subcontractor which does not meet a relevant selection criterion.\n\n\n18.8.In the case of works contracts, service contracts and siting or installation operations in the context of a supply contract, the contracting authority may require that certain critical tasks be performed directly by the tenderer itself or, where the tender is submitted by a group of economic operators, a participant in the group.\n\n\n18.9.The contracting authority shall not demand that a group of economic operators have a given legal form in order to submit a tender or request to participate, but the selected group may be required to adopt a given legal form after it has been awarded the contract if this change is necessary for proper performance of the contract.\n\n\n19.Economic and financial capacity\n\n\n19.1.To ensure that economic operators possess the necessary economic and financial capacity to perform the contract, the contracting authority may require in particular that:\n\n\n(a)economic operators have a certain minimum yearly turnover, including a certain minimum turnover in the area covered by the contract;\n\n\n(b)economic operators provide information on their annual accounts showing ratios between assets and liability;\n\n\n(c)economic operators provide an appropriate level of professional risk indemnity insurance.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, the minimum yearly turnover shall not exceed two times the estimated annual contract value, except in duly justified cases linked to the nature of the purchase, which the contracting authority shall explain in the procurement documents.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, the contracting authority shall explain the methods and criteria for such ratios in the procurement documents.\n\n\n\n\n19.2.In the case of dynamic purchasing systems, the maximum yearly turnover shall be calculated on the basis of the expected maximum size of specific contracts to be awarded under that system.\n\n\n19.3.The contracting authority shall define in the procurement documents the evidence to be provided by an economic operator to demonstrate its economic and financial capacity. It may request in particular one or more of the following documents:\n\n\n(a)appropriate statements from banks or, where appropriate, evidence of relevant professional risk indemnity insurance;\n\n\n(b)financial statements or their extracts for a period equal to or less than the last three years for which accounts have been closed;\n\n\n(c)a statement of the economic operator's overall turnover and, where appropriate, turnover in the area covered by the contract for a maximum of the last three financial years available.\n\n\nIf, for any valid reason, the economic operator is unable to provide the references requested by the contracting authority, it may prove its economic and financial capacity by any other document which the contracting authority considers appropriate.\n\n\n20.Technical and professional capacity\n\n\n20.1.The contracting authority shall verify that candidates or tenderers fulfil the minimum selection criteria concerning technical and professional capacity in accordance with points 20.2 to 20.5.\n\n\n20.2.The contracting authority shall define in the procurement documents the evidence to be provided by an economic operator to demonstrate its technical and professional capacity. It may request one or more of the following documents:\n\n\n(a)for works, supplies requiring siting or installation operations or services, the educational and professional qualifications, skills, experience and expertise of the persons responsible for performance;\n\n\n(b)a list of the following:\n\n\n(i)of the principal services provided and supplies delivered in the past three years, with the sums, dates and clients, public or private accompanied upon request by statements issued by the clients;\n\n\n(ii)of the works carried out in the last five years, accompanied by certificates of satisfactory execution for the most important works;\n\n\n(c)a statement of the technical equipment, tools or plant available to the economic operator for performing a service or works contract;\n\n\n(d)a description of the technical facilities and means available to the economic operator to for ensuring quality, and a description of available study and research facilities;\n\n\n(e)a reference to the technicians or technical bodies available to the economic operator, whether or not belonging directly to it, especially those responsible for quality control;\n\n\n(f)in respect of supplies: samples, descriptions or authentic photographs or certificates drawn up by official quality control institutes or agencies of recognised competence attesting the conformity of the products clearly identified by references to technical specifications or standards;\n\n\n(g)for works or services, a statement of the average annual manpower and the number of managerial staff of the economic operator for the last three years;\n\n\n(h)an indication of the supply chain management and tracking systems that the economic operator will be able to apply when performing the contract;\n\n\n(i)an indication of the environmental management measures that the economic operator will be able to apply when performing the contract.\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (i) of point (b) of the first subparagraph, where necessary in order to ensure an adequate level of competition, the contracting authority may indicate that evidence of relevant supplies or services delivered or performed more than three years before will be taken into account.\n\n\nFor the purposes of point (ii) of point (b) of the first subparagraph, where necessary in order to ensure an adequate level of competition, the contracting authority may indicate that evidence of relevant works delivered or performed more than five years before will be taken into account.\n\n\n20.3.Where the supplies or services are complex or, exceptionally, are required for a special purpose, evidence of technical and professional capacity may be secured by means of a check carried out by the contracting authority or on its behalf by a competent official body of the country in which the economic operator is established, subject to that body's agreement. Such checks shall concern the supplier's technical capacity and production capacity and, if necessary, its study and research facilities and quality control measures.\n\n\n20.4.Where the contracting authority requires the provision of certificates drawn up by independent bodies attesting the compliance of the economic operator with certain quality assurance standards, including on accessibility for disabled persons, it shall refer to quality assurance systems based on the relevant European standards series certified by accredited bodies. The contracting authority shall also accept other evidence of equivalent quality assurance measures from an economic operator that has demonstrably no access to such certificates or has no possibility of obtaining such certificates within the relevant time limits, for reasons that are not attributable to that economic operator and provided that the economic operator proves that the proposed quality assurance measures comply with the required quality assurance standards.\n\n\n20.5.Where the contracting authority requires the provision of certificates drawn up by independent bodies attesting that the economic operator complies with certain environmental management systems or standards, it shall refer to the European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme or to other environmental management systems as recognised in accordance with Article\u00a045 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n6\n or other environmental management standards based on the relevant European or international standards by accredited bodies. Where an economic operator had demonstrably no access to such certificates, or no possibility of obtaining them within the relevant time limits for reasons that are not attributable to that economic operator, the contracting authority shall also accept other evidence of environmental management measures, provided that the economic operator proves that these measures are equivalent to those required under the applicable environmental management system or standard.\n\n\n20.6.A contracting authority may conclude that an economic operator does not possess the required professional capacity to perform the contract to an appropriate quality standard where the contracting authority has established that the economic operator has conflicting interests which may negatively affect its performance.\n\n\n21.Award criteria\n\n\n21.1.Quality criteria may include elements such as technical merit, aesthetic and functional characteristics, accessibility, design for all users, social, environmental and innovative characteristics, production, provision and trading process and any other specific process at any stage of their life cycle, organisation of the staff assigned to performing the contract, after-sales service, technical assistance or delivery conditions such as delivery date, delivery process and delivery period or period of completion.\n\n\n21.2.The contracting authority shall specify, in the procurement documents the relative weighting which it gives to each of the criteria chosen to determine the most economically advantageous tender except when using the lowest price method. Those weightings may be expressed as a range with an appropriate maximum spread.\n\n\nThe weighting applied to price or cost in relation to the other criteria must not result in the neutralisation of price or cost.\n\n\nIf weighting is not possible for objective reasons, the contracting authority shall indicate the criteria in decreasing order of importance.\n\n\n21.3.The contracting authority may lay down minimum levels of quality. Tenders below those levels of quality shall be rejected.\n\n\n21.4.Life-cycle costing shall cover parts or all of the following costs, to the extent relevant, over the life cycle of works, supplies or services:\n\n\n(a)costs, borne by the contracting authority or other users, such as:\n\n\n(i)costs relating to acquisition;\n\n\n(ii)costs of use, such as consumption of energy and other resources;\n\n\n(iii)maintenance costs;\n\n\n(iv)end of life costs, such as collection and recycling costs;\n\n\n(b)costs attributed to environmental externalities linked to the works, supplies or services during their life cycle, provided their monetary value can be determined and verified.\n\n\n21.5.Where the contracting authority assesses the costs using a life-cycle costing approach, it shall indicate in the procurement documents the data to be provided by the tenderers and the method which it will use to determine the life-cycle costs on the basis of those data.\n\n\n\n\nThe method used for the assessment of costs attributed to environmental externalities shall fulfil the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)it is based on objectively verifiable and non-discriminatory criteria;\n\n\n(b)it is accessible to all interested parties;\n\n\n(c)economic operators can provide the required data with reasonable effort.\n\n\nWhere applicable, the contracting authority shall use the mandatory common methods for the calculation of life- cycle costs provided for in Annex XIII of Directive 2014/24/EU.\n\n\n22.Use of electronic auctions\n\n\n22.1.The contracting authority may use electronic auctions, in which new prices, revised downwards or new values concerning certain elements of tenders are presented.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall structure the electronic auction as a repetitive electronic process, which occurs after an initial full evaluation of the tenders, enabling them to be ranked using automatic evaluation methods.\n\n\n22.2.In open, restricted or competitive procedures with negotiation, the contracting authority may decide that the award of a public contract is preceded by an electronic auction when the procurement documents can be established with precision.\n\n\nAn electronic auction may be held on the reopening of competition among the parties to a framework contract as referred to in point\u00a01.3(b) and on the opening for competition of contracts to be awarded under the dynamic purchasing system referred to in point\u00a09.\n\n\nThe electronic auction shall be based on one of the award methods set out in Article\u00a0161(4).\n\n\n22.3.The contracting authority which decides to hold an electronic auction shall state that fact in the contract notice.\n\n\nThe procurement documents shall include the following details:\n\n\n(a)the values of the features which will be the subject of electronic auction, provided that those features are quantifiable and can be expressed in figures or percentages;\n\n\n(b)any limits on the values which may be submitted, as they result from the specifications relating to the subject matter of the contract;\n\n\n(c)the information which will be made available to tenderers in the course of the electronic auction and, where appropriate, when it will be made available to them;\n\n\n(d)the relevant information concerning the electronic auction process including whether it includes phases and how it will be closed, as set out in point 22.7;\n\n\n(e)the conditions under which the tenderers will be able to tender and, in particular, the minimum differences which will, where appropriate, be required when submitting the tender;\n\n\n(f)the relevant information concerning the electronic equipment used and the arrangements and technical specifications for connection.\n\n\n22.4.All tenderers who have submitted admissible tenders shall be invited simultaneously by electronic means to participate in the electronic auction using the connections in accordance with the instructions. The invitation shall specify the date and time of the start of the electronic auction.\n\n\n\n\nThe electronic auction may take place in a number of successive phases. The electronic auction may not start sooner than two working days after the date on which invitations are sent out.\n\n\n22.5.The invitation shall be accompanied by the outcome of a full evaluation of the relevant tender.\n\n\nThe invitation shall also state the mathematical formula to be used in the electronic auction to determine automatic re-rankings on the basis of the new prices and/or new values submitted. That formula shall incorporate the weighting of all the criteria fixed to determine the most economically advantageous tender, as indicated in the procurement documents. For that purpose, any ranges shall, however, be reduced beforehand to a specified value.\n\n\nWhere variants are authorised, a separate formula shall be provided for each variant.\n\n\n22.6.Throughout each phase of an electronic auction the contracting authority shall instantaneously communicate to all tenderers at least sufficient information to enable them to ascertain their relative rankings at any moment. It may also, where this has been previously indicated, communicate other information concerning other prices or values submitted as well as announce the number of tenderers in any specific phase of the auction. It may not however disclose the identities of the tenderers during any phase of an electronic auction.\n\n\n22.7.The contracting authority shall close an electronic auction in one or more of the following ways:\n\n\n(a)at the previously indicated date and time;\n\n\n(b)when it receives no more new prices or new values which meet the requirements concerning minimum differences, provided that it has previously stated the time which it will allow to elapse after receiving the last submission before it closes the electronic auction;\n\n\n(c)when the previously indicated number of phases in the auction has been completed.\n\n\n22.8.After closing an electronic auction, the contracting authority shall award the contract on the basis of the results of the electronic auction.\n\n\n23.Abnormally low tenders\n\n\n23.1.If, for a given contract, the price or cost proposed in a tender appears to be abnormally low, the contracting authority shall request in writing details of the constituent elements of the price or cost which it considers relevant and shall give the tenderer the opportunity to present its observations.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may, in particular, take into consideration observations relating to:\n\n\n(a)the economics of the manufacturing process, of the provision of services or of the construction method;\n\n\n(b)the technical solutions chosen or the exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer;\n\n\n(c)the originality of the tender;\n\n\n(d)compliance of the tenderer with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law;\n\n\n(e)compliance of subcontractors with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law;\n\n\n(f)the possibility of the tenderer obtaining state aid in compliance with applicable rules.\n\n\n23.2.The contracting authority may only reject the tender where the evidence supplied does not satisfactorily account for the low level of price or costs proposed.\n\n\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall reject the tender, where it has established that the tender is abnormally low because it does not comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law.\n\n\n23.3.Where the contracting authority establishes that a tender is abnormally low because the tenderer has obtained state aid, it may reject the tender on that sole ground only if the tenderer is unable to prove, within a sufficient time limit fixed by the contracting authority, that the aid in question was compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article\u00a0107 TFEU.\n\n\n24.Time limits for receipt of tenders and requests to participate \n\n\n24.1.The time limits shall be longer than the minimum time limits set out in this Article where tenders can only be drawn after a visit to the site or after an on-the-spot consultation of the documents supporting the procurement documents.\n\n\nThe time limits shall be prolonged by five days in any of the following cases:\n\n\n(a)the contracting authority does not offer direct access free of charge by electronic means to the procurement documents;\n\n\n(b)the contract notice is published in accordance with point (b) of point\u00a04.2.\n\n\n24.2.In open procedures, the time limit for receipt of tenders shall be no less than 37 days from the day following dispatch of the contract notice.\n\n\n24.3.In restricted procedures, in competitive dialogue in competitive procedures with negotiation, in dynamic purchasing systems and in innovation partnerships, the time limit for receipt of requests to participate shall be no less than 32 days from the day following dispatch of the contract notice.\n\n\n24.4.In restricted procedures and in competitive procedures with negotiation, the time limit for receipt of tenders shall be no less than 30 days from the day following dispatch of the invitation to tender.\n\n\n24.5.In a dynamic purchasing system, the time limit for receipt of tenders shall be no less than 10 days from the day following dispatch of the invitation to tender.\n\n\n24.6.In the procedures after a call for expressions of interest referred to in point\u00a013.1, the time limit shall be:\n\n\n(a)no less than 10 days from the day following dispatch of the invitation to tender for receipt of tenders in the case of the procedure referred to in point 13.1(a) and point 13.3(b)(i);\n\n\n(b)no less than 10 days for receipt of requests to participate and no less than 10 days for receipt of tenders in the case of the two-step procedure referred to in point\u00a013.3(b)(ii).\n\n\n24.7.The contracting authority may reduce the time limits for receipt of tenders by five days for the open or restricted procedures if it accepts that tenders may be submitted by electronic means.\n\n\n25.Access to procurement documents and time limit to provide additional information\n\n\n25.1.The contracting authority shall offer direct access free of charge by electronic means to the procurement documents from the date of publication of the contract notice or, for the procedures without contract notice or under point\u00a013, from the date of dispatch of the invitation to tender.\n\n\nIn justified cases, the contracting authority may transmit the procurement documents by other means it specifies if direct access by electronic means is not possible for technical reasons or if the procurement documents contain information of a confidential nature. In these cases, the second subparagraph of point\u00a024.1 shall apply except in urgent cases as provided for in point\u00a026.1.\n\n\nThe contracting authority may impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information contained in the procurement documents. It shall announce these requirements as well as how access to the procurement documents concerned can be obtained.\n\n\n25.2.The contracting authority shall provide additional information linked to the procurement documents simultaneously and in writing to all interested economic operators as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall not be bound to reply to requests for additional information made less than six working days before the deadline for receipt of tenders.\n\n\n25.3.The contracting authority shall extend the time limit for receipt of tenders where:\n\n\n(a)it did not provide additional information at the latest six days before the deadline for the receipt of tenders although the economic operator requested it in good time;\n\n\n(b)it makes significant changes to the procurement documents.\n\n\n26.Time limits in urgent cases\n\n\n26.1.Where duly substantiated urgency renders impracticable the minimum time limits laid down in points\u00a024.2 and 24.3\u00a0for open or restricted procedures, the contracting authority may set:\n\n\n(a)a time limit for the receipt of requests to participate or tenders in open procedures which shall not be less than 15 days from the date on which the contract notice was dispatched;\n\n\n(b)a time limit for the receipt of tenders for restricted procedures which shall not be less than 10 days from the date of dispatch of the invitation to tender.\n\n\n26.2.In urgent cases, the time limit set out in the first subparagraph of point\u00a025.2 and in point\u00a025.3(a)\u00a0shall be four days.\n\n\n27.Electronic catalogues\n\n\n27.1.Where the use of electronic means of communication is required, the contracting authority may require tenders to be presented in the format of an electronic catalogue or to include an electronic catalogue.\n\n\n27.2.Where the presentation of tenders in the form of electronic catalogues is accepted or required, the contracting authority shall:\n\n\n(a)state so in the contract notice;\n\n\n(b)indicate in the procurement documents all the necessary information concerning the format, the electronic equipment used and the technical connection arrangements and specifications for the catalogue.\n\n\n27.3.Where a multiple framework contract has been concluded following the submission of tenders in the form of electronic catalogues, the contracting authority may provide that the reopening of competition for specific contracts takes place on the basis of updated catalogues by using one of the following methods:\n\n\n(a)the contracting authority invites contractors to resubmit their electronic catalogues, adapted to the requirements of the specific contract in question;\n\n\n(b)the contracting authority notifies contractors that it intends to collect from the electronic catalogues which have already been submitted the information needed to constitute tenders adapted to the requirements of the specific contract in question, provided that the use of that method has been announced in the procurement documents for the framework contract.\n\n\n27.4.When using the method under point (b) of point 27.3, the contracting authority shall notify contractors of the date and time at which they intend to collect the information needed to constitute tenders adapted to the requirements of the specific contract in question and shall give contractors the possibility to refuse such collection of information.\n\n\nThe contracting authority shall allow for an adequate period between the notification and the actual collection of information.\n\n\nBefore awarding the specific contract, the contracting authority shall present the collected information to the contractor concerned so as to give it the opportunity to contest or confirm that the tender thus constituted does not contain any material errors.\n\n\n\n\n28.Opening of tenders and requests to participate\n\n\n28.1.In open procedures, authorised representatives from tenderers may attend the opening session.\n\n\n28.2.Where the value of a contract is equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article\u00a0169(1), the authorising officer responsible shall appoint a committee to open the tenders. The authorising officer may waive this obligation on the basis of a risk analysis when reopening competition within a framework contract and for the cases set out in point\u00a011.1 except points (d) and (g) of that point.\n\n\nThe opening committee shall be made up of at least two persons representing at least two organisational entities of the institution concerned with no hierarchical link between them. To avoid any conflict of interests, those persons shall be subject to the obligations laid down in Article\u00a059.\n\n\nIn the representations or local units referred to in Article\u00a0145 or isolated in a Member State, if there are no separate entities, the requirement of organisational entities with no hierarchical link between them shall not apply.\n\n\n28.3.In the case of a procurement procedure launched on an interinstitutional basis, the opening committee shall be appointed by the responsible authorising officer from the institution responsible for the procurement procedure.\n\n\n28.4.The contracting authority shall verify and ensure the integrity of the original tender including the financial offer and of the evidence of date and time of its receipt as provided for in points 2 and 4 of Article\u00a0144 by any appropriate method.\n\n\n28.5.In open procedures, where the contract is awarded under the lowest price or lowest cost methods in accordance with Article\u00a0161(4), the prices quoted in tenders satisfying the requirements shall be read out loud.\n\n\n28.6.The written record of the opening of the tenders received shall be signed by the person or persons in charge of opening or by members of the opening committee. It shall identify those tenders which comply with the requirements of Article\u00a0144 and those which do not, and shall give the grounds on which tenders were rejected as set out in Article\u00a0162(4). That record may be signed in an electronic system providing sufficient identification of the signatory.\n\n\n29.Evaluation of tenders and requests to participate\n\n\n29.1.The authorising officer responsible may decide that the evaluation committee is to evaluate and rank the tenders on the basis of the award criteria only and that the exclusion and selection criteria are to be evaluated by other appropriate means guaranteeing the absence of conflicts of interests.\n\n\n29.2.In the case of a procurement procedure launched on an interinstitutional basis, the evaluation committee shall be appointed by the responsible authorising officer from the institution responsible for the procurement procedure. The composition of the evaluation committee shall reflect, in so far as possible, the interinstitutional character of the procurement procedure.\n\n\n29.3.Requests to participate and tenders which are suitable under point 11.2, not irregular or unacceptable under points 12.2 and 12.3 shall be considered admissible.\n\n\n30.Results of the evaluation and award decision\n\n\n30.1.The outcome of the evaluation shall be an evaluation report containing the proposal to award the contract. The evaluation report shall be dated and signed by the person or persons who carried out the evaluation or by the members of the evaluation committee.

In the case of suspension all the candidates or tenderers shall be informed within three working days following the suspension decision.\n\n\nWhere the contract or framework contract cannot be signed with the successful envisaged tenderer, the contracting authority may award it to the following best tenderer.\n\n\n35.2.The period set in point 35.1 shall not apply in the following cases:\n\n\n(a)any procedure where only one tender has been submitted;\n\n\n(b)specific contracts based on a framework contract;\n\n\n(c)dynamic purchasing systems;\n\n\n(d)negotiated procedure without prior publications referred to in point\u00a011\u00a0except the procedure under point\u00a011.1(b).\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nProcurement in the field of external actions\n\n\n36.Special provisions relating to thresholds and the arrangements for awarding external contracts\n\n\nPoint 2 with the exception of point 2.5, points 3, 4 and 6, points (a) and (c) to (f) of point 12.1, point 12.4, point 13.3, points 14 and 15, points 17.3 to 17.7, points 20.4, 23.3, 24, points 25.2 and 25.3, points 26, 28, and 29 with the exception of point 29.3 shall not apply to procurement contracts concluded by the contracting authorities referred to in Article 172(2) or on their behalf. \n\n\n\n\nImplementation of the procurement provisions under this Chapter shall be decided by the Commission, including the appropriate controls to be applied by the responsible authorising officer where the Commission is not the contracting authority. \n\n\n37.Advertising\n\n\n37.1.If applicable, the prior information notice for calls for tender following the restricted procedure or the open procedure as referred to, respectively, in points (a) and (b) of point 38.1, shall be sent to the Publications Office by electronic means as early as possible. \n\n\n37.2.The contract award notice shall be sent when the contract is signed except where, if still necessary, the contract was declared secret or where the performance of the contract must be accompanied by special security measures, or when the protection of the essential interests of the European Union, or the beneficiary country so requires, and where the publication of the award notice is deemed not to be appropriate.\n\n\n38.Thresholds and procedures\n\n\n38.1.The procurement procedures in the field of external actions shall be as follows: \n\n\n(a)the restricted procedure as provided for in Article 158(1) (b); \n\n\n(b)the open procedure as provided for in Article 158(1) (a);\n\n\n(c)the local open procedure. \n\n\n(d)the simplified procedure; \n\n\n38.2.The use of procurement procedures according to thresholds shall be as follows: \n\n\n(a)the open or restricted procedure may be used for: \n\n\n(i)the service and supply contracts and the service concession contracts with a value of at least EUR 300 000; \n\n\n(ii)works contracts with a value of at least EUR 5 000 000. \n\n\n(b)the local open procedure may be used for:\n\n\n(i)supply contracts with a value of at least EUR 100 000 and less than EUR 300 000;\n\n\n(ii)works contracts and works concessions contracts of a value of at least EUR 300 000 and less than EUR 5 000 000;\n\n\n(c)the simplified procedure may be used for:\n\n\n(i)service contracts, service concession contracts, works contracts and works concessions contracts with a value of less than EUR 300 000\n\n\n(ii)supply contracts with a value of less than EUR 100 000\n\n\n\n\n(d)contracts with a value of less than or equal to EUR 20\u00a0000 may be awarded on the basis of a single tender;\n\n\n(e)payments for amounts less than or equal to EUR 2\u00a0500 in respect of item of expenditure may consist simply in payment against invoices without prior acceptance of a tender.\n\n\n38.3.In the restricted procedure referred to in point (a) of point 38.1, the contract notice shall state the number of candidates who will be invited to submit tenders.
