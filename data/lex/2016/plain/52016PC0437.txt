"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 1.7.2016\nCOM(2016) 437 final\n2016/0200(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on the European Union's behalf with regard to certain proposals submitted to the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP\u00a017) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Johannesburg, South Africa, 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThe 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP\u00a017) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) will be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016. The aim of CITES is to ensure that international trade in wild animals and plants is not a threat to the survival of the species in the wild. CITES regulates international trade in more than 35 000 plants and animals species which are or might become threatened by such trade. The CITES CoP is the governing body of the Convention, which usually meets every three years.\n\n\nAt CoP 17, CITES Parties will discuss and decide on proposals for (i) amendments to the Appendices I and II of the Convention and (ii) for the interpretation and implementation of the Convention. Many items on the agenda of CoP17 are the result of the intersessional work initiated at previous CoPs and carried out by CITES Animals, Plants and Standing Committees. Other agenda items have been included by CITES Parties. A number of proposals relating to CITES Resolutions and Decisions, as well as proposals to amend the Appendices to the CITES Convention were submitted on 26 April 2016 by the EU and its Member States to the CITES Secretariat for inclusion on the agenda of CITES CoP17. In total, the agenda of the CITES CoP17 includes 180 agenda items. \n\n\nThe Union became contracting Party to the Convention in July 2015. The Convention is implemented in the European Union through Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97\n1\n on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein and associated Commission Regulations. In view of Union competence on trade and environment matters and of the effects of decisions taken by the Conference of the Parties on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97, it is necessary to adopt a Union position on proposals submitted to the Conference.\n\n\nThe present document sets out the Commission's proposal for an EU position on items on the agenda of the CoP. This proposal is in line with the EU's ambitious policy for biodiversity protection, for the promotion of sustainable trade and against wildlife trafficking, as reflected notably in the EU biodiversity strategy, the EU \"Trade for all\" strategy, the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the EU Action Plans against wildlife trafficking and for the conservation and management of sharks and taking account of the EU-funded study \"Larger than Elephants. Input for an EU strategic Approach to a wildlife conservation in Africa\". \n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe procedural legal basis for the proposed Council Decision is Article 218(9) TFEU, which is the appropriate basis for an act defining the EU position in a \"body set up by an international agreement\" (such as the CITES CoP), when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects. \n\n\nThe substantive legal bases are Article 207, Article 192 of the TFEU, paragraph 1, given that the measures agreed under the CITES Convention, while pursuing an environmental objective, are to a large extent of a trade-related nature. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe Commission is in regular contact with stakeholders having an interest in matters covered by the CITES Convention, such as environmental NGOs, business sectors engaged in trade in wildlife products and hunting organisations. On 23 May 2016, the Commission services held a specific consultation meeting with interested stakeholders to get their views on the issues under discussion for CITES CoP17. On 24 May 2016, the Commission services held an informal meeting with experts from the Member States to discuss the issues to be debated at the Conference of the Parties. The input provided by stakeholders and by experts from Member States has been duly taken into consideration by the Commission when developing the proposed Council Decision. \n\n\nOther experts' views, such as the analysis by the CITES Secretariat and by IUCN and Traffic of all proposals submitted to CITES CoP 17, as well as from the FAO Expert Advisory Panel for assessment of CITES species listing amendment proposals could not be taken into consideration as they were not available on time for the Commission's proposal, but should be fully considered when the proposal is discussed with Member States in the Council. \n\n\nChanges to the Appendices of the CITES Convention need to be reflected in the EU acquis, through corresponding changes to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97. This will result in the establishment or removal of restrictions to trade from, into and within the EU for the species concerned by these changes. The volume and value of EU-related trade which might be affected by the proposals to amend the CITES Appendices made at CITES CoP17 are limited, so that the socio-economic and administrative costs of their implementation will be modest. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAs a Party, the EU has to provide an annual contribution to the CITES Trust Fund. This contribution will evolve depending on the conclusions of the discussions at CITES CoP17 on the budget for the period 2017-2019. The annual contribution by the EU for 2016 amounted to 140 000\u00a0EUR which was covered within existing envelopes. \n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\nA large number of documents for CITES CoP17 were not available in sufficient time for the Commission to propose a Union position at the present time (in particular the working documents \u2013 see Annex II(1) of the present document). The Commission therefore proposes that the position on these issues be established during the discussions in the Council Working group based on the Commission assessment, or during CoP\u00a017 in accordance with Article 2 of the draft Council Decision for documents which are only available during the CoP meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/0200 (NLE)\n\n\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing the position to be adopted on the European Union's behalf with regard to certain proposals submitted to the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP\u00a017) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Johannesburg, South Africa, 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207, Article 192, paragraph 1, in conjunction with Article\u00a0218, paragraph 9,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Union is a Party to CITES and CITES provisions are implemented in the Union by Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9\u00a0December 1996\n2\n.\n\n\n(2)CoP 17 will decide on a large number of agenda items many of which will affect the Union legislation concerned, including in some cases requiring amendments thereto, \n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe position of the Union shall be in accordance with the Annexes to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nWhere the position referred to in Article 1 is likely to be affected by new scientific or technical information presented after the adoption of this decision and before or during CoP\u00a017 or where new proposals are made at that meeting on which there is not yet a Union position, the Union position shall be established by means of on the spot co-ordination before the Conference of Parties is called to decide on those proposals.

The EU position should also serve to attain the objectives set out at EU level through the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the EU Action Plan against wildlife trafficking, the EU approach to promote trade and sustainable development, as reflected in the EU \"Trade for All\" strategy and the EU Action Plan on the conservation and management of Sharks.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The priorities for the Union at CITES CoP17 should be to:\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fully use the CITES instruments to regulate international trade of endangered species of animals and plants species subject to unsustainable international trade, pursuing a science-based approach;\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reinforce the response by the international community against wildlife trafficking and; \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0improve transparency and accountability within CITES and ensure that appropriate modalities are agreed that reflecting the EU's new status as a Party to the Convention. \n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union's position on proposals for amendments of the appendices should be based on the conservation status of the species concerned and on the documented impact that trade has or may have on their status. To this end, the most relevant and robust scientific advice should be taken into consideration for the assessment of listing proposals.\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union position should take account of the contribution that CITES controls can make towards improvement of the conservation status, while acknowledging the efforts of those countries and international bodies that have implemented effective conservation measures. The Union should ensure that the decisions taken at CoP17 maximise the efficiency of CITES, by minimising unnecessary administrative burdens and by achieving practical, cost-efficient and workable solutions to implementation and monitoring issues.\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CoP is the governing body of CITES and a number of decisions adopted at CITES CoP17 will be implemented by the Standing Committee, which is the main CoP subsidiary body. The Union's position defined for CITES CoP17 should therefore also guide the EU's approach at the meetings of the Standing Committee taking place after CITES CoP17.\n\n\nB.Specific issues\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union became in 2015 the first Regional Economic Integration Organisation to accede as a Party to CITES. The modalities for the participation of the Union to the CoP will need to be spelt out in the Rules of Procedure (RoP) of the CoP meeting, notably when it comes to voting. The Union considers that the RoP should reflect the text of the CITES Convention (Article XXI para 2 to 6) and should not contain provisions which subject the exercise of its rights as a Party to conditions not foreseen in the Convention. In that regard, the Union supports that the text of the RoP relating to Regional Economic Integration Organisations is aligned with the provisions in the RoP in place in many other international Conventions (Convention on Biological Diversity, Convention on Migratory Species, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Montreal Protocol, Stockholm, Basel and Rotterdam Conventions).  In recognition of the fact that this issue has triggered questions from third Parties, the Union should provide information ahead of the CoP on how the repartition of votes between the Union and the Member States will be operated. The Union should also be ready to show a certain degree of flexibility in the discussions on the RoP, provided that neither the rights of the Union as a Party, nor the distribution of the competencies as laid down in the TFEU, are undermined. \n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union considers that transparency and accountability within CITES should be further enhanced, in order to reinforce its legitimacy and the integrity of its decision-making process and will support proposals to this end. In that regard, the Union is in particular supporting the resolution aiming to consolidate the support provided by donors through a transparent scheme operated by the CITES Secretariat for the participation of delegates from developing countries to CITES CoP meetings (\"the sponsored delegates project\"), while requesting transparency from those donors financing directly the participation of delegates from third countries outside this scheme. \n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sixty-two proposals for amending the CITES Appendices have been tabled at CITES CoP17. The Union\u2019s position on such proposals should be based on the conservation status of the species concerned and on the impact that trade has or may have on those species. To this end, the Union should take account of the current provisions in Resolution Conf. 9.24 on the criteria for amendment of Appendices I and II. Particularly the views of the range States of the species concerned by the proposals should be taken into account by the Union. The Union also considers that generally proposals to amend CITES Appendices which are the result of the work by the CITES Animals and Plants Committees should be supported. The assessment of the proposals by the CITES Secretariat and IUCN/Traffic\n2\n will also be considered, as well as, in the case of marine species, the assessment by the FAO dedicated expert panel, noting that stock assessments and relevant data from RFMOs shall also be taken into account.\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inclusion of new marine and timber species into the CITES Appendices will be key issues for the Union at the CoP meeting. \n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In line with its well established position, the EU reaffirms that CITES is an appropriate instrument to regulate international trade in marine species when such species are affected by trade and are or may become threatened with extinction, while keeping in mind that the conservation of marine biological resources falls under the Union's exclusive competence. \n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union notes that considerable work has been done in the last years to build capacity for the implementation of CITES with regard to marine species, including through Union's financial support. These efforts should be sustained in the future in the CITES context, as appropriate. The Union looks forward to the reports that will be made available by Parties and the CITES Secretariat after CoP17 in relation to implementation of and compliance with CITES requirements regarding marine species, and in particular elasmobranches. The Union shall also support better coordination between CITES and RFMOs in the frame of their respective mandates, with the aim to improving governance and complementarity while avoiding overlapping and inconsistencies. The Union shall promote and support the inclusion of listed elasmobranches and other marine species in the relevant assessment CITES mechanisms, notably the CITES Animals Committee, with the aim to deliver their assessment before CoP18. In addition, pending the latest scientific advice the Union supports the inclusion of a number of elasmobranches species (silky shark - Carcharhinus falciformis and thresher sharks - Alopias spp.) and of the devil ray (Mobula spp.) in CITES Appendix II. The Union will review the latest scientific advice from the FAO expert panel, IUCN/Traffic or other sources of scientific advice. In view of concerns relating to the conservation of eel species worldwide and the impact of international trade on their survival, the Union also supports that more relevant information on the trade of these species is gathered and considered by the CITES Animals Committee in view of developing recommendations for CITES CoP18. However, the Union shall not support any proposal that could result in the listing of the European eel under CITES Appendix I at CITES CoP17.\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0International trade in tropical timber species to feed the market for rosewood products has increased considerably in the last years. Available information shows that a large part of this trade occurs at unsustainable levels and stems from illegal harvesting, to a point where rosewood trafficking is nowadays considered as one of the most prevalent forms of illegal wildlife trade. A few rosewood species are currently protected under CITES and the EU should support the proposals to include additional rosewood species (Pterocarpus erinaceus, three Guibourtia species and Dalbergia spp.) into CITES Appendix II. The Union considers that the scope of these inclusions should be defined (through the relevant annotations) so as to cover the largest share of the products exported from the range States concerned, based on available information and applying the precautionary principle. \n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union's position on proposals related to wildlife trafficking should be consistent with the 3 priorities identified in the EU Action Plan against wildlife trafficking, namely:\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0preventing wildlife trafficking and addressing its root causes,\n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0implementing and enforcing existing rules and combating organised wildlife crime more effectively, and \n\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strengthening the global partnership of source, consumer and transit countries against wildlife trafficking;\n\n\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with the first priority, the Union is supportive of a better protection through CITES of species currently imported into the EU at unsustainable levels or illegally (notably for the exotic pet trade).  The Union is therefore supporting the proposals to amend the Appendices in relation to the Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), the African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) and various reptile species. The Union also supports the inclusion in Appendix II of the Banggai Cardinal Fish (Pterapogon kauderni), in recognition of the fact that available information seem to indicate that the listing criteria are met, whilst noting that further discussions should take place with Indonesia, which is the only range State for the species, so as to see if a common approach can be agreed for the sustainable trade in this species.\n\n\n10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the first priority, the Union is also supportive of the adoption of a Resolution on corruption facilitating activities conducted in violation to the CITES Convention, and of additional recommendations and guidance to reduce the demand for illegal wildlife products. It will pay attention that decisions agreed at CITES CoP17 take account of the needs and interests of rural communities which might affect them. \n\n\n11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In line with the second and third priorities, the Union supports strong measures for the implementation of the Convention by its Parties and advocates for clear timeline with monitoring mechanisms (including possible trade sanctions) towards those Parties which are repeatedly failing to implement their obligations under CITES. This is in particular important to address poaching and trafficking affecting elephants (see below), rhinoceroses, Asian big cats, rosewood and pangolins. In this regard, the Union should also support the proposal for a resolution aiming to better scrutinise that wild animals are not fraudulently traded as captive bred animals. \n\n\n12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elephant and rhinoceros poaching and ivory and rhino horn trafficking continue at alarmingly high level. This remains of considerable concern for the EU and the EU priority on all agenda items relating to elephants should be to support action directly addressing this problem,\u00a0taking account notably of the priorities identified in the EU-funded study \"Larger than Elephants. Input for an EU strategic Approach to a wildlife conservation in Africa\". As far as elephants are concerned, good progress has been achieved in some range, transit and destination countries, and the National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) developed in 19 countries pursuant to decisions at the last CITES CoP have been instrumental in driving those changes. Much more remains to be done, especially in countries which remain \"hotspots\" for elephant poaching and ivory trafficking. To this end, the Union should support a reinforcement of the NIAPs and a strengthened scrutiny on their implementation by the Parties concerned, including the imposition of trade sanctions in cases of persistent failure to take adequate measures against elephant poaching and ivory trafficking. \n\n\n13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union notes that numerous, often conflicting proposals have been tabled by Parties in relation to trade in ivory. International trade in ivory is currently banned under the CITES framework. The Union considers that the conditions for re-authorising such trade are not met and does not support proposals to re-open such trade at CITES CoP17. The Union notes that there has been no progress on the development of the Decision-Making Mechanism for a process of trade in ivory (DMM) and considers that there is no urgent need to agree on such mechanism at CoP17. The Union is not opposed to a continuation of this discussion in the future, but that discussion should only take place after elephant poaching and ivory trafficking have substantially decreased. The Union should also encourage all African elephant range States to engage in a dialogue with a view to agreeing on a common position on this point. \n\n\n14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union notes that there have been cases where legal domestic trade in ivory in some CITES Parties has facilitated international illegal trade in ivory. In such cases, the Union should be ready to support calls for the establishment of bans in such domestic trade by the Parties concerned.  The Union should therefore be open to the proposals tabled on this issue, provided that their scope is clarified. When the link between legal domestic ivory trade and illegal ivory trade is not established (either directly when illegal ivory items are laundered on the domestic market or indirectly when legal trade encourages further demand for illegal ivory), it would not be appropriate for CITES to call for a prohibition of domestic ivory trade, especially for ivory items acquired before the inclusion of African elephants in CITES Appendix I in 1990.  \n\n\n15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union considers that international guidelines should be agreed in the CITES framework to provide guarantees that hunting trophies of species listed in CITES Appendix I and II come from sustainable and legal sources. The Union also supports that more scrutiny is exercised by the CITES Animals Committee on the setting of export quotas for hunting trophies of Appendix I species, notably for leopards and lions. \n\n\n16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union should also seek to minimise the administrative burden on economic operators and individuals for the cross-border movements of CITES-listed products, when there are limited concerns that such movements might have detrimental impact on the species concerned. This is in particular the case for musicians and in case of trade in finished products made of some CITES species. \n\n\n17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wildlife trafficking crisis, combined with the extension of the scope of CITES to new species and Parties, means that more activities have been brought under the CITES umbrella in the last years and that the workload of the CITES Secretariat has considerably increased. The Union should take these developments into account when deciding on its priorities at CoP17 and on the future budget for the CITES Secretariat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\ncf.

The population is not characterized by a marked decline in the population size in the wild on its whole range and does therefore not meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. This is notably the case of Southern African populations which have an increasing population trend. Well-managed and sustainable offtake for international trade purposes is also recognized as a conservation tool which can provide both livelihood opportunities for rural communities and incentives for lion conservation, and generate profits which can be invested for conservation purposes, notably in certain Southern and Eastern African countries. Recognizing nonetheless that most Western and Central African populations meet the criteria for listing in Appendix I, the Union would be supporting a split-listing whereby the African population of the species could be transferred to Appendix I, with exclusion of certain Southern and possibly Eastern African national populations (to be determined on the basis of available scientific information).\n\n\n\n\n(-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nPuma concolor coryi, Puma concolor couguar\n\n\n\n\nI \u2013 II\n\n\n\n\nCA\n\n\n\n\nSupport this proposal resulting from the Periodic Review, including the proposed adoption of the more recent taxonomic reference for Puma concolor.\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nEquus zebra zebra\n\n\n\n\nI \u2013 II\n\n\n\n\nZA\n\n\n\n\nThe subspecies does no longer seem to meet the criteria for listing in Appendix I, even though clarifications should be sought from South Africa on whether the subspecies population is of wild or captive bred nature. The precautionary measures for downlisting seem to have been met. Transferring the subspecies to Appendix II would allow its sustainable use and is therefore likely to result in an increase in population size and area of distribution within the subspecies historical range. Such an increase may help mitigate the lack of genetic diversity within the population, which is the main threat known to this taxon.\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nCeratotherium simum simum\u00a0\n\n\n(Amend annotation)\n\n\n\n\nII \u2013 II \n\n\n\n\nSZ\n\n\n\n\nGiven the continuous high levels of rhino poaching and illegal trade in rhino horn, it is premature to agree on a resumption of trade.
