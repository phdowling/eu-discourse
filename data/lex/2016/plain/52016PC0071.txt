In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct \u2014 but intrinsically interconnected \u2014 legal instruments: \n\n\n\u2013A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines;\n\n\n\u2013A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States -Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. \n\n\nThese guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted on 5 October 2015, and as provided by the adoption decision should ensure a focus on policy implementation.\n\n\nThe overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. By virtue of Article 148(2), their validity for 2016 needs to be confirmed by a Council decision, following consultation of the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of Regions and the Employment Committee.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nOJ L 268, 15.10.2015, p. 28.\n\n\n2016/0043 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 148(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\n1\n, \n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Employment Committee,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n2\n, \n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n3\n, \n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) stipulates in Article 145 that Member States and the Union shall work towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce as well as labour markets that are responsive to economic change and with a view to achieving the objectives defined in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n\n\n(2)The \"Europe 2020 Strategy\" proposed by the Commission enables the Union to turn its economy towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, accompanied by high level employment, productivity and social cohesion. Five headline targets, listed under the relevant guidelines, constitute shared objectives which guide the action of the Member States, and take into account their relative starting positions and national circumstances as well as the positions and circumstances of the Union. The European Employment Strategy has the leading role in the implementation of the employment and labour market objectives of the new strategy. \n\n\n(3)The integrated guidelines are in line with the conclusions of the European Council. They give precise guidance to the Member States on defining their National Reform Programmes and implementing reforms, reflecting interdependence and in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. The employment guidelines should form the basis for any country-specific recommendations that the Council may address to the Member States under Article 148(4) of the TFEU, in parallel with the country-specific recommendations addressed to the Member States under Article 121(2) of that Treaty. The employment guidelines should also form the basis for the establishment of the Joint Employment Report sent annually by the Council and the European Commission to the European Council.\n\n\n(4)The examination of the Member States' National Reform Programmes contained in the Joint Employment Report shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the priority areas of increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs and promoting job quality and lifelong learning, improve the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education, promoting social inclusion and combating poverty.\n\n\n(5)Member States should explore the use of the European Social Fund when implementing the Employment Guidelines,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe guidelines for Member States' employment policies as set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 5 October 2015 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States\n4\n are maintained for 2016 and shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(2)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(3)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n(4)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/1848 of 5 October 2015 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (OJ L 268, 15.10.2015, p. 28).\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
