The Agreement was initialled on 11 March 2016 in Havana, in the presence of the High Representative and the Commissioner for International Development and Cooperation.\n\n\nThe Council was kept informed at all stages of the negotiations. It was consulted in the Working Party on Latin America and the Caribbean (COLAC) and in the Trade Policy Committee. Member States provided comments before the initialling of the Agreement.\n\n\nThe European Parliament was also kept informed throughout the negotiations.\n\n\nThe Commission and the High Representative consider that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been met. The Agreement was signed on\u2026.\n\n\nThe present proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement.\n\n\n2.THE AGREEMENT\n\n\nRelations between the European Union and Cuba are currently governed by the EU's Common Position 96/697/CFSP of 2 December 1996. The PDCA is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba. It will create a stable framework for EU-Cuba relations, superseding the ad hoc dialogue and piecemeal cooperation that have characterised them to date. It will serve as a framework and platform for closer cooperation and dialogue across a broad range of policy areas. \n\n\nThe Agreement aims to consolidate and strengthen links between the parties in the areas of political dialogue, cooperation and trade, on the basis of mutual respect, reciprocity, common interest and respect for their sovereignty. The relationship will be geared to supporting the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, cooperating bilaterally and in international fora with a view to strengthening human rights and democracy, countering discrimination and achieving the sustainable development goals. The Agreement includes the EU's standard essential elements, the human rights clause and the non-proliferation clause, the breaching of which can lead to its suspension. \n\n\nThe Agreement builds essentially on a three-pillar structure:\n\n\n\u2013political dialogue (Part II): the relevant provisions cover a range of policy areas, including human rights, small arms and light weapons, disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, serious crimes of international concern (including the International Criminal Court), unilateral coercive measures (i.e. US embargo),  combating the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs,  combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and sustainable development.\n\n\n\u2013cooperation and sector policy dialogue (Part III): these provisions cover a very wide range of areas for future cooperation, including political and legal (governance and human rights, justice, citizen security and migration), social, environmental, economic and developmental issues. Particular attention is also given to regional (Caribbean and Latin American) integration and cooperation; and\n\n\n\u2013trade and trade cooperation (Part IV): this Part codifies the conventional (WTO-related) basis for EU-Cuba trade. In addition, it includes provisions on trade facilitation and cooperation in areas such as technical barriers to trade and standards, with a view to improving the prospects for deeper economic relations. It also includes a clause envisaging the future development of a stronger framework for investments.\n\n\nPart V (Institutional and Final Provisions) establishes an institutional framework composed of a Joint Council and a Joint Committee. It also includes a provision on the fulfilment of Obligations which contains measures to be taken and the procedure for action to be followed should one of the parties fail to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement.\n\n\nThe Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period and can be terminated at six months\u2019 notice.\n\n\nThe Agreement should supersede Common Position 96/697/CFSP. In parallel with this joint proposal, the High Representative will submit a proposal for a Council decision repealing Common Position 96/697/CFSP, on the understanding that the Council will adopt both measures simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED DECISION\n\n\n3.1. Substantive legal basis \n\n\nThe Court has held\n2\n that simultaneously pursues a number of objectives, or that has several components that, which are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other, and to which various provisions of the Treaty therefore apply, must be founded, exceptionally, on the various corresponding legal bases, unless the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible.\n\n\nThe Agreement pursues objectives and contains components in the areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the Agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. \n\n\nThe legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore include Articles 37 TEU, 207 TFEU and 209 TFEU.\n\n\n3.2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedural legal basis\n\n\nArticle 218(6) TFEU provides that the Council, on a proposal by the negotiator, shall adopt a decision concluding the Agreement. \n\n\nArticle 218(6)(a) TFEU provides that, where an agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council shall adopt the decision concluding the agreement after obtaining consent of the European Parliament. The PDCA establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and Cuba. \n\n\nThe second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU provides that the Council is to act unanimously if the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The CSFP is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act.\n\n\n3.3. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion\n\n\nThe legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Articles 37 TEU, 207 TFEU and 209 TFEU in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU of Article 218(8) TFEU (second subparagraph). No additional provisions are required as legal basis\n3\n.\n\n\n\n4. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NECESSITY OF PROPOSED DECISION\n\n\nArticle 216 TFEU provides that the Union may conclude an agreement with one or more other countries where the Treaties so provide or where this is necessary in order to achieve, in the framework of the Union\u2019s policies, one of the objectives referred to in the Treaties, is provided for in a legally binding Union act or is likely to affect common rules or alter their scope.\n\n\nThe Treaties provide for the conclusion of agreements such as this PDCA, see in Articles 37 TEU, 207 TFEU and 209 TFEU. Moreover, the conclusion of the PDCA is necessary for the purpose of achieving, in the framework of the Union\u2019s policies, objectives referred to in the Treaties, including in the areas of political dialogue, strengthening of human rights, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counter-terrorism, the fight against corruption and organised crime, trade, migration, environment, energy, climate change, transport, employment and social affairs, education and agriculture.\n\n\nThe Agreement must be concluded on behalf of the Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016/0298
