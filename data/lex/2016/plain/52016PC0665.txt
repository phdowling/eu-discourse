In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member States by letters dated 22 September 2016 of the request made by Poland. By letter dated 23 September 2016, the Commission notified Poland that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive allows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small enterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a certain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not have to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct the VAT on his input.\n\n\nUnder Article 287(14) of the VAT Directive, Poland may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 10 000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession.\n\n\nIn 2009, Poland requested a derogation in order to simplify VAT obligations for small traders and to ease the collection of the tax for the national tax administration. By Council Decision 2009/790/EC of 20 October 2009\n2\n, the Council authorised Poland to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR\u00a030\u00a0000 until 31 December 2012. By Council Implementing Decision 2012/769/EU\n3\n, the derogation was extended until 31 December 2015 and again, by Council Implementing Decision 2015/1173/EU\n4\n, until 31 December 2018.\n\n\nPoland has now requested to be authorised to raise the exemption threshold from EUR\u00a030\u00a0000 to EUR 40\u00a0000 for the remaining period of the current derogation. Via this demand, Poland wants to simplify the burden on business for a higher number of taxable persons who have a limited business activity and to stimulate the development of such small businesses. At the same time, Poland wants to reduce the burden on the tax administration by limiting the need to control small taxable persons, which is relatively costly in comparison to the amount of VAT at stake, and to strengthen its control activities towards larger taxable persons. It is in this context to be noted that the measure is and will remain fully optional for taxable persons.\n\n\nThe derogation measure is currently applicable until 31 December 2018. It is appropriate to maintain this end date. Derogations from the VAT Directive should always be limited in time so that their effects can be assessed. Moreover, the provisions of Articles 281 to 294 of the VAT Directive on a special scheme for small enterprises are currently subject to review. As announced in the VAT Action Plan\n5\n, the Commission's proposal in the form of a comprehensive simplification package is due to be presented by the end of 2017. A Directive, amending the provisions of the VAT Directive on a special scheme for small enterprises, might therefore enter into force before the above-mentioned date.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nSimilar derogations have been granted to other Member States. Belgium\n6\n and Luxemburg\n7\n were granted a threshold of EUR 25\u00a0000, Lithuania\n8\n\u00a0a threshold of EUR 45\u00a0000, Latvia\n9\n\u00a0and Slovenia\n10\n\u00a0a threshold of EUR\u00a050\u00a0000, Italy\n11\n and Romania\n12\n\u00a0a threshold of EUR\u00a065\u00a0000.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe measure is in line with the Union's objectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication \"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act\" for Europe\"\n13\n which calls on the Member States to take account of the special features of SMEs when designing legislation and, therefore, to simplify the existing regulatory environment.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nConsidering the provision of the VAT Directive on which the proposal is based, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe Decision concerns an authorisation granted to a Member State upon its own request and does not constitute any obligation.\n\n\n\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued, i.e. simplification for an additional number of small taxable persons and for the tax administration.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nProposed instrument: Council Implementing Decision.\n\n\nUnder Article 395 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible upon authorisation of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. A Council Implementing Decision is the most suitable instrument since it can be addressed to an individual Member State.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nThis proposal is based on a request made by Poland and concerns only this Member State.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe proposal for a Council Implementing Decision aims at extending a simplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for businesses operating with an annual turnover no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 40 000 and has therefore a potential positive impact on the reduction of administrative burden for an additional 24\u00a0000 taxable persons and, subsequently, on the tax administration. The budgetary impact in terms of VAT revenue for Poland is estimated at PLN 300 million.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU budget because Poland will carry out a compensation calculation in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC EURATOM) 1553/89.\n\n\n2016/0326 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\n\n\namending Decision 2009/790/EC authorising the Republic of Poland to apply a measure derogating from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \n\n\nHaving regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax\n14\n, and in particular Article 395 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 287(14) of Directive 2006/112/EC authorises Poland to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 10 000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession.\n\n\n(2)By Council Decision 2009/790/EC\n15\n, Poland was authorised, until 31 December 2012 and as a derogation, to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR 30 000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession. By Council Implementing Decision 2012/769/EU\n16\n, the derogatory measure provided for in Council Decision 2009/790/EC was extended until 31 December 2015 and again extended by Council Implementing Decision 2015/1173/EU\n17\n until 31 December 2018.\n\n\n(3)In a letter registered with the Commission on 1 June 2016, Poland requested authorisation to increase that threshold from EUR 30\u00a0000 to EUR 40\u00a0000. Through that measure, an additional number of small taxable persons could be exempted from certain or all of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC. The burden on the tax administration to audit very small businesses would therefore also be decreased.\n\n\n(4)The Commission informed the other Member States by letters dated 22 September 2016 of the request made by Poland. By letter dated 23 September 2016, the Commission notified Poland that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n\n\n(5)From the information provided by Poland, potentially 24\u00a0000 additional taxable persons could make use of this measure in order to reduce their VAT obligations. The budgetary impact in terms of VAT revenue has been estimated by Poland at PLN 300 million.\n\n\n(6)Given that a higher threshold will result in reduced VAT obligations for the smallest businesses, whilst the latter may still opt for the regular VAT arrangements in accordance with Article 290 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Poland should be authorised to apply the increased threshold for the remaining application period of Council Decision 2009/790/EC; which is until 31 December 2018. However, the provisions of Articles 281 to 294 of Directive 2006/112/EC on a special scheme for small enterprises are subject to review and a Directive, amending these provisions of the VAT Directive, might therefore enter into force before the above-mentioned date.\n\n\n(7)The derogation has no impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT because Poland will carry out a compensation calculation in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC EURATOM) 1553/89\n18\n.\n\n\n(8)Decision 2009/790/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nArticle 1 and 2 of Decision 2009/790/EC are replaced by the following:\n\n\n'Article 1\n\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Poland is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR\u00a040\u00a0000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThis Decision shall apply until the entry into force of a Directive amending the provisions of Articles 281 to 294 of Directive 2006/112/EC on a special scheme for small enterprises, or until 31 December 2018, whichever is the earlier.'.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland.\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For
