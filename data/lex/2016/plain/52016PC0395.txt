"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 10.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 395 final\n2016/0184(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal is for a Council Decision, to be adopted pursuant to Article 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \n\n\nAt the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (known as COP 21), which took place in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the global response to climate change. The Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. \n\n\nIn its communication assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement\n1\n, the Commission stated that the Paris Agreement should be signed and ratified as soon as possible. The European Council welcomed the Commission communication and underlined the need for the European Union and its Member States to be able to ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time so as to be Parties as of its entry into force\n2\n. As a first step, the Agreement was signed by the Commission and Council on behalf of the European Union and by all 28 Member States on their behalf at the high-level signature ceremony which took place in New York on 22 April 2016. \n\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a global milestone for enhancing global collective action and accelerating the global transformation to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. It will replace the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol,that contains commitments until the end of 2020. These commitments will not be continued beyond 2020. \n\n\nThe Paris Agreement presents an opportunity for economic transformation, jobs and growth. It is a central element in achieving broader sustainable development goals, as well as the EU's priorities of investment, competitiveness, circular economy, research, innovation and energy transition.\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement sets out a qualitative long-term emissions reduction goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2\u00b0C and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5\u00b0C. In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. Starting from 2023, parties will every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided. \n\n\nAhead of COP 21, parties to the UNFCCC presented their intended nationally determined contributions to the Agreement. The European Union and its Member States were the first major economy to communicate their intended nationally determined contribution on 6 March 2015, reflecting the 2030 climate and energy policy framework set by the October 2014 European Council\n3\n and the European Commission's blueprint for tackling global climate change beyond 2020\n4\n. The EU has set an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% domestically by 2030.\u00a0\n\n\nThe EU has already begun the process of implementation of the at least  40% greenhouse gas emission reduction target. As regards those sectors covered by the emissions trading system (ETS), the Commission adopted on 15 July 2015 a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments. The proposal aims to deliver the above target in respect of those sectors covered by the EU ETS. \n\n\nThe European Union and its Member States have expressed the intention to act jointly under the Paris Agreement\n5\n and this is reflected in Article 4 of the Paris Agreement. The Union and its Member States are therefore jointly responsible, pursuant to paragraph 18 of that Article, for preparing, communicating and maintaining successive nationally determined contributions they intend to achieve and for pursuing domestic mitigation measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of the nationally determined contribution under paragraph 2 of that Article.\n\n\nArticle 4, paragraph 16 of the Paris Agreement requires the secretariat to be notified of the joint action, including the emission level allocated to each party within the relevant time period. The respective emission level allocated to the Union covers emissions of greenhouse gases under Directive 2003/87/EC. The respective emission levels of the Member States, and the inclusion of land use, land-use change and forestry into the 2030 energy and climate change framework, will be determined in forthcoming legislation.\n\n\nNorway and Iceland have expressed an intention to participate in the joint action by the Union and its Member States. The terms governing possible participation by Norway and Iceland will be laid down in accompanying legislation. This proposal is without prejudice to how Norway and Iceland will participate in the joint action. \n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe Commission Communication of 2 March 2016 entitled the Road from Paris: assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement, emphasises that the global clean energy transition requires changes in investment behaviour and incentives across the entire policy spectrum. It is a key Union priority to establish a resilient Energy Union to provide secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy to its citizens. Achieving this requires continuation of ambitious climate action and progress on other aspects of the Energy Union.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nThe 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU sets an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% domestically by 2030, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of at least 27%\n6\n. Implementing the 2030 energy and climate framework is a priority in follow up to the Paris Agreement. The Commission will later this year present proposals to adapt the EU's regulatory framework for energy efficiency and renewable energy, including the new energy market design.\n\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal is made under Article 192(1) together with Article 218(6) TFEU. Article 218 TFEU lays down the procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between the European Union and third countries or international organisations. In particular, paragraph 6 thereof provides for the Council, on a proposal from the Commission as negotiator, to adopt a decision authorising the conclusion of an agreement on behalf of the European Union. \n\n\nIn accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. \n\n\nThere exists legislation in the Union implementing these objectives that will have to be revised in order to implement the Paris Agreement and this can only be achieved through Union legislation. \n\n\n\n\n2016/0184 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1), in conjunction with 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)At the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which took place in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the global response to climate change. \n\n\n(2)In accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2016/590 of 11 April 2016\n7\n, the Paris Agreement was signed on 22 April 2016. \n\n\n(3)The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the UNFCCC accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. Parties to the UNFCCC include the Union and its Member States. In its conclusions of 18 March 2016, the European Council underlined the need for the European Union and its Member States to conclude the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time so as to be parties as of its entry into force. \n\n\n(4)The Paris Agreement replaces the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. \n\n\n(5)The Paris Agreement, inter alia, sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. \n\n\n(6)Under the Paris Agreement, as of 2023, parties are to every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided, and each party's successive contribution is to represent a progression beyond the party's then current contribution and reflect its highest ambition.\n\n\n(7)A binding target of at least a 40% domestic reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 was endorsed in the Conclusions of the European Council of 23-24 October 2014 on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework\n8\n. The Council meeting on 4 March 2015 formally approved this contribution of the Union and its Member States as their Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, which was submitted to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC on 6 March 2015\n9\n.\n\n\n\n\n(8)In the Communication accompanying the proposal for the Union to sign the Paris Agreement\n10\n it is emphasised that the global clean energy transition requires changes in investment behaviour and incentives across the entire policy spectrum. It is a key Union priority to establish a resilient Energy Union to provide secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy to its citizens. Achieving this requires continuation of ambitious climate action and progress on other aspects of the Energy Union.\n11\n\n\n\n(9)The Council confirmed in its conclusions of 18 September 2015 that the Union and its Member States intend to act jointly under the Paris Agreement and welcomed the intention of Norway and Iceland to participate in this joint action. \n\n\n(10)The joint action by the Union and the Member States will be agreed in due course and will cover the respective emission level allocated to the Union under Directive 2003/87/EC and the respective emission levels of the Member States.\n\n\n(11)Article 4 (16) of the Paris Agreement requires the secretariat to be notified of the joint action, including the emission level allocated to each party within the relevant time period. \n\n\n(12)The Paris Agreement is in conformity with the environmental objectives of the Union as referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty, namely preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; protecting human health; and promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.\n\n\n(13)The Paris Agreement should therefore be concluded on behalf of the Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union. \n\n\nThe text of the Paris Agreement is attached to this Decision as Annex I.\n\n\nThe attached Declaration of Competence in Annex II is also approved on behalf of the Union. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 20, paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement, together with the declaration of competence. \n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n1. The instrument of ratification of the Union shall be deposited with the Depository.\n\n\nMember States shall endeavour to take the necessary steps with a view to depositing simultaneously with the Union.\n\n\n2. Member States shall inform the Commission of their decisions on ratification of the Paris Agreement, or according to the circumstances, of the probable date of completion of the necessary procedures.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCOM(2016)110 of 2 March 2016.\n\n\n\n(2)\nEuropean Council conclusions of 18 March 2016.\n\n\n\n(3)\nEuropean Council conclusions of 24 October 2014.  \n\n\n\n(4)\nCOM(2015)81 of 25 February 2015.\n\n\n\n(5)\nCouncil conclusions of 18 September 2015.\n\n\n\n(6)\nThe energy efficiency target will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of 30%.  \n\n\n\n(7)\nOJ L 103,19.4.2016, p.1.\n\n\n\n(8)\nEUCO 169/14\n\n\n\n(9)\n\n\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(10)\nCOM(2016)110 of 2 March 2016.\n\n\n\n(11)\nCOM(2015)80 of 25 February 2015. \n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 10.6.2016\nCOM(2016) 395 final\nANNEX\n\nto the \nProposal for a Council Decision\non the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nParis Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParis Agreement\n\n\nThe Parties to this Agreement,\n\n\nBeing Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, hereinafter referred to as \"the Convention\",\n\n\nPursuant to the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action established by decision 1/CP. 17 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its seventeenth session,\n\n\nIn pursuit of the objective of the Convention, and being guided by its principles, including the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances,\n\n\nRecognizing the need for an effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate change on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge,\n\n\nAlso recognizing the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in the Convention,\n\n\nTaking full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries with regard to funding and transfer of technology,\n\n\nRecognizing that Parties may be affected not only by climate change, but also by the impacts of the measures taken in response to it,\n\n\nEmphasizing the intrinsic relationship that climate change actions, responses and impacts have with equitable access to sustainable development and eradication of poverty,\n\n\nRecognizing the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change,\n\n\nTaking into account the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities,\n\n\nAcknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity,\n\n\nRecognizing the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases referred to in the Convention,\n\n\nNoting the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth, and noting the importance for some of the concept of \"climate justice\", when taking action to address climate change,\n\n\nAffirming the importance of education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and cooperation at all levels on the matters addressed in this Agreement,\n\n\nRecognizing the importance of the engagements of all levels of government and various actors, in accordance with respective national legislations of Parties, in addressing climate change,\n\n\n\nAlso recognizing that sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production, with developed country Parties taking the lead, play an important role in addressing climate change,\n\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, the definitions contained in Article 1 of the Convention shall apply. In addition:\n\n\n(a)\"Convention\" means the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in New York on 9 May 1992;\n\n\n(b)\"Conference of the Parties\" means the Conference of the Parties to the Convention;\n\n\n(c)\"Party\" means a Party to this Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n1.This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:\n\n\n(a)Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;\n\n\n(b)Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and\n\n\n(c)Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\n\n\n2.This Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nAs nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change, all Parties are to undertake and communicate ambitious efforts as defined in Articles 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13 with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement as set out in Article 2. The efforts of all Parties will represent a progression over time, while recognizing the need to support developing country Parties for the effective implementation of this Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\n1. In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n\n\n\n2.Each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.\n\n\n3.Each Party's successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Party's then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.\n\n\n4.Developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy- wide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.\n\n\n5.Support shall be provided to developing country Parties for the implementation of this Article, in accordance with Articles 9, 10 and 11, recognizing that enhanced support for developing country Parties will allow for higher ambition in their actions.\n\n\n6.The least developed countries and small island developing States may prepare and communicate strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emissions development reflecting their special circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n7.Mitigation co-benefits resulting from Parties' adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans can contribute to mitigation outcomes under this Article.\n\n\n8.In communicating their nationally determined contributions, all Parties shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement.\n\n\n9.Each Party shall communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement and be informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake referred to in Article 14.\n\n\n10.The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement shall consider common time frames for nationally determined contributions at its first session.\n\n\n11.A Party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition, in accordance with guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement.\n\n\n12.Nationally determined contributions communicated by Parties shall be recorded in a public registry maintained by the secretariat.\n\n\n13.Parties shall account for their nationally determined contributions. In accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals corresponding to their nationally determined contributions, Parties shall promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting, in accordance with guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement.\n\n\n14.In the context of their nationally determined contributions, when recognizing and implementing mitigation actions with respect to anthropogenic emissions and removals, Parties should take into account, as appropriate, existing methods and guidance under the Convention, in the light of the provisions of paragraph 13 of this Article.\n\n\n\n15.Parties shall take into consideration in the implementation of this Agreement the concerns of Parties with economies most affected by the impacts of response measures, particularly developing country Parties.\n\n\n16.Parties, including regional economic integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an agreement to act jointly under paragraph 2 of this Article shall notify the secretariat of the terms of that agreement, including the emission level allocated to each Party within the relevant time period, when they communicate their nationally determined contributions. The secretariat shall in turn inform the Parties and signatories to the Convention of the terms of that agreement.\n\n\n17.Each party to such an agreement shall be responsible for its emission level as set out in the agreement referred to in paragraph 16 of this Article in accordance with paragraphs 13 and 14 of this Article and Articles 13 and 15.\n\n\n18.If Parties acting jointly do so in the framework of, and together with, a regional economic integration organization which is itself a Party to this Agreement, each member State of that regional economic integration organization individually, and together with the regional economic integration organization, shall be responsible for its emission level as set out in the agreement communicated under paragraph 16 of this Article in accordance with paragraphs 13 and 14 of this Article and Articles 13 and 15.\n\n\n19.All Parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\n1.Parties should take action to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases as referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1(d), of the Convention, including forests.\n\n\n2.Parties are encouraged to take action to implement and support, including through results-based payments, the existing framework as set out in related guidance and decisions already agreed under the Convention for: policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\n1.Parties recognize that some Parties choose to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions to allow for higher ambition in their mitigation and adaptation actions and to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity.\n\n\n2.Parties shall, where engaging on a voluntary basis in cooperative approaches that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions, promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity and transparency, including in governance, and shall apply robust accounting to ensure, inter alia, the avoidance of double counting, consistent with guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement.\n\n\n\n3.The use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to achieve nationally determined contributions under this Agreement shall be voluntary and authorized by participating Parties.\n\n\n\n\n4.A mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development is hereby established under the authority and guidance of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement for use by Parties on a voluntary basis. It shall be supervised by a body designated by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement, and shall aim:\n\n\n(a)To promote the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions while fostering sustainable development;\n\n\n(b)To incentivize and facilitate participation in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by public and private entities authorized by a Party;\n\n\n(c)To contribute to the reduction of emission levels in the host Party, which will benefit from mitigation activities resulting in emission reductions that can also be used by another Party to fulfil its nationally determined contribution; and\n\n\n(d)To deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions.\n\n\n5.Emission reductions resulting from the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article shall not be used to demonstrate achievement of the host Party's nationally determined contribution if used by another Party to demonstrate achievement of its nationally determined contribution.\n\n\n6.The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that a share of the proceeds from activities under the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article is used to cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation.\n\n\n7.The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement shall adopt rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article at its first session.\n\n\n8.Parties recognize the importance of integrated, holistic and balanced non-market approaches being available to Parties to assist in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in a coordinated and effective manner, including through, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate. These approaches shall aim to:\n\n\n(a)Promote mitigation and adaptation ambition;\n\n\n(b)Enhance public and private sector participation in the implementation of nationally determined contributions; and\n\n\n(c)Enable opportunities for coordination across instruments and relevant institutional arrangements.\n\n\n9.A framework for non-market approaches to sustainable development is hereby defined to promote the non-market approaches referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article.\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\n1. Parties hereby establish the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view\n\nto contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2.\n\n\n2.Parties recognize that adaptation is a global challenge faced by all with local, subnational, national, regional and international dimensions, and that it is a key component of and makes a contribution to the long-term global response to climate change to protect people, livelihoods and ecosystems, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.\n\n\n3.The adaptation efforts of developing country Parties shall be recognized, in accordance with the modalities to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement at its first session.\n\n\n4.Parties recognize that the current need for adaptation is significant and that greater levels of mitigation can reduce the need for additional adaptation efforts, and that greater adaptation needs can involve greater adaptation costs.\n\n\n5.Parties acknowledge that adaptation action should follow a country-driven, gender- responsive, participatory and fully transparent approach, taking into consideration vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems, and should be based on and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional knowledge, knowledge of indigenous peoples and local knowledge systems, with a view to integrating adaptation into relevant socioeconomic and environmental policies and actions, where appropriate.\n\n\n6.Parties recognize the importance of support for and international cooperation on adaptation efforts and the importance of taking into account the needs of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n7.Parties should strengthen their cooperation on enhancing action on adaptation, taking into account the Cancun Adaptation Framework, including with regard to:\n\n\n(a)Sharing information, good practices, experiences and lessons learned, including, as appropriate, as these relate to science, planning, policies and implementation in relation to adaptation actions;\n\n\n(b)Strengthening institutional arrangements, including those under the Convention that serve this Agreement, to support the synthesis of relevant information and knowledge, and the provision of technical support and guidance to Parties;\n\n\n(c)Strengthening scientific knowledge on climate, including research, systematic observation of the climate system and early warning systems, in a manner that informs climate services and supports decision-making;\n\n\n(d)Assisting developing country Parties in identifying effective adaptation practices, adaptation needs, priorities, support provided and received for adaptation actions and efforts, and challenges and gaps, in a manner consistent with encouraging good practices;
