In each meeting session new UN Regulations, amendments to existing UN Regulations or UN Global Technical Regulations (UN GTRs) are adopted in order to allow for technical progress. Prior to each WP.29 meeting these amendments are adopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) active under WP.29.\n\n\nSubsequently, in a WP.29 meeting the final vote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place, provided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among contracting parties. The EU is a contracting party to two Agreements (1958 and 1998 Agreements) under WP.29. A Council Decision, referred to as \"mega decision\", containing the list of Regulations, amendments, supplements and corrigenda, is prepared each time and authorises the Commission to vote on behalf of the Union in each WP.29 meeting.\n\n\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's position in the voting of the Regulations, amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted for vote in the November 2016 WP.29 meeting that will take place from 14 to 20 November 2016.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal complements and is fully in line with the Union's internal market policy as regards the automotive industry.\n\n\nThe WP.29 system strengthens international harmonization of vehicle standards. The 1958 Agreement plays a key role in this objective since EU manufacturers can operate to a common set of type approval Regulations in the knowledge that the product will be recognized by the Contracting Parties as being in conformity with its national legislation. This scheme has allowed for Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 on the general safety of motor vehicles to repeal more than 50 EU Directives and replace them with the corresponding Regulations developed under the 1958 Agreement.\n\n\nA similar approach has been taken with Directive 2007/46/EC, which has replaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval procedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN Regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN Regulations have increasingly been incorporated into Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe WP.29 system is linked to the Union policy on competiveness, on which this initiative has a positive impact. This proposal is also consistent with Union transport and energy policies, which are duly considered in the process for the drafting and adoption of the UN Regulations falling under the 1958 Agreement.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for this proposal is Article 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\nThe vote in favour of international instruments like proposals for UN Regulations, amendments to UN Regulations and draft Global Technical Regulations and their incorporation into the Union system for the type-approval of motor vehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not only prevent fragmentation of the internal market, but also ensures equal environmental and safety standards across the Union. It also offers advantages of economies of scale: products can be made for the entire Union market and even the international market, instead of being customised to obtain national type-approval for every single Member State.\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n\nThis Council Decision authorises the Commission to vote on behalf of Union and is the proportionate instrument in accordance with Article 5(1) of Council Decision 97/836/EC in order to define a unified EU position at the UNECE with respect to the vote on the working documents proposed on the agenda of the WP.29 meeting. Therefore, this proposal complies with the proportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and protection.\n\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThe use of a Council Decision is required by Article 218(9) TFEU in order to establish the positions to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf in a body set up by an international agreement.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nExternal expertise is not relevant in the case of this proposal. It has however been reviewed by the Technical Committee on Motor Vehicles.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThis proposal cannot be the subject of an impact assessment as it is not of a legislative nature and no alternative policy options are available or possible.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nIn terms of administrative burden, the initiative does not have repercussions, as the amendment references annexed to the mega decision will not introduce new reporting or other administrative obligations for enterprises, including SMEs. On the contrary, reduction of administrative burden is targeted as the application of world-harmonised requirements allow manufacturers to present approval documentation of systems and components not only in the EU but also on the export markets from Contracting Parties to the 1958 Agreement outside the EU.\n\n\nThe proposal has a very positive impact on automotive EU competitiveness and international trade. The acceptance of internationally harmonised vehicle regulations by the EU\u2019s trading partners is recognised as the best way to remove non-tariff barriers to trade and to open or widen market access for EU automotive enterprises.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nThis initiative has no budgetary implications.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nThe proposal defines the Union's position in the voting of \n\n\n\u2013the amendments to UN Regulations Nos. 7, 16, 37, 44, 45, 46, 48, 53, 78, 80, 83, 86, 87, 99, 105, 107, 110, 121, 128 and 129; \n\n\n\u2013the proposal for a new UN Regulation on Heavy Duty Dual-Fuel Engine Retrofit Systems (HDDF-ERS);\n\n\n\u2013the proposals for amendments to UN Global Technical Regulations Nos. 15 and 16; \n\n\n\u2013the proposals for two new UN Global Technical Regulations on the measurement procedure for two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles, regarding emissions and on-board diagnostics, respectively; and \n\n\n\u2013the proposal for a new Resolution on the common specification of light source categories (R.E.4).\n\n\n2016/0341 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union in the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as regards the proposals for amendments to UN Regulations Nos. 7, 16, 37, 44, 45, 46, 48, 53, 78, 80, 83, 86, 87, 99, 105, 107, 110, 121, 128 and 129, one proposal for a new UN Regulation on Heavy Duty Dual-Fuel Engine Retrofit Systems (HDDF-ERS), the proposals for amendments to UN Global Technical Regulations 15 and 16, the proposals for two new UN Global Technical Regulations on the measurement procedure for two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles with regard to certain types of emissions and with regard to on-board diagnostics, respectively, and one proposal for a new Resolution on the common specification of light source categories (R.E.4) \n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC\n1\n, the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to, and/or be used on, wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of those prescriptions (the \u2018Revised 1958 Agreement\u2019).\n\n\n(2)In accordance with Council Decision 2000/125/EC\n2\n, the Union acceded to the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (the \u2018Parallel Agreement\u2019).\n\n\n(3)Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n3\n\u00a0replaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval procedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated regulations adopted under the Revised 1958 Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 'UN Regulations') in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly been incorporated into Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.\n\n\n(4)In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos. 7, 16, 37, 44, 45, 46, 48, 53, 78, 80, 83, 86, 87, 99, 105, 107, 110, 121, 128 and 129, as well as by UN Global Technical Regulations (GTRs) Nos. 15 and 16, need to be adapted to technical progress.\n\n\n(5)In order to lay down uniform provisions concerning the approval of Heavy Duty Dual-Fuel Engine Retrofit Systems (HDDF-ERS), a new UN Regulation should be adopted. \n\n\n(6)In order to lay down uniform technical provisions concerning the measurement procedure for two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles with regard to certain types of emissions and with regard to on-board diagnostics, respectively, two new GTRs should be adopted.\n\n\n(7)In order to lay down uniform provisions concerning the common specification of light source categories, a new Resolution should be adopted (R.E. 4).\n\n\n(8)It is appropriate to establish the position to be adopted on behalf of
