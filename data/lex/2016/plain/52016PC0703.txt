"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 31.10.2016\nCOM(2016) 703 final\n2016/0346(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Association Committee in Trade configuration established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other in relation to the update of Annexes XXI-A to XXI-P on regulatory approximation in the area of public procurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council decision establishes the Union position:\n\n\n1.on a Decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part ('the Agreement') in relation to the update of Annexes XXI-A to XXI-P (related to Chapter 8 on public procurement) of the Agreement;\n\n\n2.on giving a favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration on the comprehensive roadmap submitted by Ukraine in relation to the implementation of the Agreeement in the area of public procurement. \n\n\nThe Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014, and its Title IV \"TRADE AND TRADE RELATED MATTERS\" (covering the provisions related to the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area) is provisionally applied, since 1 January 2016. The update of the above-mentioned Annexes is necessary in order to reflect the evolution of the Union acquis in the area of public procurement that has taken place since the initialling of the Agreement on 30 March 2012. The proposal is consistent with the parties' obligations set out in Article 463 of the Agreement. \n\n\nThe favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration on the roadmap is needed in order for Ukraine to streamline the legislative approximation in the area of public procurement as set out in Article 152 of the Agreement. This step is an integral part in the process of the implementation of the Agreement.\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Union\u2019s common commercial policy towards Ukraine, an Eastern Neighbourhood Partner country, based on the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement and in particular its objective to create a free trade area and conditions for economic intergration between the parties. \n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with and contributes to the implementation of other external policies of the Union, notably the European Neighbourhood Policy and the development cooperation policy in relation to Ukraine.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for\u00a0establishing the Union position to be taken in the committees set up by the Agreement is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof. \n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments set out in the Agreement with Ukraine. \n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nStakeholder consultations are not applicable to this proposal, as it aims merely at updating the references to the Union acquis already listed for approximation by Ukraine in the Agreement.\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nThe trade and trade-related provisions of the Agreement have been subject to ex-ante impact assessment (the 2007 Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment commissioned by DG Trade), which fed into the DCFTA negotiation process. That study confirmed that implementation of trade and trade-related provisions would have a positive economic impact for the EU as well as for Ukraine. The proposal does not have any negative impact on the economic, social or environmental policy of the Union.\n\n\n\uf0b7Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe Agreement is not subject to REFIT procedures at this stage; it does not imply any costs for the Union SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights in the Union. \n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the Agreement is reviewed regularly by the EU-Ukraine Association Council and its sub-ordinate bodies established by that Agreement. The European Commission also reports to the European Parliament and the Council following EU-Ukraine Association Committee in Trade configuration meetings which are taking place at least once per year, including on the elements included in this proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims to adopt a Union position in relation to: \n\n\n\n1.the update of Annex XXI to the Agreement. Annex XXI to the Agreement provides the list of the Union acquis to which the Ukraine intends to approximate its domestic legislation pertaining to the area of public procurement (Chapter 8 of Title IV of the Agreement);\n\n\n2.giving a favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration on the comprehensive roadmap submitted by Ukraine in relation to the implementation of Agreeement in the area of public procurement.\n\n\n\nThe updates to these annexes are necessary in the light of the evolution of the Union acquis listed therein since the initialling of the Agreement on 30 March 2012. Article 463(3) of the Agreement provides that the Association Council shall have the power to update or amend the Annexes to the Agreement and the Association Council delegated the power to update or amend certain trade-related annexes to the Association Committee in Trade configuration by its decision No. 3/2014 of 15 December 2014. Accordingly, the Union position is to be taken in the Association Committee in Trade configuration. \n\n\n\nThe favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration on the comprehensive roadmap is needed in order for Ukraine to streamline the legislative approximation in the area of public procurement as set out in Article 152 of the Agreement. This step is an integral part in the process of the implementation of the Agreement. The roadmap shall be considered as the reference document for the implementation of the Agreement by Ukraine in the area of public procurement.\n\n\n2016/0346 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the Association Committee in Trade configuration established by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other in relation to the update of Annexes XXI-A to XXI-P on regulatory approximation in the area of public procurement\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article 486 of the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, and their Member States of the one part, and the Ukraine, of the other part, ('the Agreement') provides for the provisional application of the Agreement in part, as specified by the Union.\n\n\n(2)Article 1 of Council Decision 2014/668/EU\n1\n of 23 June 2014 specifies the provisions of the Agreement to be applied provisionally, including the provisions on public procurement, and Annex XXI to the Agreement.

amended or repealed since the initialling of the Association Agreement on 30 March 2012. \n\n\n\n\n(5)Article 149 of the Agreement provides that the value thresholds for public procurement contracts provided for in Annex XXI-P to the Agreement are to be revised regularly, beginning in the first even year following the entry into force of the Agreement. \n\n\n(6)It is furthermore appropriate to take into account the progress made by Ukraine in the process of approximation to the Union acquis by amending certain deadlines.\u00a0\n\n\n(7)It is therefore necessary to update Annex XXI in order to reflect the developments to the Union acquis listed therein, and revise the value thresholds for public procurement contracts provided for in Annex XXI-P to the Agreement. \n\n\n(8)Article 149 of the Agreement provides that the revision of the thresholds provided for in Annex XXI-P to the Agreement shall be adopted by decision of the Association Committee in Trade configuration.

pertaining to Chapter 8 (Public Procurement) of Title IV (Trade and trade-related matters) of the Agreement.\n\n\n(11)It is therefore appropriate to determine the Union position in relation to the update of Annex XXI to the Agreement to be adopted by the Association Committee in Trade configuration.\n\n\n(12)Article 152(1) of the Agreement stipulates that Ukraine shall submit to the Association Committee in Trade configuration a comprehensive roadmap for the implementation of the legislation related to public procurement with time schedules and milestones which should include all reforms in terms of legislative approximation and institutional capacity building.This roadmap shall comply with the phases and time schedules set out in Annex XXI-A to the Agreement.\u00a0\n\n\n(13)Article 152(3) specifies that a favourable opinion by the Association Committee in Trade configuration is needed in order for the comprehensive roadmap to become a reference document for the process of implementation i.e. for the legislative approximation of the public procurement related legislation to the Union acquis.\u00a0\n\n\n(14)It is therefore appropriate to determine the Union position in relation to a favourable opinion regarding the comprehensive roadmap to be adopted by the Association Committee in Trade configuration,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n1.The
