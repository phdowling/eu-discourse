One important tool in this respect is the annual fixing of fishing opportunities. \n\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to fix, for the commercially most important fish stocks in the Black Sea, the fishing opportunities for Member States for 2017.20\n\n\n\uf0b7General context\n\n\nBlack Sea stocks exploited by Bulgaria and Romania are shared with non-EU countries, e.g. Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia and Russian Federation. There are however no Total Allowable Catches (TAC) decided at regional level between EU and non-EU countries. Every year since 2008 the European Union has been fixing autonomous quotas for turbot and sprat stocks in order to help ensure that the CFP rules are applied.\n\n\nThe fisheries exploiting sprat are of high socio-economic significance for the Black Sea riparian countries. According to the 2015-2016 Black Sea assessment of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (the STECF), the share of EU countries in the Black Sea sprat catch represented 4% in 2014, 14% in 2013 and 9% in 2012 of the official reported landings. According to the 2016 General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (the GFCM) session report, the stock status of sprat in the Black Sea is sustainably exploited.\n\n\nThe fisheries exploiting turbot are of high socio-economic significance for the Black Sea riparian countries. According to the 2015-2016 Black Sea assessment of the STECF, the turbot stock is severely depleted. According to the GFCM's 2016 session report, the stock status of turbot in the Black Sea is overexploited and in overexploitation. The share of EU countries in the Black Sea turbot catch represented 7% in 2014, 5.5% in 2013 and 4.6% in 2012 of the official reported landings plus the IUU estimates. Thus, the need to establish an international recovery programme for turbot in the whole Black Sea has been one of the Commission's priorities in the recent years. Progress has been made in that respect at the 2015 GFCM annual session where the EU proposal for measures to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing in turbot fisheries in the Black Sea was endorsed\n1\n, and at the 2016 GFCM annual session where the EU proposal for scientific monitoring, management and control of turbot fisheries in the Black Sea was adopted\n2\n. \n\n\nThe share of the catches between riparian countries has been drastically modified due to the recent integration of Crimea in the Russian Federation, which have redefined EEZs in the Black Sea.\n\n\nThe Communication from the Commission on the consultation on fishing opportunities for 2016 (COM(2015) 239 final), outlines the background to the proposal. \n\n\nThis year data gathering is not available due to data availability problems regarding non-EU sources. Consequently, the scientific advice on fishing opportunities in the Black Sea for 2017 will not be delivered by the STECF at the session scheduled in September 2016, which for the reason invoked has been postponed sine die.. The scientific advice available at this stage corresponds to the evaluation of the stocks concerned made last year by the STECF and in March 2016 by the Working Group on stocks assessment of the GFCM. Taking into consideration the worrying status of turbot confirmed by the GFCM in 2016, the diagnosis on the status of this stock will remain the same: overexploited.\n\n\nThe proposal will need to be updated if eventually new advice and information become available, either by the STECF or the by the Working Group on stocks assessment of the GFCM. The assessment of this Working Group will not be endorsed by GFCM until the 2nd quarter of 2017. Therefore, the result of this group could be indicative but could not taken as official consolidated scientif advice.\n\n\n\uf0b7Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\n\n\nFishing opportunities and the way they are allocated to Member States are regulated annually. The latest such legal act is Council Regulation (EU) 2016/73\n3\n of 18 January 2016 fixing for 2016 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks applicable in the Black Sea.\n\n\nIn addition to the annual fishing opportunities, the following measures relevant to the Black Sea fisheries covered by this proposal should be mentioned: \n\n\n\u2013Minimum conservation sizes and minimum mesh sizes regarding the turbot fishery in the Black Sea are established by Regulation (EU) No 227/2013 of the Council and the European Parliament of 13 March 2013\n4\n amending Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms and Council Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 specifying conditions under which herring may be landed for industrial purposes other than direct human consumption.\n\n\n\u2013Recommendation GFCM/37/2013/2 establishing a set of minimum standards for bottom-set gillnet fisheries for turbot and conservation of cetaceans in the Black Sea adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in its 37th Session (Split, May 2013).\n\n\n\u2013Recommendation GFCM/39/2015/3 establishing a set of measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in turbot fisheries in the Black Sea adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in its 39th  Session (Milan, May 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\u2013Recommendation GFCM/39/2015/4 establishing management measures for piked dogfish in the Black Sea adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in its 39th  Session (Milan, May 2015).\n\n\n\u2013Recommendation GFCM/40/2016/6 on scientific monitoring, management and control of turbot fisheries in the Black Sea adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in its 40th Session (St Julian, May-June 2016).\n\n\n\uf0b7Consistency with other policies and objectives of the EU\n\n\nThe proposed measures are in accordance with the objectives and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union\u2019s policy on sustainable development.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nMain organisations/experts consulted\n\n\nThe scientific organisation consulted is the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\n\n\nThe Union asks STECF each year for scientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The STECF gives its advice following the terms of reference that it receives from the Commission. The most recent and accurate advice at the time of the discussion of this proposal at the Councilwill cover all Black Sea stocks for which quotas are proposed.\n\n\nThe ultimate objective is to bring and maintain the stocks to levels that can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This objective has been incorporated expressly in the new basic Regulation of the CFP, whose Article 2(2) states that this objective \u201cshall be achieved by 2015 where possible, and [\u2026] by 2020 for all stocks\". This reflects the commitment taken by the Union regarding the conclusions of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and its related Plan of Implementation. \n\n\nConsultation of interested parties\n\n\nInterested parties were consulted via the Communication from the Commission on the Consultation on fishing opportunities for 2017. The scientific basis for the proposal will be provided by STECF. All STECF reports are available on the DG MARE website.\n\n\n\uf0b7Impact assessment\n\n\nBased on the scientific advice, the proposed measures will result on keeping the current fishing opportunities in terms of catch volumes for Union fishing vessels in the Black Sea. The risk of negative impact on the recovery of the stock population is curtailed by additional control measures introduced and implemented by Romania and Bulgaria in complying with their commitments given by these Member States in the context of the adoption of the Regulation fixing for 2016 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks in the Black Sea.\n\n\nThe proposal reflects not only short-term concerns but is also part of a longer term approach whereby the level of fishing is gradually adapted to long-term sustainable levels.\n\n\nThe approach taken in the proposal might therefore, in the medium to long term, result in reduced fishing effort but stable or increasing quotas in the long term. The long-term consequences of the approach are expected to be a reduced impact on the environment as a consequence of the adaptation in fishing effort and unchanged or increased landings. The sustainability of fishing activities will increase in the long term.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\uf0b7Summary of the proposed action\n\n\nThe proposal establishes the catch limitations applicable in the Black Sea to Union fisheries, in order to achieve the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy of ensuring fisheries at levels that are biologically, economically and socially sustainable.\n\n\n\uf0b7Legal basis\n\n\n\n\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\nThe Union's obligations for sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources arise from obligations set out in Article 2 of the basic regulation of the CFP.\n\n\n\uf0b7Subsidiarity principle\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the Union exclusive competence as referred to in Article 3(1)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\n\n\uf0b7Proportionality principle\n\n\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason.\n\n\nThe Common Fisheries Policy is a common policy. According to Article 43(3) TFEU it is incumbent upon the Council to adopt the measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n\n\nThe proposed Council Regulation allocates fishing opportunities to Member States. Having regard to Article 16(6) and (7) and Article 17 of Regulation 1380/2013, Member States are free to allocate such opportunities among vessels flying their flag as they see fit. Therefore, Member States have ample room for manoeuvre on decisions related to the social and economic models of their choice to exploit their allocated fishing opportunities.\n\n\nThe proposal has no new financial implications for Member States. This Regulation is adopted by the Council every year, and the public and private means to implement it are already in place.\n\n\n\uf0b7Choice of instruments\n\n\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\n\n\nThis is a proposal for fisheries management on the basis of Article 43(3) TFEU and in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 .\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the Union budget.\n\n\n5.OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\n\n\uf0b7Simplification\n\n\nThe proposal continues to provide for simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or national), as it contains provisions similar to those of the 2016 Regulation on the fishing opportunities in the Black Sea. \n\n\n\uf0b7Review/revision/sunset clause\n\n\nThe proposal concerns an annual Regulation for the year 2017 and therefore does not include a revision clause.\n\n\n\uf0b7Detailed Explanation\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal fixes for 2017 the fishing opportunities for certain stocks or groups of stocks for Member States fishing in the Black Sea. \n\n\nThe landing obligation for stocks caught in certain fisheries starts to become applicable from 1 January 2015. In the Black Sea these fisheries cover small pelagic fisheries, namely, the fishery for sprat, which is one of the stocks under quotas in this Regulation. From 1 January 2017 the landing obligation will apply to all catches for species which define the fisheries in the Black Sea.\n\n\nWith introduction of the landing obligation, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the fishing opportunities proposed shall reflect the change from amount landed to amount caught. This is done on the basis of the received scientific advice for the fish stocks in fisheries as refered to in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The fishing opportunities should also be fixed in accordance with Articles 16(1) (referring to the principle of relative stability) and 16(4) (referring to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and the rules provided for in multiannual plans). The proposed figures reflect the scientific advice and the framework for setting the quotas outlined in the Communication from the Commission on the Consultation on fishing opportunities for 2016. \n\n\nGiven the Commission's intention to ensure the sustainable use of fishery resources, in line with the Union's policy and international commitments while maintaining stable fishing opportunities, annual variations in fishing opportunities are limited as far as practicable, taking account of the status of a given stock.\n\n\nIn the absence of a TAC agreed by the riparian countries of the Black Sea, the EU autonomous quotas allocated to Member States are given in the Annex to the proposed Regulation.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article\u00a02 of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 847/96\n5\n, it is proposed that Articles 3 and 4 do not apply to the stocks covered by this Regulation. However, in accordance with Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 year-to-year flexibility envisaged therein applies to stocks covered by the landing obligation.\n\n\n2016/0386 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\n\n\nfixing for 2017 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Black Sea\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Article\u00a043(3) of the Treaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n\n\n(2)Regulation\u00a0(EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n6\n requires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).\n\n\n(3)It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries in the Black Sea including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(1) and (4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of each Member State's fishing activities for each stock or fishery and in accordance the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation.\n\n\n(4)The fishing opportunities should be established on the basis of the available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders.\n\n\n(5)For sprat fisheries the landing obligation referred to in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 applies from 1 January 2015. Article 16(2) of that Regulation provides that, when the landing obligation is introduced in respect of a fish stock, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches.\n\n\n(6)The use of fishing opportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\n7\n and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 thereof concerning  the recording of catches and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by the Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n\n\n\n\n(7)In accordance with Article\u00a02 of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 847/96\n8\n,the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified\n\n\n(8)In order to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of Union fishermen, it is important to open the fisheries concerned in the Black Sea on 1 January 2017. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\n\n\n(9)Fishing opportunities should be used in full compliance with the applicable law of the Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\n\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation fixes the fishing opportunities by Union fishing
