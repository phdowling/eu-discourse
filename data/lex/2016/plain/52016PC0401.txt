ICCAT is the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of ICCAT species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas. ICCAT adopts new conservation, control and enforcement measures every year. This transposition proposal relates to the measures adopted by ICCAT since 2008, with the exception of the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, which is subject to a separate transposition process.\n\n\nICCAT has the authority to adopt compulsory decisions (\u201crecommendations\u201d) for the conservation and management of the fisheries under its purview. These acts are essentially addressed to the ICCAT Contracting Parties but also contain obligations for operators (e.g. the vessel master). The ICCAT recommendations enter into force six months following their adoption and are binding for Contracting Parties and, in the case of the EU, must be enacted into European law to the extent to which they are not already covered by EU legislation.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThe last transposition of the ICCAT conservation and enforcement recommendations was done through the following legal acts: Council Regulation (EC) No 1936/2001 of 27 September 2001 laying down control measures applicable to fishing for certain stocks of highly migratory fish\n1\n; Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 of 7 May 2007, laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species and repealing Regulation (EC) No 973/2001, and Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009  concerning the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ICCAT recommendations adopted after 2008 introduce amendments to many recommendations adopted before and establish several new provisions. In addition, the relevant EU legislation has substantially evolved since the last transposition with the adoption of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy. For reasons of clarity, parts of Council Regulation (EC) No 1936/2001 and of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 referred to above will be repealed to take account of the many changes adopted since 2008. \n\n\nFishing opportunities for the EU decided by ICCAT will not be covered by this proposal in the light of Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides that the adoption of measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities is a prerogative of the Council.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal basis\n\n\n\nThe proposal is based on Article 43(2) TFEU as it sets out provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. \n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n\nThe subsidiarity principle does not apply in this context, as the proposal relates to the sustainable exploitation, management and conservation of marine biological resources in the context of the external component of the Common Fisheries Policy.. \n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality\n\n\n\nThe considered option will ensure the implementation of the ICCAT obligations within the EU without exceeding what is necessary to achieve the objective pursued.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Regulation is directly applicable and binding on the Member States, it shall contribute to a uniform application of the proposed rules throughout the Union, therefore creating a level playing field for all EU operators active in fishing activities in the ICCAT  Convention Area. \n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n\nThis proposal aims at transposing already existing ICCAT recommendations, binding upon the Contracting Parties. Both Member States experts and stakeholders are consulted in the preparation of the ICCAT meetings where these recommendations are adopted, as well as throughout the negotiations at the ICCAT annual meeting. No stakeholder consultation was therefore deemed to be necessary for this transposition Regulation. \n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impact assessment\n\n\n\nAs no new policy aspects will be defined, an impact assessment is not relevant for the present legislative initiative. This initiative is about applicable international obligations that are already binding upon the EU, in respect of which no impact assessment is required.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental rights\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\n\n\nNA.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nTitle I contains general provisions such as subject matter and scope, objective and definitions. Most importantly, this Regulation applies to the Union vessels fishing in the ICCAT Convention area or, in the case of transhipments, in the area outside the ICCAT Convention area for the species caught in the ICCAT Convention area. \n\n\nTitle II contains ICCAT management measures divided into 7 chapters per individual species. Chapter 1 is devoted to tropical tunas; Chapter 2 to North Atlantic albacore; Chapter 3 to swordfish (Atlantic swordfish as well as Mediterranean swordfish); Chapter 4 to blue marlin and white marlin; Chapter 5 to sharks; Chapter 6 to sea-birds (caught as by-catch) and Chapter 7 to turtles (caught as by-catch). \n\n\nTitle III contains common control and monitoring measures. Chapter 1 deals with the ICCAT record of large scale vessels. Chapter 2 lays down provisions on chartering. Chapter 3 deals with control of catches, and notably compliance with quotas and minimum size requirements, catch sampling and catch and fishing effort notification. Chapter 4 and 5 set provisions on transhipment and on scientific observer programmes respectively. Chapter 6 lays down provisions for reporting obligations with regard to designated ports and points of contact and with regard to port inspections. Chapter 7 deals with enforcement and specifically with alleged infringements and non-compliances and ICCAT draft IUU list\n\n\nTitle IV contains final provisions, such as annual report, confidentiality of data, procedure for amendments, exercise of the delegation, implementation and amendments to the existing EU legislation. \n\n\n\n2016/0187 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\nlaying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1936/2001, (EC) No 1984/2003 and (EC) No 520/2007\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 (2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n3\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas: \n\n\n(1)The objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n4\n is to ensure exploitation of marine biological resources that provides long-term environmental, economic and social sustainability.\n\n\n(2)The European Union has approved by Council Decision 98/392/EC\n5\n the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which contains, inter alia, principles and rules with regard to the conservation and management of marine living resources. In the framework of its wider international obligations, the European Union participates in efforts made in international waters to conserve fish stocks.\n\n\n(3)Pursuant to Council Decision 86/238/EEC\n6\n the European Union has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter \"the ICCAT Convention\") since 14 November 1997.\n\n\n\n\n(4)The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjoining seas through the setting up of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereafter the \"ICCAT\").\n\n\n(5)ICCAT has the authority to adopt compulsory decisions (\"Recommendations\") for the conservation and management of the fisheries under its purview, which are binding for the Contracting Parties. These acts are essentially addressed to the ICCAT Contracting Parties, but also contain obligations for private operators (e.g. vessel masters). The ICCAT Recommendations enter into force six months following their adoption and in respect of the EU, they must be enacted into European Union law. \n\n\n(6)The last implementation of the ICCAT conservation and enforcement recommendations was done through Council Regulation (EC) No 1936/2001\n7\n and Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007\n8\n.\n\n\n(7)ICCAT Recommendation concerning multiannual recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean were implemented by Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009\n9\n. This Regulation does not cover such multiannual recovery plan.\n\n\n(8)This Regulation also does not cover fishing opportunities decided by ICCAT, as Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities shall be adopted by the Council.\n\n\n(9)The ICCAT Recommendations adopted after 2008 introduce amendments to many recommendations adopted before that date and establish several new provisions.\n\n\n(10)In order to swiftly incorporate into Union law future binding amendments to the ICCAT Recommendations, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.\n\n\n(11)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n10\n.\n\n\n(12)To ensure compliance with the CFP, EU legislation has been adopted to establish a system of control, inspection and enforcement, which includes the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) activities.\n\n\n(13)In particular, Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\n11\n establishes a Union system for control, inspection and enforcement with a global and integrated approach so as to ensure compliance with all the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011\n12\n lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008\n13\n establishes a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Those Regulations already implement a number  of the provisions laid down in the ICCAT Recommendations. It is therefore not necessary to include those provisions in this Regulation.\n\n\n(14)Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 introduced a landing obligation which applies as of 1 January 2015 to small and large pelagic fisheries, fisheries for industrial purposes and fisheries for salmon in the Baltic sea. However, under Article 15(2) of that Regulation, the landing obligation is without prejudice to the Union's international obligations, such as those resulting from ICCAT Recommendations. Under that same provision the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation. Accordingly, the discard in some fisheries for small and large pelagic fisheries and fisheries for industrial purposes will be allowed in some situations laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2015/98\n14\n.\n\n\n(15)Council Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003\n15\n establishes statistical document programmes for swordfish and bigeye in accordance with the relevant ICCAT provisions. As new provisions on statistical programmes have been adopted by ICCAT in relation to transhipment at sea, it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 to incorporate those provisions in Union law.\n\n\n(16)Many ICCAT recommendations have changed or have been repealed in recent years. Therefore, for reasons of clarity, simplification and legal certainty it is appropriate to amend Council Regulations (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 520/2007,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nTitle I\nGeneral Provisions\n\n\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n\n\nThis Regulation lays down management, conservation and control provisions relating to fishing for highly migratory fish species managed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).\n\n\nArticle 2\nScope\n\n\nThis Regulation shall apply to:\n\n\n(a)Union fishing vessels, and Union vessels engaged in recreational fisheries, which operate in the ICCAT  Convention Area and, in the case of transhipments, also outside the ICCAT Convention area if they tranship species caught in that area;\n\n\n\n\n(b)third country vessels which are inspected in Member States ports and which carry ICCAT species or fish products originating from such species that have not been previously landed or transhipped at ports.\n\n\nArticle 3\nRelationship to other Union acts\n\n\nThis Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the provisions laid down in: \n\n\n(a)Regulation XXXX/2016 [new FAR Regulation];

The observers shall respect the hierarchy and general rules of behaviour which apply to all vessel personnel, provided such rules do not interfere with the duties of the observer under this programme, and with the obligations set forth in point 7.\n\n\n\nObligations of the flag Member State \n\n\n7. The responsibilities regarding observers of the flag Member States of the fishing vessels and their masters shall include the following, notably:\n\n\n(a) the observers shall be allowed to access to the vessel personnel and to the gear and equipment;\n\n\n(b) upon request, observers shall also be allowed access to the following equipment, if present on the vessels to which they are assigned, in order to facilitate the carrying out of their duties set forth in point 3:\n\n\n\n\n(i) satellite navigation equipment;\n\n\n(ii) radar display viewing screens when in use;\n\n\n(iii) electronic means of communication.\n\n\n(c) the observers shall be provided accommodations, including lodging, food and adequate sanitary facilities, equal to those of officers;\n\n\n(d) the observers shall be provided with adequate space on the bridge or pilot house for clerical work, as well as space on deck adequate for carrying out observer duties; and\n\n\n(e) the flag Member State shall ensure that masters, crew and vessel owners do not obstruct, intimidate, interfere with, influence, bribe or attempt to bribe an observer in the performance of his/her duties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex V\nMinimum technical standards for mitigation measures\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\n\n\nmeasure\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNight setting with minimum deck lighting\n\n\n\n\n\nNo setting between nautical dawn and before nautical dusk. Deck lighting to be kept to a minimum\n\n\n\n\n\nNautical dusk and nautical dawn are defined as set out in the Nautical Almanac tables for relevant latitude, local time and date. Minimum deck lighting should not breach minimum standards for safety and navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBird-scaring lines (Tori lines)\n\n\n\n\n\nBird-scaring lines shall be deployed during longline setting to deter birds from approaching the branch line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor vessels greater than or equal to 35m:\n\n\n- deploy at least 1 bird-scaring line. Where practical, vessels are encouraged to use a second tori pole and bird scaring line at times of high bird abundance or activity; both tori lines should be deployed simultaneously, one on each side of the line being set;\n\n\n- aerial extent of bird-scaring lines must be greater than or equal to 100 m.\n\n\n- long streamers of sufficient length to reach the sea surface in calm conditions must be used;\n\n\n- long streamers must be at intervals of no more than 5m.\n\n\nFor vessels less than 35m:\n\n\n- deploy at least 1 bird-scaring line;\n\n\n- aerial extent must be greater than or equal to 75m;\n\n\n- long and/or short (but greater than 1m in length) streamers must be used and placed at intervals as follows:\n\n\n\uf0b7Short: intervals of no more than 2m.\n\n\n\uf0b7Long: intervals of no more than 5m for the first 55 m of bird scaring line.\n\n\nAdditional design and deployment guidelines for bird-scaring lines are provided in Supplemental Guidelines for Design and Deployment of tori lines below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine weighting\n\n\n\n\nLine weights to be deployed on the snood prior to setting\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater than a total of 45 g attached within 1 m of the hook; or \n\n\nGreater than a total of 60 g attached within 3.5 m of the hook; or\n\n\nGreater than a total of 98 g weight attached within 4 m of the hook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Guidelines for Design and Deployment of Tori Lines\n\n\n\nPreamble\n\n\nMinimum technical standards for deployment of tori lines are found in Table above of this Annex. These supplemental guidelines are designed to assist in preparation and implementation of tori line regulations for longline vessels. While these guidelines are relatively explicit, improvement in tori line effectiveness through experimentation is encouraged, within the requirements of the Table above. The guidelines take into account environmental and operational variables such as weather conditions, setting speed and ship size, all of which influence tori line performance and design in protecting baits from birds. Tori line design and use may change to take account of these variables provided that line performance is not compromised. On-going improvement in tori line design is envisaged and consequently review of these guidelines should be undertaken in the future.\n\n\n\nTori line design\n\n\n1. An appropriate towed device on the section of the tori line in the water can improve the aerial extension.\n\n\n2. The above water section of the line should be sufficiently light that its movement is unpredictable to avoid habituation by birds and sufficiently heavy to avoid deflection of the line by wind.\n\n\n3. The line is best attached to the vessel with a robust barrel swivel to reduce tangling of the line.\n\n\n4. The streamers should be made of material that is conspicuous and produces an unpredictable lively action (e.g. strong fine line sheathed in red polyurethane tubing) suspended from a robust three-way swivel (that again reduces tangles) attached to the tori line.\n\n\n\n\n5. Each streamer should consist of two or more strands.\n\n\n6. Each streamer pair should be detachable by means of a clip so that line stowage is more efficient.\n\n\n\nDeployment of tori lines\n\n\n1. The line should be suspended from a pole affixed to the vessel. The tori pole should be set as high as possible so that the line protects bait a good distance astern of the vessel and will not tangle with fishing gear. Greater pole height provides greater bait protection. For example, a height of around 7 m above the water line can give about 100 m of bait protection.\n\n\n2. If vessels use only one tori line it should be set to windward of sinking baits. If baited hooks are set outboard of the wake, the streamer line attachment point to the vessel should be positioned several meters outboard of the side of the vessel that baits are deployed. If vessels use two tori lines, baited hooks should be deployed within the area bounded by the two tori lines.\n\n\n3. Deployment of multiple tori lines is encouraged to provide even greater protection of baits from birds.\n\n\n4. Because there is the potential for line breakage and tangling, spare tori lines should be carried on board to replace damaged lines and to ensure fishing operations can continue uninterrupted. Breakaways can be incorporated into the tori line to minimize safety and operational problems should a longline float foul or tangle with the in-water extent of a streamer line.\n\n\n5. When fishers use a bait casting machine (BCM), they must ensure coordination of tori line and machine by:\n\n\n(i) ensuring the BCM throws directly under the tori line protection, and\n\n\n(ii) when using a BCM (or multiple BCMs) that allows throwing to both port and starboard, two tori lines should be used.\n\n\n6. When casting branchline by hand, fishers should ensure that the baited hooks and coiled branchline sections are cast under the tori line protection, avoiding the propeller turbulence which may slow the sink rate.\n\n\n7. Fishers are encouraged to install manual, electric or hydraulic winches to improve ease of deployment and retrieval of tori lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex VI\nDetailed requirements for the release of turtles\n\n\nRegarding safe-handling practices:\n\n\n(i) When a turtle is to be removed from the water, an appropriate basket lift or dip-net shall be used to bring aboard sea turtles that are hooked or entangled in gear. No turtle shall be hauled from the water by a fishing line attached to, or entangled upon the body of a turtle. If the turtle cannot be safely removed from the water, the crew should cut the line as close as possible to the hook, without inflicting additional unnecessary harm on the turtle.\n\n\n(ii) In cases where marine turtles are taken on board, vessel operators or crew shall assess the condition of sea turtles that are caught or entangled prior to release. Those turtles with difficulties to move or are unresponsive shall be kept on board to the extent practicable and assisted in a manner consistent with maximizing their survival prior to release. These practices are described further in the FAO\u2019s Guidelines to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations.\n\n\n\n\n(iii) To the extent practicable, turtles handled in fishing operations or during national observer programmes (e.g. tagging activities) shall be handled in a manner consistent with the FAO\u2019s Guidelines to Reduce Sea Turtle Mortality in Fishing Operations.\n\n\nRegarding the use of line cutters:\n\n\n(i) Longline vessels shall carry on board line-cutters and use these when de-hooking is not possible without harming the marine turtle while releasing them.\n\n\n(ii) Other types of vessels that use gear that may entangle sea turtles shall carry on board line-cutters and use these tools to safely remove gear, and release sea turtles.\n\n\nRegarding the use of de-hooking devices:\n\n\n(i) Longline vessels shall carry on board de-hooking devices to effectively remove hooks from sea turtles.\n\n\n(ii) When a hook is swallowed, no attempt shall be made to remove the hook. Instead, the line must be cut as close to the hook as possible without inflicting additional unnecessary harm on the turtle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex VII\nIn-Port Transhipment\n\n\n1. Transhipment in-port by Union vessels or in Union ports of tuna and tuna-like species and any other species caught in association with these species in the Convention area shall follow the following procedures:\n\n\nNotification obligations\n\n\n2. Fishing vessel\n\n\n2.1 At least 48 hours in advance of transhipment operations, the captain of the fishing vessel must notify to the port State authorities the name of the carrier vessel and date/time of transhipment.\n\n\n2.2 The captain of a fishing vessel shall, at the time of the transhipment, inform its flag Member State of the following;\n\n\n\u2212 the quantities of tuna and tuna-like species, if possible, by stock, to be transhipped;\n\n\n\u2212 the quantities of other species caught in association with tuna and tuna-like species by species, where known, to be transhipped;\n\n\n\u2212 the date and place of the transhipment;\n\n\n\u2212 the name, registration number and flag of the receiving carrier vessel; and\n\n\n\u2212 the geographic location of the catches by species and, where appropriate, by stock, consistent with ICCAT statistical areas.\n\n\n2.3 The captain of the fishing vessel concerned shall complete and transmit to its flag Member State the ICCAT transhipment declaration, along with its number in the ICCAT record of fishing vessels, where applicable, not later than 15 days after the transhipment.\n\n\n\n\n3. Receiving vessel\n\n\n3.1 Not later than 24 hours before the beginning and at the end of the transhipment, the master of the receiving carrier vessel shall inform the port State authorities of the quantities of catches of tuna and tuna-like species transhipped to his vessel, and complete and transmit the ICCAT transhipment declaration to the competent authorities within 24 hours.\n\n\n3.2 The master of the receiving carrier vessel shall, at least 48 hours before landing, complete and transmit an ICCAT transhipment declaration to the competent authorities of the landing State where the landing takes place.\n\n\nPort and Landing State Cooperation\n\n\n4. The port State and the landing State referred to in the above paragraphs shall review the information received pursuant to the provisions of this Annex, including in cooperation with the flag CPC of the fishing vessel as necessary, to determine consistency between the reported catches, transhipments, and landings of each vessel. This verification shall be carried out so that the vessel suffers the minimum interference and inconvenience and that degradation of the fish is avoided.\n\n\nReporting\n\n\n6. Each flag Member State of the fishing vessel shall include in its annual report each year to ICCAT the details on the transhipments by its vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex VIII\nICCAT Regional Observer Programme for transhipment at-sea operations\n\n\n1.
