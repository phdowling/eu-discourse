These Sub-Committees have to monitor the implementation of the DCFTA part of the Agreement, and resolve related issues. The Sub-Committees have to adopt their Rules of Procedure. The first meetings of the Sub-Committees are expected to take place in the second half of 2016. The Rules of Procedure of these Sub-Committees, attached to this proposal, are based on the Rules of Procedure of the Association Committee. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThis proposal implements the Union\u2019s common commercial policy towards Ukraine, an Eastern Neighbourhood Partner country, based on the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement and in particular its objective to create a deep and comprehensive free trade area between the parties (DCFTA). \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThis proposal is consistent with and contributes to the implementation of other external policies of the Union, notably the European Neighbourhood Policy and the development cooperation policy in relation to Ukraine.\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nThe legal basis for establishing the Union position to be taken in the Committees and Sub-Committees set up by the Agreement is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article 207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof. \n\n\nIn light of approval of the four draft texts of the Rules of Procedure by Ukraine, on the basis of Article 207(4) and Article 218(9) TFEU, the European Commission proposes that the Council adopts the Decision authorising the Union position on the decisions to be adopted in the first EU-Ukraine SPS Sub-Committee, in the EU-Ukraine Trade and Sustainable Development Sub-Committee, in the EU-Ukraine Customs Sub-Committee and in the EU-Ukraine GI Sub-Committee with regard to their Rules of Procedure.\n\n\nArticle 74 of the Agreement establishes the SPS Sub-Committee and provides that it should adopt its working procedures at its first meeting. The meeting of the SPS Sub-Committee is to take place in the second half of 2016. In view of this first meeting it is necessary to prepare the Union position on the draft Rules of Procedure for the said Sub-Committee. The attached draft rules were approved by Ukraine.\n\n\nArticle 300 of the Agreement establishes the Trade and Sustainable Development Sub-Committee and provides that it should adopt its Rules of Procedure. The first meeting is expected to take place in the second half of 2016. Therefore it is necessary to prepare the Union position on the Rules of Procedure for that Sub-Committee. The attached draft rules were approved by Ukraine.\n\n\nArticle 83 of the Agreement establishes the Customs Sub-Committee and provides that it should adopt its internal Rules of Procedure. The first meeting is expected to take place the second half of 2016. Therefore it is necessary to prepare the Union position on the Rules of Procedure for that Sub-Committee. The attached draft rules were approved by Ukraine.\n\n\nArticle 211 of the Agreement establishes the GI Sub-Committee and provides that it should adopt its Rules of Procedure. The first meeting is expected to take place inthe second half of 2016. Therefore it is necessary to prepare the Union position on the Rules of Procedure for that Sub-Committee. The attached draft rules were approved by Ukraine.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\n\n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is necessary in order to implement the Union\u2019s international commitments set out in the Agreement with Ukraine. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions establishing the positions to be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by and agreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal efects. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nStakeholder consultations are not applicable to this proposal, as it aims merely at implementimg the Union's commitments set out in the Agreement.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe trade and trade-related provisions of the Agreement have been subject to ex-ante impact assessment (the 2007 Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment commissioned by DG Trade), which fed into the DCFTA negotiation process. That study confirmed that implementation of trade and trade-related provisions would have a positive economic impact for the EU as well as for Ukraine. The proposal does not have any negative impact on the economic, social or environmental policy of the Union.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nThe Agreement is not subject to REFIT procedures at this stage; it does not imply any costs for the Union SMEs; and it does not raise any issues from the viewpoint of the digital environment. \n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights in the Union. \n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the Agreement is reviewed regularly by the EU-Ukraine Association Council and its sub-ordinate bodies established by that Agreement. The European Commission also reports to the European Parliament and the Council following EU-Ukraine Association Committee in Trade configuration meetings which are taking place at least once per year, including on the elements included in this proposal.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\nThe proposal aims to adopt a Union position in relation to: \n\n\n\nThe Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), as part of EU-Ukraine Association Agreement (\"the Agreement\"), is applied since 1 January 2016. The Agreement established a number of joint institutions, among them the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Sub-Committee, the Trade and Sustainable Development Sub-Committee, the Customs Subcommittee and the Geographical Indications Sub-Committee which are responsible for the implementation of the DCFTA commitments related to their respective areas of expertise. \n\n\nIn accordance with Article 218(9)
