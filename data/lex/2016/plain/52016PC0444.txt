"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nStrasbourg, 5.7.2016\nCOM(2016) 444 final\n2016/0206(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing on behalf of the European Union of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada of the one part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\nOn the basis of negotiating directives adopted by the Council, the European Commission has negotiated the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with a view to establishing a state of the art and priviledged economic relationship with Canada. Canada is a strategic partner of the European Union with whom we share a past history based on common values and interests, and with whom we also wish to define a positive forward-looking relationship for the future. This should create new opportunities for trade and investment between the European Union and Canada, notably through improved market access for goods and services and enhanced rules on trade for economic actors. \n\n\nTo this end, the EU and Canada have reached an ambitious agreement which will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for economic actors on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides have also underlined through this agreement the importance of economic activity taking place within a framework of clear and transparent regulation defined by public authorities, and that they consider the right to regulate in the public interest as a basic underlying principle of the Agreement. \n\n\nThe attached proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)\n\nbetween the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part.\n\n\nThe CETA negotiations were completed and initialled at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 1 August 2014 and President Barroso, President Van Rompuy and Prime Minister Harper jointly announced the end of the CETA negotiations at the EU-Canada Summit on 26 September 2014 following which the text of the agreement was made public the same day. The legally reviewed text of CETA has been published on 29 February 2016 and can be found on the following link: \n\n\n\nhttp://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\nThe EU and Canada have a longstanding trade and economic cooperation relationship, developed under the 1976 Framework Agreement for Commercial and Economic Cooperation, the 1996 Joint Action Plan and the 1998 EU-Canada Trade Initiative. In addition, the EU and Canada have concluded several bilateral sectoral agreements, notably the 1996 Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation, the 1998 Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessments, the 1998 Veterinary Agreement, the 1999 Competition Agreement, the 2003 Agreement on Trade in Wines and Spirits Drinks, the 2009 Civil Aviation Safety Agreement and the 2009 Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement.\n\n\nThese agreements will remain in place with the exception that:\n\n\nThe 1989 Alcoholic Beverages Agreement and the 2003 Wines and Spirit Drinks Agreement will be incorporated into and made part of CETA, as amended by Annex 30-B.\n\n\nThe 1998 Agreement on Mutual Recognition will be terminated from the date of entry into force of CETA. \n\n\nThe EU and Canada recognise the achievements that have been accomplished under the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products, done at Ottawa on 17 December 1998 (the \u201cVeterinary Agreement\u201d) and confirm their intention to continue this work under CETA. The 1998 Veterinary Agreement shall be replaced by CETA from the date of entry into force of CETA. \n\n\nThe bilateral agreements listed below shall cease to have effect, and shall be replaced and superseded by CETA. The termination of those agreements shall take effect from the date of entry into force of CETA.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, done at Ottawa on 3 February 1997.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Czech Republic and Canada for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, done at Prague on 6 May 2009.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Hungary and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, done at Ottawa on 3 October 1991.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Latvia and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, done at Riga on 5 May 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Exchange of Notes between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Malta Constituting an Agreement Relating to Foreign Investment Insurance, done at Valletta on 24 May 1982.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Poland and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, done at Warsaw on 6 April 2009.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Government of Romania and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, done at Bucharest on 8 May 2009.\n\n\n\uf0b7Agreement between the Slovak Republic and the Government of Canada for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, done at Bratislava on 20 July 2010.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nCETA is fully consistent with Union policies, including those affecting international trade. In this respect, CETA will not lower or amend EU legislation, nor it will amend, reduce or eliminate EU standards in any regulated area. All imports from Canada will have to satisfy EU rules and regulations (e.g. technical rules and product standards, sanitary or phytosanitary rules, regulations on food and safety, health and safety standards, rules on GMO\u2019s, environmental protection, consumer protection, etc\u2026). \n\n\n\nCETA also includes chapters on Trade and Sustainable Development, Trade and Labour and Trade and Environment, which link the trade agreement to the EU\u2019s overall objectives in sustainable development and specific objectives in the area of labour, environment, and climate change.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, like in all its other trade agreements, in CETA the EU fully safeguards public services. EU Member States will be able to run public monopolies for a particular service if they wish to. CETA will not force or incite governments to privatise or deregulate public services like water supply, health, social services or education. EU Member States will continue to be able to decide which services they wish to keep universal and public and to subsidise them if they want to. In addition, nothing in CETA will stop a government in a EU Member State to reverse in the future at any time any autonomous decision it may have taken to privatise these sectors. \n\n\nCETA ensures that Governments\u2019 right to regulate for public policies is fully preserved. In addition, any decision of the CETA Joint Committee has to be approved by each Party, and therefore subject to the EU\u2019s applicable internal requirements and procedures.\n\n\nThe Regulatory Cooperation Forum within CETA will function as a voluntary cooperation mechanism to exchange experiences and relevant information among regulators, and to help identify areas where regulators could cooperate. It will not be able to change existing regulations or develop new legislation. The Regulatory Cooperation Forum will only provide assistance and make suggestions to regulators and legislators. It will in no way restrict the decision-making power of regulators in the EU's Member States or at EU level.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n\nCETA has identical objectives and essentially the same contents as the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore (EUSFTA). Therefore, the Union's competence is the same in both cases. In view of the doubts raised with regard to the extent and the nature of the Union's competence to conclude EUSFTA, in July 2015 the Commission requested from the Court of Justice an opinion under Article 218(11) TFEU (case A \u2013 2/15). In case A -2/15 the Commission has expressed the view that the Union has exclusive competence to conclude EUSFTA alone and, in the alternative, that it has at least shared competence in those areas where the Union's competence is not exclusive. Many Member States, however, have expressed a different opinion.  In view of this, and in order not to delay the signature of the Agreement, the Commission has decided to propose the signature of the Agreement as a mixed agreement. Nevertheless, this is without prejudice to the views expressed by the Commission in Case A \u2013 2/15.  Once the Court issues its opinion in case A-2/15, it will be necessary to draw the appropriate conclusions.\n\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3 of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. The Commission takes the view that other matters falling outside of the common commercial policy covered under this Agreement fall under the EU's exclusive competence. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThis proposal is in line with the vision of Europe 2020 strategy and contributes to the Union's trade and development objectives. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nThis proposal is in accordance with Article 218(5) TFEU, which envisages the adoption by the Council of decisions on international agreements. There exists no other legal instrument that could be used in order to achieve the objective expressed in this proposal. \n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nPrior to the start of the negotiations with Canada, the EU and Canada decided in 2007 to jointly undertake a study to examine and assess the costs and benefits of a closer economic partnership.\u00a0In the context of this joint study\n1\n, the European Commission and Canada carried out two stakeholder consultations. The European Commission undertook a web-based civil society consultation in February and March 2008 on the basis of a questionnaire covering various aspects of the EU-Canada trade and investment relationship. In March and April 2008 Canada distributed a similar questionnaire among the members of its domestic steering committee.\n\n\nA high proportion of the respondents expressed the view that, despite the robustness of the existing trade and investment relationship between the EU and Canada, there were still many obstacles and therefore much potential to improve the bilateral relationship.\n\n\nThere was a general consensus among EU respondents that enhanced economic cooperation between Canada and the EU was desirable.\n\n\nThere appeared to be a particular emphasis on the need to remove tariff peaks and onerous non-tariff barriers to trade as well as a strong request for enhanced regulatory cooperation. \n\n\nIn addition, during the CETA negotiations, a range of consultation methods were used in the context of the Sustainability Impact Assessment\n2\n. This included amongst others civil society meetings, a stakeholder workshop, and a project website with a discussion forum.\u00a0The civil society meetings took place in Brussels and Ottawa and were attended by broad section of different interest groups and unions. The stakeholder workshop in Ottawa included participants from industry and trade associations, labour organisations, public workers\u2019 unions and unions for workers in private sector, environmental organisations, etc. Several academic and institute-based experts also provided helpful comments on the SIA.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nA Joint EU-Canada study was produced with the assistance of Professor Walid Hejazi (Rotman Business School, University of Toronto) for the drafting of this study and Professor Joe Francois (University of Linz) for the economic modelling part of the study.\n\n\nThe CETA Sustainability Impact Assessment has been carried out by the external contractor \u201cDevelopment Solutions\u201d.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nIn October 2008, the EU and Canada released their joint study \"Assessing the Costs and Benefits of a Closer EU-Canada Economic Partnership\". At the time the study indicated that the liberalisation of trade in goods and services will bring benefits both to the EU and to Canada. The full report is available on the DG TRADE website: \n\n\n\nhttp://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2008/october/tradoc_141032.pdf\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA), carried out during the negotiation, provides a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of trade liberalisation under the Agreement. The analysis assesses the economic, social and environmental impacts in Canada and the European Union across three main sectors, sixteen sub-sectors and seven cross-cutting issues. It also assesses the potential impacts of CETA on the U.S., Mexico and other countries and regions, including a number of developing countries as well as the EU Overseas Customs and Territories of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Greenland. The terms of reference, interim report, and the final report are available on the DG TRADE website:\n\n\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/policy-making/analysis/sustainability-impact-assessments/assessments/#study-geo-14\n\n\n\nThe EU and Canada have reached an ambitious agreement which will open new opportunities for trade and investment on both sides of the Atlantic and support jobs in Europe. CETA will remove customs duties, end limitations on access to public contracts, open up services' market, offer predictable conditions for investors and, last but not least, help prevent illegal copying of EU innovations and traditional products. The agreement also contains all the guarantees to make sure that the economic gains do not come at the expense of fundamental rights, social standards, governments' right to regulate, environment protection or consumers' health and safety. \n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nCETA is not subject to REFIT procedures; nevertheless it does have some special provisions for SMEs (for example potentially reducing the cost of litigation under the Investment Court System for claimants who are SMEs).\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal does not affect the protection of fundamental rights in the Union.\n\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe impact of this agreement for the EU budget will be twofold:\n\n\nOn the INCOME: it is estimated that foregone duty will reach an amount of \u20ac 311 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after seven years, as 97,7 % of the EU tariffs lines will be eliminated at the entry into force of the agreement and then an additional 1% gradually within 3, 5 or 7 years. The amount of \u20ac 311 million corresponds to the 80 % of estimated duties collected by EU Member States on imported Canadian products on the basis of 2015 data. The estimate takes into account the new Own Resources Decision, which lowers the collecting costs that Member States retain, from 25% to 20%.\n\n\nOn the EXPENDITURE: the CETA will be the first to incorporate the new Investment Court System (ICS) in the context of the Investment Dispute Resolution System. Accordingly, an amount of \u20ac 0,5 million of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2017 onwards (subject to ratification) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the proposal entails the use of administrative resources under budget line XX 01 01 01 (Expenditure related to officials and temporary staff working with the Institution), since it is estimated that one Administrator will be dedicated as FTE to the tasks inherent to this agreement. This is indicated in the Legislative Financial Statement and is subject to the conditions mentioned in it.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nThe administrative and institutional chapter establishes a CETA Joint Committee that will continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of this agreement. The CETA Joint Committee is comprised of representatives of the European Union and representatives of Canada who will meet once a year or at the request of a Party and will supervise the work of all specialised committees and other bodies established under this Agreement. \n\n\n\uf0b7It is important to note that the CETA Joint Committee is not an independent body and shall make its decisions and recommendations only by agreement between the EU and Canada. It\u00a0will in no way restrict the decision-making power of regulators in the EU's Member States or at EU level, or of their authorising institutions.\n\n\n\uf0b7The EU and Canada may, through the CETA Joint Committee, decide to amend the Annexes. When the Parties approve such a decision, it has to be subject to their respective applicable internal requirements and procedures. The EU therefore decides whether or not to agree to a decision of the Joint Committee by following the EU internal procedures as stipulated in the EU Treaty. The CETA Joint Committee can therefore not act without a decision of the EU institutions, taken according to the EU\u2019s internal legal process.\n\n\n\uf0b7The possibility of Joint Committees adopting certain amendments is a common feature of all international agreements, including EU trade agreements.\n\n\n\uf0b7As a special procedure, as stated in Article 30.2, the CETA Joint Committee cannot decide to amend a specific list of annexes for which the full amendment procedure will be needed. This list includes: Chapter 8 - Investment, Chapter 9 - Cross-Border Trade in Services, Chapter 10 - Temporary Entry and Stay of Natural Persons for Business Purposes, and Chapter 13 - Financial Services (with the exception for Annex 10-A List of Contact Points of the Member States of the European Union).\n\n\nThe following specialised committees will be established under the auspices of the CETA Joint Committee: \n\n\n\u2013the Committee on Trade in Goods, which addresses matters concerning trade in goods, tariffs, technical barriers to trade, the Protocol on the mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment and intellectual property rights related to goods. The Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Wines and Spirits, and the Joint Sectoral Group on Pharmaceuticals shall also be established under and report to the Committee on Trade in Goods.\n\n\n\u2013the Committee on Services and Investment, which addresses matters concerning cross-border trade in services, investment, temporary entry, electronic commerce, and intellectual property rights related to services. \n\n\n\u2013the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee (JCCC), established under the 1998 Agreement between the European Community and Canada on Customs Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in Customs Matters, which addresses matters under this Agreement concerning rules of origin, origin procedures, customs and trade facilitation, border measures and temporary suspension of preferential tariff treatment;\n\n\n\u2013the Joint Management Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, which addresses matters concerning sanitary and phytosanitary measures;\n\n\n\u2013the Committee on Government Procurement, which addresses matters concerning government procurement;\n\n\n\u2013the Financial Services Committee, which addresses matters concerning financial services;\n\n\n\n\n\u2013the Committee on Trade and Sustainable Development, which addresses matters concerning sustainable development;\n\n\n\u2013the Regulatory Cooperation Forum, which addresses matters concerning regulatory cooperation; and\n\n\n\u2013the CETA Committee on Geographical Indications, which addresses matters concerning geographical indications.\n\n\nTo the extent that any of such specialised Committee has any decision-making power under CETA, those decisions will be taken in the same manner as those of the Joint Committee.\n\n\n\u2022Implementation in the EU\n\n\nCertain actions will need to be taken in order to ensure implementation of the Agreement. These will be put in place in time for the application of the Agreement. These are a Commission implementing regulation to be adopted pursuant to Article 58(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code opening the tariff rate quotas provided for by the Agreement. \n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\nCETA is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement which contains provisions on national treatment and market access for goods, trade remedies, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs and trade facilitation, subsidies, investment, cross-border trade in services, temporary entry and stay of natural persons for business purposes, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, domestic regulation, financial services, international maritime transport services, telecommunications, electronic commerce, competition policy, state enterprises, monopolies, and enterprises granted special rights or privileges, government procurement, intellectual property, regulatory cooperation, trade and sustainable development, trade and labour, trade and environment, bilateral dialogues and cooperation,\u00a0administrative and institutional provisions, transparency and dispute settlement.\n\n\nCETA will significantly improve business opportunities for European companies in Canada. With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU companies. \n\n\nBy opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs in the EU and bring further benefits for European consumers. It has the potential to keep prices down and provide consumers with greater choice of quality products. CETA will not change EU standards.\u00a0Standards and regulations related to food safety, product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, social or labour standards etc. will remain untouched.\u00a0All imports from Canada will have to satisfy all EU product rules and regulations \u2013 without exception. \n\n\nMore specifically CETA will offer:\n\n\nSavings on customs duties\n\n\nCETA will bring tangible benefits to European consumers and companies by eliminating or cutting customs duties\u2013 some of the most far reaching cuts achieved by the EU in a trade agreement. This will provide important market opportunities for European companies including SMEs. Importantly, most customs duties will be removed as soon as CETA comes into effect. Cutting customs duties will not lower or change EU standards. Canadian imports will have to respect EU regulations.\n\n\nOpportunities for service suppliers and transparent and effective investment protection and dispute settlement mechanisms\n\n\nCETA is by far the most far reaching agreement ever concluded by EU in the area of services and investment. European firms will have more opportunities to provide specialised maritime transport services like dredging, moving empty containers, and shipping of certain cargo within Canada. European firms will also have new advantages when it comes to getting investment projects approved in Canada, protecting their investments and enforcing their rights in case of unfair treatment through a balanced and effective dispute settlement system. For all services sectors, such as environmental services, telecom and finance, market access is ensured, both at federal level and - for the first time \u2013 provincial level.\u00a0In CETA \u2013 as in all its trade agreements \u2013 the EU protects public services. Again, Canadian investors and service providers will have to respect applicable EU regulations.\n\n\nInvestment protection and investment dispute settlement\n\n\nCETA includes all the innovations of the EU's new approach on investment and its dispute settlement mechanism, thus meeting the expectations of stakeholders for a fairer, more transparent and institutionalised system for the settlement of investment disputes. It introduces important innovations in this field, ensuring a high level of protection for investors, while fully preserving the right of governments to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as the protection of health, safety or the environment. CETA represents a significant break with the traditional approach to investment protection and settlement of investment disputes in most of the existing bilateral investment treaties worldwide. It removes ambiguities that made the old system open to abuses or excessive interpretations and creates an independent investment court system, consisting of a permanent tribunal and an appeal tribunal that will conduct dispute settlement proceedings in a transparent and impartial manner.\n\n\nMutual recognition of professional qualifications \n\n\n\n\nThe agreement provides a framework to facilitate the mutual recognition of qualifications in regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers. The relevant professional organisations in the EU and Canada now have a framework that sets out the conditions for the negotiation of mutual recognition agreements for their respective professions. These will then have to be confirmed and agreed by the EU and Canada.\n\n\nEasier transfers of company staff and other professionals between the EU and Canada\n\n\nCETA will make it easier for firms to move staff temporarily between the EU and Canada.\u00a0This will facilitate European companies' operations in Canada.\u00a0It will be also easier for providers of professional services to temporarily supply legal, accounting, architectural or similar services.\n\n\nImprove ability of European companies to provide after sales services\n\n\nCETA will make it easier for EU firms to export equipment, machinery and software by allowing firms to send maintenance engineers and other specialists to provide after-sales and related services. \n\n\nAccess to Canadian public tenders\n\n\nCanada has opened up its government tenders to EU companies to a greater extent than with any of its other trading partners. EU firms will be able to bid to provide goods and services not only at federal level but also to Canadian provinces and municipalities, the first non-Canadian firms to be able to do so. Canada\u2019s provincial procurement market is estimated to be double the size of its federal equivalent. \n\n\nAvoiding costs related to double testing\n\n\nThe EU and Canada have agreed to accept each other\u2019s conformity assessment certificates in areas such as electrical goods, electronic and radio equipment, toys, machinery or measuring equipment. This means that a conformity assessment body in the EU can test EU products for export to Canada according to Canadian rules and vice versa. This will avoid both sides doing the same test and could greatly reduce costs for companies and consumers alike. This is of particular benefit to smaller companies for whom paying twice for the same test can be prohibitive. While this falls short of how the EU operates within its borders, it is nevertheless a very big step forward in the EU's International agreements.\n\n\nBetter protection for EU innovation and creative works\n\n\nCETA will create a more level playing field between Canada and the EU on intellectual property rights. It will strengthen the protection of copyrights (alignment with EU rules on protection of technological measures and digital rights management as well as on the liability of internet service providers) and enforcement (namely by foreseeing the possibility of provisional measures and injunctions for intermediaries involved in infringing activities). It will improve how Canada\u2019s IPR system protects patents for EU pharmaceutical products. Canada also agreed to strengthen its border measures against counterfeit trademark goods, pirated copyright goods and counterfeit geographical indication goods. \n\n\nMarket advantage for producers of traditional European products\n\n\nMany medium-sized and smaller businesses trading in agricultural products will benefit from Canada agreeing to protect 143 geographical indications for high-quality European products, such as Roquefort cheese, balsamic vinegar from Modena or Dutch Gouda cheese and many others.\n\n\nCommitment to Sustainable Development\n\n\nIn CETA,\u00a0the EU and Canada affirm their commitment to sustainable development. Both agree that trade and investment should further environmental protection and labour rights \u2013 and not be at their expense. The EU and Canada are committed to CETA helping to ensure that economic growth, social development and environmental protection are mutually supportive. CETA integrates the EU\u2019s and Canada's obligations to international rules on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection, and gives a strong role to EU and Canadian civil society in participating in the implementation of the commitments in these areas in CETA. CETA also sets up a process for settling disputes, including government consultations and a panel of experts. \n\n\n2016/0206 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing on

With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU operators.

Substantive obligations in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute \"treatment\", and thus cannot give rise to a breach of this Article, absent measures adopted or maintained by a Party pursuant to those obligations.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.8\n\n\n\nSenior management and boards of directors\n\n\n\nA Party shall not require that an enterprise of that Party, that is also a covered investment, appoint to senior management or board of director positions, natural persons of any particular nationality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION D\n\n\nInvestment protection\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.9\n\n\n\n\nInvestment and regulatory measures\n\n\n\n1. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Chapter, the Parties reaffirm their right to regulate within their territories to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, the environment or public morals, social or consumer protection or the promotion and protection of cultural diversity.\n\n\n\n2. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party regulates, including through a modification to its laws, in a manner which negatively affects an investment or interferes with an investor\u2019s expectations, including its expectations of profits, does not amount to a breach of an obligation under this Section. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For greater certainty, a Party\u2019s decision not to issue, renew or maintain a subsidy: \n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the absence of any specific commitment under law or contract to issue, renew, or maintain that subsidy; or \n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in accordance with any terms or conditions attached to the issuance, renewal or maintenance of the subsidy, \n\n\n\ndoes not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section.\n\n\n\n4. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For greater certainty, nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing a Party from discontinuing the granting of a subsidy\n9\n or requesting its reimbursement where such measure is necessary in order to comply with international obligations between the Parties or has been ordered by a competent court, administrative tribunal or other competent authority\n10\n,\u00a0or requiring that Party to compensate the investor therefor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.10\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of investors and of covered investments\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Party shall accord in its territory to covered investments of the other Party and to investors with respect to their covered investments fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 7.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Party breaches the obligation of fair and equitable treatment referenced in paragraph 1 if a measure or series of measures constitutes:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings;\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0manifest arbitrariness;\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0abusive treatment of investors, such as coercion, duress and harassment; or\n\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a breach of any further elements of the fair and equitable treatment obligation adopted by the Parties in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties shall regularly, or upon request of a Party, review the content of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.

In order to ascertain whether the measure breaches this Article,  the Tribunal must consider whether a Party has acted inconsistently with the obligations in paragraph 1.\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.11\n\n\n\nCompensation for losses\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding Article 8.15.5(b), each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party, whose covered investments suffer losses owing to armed conflict, civil strife, a state of emergency or natural disaster in its territory, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own investors or to the investors of a third country, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.12\n\n\n\n\n\nExpropriation\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Party shall not nationalise or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation\u00a0(\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for a public purpose;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under due process of law;\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in a nondiscriminatory manner; and\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n\n\nFor greater certainty, this paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 8A.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 shall amount to the fair market value of the investment at the time immediately before the expropriation or the impending expropriation became known, whichever is earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The compensation shall also include interest at a normal commercial rate from the date of expropriation until the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the investor, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the investor and in the currency of the country of which the investor is a national or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the investor.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The affected investor shall have the right, under the law of the expropriating Party, to a prompt review of its claim and of the valuation of its investment, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licences granted in relation to intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement.\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For greater certainty, the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that these measures are consistent with the TRIPS Agreement and Chapter Twenty\u00a0(Intellectual Property), do not constitute expropriation. Moreover, a determination that these measures are inconsistent with the TRIPS Agreement or Chapter Twenty\u00a0(Intellectual Property) does not establish an expropriation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.13\n\n\n\nTransfers\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to a covered investment to be made without restriction or delay in a freely convertible currency and at the market rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.

These rights may be exercised by the Party or an agency of the Party, or by the investor if the Party or an agency of the Party thereof so authorises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION E\n\n\n\nReservations and exceptions\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.15\n\n\n\n\n\nReservations and exceptions\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 8.4 through 8.8 do not apply to:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an existing nonconforming measure that is maintained by a Party at the level of:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the European Union, as set out in its Schedule to Annex I;\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a national government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I;\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a provincial, territorial, or regional government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; or\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a local government;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the continuation or prompt renewal of a nonconforming measure referred to in subparagraph\u00a0(a); or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an amendment to a nonconforming measure referred to in subparagraph\u00a0(a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Articles 8.4 through 8.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 8.4 through 8.8 do not apply to a measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to a sector, subsector or activity, as set out in its Schedule to Annex II.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Articles 8.10 and 8.12, a Party shall not adopt a measure or series of measures after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and covered by its Schedule to Annex II, that require, directly or indirectly an investor of the other Party, by reason of nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at the time the measure or series of measures become effective.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of intellectual property rights, a Party may derogate from Articles 8.5.1(f), 8.6, and 8.7 if permitted by the TRIPS Agreement, including any amendments to the TRIPS Agreement in force for both Parties, and waivers to the TRIPS Agreement adopted pursuant to Article IX of the WTO Agreement.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 8.4, 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8 do not apply to:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0procurement by a Party of a good or service purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the supply of a good or service for commercial sale, whether or not that procurement is \"covered procurement\" within the meaning of Article 19.2\u00a0(Scope and coverage); or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0subsidies, or government support relating to trade in services, provided by a Party.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.16\n\n\n\nDenial of benefits\n\n\n\nA Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of that Party and to investments of that investor if:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an investor of a third country owns or controls the enterprise; and\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the denying Party adopts or maintains a measure with respect to the third country that:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0relates to the maintenance of international peace and security; and\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0prohibits transactions with the enterprise or would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 8.17\n\n\n\nFormal requirements\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding Articles 8.6 and 8.7, a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or its covered investment, to provide routine information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes, provided that those requests are reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

If the list has not been established under Article 13.20 on the date the claim is submitted pursuant to Article 8.23 (Submission of a claim to the Tribunal), the SecretaryGeneral of ICSID shall select the Members of the Tribunal from the individuals proposed by one or both of the Parties in accordance with Article 13.20.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The respondent may refer the matter in writing to the Financial Services Committee for a decision as to whether and, if so, to what extent the exception under Article 13.16.1 is a valid defence to the claim. This referral shall not be made later than the date the Tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its countermemorial. If the respondent refers the matter to the Financial Services Committee under this paragraph the periods of time or proceedings referred to in Section F of Chapter Eight\u00a0(Resolution of investment disputes between investors and states) are suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a referral under paragraph 3, the Financial Services Committee or the CETA Joint Committee, as the case may be, may make a joint determination as to whether and to what extent Article 13.16.1 is a valid defence to the claim. The Financial Services Committee or the CETA Joint Committee, as the case may be, shall transmit a copy of the joint determination to the investor and the Tribunal, if constituted. If the joint determination concludes that Article 13.16.1 is a valid defence to all parts of the claim in their entirety, the investor is deemed to have withdrawn its claim and the proceedings are discontinued in accordance with Article 8.35\u00a0(Discontinuance). If the joint determination concludes that Article 13.16.1 is a valid defence to only parts of the claim, the joint determination is binding on the Tribunal with respect to those parts of the claim. The suspension of the periods of time or proceedings described in paragraph 3 then no longer applies and the investor may proceed with the remaining parts of the claim.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the CETA Joint Committee has not made a joint determination within three months of referral of the matter by the Financial Services Committee, the suspension of the periods of time or proceedings referred to in paragraph 3 no longer applies and the investor may proceed with its claim.\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the request of the respondent, the Tribunal shall decide as a preliminary matter whether and to what extent Article 13.16.1 is a valid defence to the claim. Failure of the respondent to make that request is without prejudice to the right of the respondent to assert Article 13.16.1 as a defence in a later phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal shall draw no adverse inference from the fact that the Financial Services Committee or the CETA Joint Committee has not agreed on a joint determination in accordance with Annex13B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL MARITIME TRANSPORT SERVICES\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 14.1\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n\n\n\ncustoms clearance services or customs house brokers' services means the carrying out, on a fee or contract basis, of customs formalities concerning import, export or through transport of cargo, irrespective of whether these services are the main or secondary activity of the service provider;\n\n\n\n\n\ncontainer station and depot services means the storage, stuffing, stripping or repair of containers and making them available for shipment, whether in port areas or inland;\n\n\n\ndoortodoor or multimodal transport operation means the transport of cargo under a single transport document, that uses more than one mode of transport and involves an international sealeg;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfeeder services means the pre and onward transportation by sea of international cargo, including containerised, break bulk and dry or liquid bulk cargo,\u00a0between ports located in the territory of a Party.

More specifically, it must not impair or nullify the market access commitments negotiated by the Parties; it must be transparent, predictable, minimise transactional costs for traders, maximise fill rates and aim to avoid potential speculation.\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the import licensing system\n\n\n\n\nQuarterly subperiods with carryover between periods for unused tariff rate quota quantities\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In each of the four quarters of the marketing year, 25\u00a0per cent of the annual tariff rate quota quantity will be made available for licence applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any quantities remaining available at the end of one quarter will be automatically rolled over into the subsequent quarter until the end of the marketing year.\n\n\n\nApplication period for import licences\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An application for an import licence will be accepted up to 45 calendar days preceding the beginning of each quarter and an import licence shall be issued no less than 30 calendar days before the quarter begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If demand for licences during the application period exceeds the quantities available for that quarter, licences will be allocated on a prorated basis.\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the available quantity for any quarter is not fully allocated during the application period, the remaining quantity will be made available for eligible applicants to apply for on demand for the rest of that quarter.

More specifically, it must not impair or nullify the market access commitments negotiated by the Parties; it must be transparent, predictable, minimise transactional costs for traders, maximise fill rates and aim to avoid potential speculation.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The eligibility criteria and allocation method should result in the quotas going to those persons that are most likely to use it and must not create barriers to imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the import licensing system\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annual tariff rate quota quantity will be allocated each year among eligible applicants.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff rate quota allocation method will allow for new entrants each year. During the phasein period from Year 1 to Year 5, at least 30 per cent of the tariff rate quota will be available to new entrants every year. After the end of the phasein period from Year 6 and in subsequent years, at least 10 percent of the tariff rate quota quantity will be available for new entrants.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff rate quota quantity will be allocated on a calendar year basis. Applications from all interested parties will be received and processed according to the provisions of the Understanding on Tariff Rate Quota Administration Provisions of Agricultural Products, as defined in Article\u00a02 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Ministerial Decision WT/MIN(13)/39, 7\u00a0December\u00a02013, with a period of four to six weeks to submit applications. Imports will be able to start from the first day of the year.\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the tariff rate quota is not fully allocated following the application process in paragraph\u00a03, available quantities will immediately be offered to eligible applicants in proportion to their allocation, or on demand if quantities still remain after the first offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility criteria\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible, an applicant shall be, at a minimum, a resident of Canada and be active in the Canadian cheese sector regularly during the year.\n\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the phasein period from Year 1 to Year 5, a new entrant shall be an eligible applicant who is not an allocation holder under Canada's cheese tariff rate quota under the WTO.\n\n\n\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the end of the phasein period, from Year 6 and in subsequent years, a new entrant shall be an eligible applicant who is not an allocation holder under Canada's cheese tariff rate quota under the WTO or did not receive an allocation of the tariff rate quotas under this Agreement in the preceding year.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A new entrant shall be considered as such for a period of three years.\n\n\n\n11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once an applicant is no longer considered to be a new entrant, the applicant shall be treated the same as all other applicants.\n\n\n\n12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada may consider limiting the size of allocations to a specific percentage if it is deemed necessary to foster a competitive, fair, and balanced import environment.\n\n\n\nUse of import allocations and import permits\n\n\n\n13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tariff rate quota allocation shall be valid for one quota year or, if issued after the beginning of the quota year, for the remainder of the quota year.\n\n\n\n14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ensure that imports are aligned with domestic market conditions and to minimise barriers to trade, an allocation holder will normally be free to use its allocation to import any product covered by the tariff rate quota at any time during the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of its allocation, an importer will submit an import permit request for each shipment of product covered by the tariff rate quota that the importer seeks to import into Canada. Import permits are normally issued automatically upon request through the electronic permitting system of the Government of Canada. Under current policies, import permits may be requested up to 30 days before the planned date of entry and are valid for a period of five days before and 25 days from the date of entry.\n\n\n\n16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Permits are not transferable.\n\n\n\n17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An import permit may be amended or cancelled.\n\n\n\n18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A transfer of allocations may be authorised.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An allocation holder that uses less than 95 per cent of its allocation in any one year may be subject to an underutilisation penalty in the following year, in which it will receive an allocation that reflects the actual level of use of the previous allocation. An allocation holder affected by an underutilisation penalty will be advised prior to the final allocation of the tariff rate quota.\n\n\n\n20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An allocation holder may return an unused quantity of their allocation up to a specified date. Returned quantities will be considered used for the purpose of the application of the underutilisation penalty. Chronic returns may be penalised.\n\n\n\n21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Returned quantities will normally be made available to interested allocation holders who have not returned any unused quantity of their allocation the day after the return deadline. If quantities remain after that, they may be offered to other interested third parties.\n\n\n\n22.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The return deadline will be set at a date that is early enough to give sufficient time for use of the returned quantities, while being late enough to allow allocation holders to establish their import needs until the end of the year, possibly near the middle of the quota year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 4A\n\n\n\n\nCOOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF MOTOR VEHICLE REGULATIONS\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\nObjectives and purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties note the cooperation between Canada and the European Commission in the area of science and technology.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties affirm their joint commitment to improve vehicle safety and environmental performance, and to the harmonisation efforts pursued under the framework of the 1998 Global Agreement administered by the World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) (the \"1998 Global Agreement\") of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"UNECE\").\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties note their commitment to enhance their efforts in the area of regulatory cooperation under this Chapter and Chapter TwentyOne (Regulatory Cooperation).\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties recognise the right of each Party to determine its desired level of health, safety, and environmental and consumer protection.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties desire to enhance cooperation and to increase the efficient use of resources in matters that relate to motor vehicle technical regulations, in a manner that does not compromise each Party's ability to fulfill its responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of this Annex is to strengthen cooperation and communication, including the exchange of information, on motor vehicle safety and environmental performance research activities related to the development of new technical regulations or related standards, to promote the application and recognition of the Global Technical Regulations under the framework of the 1998 Global Agreement and possible future harmonisation, between the Parties, concerning improvements and other developments in the areas of motor vehicle technical regulations or related standards.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n\nAreas of cooperation\n\n\n\nThe Parties shall endeavour to share information and cooperate on activities in the following areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development and establishment of technical regulations or related standards;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the postimplementation reviews of technical regulations or related standards;\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development and dissemination of information for consumer use related to motor vehicle regulations or related standards;\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the exchange of research, information and results linked to the development of new vehicle safety regulations or related standards, and advanced emission reduction and electric vehicle technologies; and\n\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the exchange of available information on the identification of safetyrelated or emissionrelated defects and noncompliance with technical regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n\nForms of cooperation\n\n\n\nThe Parties shall endeavour to maintain an open and ongoing dialogue in the area of motor vehicle technical regulations or related standards.

Before introducing such changes, Canada shall inform the European Union and, upon request, shall be prepared to provide information on the rationale for these changes. Canada shall continue to recognise the relevant United Nations Regulations, unless doing so would provide for a lower level of safety than the amendments introduced, or would compromise North American integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties shall engage in technical consultations with a view to determining, no later than three years after the entry into force of this Agreement, whether the technical regulations contained in the United Nations Regulations listed in Annex 4A2 should also be incorporated into Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations, with any adaptations Canada considers necessary. These technical regulations should be incorporated, unless doing so would provide for a lower level of safety than the Canadian regulations or would compromise North American integration.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties shall also engage in further technical consultations to determine whether other technical regulations should be included in Annex 4A2.\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada shall establish and maintain a list of technical regulations contained in United Nations Regulations that are incorporated into Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations.

For greater certainty, this exclusion is without prejudice to the right of a Party to have recourse to Chapter TwentyNine (Dispute Settlement) with respect to the consistency of a measure with a Party's reservations, as set out in the Party's Schedule to Annexes\u00a0I, II or\u00a0III, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 8D\n\n\n\n\nJoint Declaration concerning Article 8.12.6\n\n\n\nMindful that the Tribunal for the resolution of investment disputes between investors and states\u00a0is meant to enforce the obligations referred to in Article 8.18.1, and is not an appeal mechanism for the decisions of domestic courts, the Parties recall that the domestic courts of each Party are responsible for the determination of the existence and validity of intellectual property rights. The Parties further recognise that each Party shall be free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of this Agreement regarding intellectual property within their own legal system and practice.\u00a0The Parties agree to review the relation between intellectual property rights and investment disciplines within three years after entry into force of this Agreement or at the request of a Party.\u00a0Further to this review and to the extent required, the Parties may issue binding interpretations to ensure the proper interpretation of the scope of investment protection under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 8.31.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 8E\n\n\n\n\nJoint Declaration on Articles 8.16, 9.8, and 28.6\n\n\n\nWith respect to Articles 8.16, 9.8 (Denial of benefits) and 28.6 (National security), the Parties confirm their understanding that measures that are \"related to the maintenance of international peace and security\" include the protection of human rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 8F\n\n\n\n\nDeclaration by Canada on the Investment Canada Act\n\n\n\nCanada will increase the threshold for review under the Investment Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.\u00a028 (1st\u00a0Supp.) (\"ICA\") to CAD $1.5 billion once this Agreement is implemented.\n\n\n\nAny future amendments to the ICA would be subject to the requirement that such amendments could not decrease the conformity of the ICA with the investment obligations of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nAs set out in Canada's ICA reservation (Annex I-C-1), the higher threshold will apply to an acquisition of a Canadian enterprise by an investor of the European Union that is not a state enterprise. The determination of whether the acquirer is an investor of the European Union would be based on whether a national of the European Union controls the acquirer in law, or in the absence of a majority ownership, whether nationals of the European Union control the acquirer in fact such as through the ownership of voting interests or through the nationality of members of the board of directors. Moreover, enterprises of the European Union that are controlled by nationals from Canada's existing Free Trade Agreement partners with which Canada has taken investment commitments would also benefit from the higher threshold.\n\n\n\nCanada will amend its ICA to provide for the changes necessary for the higher review threshold stated above upon the entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 9A\n\n\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING ON NATIONAL TREATMENT \nWITH RESPECT TO THE CROSSBORDER SUPPLY OF SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU Party and Canada share the following understanding with respect to the application of Article 9.3 to treatment accorded by a provincial or territorial government in Canada, or by a government of or in a Member State of the European Union with respect to the cross-border supply of services as defined in Article 9.1 or the supply of a service by a natural person of a Party in the territory of the other Party.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article 9.3, treatment \"no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like situations, by that government to its own service suppliers and services\" does not apply to a person of the other Party, or to a service supplied by this person if:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the case of Canada, a provincial or territorial government of Canada accords more favourable treatment to a service supplier which is a person of another provincial or territorial government of Canada, or to a service supplied by this supplier; and\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the case of the EU Party:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a government of a Member\u00a0State of the European Union accords more favourable treatment to a service supplier which is a person of another Member\u00a0State or to a service supplied by this supplier;\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a regional government of a Member\u00a0State of the European Union accords more favourable treatment to a service supplier which is a person of another regional government of that Member\u00a0State, or to a service supplied by this supplier; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the more favourable treatment referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) is accorded pursuant to specific mutual rights and obligations applicable between these governments.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the EU Party, paragraph 2 includes in particular treatment accorded pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, done at Lisbon on 13\u00a0December\u00a02007 in respect of the free movement of persons and services, as well as to treatment accorded by any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty.

with respect to regulated professions. These guidelines are nonbinding and they do not modify or affect the rights and obligations of a Party under this Agreement.\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n\n\n\nadaptation period means a period of supervised practice, possibly accompanied by further training, of a regulated profession in the host jurisdiction under the responsibility of a qualified person. This period of supervised practice shall be subject to an assessment. The detailed rules governing the adaptation period, its assessment and the professional status of the person under supervision shall be set out, as appropriate, in the host jurisdiction's law;\n\n\n\naptitude test means a test limited to the professional knowledge of applicants, made by the relevant authorities of the host jurisdiction with the aim of assessing the ability of applicants to pursue a regulated profession in that jurisdiction; and\n\n\n\nscope of practice means an activity or group of activities covered by a regulated profession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm and Content of the MRA\n\n\n\nThis Section sets out various issues that may be addressed in a negotiation and, if so agreed, included in final MRAs. It outlines elements that might be required of foreign professionals seeking to benefit from an MRA.\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Participants\n\n\n\nThe parties to the MRA should be clearly stated.\n\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the MRA\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the MRA should be clearly stated.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope of the MRA\n\n\n\nThe MRA should set out clearly:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the scope of the MRA, in terms of the specific professional titles and activities which it covers;\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0who is entitled to use the professional titles concerned;\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether the recognition mechanism is based on formal qualifications, a licence obtained in the jurisdiction of origin, or on some other requirement; and\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether the MRA allows temporary or permanent access to the profession concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mutual Recognition Provisions\n\n\n\nThe MRA should clearly specify the conditions to be met for the recognition of qualifications in each jurisdiction and the level of equivalence agreed.\n\n\n\nThe following fourstep process should be considered to simplify and facilitate the recognition of the qualifications.\n\n\n\nFourStep Process for the Recognition of Qualifications\n\n\n\nStep One: Verification of Equivalency\n\n\n\nThe negotiating entities should verify the overall equivalence of the scopes of practice or qualifications of the regulated profession in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nThe examination of qualifications should include the collection of all relevant information pertaining to the scope of practice rights related to a legal competency to practice or to the qualifications required for a specific regulated profession in the respective jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, the negotiating entities should:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identify activities or groups of activities covered by the scope of practice rights of the regulated profession; and\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identify the qualifications required in each jurisdiction. These may include the following elements:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the minimum level of education required, for example, entry requirements, length of study and subjects studied;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the minimum level of experience required, for example, location, length and conditions of practical training or supervised professional practice prior to licensing, or the framework of ethical and disciplinary standards;\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0examinations passed, especially examinations of professional competency;\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the extent to which qualifications from one jurisdiction are recognised in the other jurisdiction; and\n\n\n\n(v)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the qualifications which the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction are prepared to recognise, for instance, by listing particular diplomas or certificates issued, or by reference to particular minimum requirements to be certified by the relevant authorities of the jurisdiction of origin, including whether the possession of a certain level of qualification would allow recognition for some activities of the scope of practice but not others (level and length of education, major educational focuses, overall subjects and areas).\n\n\n\nThere is an overall equivalence between the scope of practice rights or the qualifications of the regulated profession if there are no substantial differences in this regard between jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Two: Evaluation of Substantial Differences\n\n\n\nThere exists a substantial difference\u00a0in the scope of qualifications required to practice a regulated profession, in cases of:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0important differences in the essential knowledge; or\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0significant differences in the duration or content of the training between the jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere exists a substantial difference in the scope of practice if:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0one or more professional activities do not form part of the corresponding profession in the jurisdiction of origin;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0these activities are subject to specific training in the host jurisdiction; and,\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the training for these activities in the host jurisdiction covers substantially different matters from those covered by the applicant's qualification.\n\n\n\nStep Three: Compensatory Measures\n\n\n\nIf the negotiating entities determine that there is a substantial difference in the scope of practice rights or of qualifications between the jurisdictions, they may determine compensatory measures to bridge the gap.\n\n\n\n\n\nA compensatory measure may take the form of, among other things, an adaptation period or, if required, an aptitude test.\n\n\n\nCompensatory measures should be proportionate to the substantial difference which they seek to address.

Each Party shall present its position to the Financial Services Committee within 60 days of the referral to the Financial Services Committee.\n\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the nondisputing Party notifies the Financial Services Committee within the 60 day period in paragraph 2 that it has launched an internal determination process on this matter, the period of time referred to in paragraph 2 is suspended until that Party notifies the Financial Services Committee of its position. A suspension beyond six months is considered as a breach of the good faith undertaking.\n\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the respondent does not provide its position to the Financial Services Committee within the period of time referred to in paragraph 2, the suspension of the periods of time or proceedings referred to in Article 13.21.3 no longer applies and the investor may proceed with its claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Financial Services Committee is unable to adopt a decision on a joint determination within 60 days in relation to a specific investorstate dispute concerning a prudential measure, the Financial Services Committee shall refer the matter to the CETA Joint Committee\n13\n. This period of 60 days commences from the moment the Financial Services Committee receives the positions of the Parties pursuant to paragraph 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The joint determination of the Financial Services Committee or of the CETA Joint Committee is binding on the Tribunal only in the dispute in question. The joint determination does not constitute a binding precedent for the Parties with respect to the scope and application of the prudential carveout or other terms of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless the CETA Joint Committee decides otherwise, if the CETA Joint Committee does not reach an agreement within three months of a referral of the matter by the Financial Services Committee pursuant to paragraph 5, each Party shall make its position available to the Tribunal that arbitrates the dispute in question. The Tribunal shall take into account this record in reaching a decision.\n\n\n\nHigh level principles\n\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties agree that the application of Article\u00a013.16.1 by the Parties and by tribunals should be guided by the following principles, which are not exhaustive:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Party may determine its own appropriate level of prudential regulation. Specifically, a Party may establish and enforce measures that provide a higher level of prudential protection than those set out in common international prudential commitments;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0relevant considerations in determining whether a measure meets the requirements of Article\u00a013.16.1 include the extent to which a measure may be required by the urgency of the situation and the information available to the Party at the time when the measure was adopted;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0given the highly specialised nature of prudential regulation, those applying these principles shall defer to the highest degree possible to regulations and practices in the Parties' respective jurisdictions and to the\u00a0decisions and factual determinations, including risk assessments, made by financial regulatory authorities;\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0except as provided in subparagraph (ii), a measure is deemed to meet the requirements of Article\u00a013.16.1 if it:\n\n\n\n(A)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has a prudential objective; and\n\n\n\n(B)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is not so severe in light of its purpose that it is manifestly disproportionate to the attainment of its objective; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a measure that otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) does not meet the requirements of Article 13.16.1 if it is a disguised restriction on foreign investment or an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investors in like situations;\n\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provided that a measure is not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investors in like situations, or a disguised restriction on foreign investment, that measure is deemed to meet the requirements of Article 13.16.1 if it is:\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in line with international prudential commitments that are common to the Parties;\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in pursuance of the resolution of a financial institution that is no longer viable or likely to be no longer viable;\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in pursuance of the recovery of a financial institution or the management of a financial institution under stress; or\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in pursuance of the preservation or the restoration of financial stability, in response to a systemwide financial crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic Review\n\n\n\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Financial Services Committee may, by consent of both Parties, amend this Understanding at any time. The Financial Services Committee should review this Understanding at least every two years.\n\n\n\nIn this context, the Financial Services Committee may develop a common understanding on the application of Article 13.16.1, on the basis of the dialogue and discussions held in the Committee in relation to specific disputes and mindful of international prudential commitments that are common to the Parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX 13C\n\n\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING ON THE DIALOGUE \nON THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR\n\n\n\nThe Parties reaffirm their commitment to strengthening financial stability. The dialogue on the regulation of the financial services sector within the Financial Services Committee shall be based on the principles and prudential standards agreed at the multilateral level. The Parties undertake to focus the discussion on issues with crossborder impact, such as crossborder trade in securities (including the possibility of taking further commitments on portfolio management), the respective frameworks for covered bonds and for collateral requirements in reinsurance, and to discuss issues related to the operation of branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nFor greater certainty, mere differences in treatment accorded by a Party to certain investors or investments on the basis of legitimate policy objectives in the context of a debt crisis or threat thereof, including those differences in treatment resulting from\u00a0eligibility for debt restructuring, do not amount to a breach of Article 8.6 or 8.7.\n\n\n\n(2)\nThis paragraph does not apply to UK reservations.\n\n\n\n(3)\nA reservation for legal services described in Annexes I or II by a Member State for 'domestic law' as covering 'EU and Member State law' applies to this Annex.\n\n\n\n(4)\nA reservation for legal services described in Annexes I or II by a Member State for 'domestic law' as covering 'EU and Member State law' applies to this Annex.\n\n\n\n(5)\nDoes not include legal advisory and legal representational services on tax matters, which are under legal advisory services in respect of public international law and foreign law.\n\n\n\n(6)\nPart of CPC 85201, which is under medical and dental services.\n\n\n\n(7)\nFor all Member States of the European Union except UK and DK, the approval of the research organisation and the hosting agreement must meet the conditions set pursuant to EU Directive\u00a02005/71/EC of 12\u00a0October\u00a02005.\n\n\n\n(8)\nFor all Member States of the European Union except the UK and DK, the approval of the research organisation and the hosting agreement must meet the conditions set pursuant to EU Directive 2005/71/EC of 12 October 2005.\n\n\n\n(9)\nMaintenance and repair services of office machinery and equipment including computers (CPC\u00a0845) are under computer services.\n\n\n\n(10)\nServices suppliers whose function is to accompany a tour group of a minimum of 10 natural persons, without acting as guides in specific locations.\n\n\n\n(11)\nThe abbreviations used in this Annex are defined in paragraph 8 of the Headnote to Annex I (Reservations for Existing Measures and Liberalisation Commitments).\n\n\n\n(12)\nThis means that once the European Commission has adopted the equivalence decision related to portfolio management and a Canadian financial institution has satisfied other European Union prudential requirements, this financial institution may provide discretionary portfolio management services to a European Union professional client without being established in the European Union. Furthermore, measures of Member\u00a0States of the European Union restricting or prohibiting crossborder portfolio management including reservations in its Schedules to Annexes\u00a0I and II shall no longer apply to this commitment.\n\n\n\n(13)\nEach Party shall ensure that its representation in the CETA Joint Commission for this purpose includes financial services authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop

participation, or the rules which govern it.\n\n\n\n(9)\nWhen, because of the date on which an affiliated undertaking was created or commenced activities, the turnover is not available for the

These notes must be read in conjunction with the productspecific rules of origin for the applicable section, chapter, heading, or subheading and may impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative to, the productspecific rules of origin.\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless otherwise specified, reference to weight in a productspecific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the weight of a material or a product not including the weight of packaging as set out in the definitions of \"net weight of nonoriginating material\" and \"net weight of the product\" in Article 1 (Definitions) of this Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A reference to nonoriginating sugar in a productspecific rule of origin means the nonoriginating material referred to in Article 16 (Sugar) of this Protocol. \n\n\n\n8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a productspecific rule of origin requires:\n\n\n\n(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a change from any other chapter, heading, or subheading, or a change to product x\n2\n from any other chapter, heading, or subheading, only nonoriginating material classified in a chapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product;\n\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a change from within a heading or subheading, or from within any one of these headings or subheadings, nonoriginating material classified within the heading or subheading may be used in the production of the product, as well as nonoriginating material classified in a chapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product;\n\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a change from any heading or subheading outside a group, only nonoriginating material classified outside the group of headings or subheadings may be used in the production of the product;\n\n\n\n(d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that a product is wholly obtained, the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). If a shipment consists of a number of identical products classified under tariff provision x, each product shall be considered separately;\n\n\n\n(e)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0production in which all the material of tariff provision x used is wholly obtained, all of the material of tariff provision x used in production of the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products); \n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a change from tariff provision x, whether or not there is also a change from any other chapter, heading or subheading, the value of any nonoriginating material that satisfies the change in tariff classification specified in the phrase commencing with the words \"whether or not\" is not considered when calculating the value of nonoriginating materials. If two or more productspecific rules of origin are applicable to a heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings, the change in tariff classification specified in this phrase reflects the change specified in the first rule of origin; \n\n\n\n(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the value of nonoriginating materials of tariff provision x does not exceed x\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the transaction value or exworks price of the product, only the value of the nonoriginating material specified in this rule of origin is considered when calculating the value of nonoriginating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of nonoriginating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance);\u00a0\n\n\n\n(h)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the value of nonoriginating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product does not exceed x\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the transaction value or exworks price of the product,\u00a0nonoriginating material classified in a tariff provision other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product. Only the value of the nonoriginating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product is considered when calculating the value of nonoriginating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of nonoriginating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance);\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the value of all nonoriginating materials does not exceed x\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the transaction value or exworks price of the product, the value of all nonoriginating materials is considered when calculating the value of nonoriginating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of nonoriginating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance); and \n\n\n\n\n(j)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the net weight of nonoriginating material of tariff provision x used in production does not exceed x\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the net weight of the product, the specified nonoriginating materials may be used in the production of the product, provided that it does not exceed the specified percentage of the net weight of the product in accordance with the definition of \"net weight of the product\" in Article 1. The percentage for the maximum weight of nonoriginating material as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance). \n\n\n\n9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The productspecific rule of origin represents the minimum amount of production required on nonoriginating material for the resulting product to achieve originating status. A greater amount of production than that required by the productspecific rule of origin for that product also confers originating status.\n\n\n\n10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a productspecific rule of origin provides that a specified nonoriginating material may not be used, or that the value or weight of a specified nonoriginating material cannot exceed a specific threshold, these conditions do not apply to nonoriginating material classified elsewhere in the Harmonized System.\n\n\n\n11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article 5 (Sufficient Production), when a material obtains originating status in the territory of a Party and this material is further used in the production of a product for which origin is being determined, no account will be taken of any nonoriginating material used in the production of that material. This applies whether or not the material has acquired originating status inside the same factory where the product is produced.\n\n\n\n12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The productspecific rules of origin set out in this Annex also apply to used products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmonized System classification\n\n\n\n\nProduct specific rule for sufficient production pursuant to Article 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection

This requirement also applies to enterprises, associations and other bodies, public or private institutions, foundations and charitable trusts that have no registered office in Denmark, and to foreign public authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther persons must apply to the Ministry of Justice for permission to purchase real estate property, which will be permitted if the applicant is going to use the real estate property as primary residence during the stay in Denmark or for selfemployment in Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase of real estate property which will be used as secondary residence or summer house for the applicant will be permitted only if the person concerned has particularly close relations or ties to Denmark. \n\n\nThe purchase of real estate property for enterprises, associations and other bodies, public or private institutions, foundations and charitable trusts that have no registered office in Denmark will be permitted where the acquisition is a prerequisite for the business activities of the purchaser. \n\n\nThe acquisition of agricultural land by private or legal persons is also governed by the Danish Act on Agricultural Real Estate (lov om landbrugsejendomme), which imposes restrictions on all persons, Danish or foreign, when acquiring agricultural property. Accordingly, any private or legal person, who wishes to acquire agricultural real estate, must fulfill the requirements in both laws.\n\n\nAn agricultural holding may be acquired by an individual, provided that the acquirer  or another person  takes permanent residence at the holding no later than six month following the acquisition. There is no limitation on citizenship.\n\n\nIf the acquirer is not a national of one of the Member States of the EU or the EEA, the acquirer must also\u00a0have a permit from the Ministry of Justice, unless the acquirer\u00a0actually lives in Denmark or formerly has lived in Denmark for at least five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector:\n\n\n\n\nBusiness services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubSector: \n\n\n\n\nLegal services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Classification:\n\n\n\n\nPart of CPC 861\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Reservation:\n\n\n\n\nNational treatment\n\n\nMarket access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of Government:\n\n\n\n\nNational\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures:\n\n\n\n\nLovbekendtg\u00f8relse nr. 1053 af 29.
