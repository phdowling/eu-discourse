"\nText\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 29.4.2016\nCOM(2016) 235 final\n2016/0124(NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nimplementing the Agreement concluded between  the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (COGECA), the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises (EUROP\u00caCHE) of 21 May 2012 as amended on 8 May 2013 concerning the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 of the International Labour Organisation\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n{SWD(2016) 143 final}{SWD(2016) 144 final}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM\n\n\n1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\u2022Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\n\n\n\nIn 2002, the ILO started discussions on a global scale on a complete and up-to-date set of international standards for the fishing sector, in order to guarantee proper protection for fishermen at global level. This resulted in the adoption of the Work in Fishing Convention in 2007\n1\n. So far, France is the only EU Member State to have ratified this Convention\n2\n. \n\n\nIn 2007, the Commission launched the first phase of consultation with EU social partners pursuant to Article 154 the Treaty on the  Functioning of the EU (TFEU), by which the latter were invited to \u2018examine the possibilities of a joint initiative to promote the application within the EU of the provisions of the recent ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007\u2019\n3\n. The General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (\u2018Cogeca\u2019), the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (\u2018ETF\u2019), and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union (\u2018Europ\u00eache\u2019) started negotiating in 2009. An Agreement was concluded on 21 May 2012, and later amended on 8 May 2013. On 10 May 2013, EU social partners requested the Commission to implement their Agreement through a Council decision in accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU.\n\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to implement the Agreement concerning the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007, of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), between Cogeca, ETF, and Europ\u00eache.\n\n\nWith this proposal, the Commission aims to improve the working and living conditions for fishermen working on vessels flying the flag of an EU Member State, by establishing a consolidated legal framework which is suited to working conditions for the sea fishing sector.\n\n\n\u2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThis initiative fits within the Commission\u2019s priority for a deeper and fairer single market, in particular its social dimension. It is in line with Commission\u2019s work to establish a fair and truly pan-European labour market, which provides workers with decent protection and sustainable jobs\n4\n. This includes occupational safety and health protection, working time, social protection, and rights connected to the employment contract.\n\n\nEU legal provisions relevant to fishermen\u2019s living and working conditions are laid down in a number of legal instruments, notably EU labour law directives and the EU occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation. For matters not covered by EU legislation, such as the right to medical treatment ashore, the right to repatriation and the medical certificate certifying the fitness for work of fishermen, EU Member States have introduced very different standards.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nThe ex post evaluation of the EU OSH acquis is ongoing and a number of key issues for the revision of EU legislation have not been defined yet, namely in relation to the new architecture and exact content of the provisions of the future EU OSH regulatory framework. During the preliminary work, stakeholders indicated the need to align the current OSH provisions for the maritime and fisheries sector with the recent ILO Conventions, such as the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007. It is clear that the Agreement complements the current EU OSH acquis and aligns it with the Convention. The future revision of the EU OSH framework will have to take the Agreement into account.\n\n\nThe EU also contributes to improving fishermen\u2019s living and working conditions through the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)\n5\n, which aims at ensuring that fishing and aquaculture activities contribute to long-term environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Indeed, healthy fish stocks in turn benefit fishermen. Managing resources in a sustainable manner will increase the competitiveness of the EU fisheries sector, creating new jobs.\n\n\nThe objectives of the CFP are also promoted internationally, ensuring that EU fishing activities outside EU waters are based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under EU law, and promoting a level\u2013playing field for EU operators and third country operators. To this end, the EU actively seeks to lead the process of strengthening the performance of regional and international fisheries organisations in order to better enable them to conserve and manage marine living resources under their purview, including combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\n6\n.\n\n\nPoor health and safety standards and poor working conditions are both a driver of IUU fishing and one of its consequences. On one hand, operators may choose to engage in IUU fishing because of the lower cost of limited health and safety checks and other controls over working conditions. On the other hand, workers on vessels engaged in IUU fishing are vulnerable to exploitation, as there is no way of ensuring decent working conditions on a vessel engaging in illegal activities. Improving the social situation of fishermen is expected to reduce the risk of abuses and increase the cost of engaging in IUU fishing, making it a less attractive option. Thorough implementation of ILO Conventions worldwide would therefore have a positive impact both on fishermen\u2019s working conditions and on the incidence of IUU fishing. By incorporating the Agreement of the social partners on the ILO Work in Fishing Convention in EU legislation, the EU will be in a stronger position to promote its implementation in partner countries worldwide.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 155(2) of the TFEU provides that \u2018Agreements concluded at Union level shall be implemented either in accordance with the procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters covered by Article 153, at the joint request of the signatory parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament shall be informed\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objective of the Agreement concluded by the Cogeca, ETF and Europ\u00eache is, in line with Article 153(1)(a) and (b) TFEU, to improve the working and living conditions of workers on board sea fishing vessels with regard to minimum requirements for work on board, conditions of service, accommodation and food, occupational safety and health protection and medical care. Article 155(2) therefore constitutes the proper legal basis for the Commission\u2019s proposal.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity\n\n\nThe need for EU action is justified by the fact that sea fishing is a cross-border sector which operates worldwide. Fishing vessels sail under different EU flags, they also operate outside the territorial waters of the EU Member State concerned, in waters under the jurisdiction of other Member States and in international waters. The EU distant-water fleet operates in international waters (high seas) and through bilateral agreements with countries outside the EU.\n\n\nDespite the Council Decision to authorise EU Member States to ratify the ILO Convention C188\n7\n, the ratification process has been very slow. Ratification by only some EU Member States would not ensure a similar level of decent living and working conditions within the EU for fishermen and a level playing field in terms of competitiveness between the EU Member States. It would lead to continuing different standards, in particular, on issues which are not yet included in EU legislation, such as medical certificates for fishermen, the right to repatriation, and medical treatment on shore. Different working conditions for fishermen within the EU would continue to exist. In addition, this would lead to different competitive positions between Member States which have ratified the Convention and those which have not. The proposed Directive builds on existing international and EU standards, taking into account the specific work environment in the sector. It ensures a similar level of decent living and working conditions and a level playing field in terms of competitiveness between the EU Member States by bringing about the simultaneous entry into force and uniform transposition in all EU Member States of the standards of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 to which it refers. It aligns the situation of fishermen with that of other maritime professions\n8\n. \n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nThe proposed Directive fulfils the requirement for proportionality because it takes a step forward to achieve the objectives set to improve the living and working conditions of workers and provide for a coherent legal framework which lays down minimum standards. It is strictly limited to the transposition into EU law of updated standards contained in the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007. The action is based on an Agreement concluded by employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives in the sector.\n\n\n\nIt leaves EU Member States the option of keeping or setting more favourable standards for workers and the flexibility to take into account specific features of their national situation. As a consequence, the proposal leaves room for flexibility as regards the choice of concrete implementing measures. \n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n\nThe instrument chosen is a directive. The term \u2018decision\u2019 in Article 155(2) TFEU is used in its general meaning in order to enable the legislative instrument to be selected in accordance with Article 288 of the TFEU. It is up to the Commission to propose the most appropriate of the three binding instruments referred to in that Article (a regulation, directive or decision).\n\n\nArticle 296 of the TFEU states that: \u2018where the Treaties do not specify the type of act to be adopted, the institutions shall select it on a case-by-case basis, in compliance with the applicable procedures and with the principle of proportionality.\u2019\n\n\nIn this instance, given the type and content of the social partners\u2019 Agreement, it is clear that it is best applied through provisions to be transposed by the Member States and/or the social partners into the Member States\u2019 national law. The most suitable instrument is therefore a Council directive. The Commission also considers that the Agreement should not be incorporated into but annexed to the proposal.\n\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nArticle 155(1) of the TFEU provides for the social partners at EU level to enter into contractual relations, including agreements, if they want to. The TFEU does not require them to consult other parties beforehand. Given the transparency of the process and the role entrusted to the social partners by Article 155 TFEU, no additional public consultation has been carried out\n9\n.\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n\nAn external study was commissioned to support the cost and benefits assessment of the Agreement\n10\n. The consultants identified the relevant authorities and social partners in all Member States and asked for information on the national legislation on living and working conditions in the sea fishing sector and the potential impact they expect from implementing the Agreement.\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionate impact assessment\n\n\nAccording to the Better Regulation Guidelines\n11\n, and in order for the College of Commissioners to take an informed decision, the Commission services have prepared an proportionate impact assessment which also includes an assessment of the representativeness of the signatories and of the legality of the clauses of the Agreement vis-\u00e0-vis the EU legal framework.\n\n\n\uf0b7Representativeness of the EU social partners\n\n\n\n\nWhen assessing a request from EU social partners to implement their agreement in EU law according to Article 155 TFEU, the Commission looks at representativeness and mandate of the social partners for the area concerned by the agreement. This ensures that the request is in line with the provisions of the TFEU and that the agreement can count on broad support amongst those actually concerned.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 1 of Commission Decision 98/500/EC of 20 May 1998, social partners at the European level should fulfil the following criteria: \u2018(a) they shall relate to specific sectors or categories and be organised at European level; \n\n\n(b) they shall consist of organisations which are themselves an integral and recognized part of Member States\u2019 social partner structures and have the capacity to negotiate agreements, and which are representative of several Member States; and \n\n\n(c) they shall have adequate structures to ensure their effective participation in the work of the (Sectoral) Dialogue Committees\u2019.\n\n\nThese conditions should be fulfilled at the time when the Agreement was signed. At the moment of signature of the Agreement, Croatia was not yet a member of the EU. In order to assess the representativeness of the EU social partners, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) conducted a study in 2012.\n\n\nThe Agreement concerns working conditions in sea fisheries, which matches with the sectoral delimitations of the sea fisheries sectoral social dialogue Committee. Therefore, equivalence between the coverage of the Committee and of the Agreement is given. The social partners participating in the Committee are Europ\u00eache and Cogeca for the employers\u2019 and ETF for the workers\u2019.\n\n\nFor Europ\u00eache, the Eurofound representativeness study from 2012 identifies members in 11 EU Member States\n12\n. Two employers\u2019 organisations have an observer status (LV and LT).\n\n\nCogeca represents the general and specific interests of European agricultural, forestry, fisheries and agri-food cooperatives. It has members linked to sea fisheries in 11 Member States\n13\n. Considering the membership of both Cogeca and Europ\u00eache, it means that on the employers\u2019 side, altogether 16 Member States are represented in the committee.\n\n\nOn the workers\u2019 side, ETF has membership related to sea-fisheries in 11 Member States\n14\n. This leaves fishermen in 11 Member States\n15\n not represented. However, according to the employment figures for the sector, for most of these countries the numbers of employees are around a 1000 workers (in most of these Member States, employment is considerably lower). While Ireland, Greece, Romania and Sweden have more than 1\u00a0000 fishermen, a very large share of them are self-employed.\n\n\nIn conclusion, with the exception of Portugal and Romania, there are no Member States where employer organisations active in sea-fishing are not represented at European level, taking into account that the sector is relatively small in Romania. The eight Member States which make up 84\u00a0% of the sector in total employment terms and 87\u00a0% in terms of full-time equivalent are represented within the EU social dialogue. This leads to the conclusion that the social partners who have signed the Agreement are representative of the sector and can therefore request the Commission to implement it in accordance with Article 155 of the TFEU.\n\n\n\uf0b7Legality of the clauses\n\n\nThe Commission has examined the legality of the Agreement. It has scrutinised each clause and has not found any to be contrary to EU law. The obligations which would be imposed on the Member States do not arise directly from the Agreement between the social partners. Rather they would arise from its implementation by means of a Council decision, i.e. a directive. The scope and content of the Agreement remains within the fields listed in Article 153(1) of the TFEU. The extension of some provisions of the Agreement to the self-employed does not contradict Article 153(1)(a) as the ultimate objective is and enacting condition to extend provisions to the self-employed is to safeguard the health and safety of the workers on board the same vessel. This extension already exists in the current EU OSH acquis applicable to this sector. Article\u00a03(3) of the Agreement contains a non-regression clause, which safeguards the existing level of protection of workers. Article 4 of the Agreement states that it shall not affect any law, award or custom, or any agreement between fishing vessel owners and fishermen, which ensures more favourable conditions to fishermen than those provided for in the Agreement.\n\n\n\uf0b7Policy options and assessment of costs and benefits\n\n\nThe Commission can only accept or reject the signatory parties\u2019 request to implement the Agreement by legislative act. It cannot amend the text of the Agreement. It cannot ask the social partners at EU level to implement their Agreement autonomously, as this is the prerogative of the social partners according to Article 155(2) of the TFEU.\n\n\nTherefore, the Commission can only consider one policy option. The proportionate impact assessment accompanying the proposal assessed this policy option (i.e. the measures laid down in the Agreement), and compared it against the baseline (i.e. the option of no further EU action).\n\n\nThe results of the analysis show that, overall, no significant increase in costs is expected. The costs vary per Member State, depending on the degree to which their national legislation already complies already with the Agreement. Some costs will only occur once (e.g. costs related to the transposition of the Agreement into national legislation) and some will be recurrent (e.g. costs associated to the medical certificates which will need to be renewed periodically, costs for repatriation, etc.).\n\n\nFor Member States which already comply with most provisions of the Agreement, the costs will be limited. For Member States which will need to change some aspects of their national legislation concerning for example medical certification, right of repatriation and risk assessment, the costs per worker or per enterprise remain proportionate, overall, to the objective to be achieved. Overall, the costs for repatriation, medical certificates, and risk assessments are estimated between EUR 1.3 million and EUR\u00a08 million. Taking into account the sector\u2019s annual turnover of EUR 6.9 billion, the costs would amount to a maximum 0.11\u00a0% of the total turnover of the sector.\n\n\nThe Agreement will improve living and working conditions in the sea fishing sector concerning working time, minimum age, medical certification, risk assessment, accommodation, food and water on board, and medical treatment on board. It will also create a level playing field within the EU for the sector, by setting minimum standards across the EU.\n\n\nFor employers, a reduction in the incidence of occupational accidents, injuries, and diseases will lead to higher productivity, lower costs for compensation and a reduction in staff turnover. For workers it will lower the risk of accidents and/or diseases. This will reduce the risk of loss of earning capacity. Furthermore, it will enable them to stay longer in the sector. It will also increase the attractiveness of the sector for young and skilled workers.\n\n\nAs regards the national authorities, it will lead to lower social security  and healthcare costs. The overall benefits for workers, employers and national authorities are estimated between EUR 1.2 million and EUR\u00a019.7 million over a period of five years.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the comparison of the options and from the cost-benefit analysis, it can be concluded that the Agreement achieves the objectives set at reasonable cost overall and that implementing it through a directive is appropriate.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n\nNearly 90\u00a0% of businesses in the sea fishing sector are micro-businesses with only one vessel. Based on the data available, it can be assumed that a significant share of these are owner-operated vessels or vessels operated by a skipper with one or two other self-employed or employees on board. The Agreement does not apply to owner-operators as they are considered to be self-employed.\n\n\nDue to the specific structure of the sea fishing sector, the impact of the Agreement will mainly be on micro-businesses with employees or where self-employed work alongside employees. However, it is unlikely that their competitiveness will be negatively affected compared to the current situation. Setting minimum standards at EU level will contribute to a level playing field, and therefore improve the competitive position. Better working conditions will lead to improved production, less cost on compensation in case of occupational injury, illnesses or accidents and a reduced rate of staff turnover.\n\n\nIn addition, the Agreement includes the possibility for Member States to progressively implement the Agreement over a period of five years for certain categories of fishermen or vessels.\n\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nThe objectives of this proposal are in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the rights protected under Articles 20 (Equality before the law), 31 (Fair and just working conditions) and 32 (Prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work).\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU budget.\n\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of the Agreement on the follow-up and review by the signatories, the European Commission will, after consulting management and labour at European level, monitor the implementation of the Directive implementing the Agreement. The European Commission will evaluate the Directive five years after its entry into force.\n\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents\n\n\n\nMember States must send the Commission the national text transposing the Directive and a correlation table between those provisions and the Directive. The Directive covers many aspects of the living and working conditions of fishermen such as working time, minimum age, the content of the employment agreement, occupational safety and health, medical certificates for fishermen and manning requirements. Hence, the national legislation of Member States concerning matters covered by the proposal is normally contained in a number of different legislative texts (Labour Codes, health and safety legislation, sector-specific non-exhaustive provisions) which will require a systemic approach and interpretation.\n\n\nThe proposal also contains a number of elements not previously covered by EU legislation, such as medical certification, specific details on quality of food and water, and specific elements concerning the accommodation on board fishing vessels. Unambiguous information on the transposition of these new provisions and solutions is needed to ensure compliance with the minimum requirements established by the proposal. It will enable the Commission to ensure the implementation of the Directive\u2019s requirements, which are intended to protect workers\u2019 safety and health, to provide more flexibility for the undertakings and to foster fair competition between undertakings.\n\n\nThe estimated additional administrative burden of providing explanatory documents is not disproportionate (it is a one-off and should not require many organisations to be involved). The explanatory documents can be drafted more efficiently by the Member States.\n\n\nIn view of the above, it is suggested that the Member States undertake to notify the Commission of their transposition measures by providing one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of the Directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. \n\n\n\n\uf0b7European Economic Area\n\n\n\nThe proposed act is an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of the proposal is as follows:\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\nThis Article makes the Agreement between the social partners binding, which is the aim of a Council decision in accordance with Article 155(2) of the TFEU.\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nArticle 2 states that the Directive provides only for minimum requirements, leaving the Member States free to adopt measures which are more favourable to workers in the area concerned. Its aim is to explicitly ensure that acquired levels of protection for workers and only the most favourable standards of occupational protection apply.\n\n\n\nArticles 3 to 6\n\n\n\nArticles 3 to 6 contain the usual provisions on transposition into the Member States\u2019 national law, including the obligation to provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. Article 5 contains a reporting clause. The objective of Article 5 is to monitor the implementation and application of the Directive in the Member States, in relation to the living and working conditions in the sector and carry out an evaluation. Data regarding the number of accidents, occupational injuries and health problems in the sector will be examined in this context. \n\n\nArticle 6 refers to the date of entry into force of the Directive. Article 7 specifies the addressees.\n\n\n\nDetailed explanation of the provisions of the Annex to the proposal\n\n\nArticle 1 (Definitions)\n\n\nThe Agreement defines the meaning of the following terms for its purposes: a) fishing operations, b) commercial fishing, c) competent authority, d) consultation, e) fishing vessel owner or owner, f) fisherman, g) fisherman\u2019s work agreement, , h) fishing vessel or vessel, i) length, j) length between perpendiculars, k) skipper, l)\u00a0recruitment and placement services, and m) private employment agency. Paragraph 2 sets out the meaning of these terms for the purpose of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 2 (Scope)\n\n\nArticle 2 states that the Agreement applies to all fishermen employed on board of a fishing vessel engaged in commercial fishing operations, which is registered in or flying the flag of an EU Member State. The Agreement also applies to self-employed fishermen working alongside workers on the same vessel, in order to ensure the protection of the overall health and safety of the workers on the same vessel. This extension to the self-employed is in accordance with current EU legislation. Article 2(2) establishes  that in case of doubt as to whether a fishing vessel is engaged in commercial operations, this must be determined by the competent authority after consultation. Article 2(3) states that Member States may extend, after consultation, the protection provided in the Agreement to fishermen working on vessels of 24 metres and over to fishermen working on vessels of less than 24 metres in length.\n\n\nArticle 3 (Application of the Agreement)\n\n\n\n\nParagraph 1 establishes that a Member State may, on objective grounds, after consultation. exclude limited categories of fishermen or fishing vessels from the requirements of this Agreement or from certain of its provisions, if the application of the agreement raises substantial problems in the light of the specific conditions of service of the fishermen or of the fishing vessel\u2019s operations. Paragraph 2 states that in case of exclusion of certain categories of fishermen or fishing vessels under paragraph 1, the competent authority must extend progressively the Agreement to all categories of fishermen or fishing vessels within five years from the entry into force of the Agreement. Paragraph 3 contains a non-regression clause.\n\n\nArticle 4 (More favourable conditions clause)\n\n\nThis Article contains a clause on more favourable provisions whereby any law, award or custom ensuring more favourable conditions to the fishermen than those in the Agreement, must not be affected by the provisions of the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 5 (Responsibilities of fishing vessel owners, skippers and fishermen)\n\n\nArticle 5(1) states that it applies without prejudice to Directive 93/103/EC\n16\n. Paragraph 2 establishes the fishing vessel owner\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the skipper is provided with necessary resources and facilities to comply with the obligations of the Agreement. Article\u00a05(3) describes, in a non-exhaustive manner, the skipper\u2019s different responsibilities, in order for him to ensure the safety and health of the fishermen on board of the vessel. Article\u00a05(4) establishes that the skipper must not be constrained by the fishing vessel owner from taking decisions which are necessary for the safety of the fishermen, the vessel, and its safe navigation and operation. Article 5(5) establishes an obligation on the fishermen to comply with lawful orders of the skipper and with applicable safety and health measures.\n\n\nArticle 6 (Minimum age)\n\n\nArticle 6 applies without prejudice to Directive 94/33/EC\n17\n. According to paragraph 2 the minimum age for working on board a fishing vessel is 16 years on the condition that a young person is no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling under national legislation. Fifteen-year-olds engaged in vocational training in fishing are allowed to work on board fishing vessels under the same conditions.\n\n\nArticle 6(3) establishes that the competent authorities may authorise persons of the age of 15 years old to perform light work during school holidays. The competent authorities must, after consultation, determine the kinds of work permitted and the conditions in which such work is undertaken and the periods of rest required. Article 6(4) states that the minimum age is 18 years for activities on board the vessels which due to their nature or the circumstances in which they are carried out are likely to jeopardise health, safety, physical, mental or social development, education or morals of young people. Article 6(5) states that these activities must be determined by national law or regulation or by the competent authorities after consultation. Article 6(6) establishes that young people from that age may perform these activities provided their health, safety, physical, mental or social development, education or morals are fully protected and they received specific instruction or vocational training and completed pre-safety training.\n\n\nArticle 6(7) establishes a definition of \u2018night\u2019. It contains a prohibition of night work under the age of 18. An exception may be made by the competent authorities when effective training of fishermen would be otherwise impaired or the specific nature or a recognised training programme requires fishermen under the age of 18 to perform duties at night. The competent authority must determine, after consultation, that the night work will not have a detrimental impact on their health or well-being. Article 6(8) contains a clause on more favourable provisions.\n\n\nArticle 7-9 (Medical examination / medical certificate)\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nArticle 7(1) establishes the fishermen\u2019s obligation to have a valid medical certificate on board attesting to their fitness to perform their duties on board. Paragraph 2 states that exemptions to applying paragraph 1 may be granted, taking into account the safety and health of fishermen, size of the vessel, and availability of medical assistance, evacuation, duration of the voyage, area and type of fishing operation. Paragraph 3 states that these exemptions cannot be applied to fishermen working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over or which normally remain at sea for more than three days. The competent authority may grant an exemption to permit a fisherman to work for a limited and specified duration until a medical certificate can be obtained in urgent cases and only if the fisherman needs to be in possession of an expired medical certificate of recent date.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nArticle 8 states that Member States must adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing for the nature and the frequency of the medical examination and the form, content and validity of the medical certificates. They must also adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing for the right for another binding examination by an independent medical examiner, appointed as a referee, in case of refusal of a certificate, or receiving a certificate while the person has declared that he or she is unfit for work or being refused a certificate while the medical reasons for refusal are no longer applicable.\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nArticle 9 establishes additional minimum requirements vis-\u00e0-vis the medical certificate for fishermen working on board of a vessel of 24 metres and over or a vessel which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n\n\nArticle 10 (Manning)\n\n\nArticle 10 states that fishing vessel owners must ensure that fishing vessels are sufficiently and safely manned for the safe navigation and operation of the vessel and under the control of a competent skipper. No numerical limit is indicated. Paragraph 2 establishes more detailed requirements for vessels of 24 metres and over. Paragraph 3 gives the competent authority the possibility to establish alternative requirements for vessels of 24 metres and over. They must facilitate the general objectives and aim of this Article and Article 11 and fulfil the requirements of paragraph 2 and not jeopardise the occupational safety and health of fishermen.\n\n\nArticle 11 (Hours of work and hours of rest)\n\n\nArticle 11 establishes working hours and hours of rest for sea fishermen falling under the scope of this Agreement, providing for an average weekly working time of 48 hours  for a maximum reference period of 12 months. For the aforementioned fishermen Articles 3 to 6 inclusive, 8, and 21 of Directive 2003/88/EC\n18\n will not apply. For other fishermen Directive 2003/88/EC will continue to apply.\n\n\n\n\nParagraph 2 states that to protect the fishermen\u2019s health and safety and to limit fatigue, maximum number of working hours and minimum hours of rest within a given period need to be established, taking into account the limits set by paragraph 3 and 4. They can be established by law, administrative agreement or collective agreement. Paragraph 3 lays down a maximum working time and minimum hours of rest during any 24-hour period and the maximum working time during any seven-day period. Paragraph 4 sets limits on the division of periods of rest.\n\n\nParagraph 5 allows for exceptions to the maximum reference period, maximum working hours and minimum hours of rest for objective or technical reasons or reasons concerning the organisation of work. Such exceptions will need to comply as far as possible with the standards laid down and allow for more compensatory rest periods. They may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods or the granting of compensatory leave for the fishermen. Paragraph 6 states that if exceptions are made to the limits on working hours and hours of rest, fishermen must receive compensatory rest periods as soon as practicable.\n\n\nParagraph 7 states that in emergency situations, the skipper may require the worker to work additional hours necessary for the safety of persons, the catch or the vessel itself or to provide assistance to persons or vessels in distress until the normal situation is restored. The skipper must ensure that all fishermen who have worked during a scheduled rest period have an adequate compensatory rest, after the normal situation is restored.\n\n\nParagraph 8 establishes that EU Member States may provide that fishermen working on board fishing vessels, that by law are not allowed to operate during a period longer than a month, must take annual leave during that period.\n\n\nArticle 12 (Crew list)\n\n\nThis Article states that each fishing vessel needs to carry a crew list. The crew list needs to be communicated before departure or immediately after departure to authorised persons ashore. The competent authority will determine to who and when the crew list needs to be provided and for what purpose(s).\n\n\nFisherman\u2019s work agreement (Article 13-18)\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nArticle 13 establishes that the provisions in Articles 14-18 apply without prejudice to Directive 91/553/EEC\n19\n. \n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nThis Article states that each EU Member State must require in national law, regulations or other measures that fishermen who are employed on board a fishing vessel have a written work agreement that is comprehensible to them. The fisherman\u2019s work agreement must be in line with the provisions of the Agreement and in particular its Annex I which contains minimum standards on the content of the fisherman\u2019s work agreement.\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nEU Member States must adopt national laws, regulations or other measures to establish procedures to ensure (a) that the fisherman can ask advice on the content of his or her fisherman\u2019s work agreement, before it is concluded; (b) maintenance of records under an agreement, where applicable; and (c) dispute settlement mechanisms regarding the fisherman\u2019s work agreement.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\nThis Article establishes that the fisherman must receive a copy of the fisherman\u2019s work agreement. A copy must be given to other parties on request in accordance with national law and practice. A copy of the fisherman\u2019s work agreement must be carried on board the vessel and be available to the fishermen.\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nThis Article states that Article 14-16 and Annex I to this Agreement do not apply to fishing vessel owners who are single-handedly operating the vessel.\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nThis Article establishes the fishing vessel owner\u2019s responsibility for ensuring that each fisherman employed on board of the vessel, has a written fisherman\u2019s work agreement. This work agreement needs to be signed by all parties concerned, i.e. fisherman, employer and/or representatives or other parties concerned.\n\n\nArticle 19 (Repatriation)\n\n\n\n\nArticle 19(1) states that EU Member States must ensure a right to repatriation for fishermen working on vessels flying their flag or registered under their plenary jurisdiction and that enter a foreign port. A right to repatriation exists when the fisherman\u2019s work agreement has expired or has been terminated for justified reasons by one or more of the parties to that agreement, or the fisherman is no longer able to carry out the duties required under the fisherman\u2019s work agreement or cannot be expected to carry them out in the specific circumstances (e.g. occupational accidents, diseases, or injuries). The right of repatriation also applies to fishermen transferred from the vessel to the foreign port for the reasons mentioned above.\n\n\nArticle 19(2) establishes that the fishing vessel owner bears the costs for repatriation unless the fisherman is in serious default of his or her obligations under the fisherman\u2019s work agreement, according to national law, regulations, or other measures. According to Article\u00a019(3) EU Member States must prescribe the precise circumstances in which a fishermen is entitled to repatriation such as the maximum duration of service periods on board and the destinations to which fishermen may be repatriated.\n\n\nArticle 19(4) states that in case the fishing vessel owner fails to provide for repatriation, the Member State must arrange it. The Member State will be entitled to recover the costs from the fishing vessel owner. Paragraph 19(5) gives the fishing vessel owner the possibility to recover the costs under third party contractual arrangements.\n\n\nArticle 20 (Private market labour services)\n\n\nArticle 20(1) states that this Article applies without prejudice to Directive 2008/104/EC.\n20\n Article 20(2) clarifies that private market labour services for the purposes of this Article consist of recruitment and placement and of private employment services. Article 20(3) requires that Member States prohibit private employment agencies from using any means or mechanism or lists to prevent fishermen from engaging for work. No fees or other charges for private labour market services must be borne, directly or indirectly, fully or partly, by the fisherman. Article 20(4) stipulates that Member States which have ratified the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 are allowed to allocate certain responsibilities under that Convention to private employment agencies, as far as they have this right. The limits of the Convention have to be taken into account.\n\n\nArticles 21-25 of the Agreement contain provisions on occupational safety and health, in particular with regard to food and accommodation.\n\n\nArticle 21(1) states that Articles 21-25 apply without prejudice to Directive 93/103/EC. National provisions implementing Articles 22-25 must be observed with due regard to hygiene, and overall safe, healthy and comfortable conditions.\n\n\nAccording to Article 22, Member States must adopt laws, regulations or other measures with regard to, inter alia, the size and quality of the accommodation, food and potable water on vessels flying their flag or registered under their plenary jurisdiction. Article 23 states that each EU Member State must adopt laws, regulations and other measures which require that accommodation is of sufficient quality and size and equipped for the service of the vessel and the length of time the fishermen spend on board. In particular, the issues enumerated in Article\u00a023 need to be taken into account, such as approval of plans for the construction or modification of fishing vessels in respect of accommodation, maintenance of accommodation and galley spaces, ventilation, heating, cooling and lighting, mitigation of excessive noise and vibration, location, size, construction materials, furnishing and equipping of different rooms and other accommodation spaces, sanitary facilities, and supply of sufficient hot and cold water, and complaint procedures concerning accommodation that does not meet the requirements of this Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 24 states that EU Member States must adopt laws, regulations or other measures with regard to food and water on board the vessel. In particular, food carried and served on board must be of sufficient quality, quantity and nutritional value. Potable water must be of sufficient quality and quantity. The fishing vessel owner must provide food and water at no cost to the fishermen. However, in accordance with national law and regulations, the cost can be recovered as an operational cost if the collective agreement governing a share system or a fisherman\u2019s work agreement so provides. The national laws, regulations and measures to be adopted by the EU Member State to transpose the provisions of Articles 22-24 must give full effect to Annex II of the Agreement on fishing vessel accommodation.\n\n\nArticles 26-31 concern health protection and medical care; protection in case of work-related sickness, injury or death.\n\n\nArticle 26 requires EU Member States to adopt national laws, regulations and other measures to ensure that fishermen on vessels flying their flag or registered under their plenary jurisdiction have the right to medical treatment ashore and to be taken ashore in case of a serious illness or injury in a timely manner. The fisherman must be provided by the fishing vessel owner with medical care and health protection while on board or while landed in a port outside the country responsible for the fisherman\u2019s social security protection. In case of a work-related illness or injury the fisherman must have access to adequate medical care in accordance with national law, practices and regulation. Under Article 27, the medical care and health protection on board referred to in Article 26(b) is subject to the applicable provisions of Directive 92/92/EEC\n21\n and Article 28 of the Agreement. It must also include medical treatment and material assistance and support if the fisherman is landed in a foreign port outside the country responsible for the fisherman\u2019s social security protection.\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 28 of the Agreement, EU Member States must adopt national laws, regulations or other measures introducing additional requirements to the provisions of Directive 92/29/EEC, taking into account, inter alia, the area of operation and length of the voyage, and the number of fishermen on board. In addition it establishes that vessels need to be equipped with radio or satellite communications for medical consultation and a medical guide adopted or approved by the competent authority or the most updated edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships.\n\n\nArticle 29 establishes that EU Member States must adopt laws, regulations or other measures requiring that: a) the medical care under Article 26(b) and Article 28 is provided free of charge to fisherman; b) the fishing vessel owner is responsible for the cost of medical treatment of the fisherman until the latter has been repatriated, to the extent that the costs are not covered by the country responsible for the fisherman\u2019s social security protection.\n\n\nArticle 30 states that national law or regulations may allow this responsibility for defraying the cost of medical treatment to be excluded if the injury did not occur in the service of the vessel, or the illness was concealed during engagement, or the fishing vessel owner can prove that the injury or sickness illness was caused by wilful misconduct of the fisherman.\n\n\nArticle 31(1) obliges EU Member States to take measures to provide fishermen with protection for occupational illness, injury or death. Article 31(2) states that in case of illness or injury caused by an occupational accident the fisherman is entitled to compensation in accordance with national law and regulations. Under Article 31(3), the fishing vessel owner is responsible for this protection and compensation if it is not covered by the country responsible for the fisherman\u2019s social security protection. Under Article 32, the fishing vessel owner may ensure financial liabilities under Articles 29 and 31 of the Agreement through insurance or other schemes.\n\n\nArticles 33-36 inclusive concern occupational safety and health and accident prevention.\n\n\n\nArticle 33 stipulates that Articles 34 to 36 apply without prejudice to Directive 89/391/EEC\n22\n, Directive 92/29/EEC\n23\n, and Directive 93/103/EC\n24\n. \n\n\n\nArticle 34 establishes that EU Member States are obliged to adopt laws, regulations or other measures concerning the prevention of occupational illnesses, injuries and accidents, including risk assessment and management and training of fishermen. Training of fishermen must also include training on the fishing equipment they will handle and the operations they will be engaged in. In addition they must include the responsibilities of fishing vessel owners, fishermen and others, taking into account in particular the occupational safety and health of fishermen under the age of 18. National laws, regulations and other measures must also concern the registration and investigation of accidents on board the vessel and the setting up of joint committees on occupational safety and health or (after consultation with the national social partners) other bodies.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 35 applies to all fishing vessels taking into account number of fishermen on board, area of operation and length of the voyage. It establishes the responsibilities of competent authorities and the fishing vessel owner with regard to the prevention of occupational illnesses, injuries and accidents on board and risk assessment and management of risks. In addition, it establishes their responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis information and training of fishermen with regard to equipment, operations and basic safety, and the provision of personal protective clothing and equipment.\n\n\nArticle 36 establishes that fishermen or their representatives must participate in the risk evaluation.\n\n\nArticle 37 (Amendments)\n\n\nThis Article states that a review of the application of the Agreement and its annexes must be carried out, at the request of one of the signatories, subsequent to any amendment of any of the provisions of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007. If requested by one of the signatories, subsequent to any change in EU acquis affecting this Agreement, a review of the application of the Agreement must be carried out.\n\n\nArticle 38 (Final provisions)\n\n\nThis Article states that the Agreement will enter into force on the day the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 enters into force.\n\n\nAnnex I (Fisherman\u2019s Work Agreement) specifies the content of the Fisherman\u2019s Work Agreement.\n\n\nAnnex II (Fishing Vessel Accommodation). \n\n\nThe Annex specifies its scope and possible extensions (where deemed practicable and/or possible by the national competent authority). It covers a number of specific issues regarding mainly accommodation on board, but also contains provisions on matters such as food and potable water, and on inspections by the skipper or under his authority. For the purposes of this Annex, the definitions of a) Agreement; b) new and c) existing vessel are laid down.  \n\n\n2016/0124 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\n\n\nimplementing the Agreement concluded between  the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (COGECA), the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises (EUROP\u00caCHE) of 21 May 2012 as amended on 8 May 2013 concerning the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 of the International Labour Organisation\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in particular Article 155(2) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Management and labour (\u2018the social partners\u2019) may in accordance with Article 155(2) of the TFEU request jointly that agreements concluded by them at Union level be implemented by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission.\n\n\n(2)On 14 June 2007, the International Labour Organisation adopted the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007\n25\n, aiming to create a single, coherent instrument to complete the international living and working conditions standards for this sector, embodying revised and updated standards of existing international Conventions and Recommendations applicable to fishermen, as well as the fundamental principles found in other international labour Conventions.\n\n\n(3)The Commission consulted the social partners, in accordance with Article 154(2) of the TFEU, on whether to promote the application within the Union of the provisions of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007\n26\n.\n\n\n(4)On 8 May 2013, the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union , the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union, wishing to undertake a first step towards a codification of EU social acquis in the sea fishing sector and to help create a level playing field for the sea fishing sector in the EU, concluded an agreement concerning the implementation of the  Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 ('the Agreement'). On 10 May 2013, these organisations requested the Commission to implement their agreement by a Council decision in accordance with Article 155(2) of the TFEU. \n\n\n(5)For the purposes of Article 288 of the Treaty, the appropriate instrument to implement the Agreement is a directive.\n\n\n(6)The Commission has drafted its proposal for a directive, in accordance with its Communication of 20 May 1998\n27\n on adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level, taking into account the representative status of the signatory parties and the legality of each clause of the Agreement.\n\n\n(7)The provisions of this Directive should apply without prejudice to any existing Union provisions which are more specific or which grant a higher level of protection to all fishermen.\n\n\n(8)This Directive should not be used to justify a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the fields covered by the Agreement.\n\n\n(9)This Directive and the Agreement annexed hereto lay down minimum standards; the Member States and the social partners may maintain or introduce more favourable provisions.\n\n\n(10)Without prejudice to the provisions of the Agreement on follow up and review by the social partners at EU level, the European Commission shall monitor the implementation of this Directive and the Agreement and carry out an evaluation.\n\n\n(11)The Directive will enter into force simultaneously with the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 and the social partners wish the national measures implementing this Directive to enter into force not earlier than on the date of entry into force of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007.\n\n\n(12)The Agreement applies to fishermen working in any capacity under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship on board of fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing, flying the flag of an EU Member State or registered under the plenary jurisdiction of an EU Member State.\n\n\n(13)In order to protect the occupational safety and health of the fishermen working in any capacity under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship, the Agreement may further apply to all other fishermen present on board the same fishing vessel.\n\n\n(14)Any terms used in the Agreement and which are not specifically defined therein may be defined by Member States in accordance with national law and practice, as is the case for other social policy directives using similar terms, providing that those definitions respect the content of the Agreement.\n\n\n(15)This Directive and the Agreement annexed hereto should take into account the provisions on the management of fishing capacity as highlighted in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\n28\n.\n\n\n(16)The Member States may entrust social partners, at their joint request, with the implementation of this Directive, as long as the Member States take all the necessary steps to ensure that they can at all times guarantee the results imposed by this Directive.\n\n\n(17)The Commission has informed the European Parliament pursuant to Article 155(2) TFEU, by sending the text of its proposal for a Directive containing the Agreement.\n\n\n(18)This Directive respects the fundamental rights and principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 20, 31 and 32 thereof.\n\n\n(19)Since the objectives of this Directive which is intended to improve living and working conditions and to protect health and safety of workers in the sea fishing sector \u2013which is a cross-border sector operating under the flags of different Member States- cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can be better achieved at Union level, the European Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5(4) of the TEU, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n\n\n\n(20)In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents\n29\n, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThis Directive implements, the Agreement between the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union, the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation and the Association of National Organisations of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union, concluded on 8 May 2013, concerning the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007, of the International Labour Organisation. \n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is set out in the annex to this Directive. \n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n1.Member States may maintain or introduce provisions more favourable to workers than those laid down in this Directive.\n\n\n2.The implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances constitute sufficient grounds for justifying a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the fields covered by this Directive. This shall be without prejudice to the rights of Member States and social partners to adopt, in the light of changing circumstances, different laws and regulations  or make different contractual arrangements to those prevailing at the time of the adoption of this Directive, provided always that the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive are complied with.\n\n\n3.The application and interpretation of this Directive shall be without prejudice to any Union or national provision, custom or practice providing for more favourable conditions for the workers concerned.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nMember States shall determine what penalties are applicable when national provisions enacted pursuant to this Directive are infringed. The penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\n1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by [two years after the entry into force of the Directive] at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.\n\n\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n\n\n2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nThe Commission shall, after\u00a0consulting the Member States and the social partners at Union level, present a report to the Council on the implementation, application and evaluation of this Directive no later than 5 years after the date provided in Article 6. \n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the date of entry into force of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007.\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\n\n\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\n\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nhttp://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C188.\n\n\n\n(2)\nFrance has ratified the Convention in October 2015.

Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Review of the operation of the provisions with regards to workers on board seagoing fishing vessels contained in Directive 2003/88/EC.\n\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n(1)The 96th Session of the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 (C188) on the 14th of June 2007.\n\n\n(2)C188 was adopted by 437 votes for, 2 votes against, and 22 abstentions. All government representatives present (53 votes), all worker representatives present (25 votes) and all employer representatives present (22 votes) of the present 27 Member States of the European Union (\u2018Member States\u2019) voted for the adoption of the Convention.\n\n\n(3)Globalization has a profound impact on the fishing sector and the rights of fishermen need to be promoted and protected.\n\n\n(4)The ILO considers fishing a hazardous occupation when compared to other occupations.\n\n\n(5)The objective of C188 is to ensure that fishermen have decent conditions of work on board fishing vessels with regard to minimum requirements for work on board, conditions of service, accommodation and food, occupational safety and health protection, medical care, and social security.\n\n\n(6)C188 requires Members of the ILO to exercise, in accordance with national laws or regulations, jurisdiction and control over fishing vessels that fly their flags by establishing a system for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Convention.\n\n\n(7)Article 155, paragraph 2, of the TFEU provides that agreements concluded at European Union (\u2018EU\u2019) level may be implemented at the joint request of the EU social partners by a Council decision on a proposal from the European Commission. In view of this, the social partners have decided to enter into negotiations to conclude, within the limitations as set out in Article 153 of the TFEU, an agreement implementing certain parts of C188.\n\n\n(8)The EU social partners consider this initiative as highly important to encourage Member States to ratify the Convention so as to complete a level playing field in the EU and the rest of the world on matters relating to fishermen\u2019s working and living conditions on board fishing vessels.\n\n\n(9)The EU social partners consider an agreement as a first step contributing to codification of the social acquis in the fishing sector.\n\n\n(10)Certain aspects of the organisation of working time of workers on board seagoing fishing vessels are governed at present by the provisions of Article 21 of Directive 2003/88/EC. Although the Articles 13 and 14 of C188 on the whole offer fishermen a lower level of protection than the Directive, some of the provisions of Article 14 of the Convention are of a higher protection level. For this reason the EU social partners have agreed on merging the provisions referred to. The result is an overall higher level of protection. The provisions concerned are: consultation by the competent authority of the national EU social partners prior to establishing the minimum level of protection; the additional purpose of limiting fatigue; compensatory rest in case of exceptions allowed to minimum hours of rest or maximum hours of work; and improved protection after distress situations.\n\n\n(11)The provisions of C188 on quality of medical care, accommodation facilities, food, living conditions, compensation in the event of hazards or illnesses, and on social protection should be considered as falling within the scope of the safety and health at work of fishermen having regard to the specificities of work on board a fishing vessel, such as geographical isolation, fatigue and the nature, mostly physical, of the work to be performed.\n\n\n(12)C188 applies to all fishers (\u2018fishermen\u2019), defined in its Article 1(e) as \u201cevery person employed or engaged in any capacity or carrying out an occupation on board any fishing vessel, including persons working on board who are paid on the basis of a share of the catch but excluding pilots, naval personnel, other persons in the permanent service of a government, shore based persons carrying out work aboard a fishing vessel and fisheries observers\u201d. Due to the limitations as set out in the TFEU the EU social partners do not have the power to agree texts, intended to be implemented by a Council decision, which affect fishermen who neither work under a contract of employment nor in an employment relationship. However, the application of different or no standards to those fishermen while they are present on the same vessel with fishermen who are working under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship can have an impact on the overall occupational safety and health, including the living and working conditions, of the latter. In order to protect fishermen who work under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship, the EU social partners consider it therefore justified that this Agreement shall apply, not only to fishermen who work under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship, but also to all other fishermen who are present on the same vessel.\n\n\n(13)The proper instrument for implementing this Agreement is a Directive, within the meaning of Article 288 of the TFEU, which binds Member States as to the result to be achieved, whilst leaving to national authorities the choice of form and methods.\n\n\n\nCalling upon the Member States to:\n\n\n(1)Ratify C188 given the unanimity of Member States at the time of the Convention\u2019s adoption and because of the important differences between the scope of application as well as the areas covered by the Convention on the one hand and this Agreement on the other hand.\n\n\n\n\n(2)Develop a uniform valid document as mentioned in Article 41 of C188 to be implemented throughout the European Union.\n\n\n(3)Develop a harmonized policy on port State control of fishing vessels which are subject to C188 to be implemented throughout the European Union, based on the PSC-F Guidelines.\n\n\nJointly requesting:\n\n\n\nThis Agreement to be implemented by a Council Directive.\n\n\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\n\n\nPART 1\n\n\nDEFINITIONS AND SCOPE\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n\n(a)fishing operation means catching, or catching and processing, of fish or other living resources of the sea;\n\n\n(b)commercial fishing means all fishing operations with the exception of subsistence fishing and recreational fishing;\n\n\n(c)competent authority means the minister, government department or other authority designated by a Member State having power to issue and enforce regulations, orders or other instructions having the force of law in respect of the subject matter of the provision concerned;\n\n\n\n\n(d)consultation means consultation by the competent authority with the representative organizations of employers and workers concerned, and in particular the representative organizations of fishing vessel owners and fishermen, where they exist;\n\n\n(e)fishing vessel owner or owner means the owner of the fishing vessel or any other organization or person, such as the manager, agent or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the vessel from the owner and who, on assuming such responsibility, has agreed to take over the duties and responsibilities imposed on fishing vessel owners in accordance with this Agreement, regardless of whether any other organization or person fulfils certain of the duties or responsibilities on behalf of the fishing vessel owner;\n\n\n(f)fisherman means every person employed or engaged or working in any capacity on board any fishing vessel under the conditions laid down in Article 2, but excluding port pilots and shore personnel carrying out work on board a fishing vessel at the quay side;\n\n\n(g)fisherman\u2019s work agreement means a contract of employment, articles of agreement or other similar arrangements, or any other contract governing a fisherman\u2019s living and working conditions on board a fishing vessel; \n\n\n(h)fishing vessel or vessel means any ship or boat, flying the flag of a Member State or registered under the plenary jurisdiction of a Member State, of any nature whatsoever, irrespective of the form of ownership, used or intended to be used for the purpose of commercial fishing;\n\n\n(i)length (L) shall be taken as 96 per cent of the total length on a waterline at 85 per cent of the least moulded depth measured from the keel line, or as the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater; in vessels designed with rake of keel, the waterline on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline;\n\n\n(j)length between perpendiculars (LBP) means the distance between the forward and the after perpendiculars; the forward perpendicular shall be coincident with the foreside of the stem on the waterline on which the length (L) is measured; the after perpendicular shall be coincident with the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline;\n\n\n(k)skipper means the fisherman having command of a fishing vessel;\n\n\n(l)recruitment and placement service means any person, company, institution, agency or other organisation, in the public or the private sector, which is engaged in recruiting fishermen on behalf of, or placing fishermen with, fishing vessel owners;\n\n\n(m)private employment agency means any person, company, institution, agency or other organization in the private sector engaged in employing or engaging fishermen with a view to making them available to fishing vessel owners who assign their tasks and supervise the execution of these tasks.\n\n\n\nSCOPE\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\n1. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement applies to:\n\n\n(a)all fishermen working in any capacity under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship on all fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing;\n\n\n(b)all other fishermen who are present on the same vessel with fishermen referred to in (a) in order to ensure the protection of the overall safety and health.\n\n\n2. In the event of doubt as to whether a vessel is engaged in commercial fishing, the question shall be determined by the competent authority after consultation.\n\n\n3. Any Member State, after consultation, may extend, in whole or in part, to fishermen working on vessels of less than 24 metres in length the protection provided in this Agreement for fishermen working on vessels of 24 metres in length and over.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n1. Where the application of this Agreement raises special problems of a substantial nature in the light of the particular conditions of service of the fisherman or of the fishing vessels\u2019 operations concerned, a Member State may, on objective grounds, after consultation, exclude limited categories of fishermen or fishing vessels from the requirements of this Agreement or from certain of its provisions.\n\n\n2. In case of exclusions under the preceding paragraph, the competent authority shall take measures, as appropriate, to extend progressively the requirements under this Agreement to all categories of fishermen or fishing vessels concerned within a maximum period of 5 years since the entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n\n3. The application of this Article shall under no circumstances constitute grounds for justifying a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the fields covered under EU law at the time of entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall affect any law, award or custom, or any agreement between fishing vessel owners and fishermen, which ensures more favourable conditions to fishermen than those provided for in this Agreement.\n\n\n\nPART 2\n\n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF FISHING VESSEL OWNERS, SKIPPERS AND FISHERMEN\n\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\n1. This Article applies without prejudice to Directive 93/103/ EC.\n\n\n2. The fishing vessel owner has the overall responsibility to ensure that the skipper is provided with the necessary resources and facilities to comply with the obligations of this Agreement.\n\n\n3. In order to ensure the safety of the fishermen on board and the safe operation of the vessel the skipper\u2019s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n(a)providing such supervision as well as ensuring that, as far as possible, fishermen perform their work in the best conditions of safety and health;\n\n\n(b)managing the fishermen in a manner which respects safety and health, including prevention of fatigue;\n\n\n\n\n(c)facilitating on-board occupational safety and health awareness training; and\n\n\n(d)ensuring compliance with safety of navigation, watch keeping and associated good seamanship standards.\n\n\n4. The skipper shall not be constrained by the fishing vessel owner from taking any decision which, in the professional judgement of the skipper, is necessary for the safety of the fishermen on board, or the vessel and its safe navigation and safe operation.\n\n\n5. Fishermen shall comply with the lawful orders of the skipper and applicable safety and health measures.\n\n\n\nPART 3\n\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK ON FISHING VESSELS\n\n\n\n\nMINIMUM AGE\n\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\n1. This Article applies without prejudice to Directive 94/33/EC.\n\n\n2. The minimum age for work on board a fishing vessel shall be 16 years provided a young person is no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling under national law. However, the competent authority may authorize a minimum age of 15 for persons who are no longer subject to compulsory schooling as provided by national legislation, and who are engaged in vocational training in fishing.\n\n\n3. The competent authority, in accordance with national laws and practice, may authorize persons of the age of 15 to perform light work during school holidays. In such cases, it shall determine, after consultation, the kinds of work permitted and shall prescribe the conditions in which such work shall be undertaken and the periods of rest required.\n\n\n4. The minimum age for assignment to activities on board fishing vessels, which by their nature or the circumstances in which they are carried out are likely to jeopardize the health, safety, physical, mental or social development, education or morals of young persons, shall not be less than 18 years.\n\n\n5. The types of activities to which paragraph 4 of this Article applies shall be determined by national laws or regulations, or by the competent authority, after consultation, taking into account the risks concerned and the applicable international standards.\n\n\n6. The performance of the activities referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article as from the age of 16, provided a young person is no longer subject to compulsory fulltime schooling under national law, may be authorized by national laws or regulations, or by decision of the competent authority, after consultation, on condition that the health, safety, physical, mental and social development, education and morals of the young persons concerned are fully protected and that the young persons concerned have received adequate specific instruction or vocational training and have completed basic pre-sea safety training. The requirements under Article 7.3 of Directive 94/33/EC shall be respected.\n\n\n7. The engagement of fishermen under the age of 18 for work at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article, \u2018night\u2019 shall be defined in accordance with national law and practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours, starting no later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by the competent authority, provided that the requirements under Article 9 of Directive 94/33/EC are respected, when:\n\n\n(a)the effective training of the fishermen concerned, in accordance with established programmes and schedules, would be impaired; or\n\n\n\n\n(b)the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training programme requires that fishermen covered by the exception perform duties at night and the authority determines, after consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental impact on their health or well-being.\n\n\n8. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations assumed by the Member State arising from the ratification of any international labour Convention guaranteeing more protective conditions to the young fishermen concerned in this Article.\n\n\n\nMEDICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\n1. No fishermen shall work on board a fishing vessel without a valid medical certificate attesting to fitness to perform their duties.\n\n\n2. The competent authority, after consultation, may grant exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article, taking into account the safety and health of fishermen, size of the vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing operation.\n\n\n3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not apply to a fisherman working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days. In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisherman to work on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the fisherman is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a recent date.\n\n\nArticle 8\n\n\nEach Member State shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing for:\n\n\n(a)the nature of medical examinations;\n\n\n(b)the form and content of medical certificates;\n\n\n(c)the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy full independence in exercising their professional judgement;\n\n\n(d)the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity of medical certificates;\n\n\n(e)the right to another, binding examination by an independent medical practitioner, who has been appointed by the Member State as referee,\n\n\n(i) in the event that a person has been refused a certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may perform;\n\n\n(ii) in the event that a person, during his or her examination, has indicated that he or she finds himself or herself unfit to perform his or her duties on board a fishing vessel, but the medical examiner issues a medical certificate nonetheless attesting that the person is medically fit to perform his or her duties on board a fishing vessel;\n\n\n(iii) in the event that a person has been refused a certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may perform, in case the medical reasons for such refusal have disappeared.\n\n\n(f)other relevant requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 9\n\n\nIn addition to the minimum requirements set out in Article 7 and Article 8, on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which normally remains at sea for more than three days:\n\n\n(a)the medical certificate of a fisherman shall state, at a minimum, that:\n\n\n(i) the hearing and sight of the fisherman concerned are satisfactory for the fisherman\u2019s duties on the vessel, and\n\n\n(ii) the fisherman is not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the fisherman unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or health of other persons on board;\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum period of two years unless the fisherman is under the age of 18, in which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year;\n\n\n(c)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if the period of validity of a certificate expires in the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until the end of that voyage.\n\n\n\nPART 4\n\n\nCONDITIONS OF SERVICE\n\n\n\n\nMANNING\n\n\n\nArticle 10\n\n\n1. Each Member State shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures requiring that owners of vessels flying its flag or registered under its plenary jurisdiction ensure that their vessels are sufficiently and safely manned for the safe navigation and operation of the vessel and under the control of a competent skipper.\n\n\n2. In addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, the competent authority shall, for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over, establish a minimum level of manning for the safe navigation of the vessel, specifying the number and the qualifications of the fishermen required.\n\n\n3. The competent authority, after consultation, may establish alternative requirements to those in paragraph 2 of this Article. However, the Member State shall satisfy itself that the alternative:\n\n\n(a)is conducive to the full achievement of the general object and purpose of this Article and of Article 11 hereafter;\n\n\n\n\n(b)gives effect to paragraph 2 of this Article; and\n\n\n(c)shall not jeopardise the safety and health of the fishermen.\n\n\n\nHOURS OF WORK AND HOURS OF REST\n\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\n1.(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 3 to 6 inclusive, 8, and 21 of Directive 2003/88/EC shall not apply to fishermen covered under this Agreement.\n\n\n(b)Each Member State shall, however, adopt laws, regulations or other measures requiring that owners of vessels flying its flag ensure that fishermen are entitled to adequate rest and that the fishermen\u2019s hours of work are limited to 48 hours a week on average, calculated over a reference period not exceeding twelve months.\n\n\n2.(a)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within the limits set out in paragraph 1, subparagraph (b), and paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, each Member State shall, after consultation, take the necessary measures to ensure that, in keeping with the need to protect the safety and health of the fishermen and for the purpose of limiting fatigue:\n\n\n(i) the working hours are limited to a maximum number of hours which shall not be exceeded in a given period of time; or\n\n\n(ii) a minimum number of hours of rest are provided within a given period of time.\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The maximum number of hours of work or the minimum hours of rest shall be specified by law, regulations, administrative provisions or by collective agreements or agreements between the two sides of the industry.\n\n\n3.The limits on hours of work or rest shall be either:\n\n\n(a)maximum hours of work which shall not exceed:\n\n\n(i) 14 hours in any 24-hour period, and\n\n\n(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period;\n\n\nor\n\n\n(b)minimum hours of rest which shall not be less than:\n\n\n(i) ten hours in any 24-hour period, and\n\n\n(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.\n\n\n\n\n4.Hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours in length, and the interval between two consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.\n\n\n5.In accordance with the general principles of the protection of the health and safety of workers, and for objective or technical reasons or reasons concerning the organisation of work, Member States may allow exceptions, including the establishment of reference periods, to the limits laid down in paragraph 1, subparagraph (b), and paragraphs 3 and 4. Such exceptions shall, as far as possible, comply with the standards laid down but may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods or the granting of compensatory leave for the fishermen. \n\n\nThese exceptions may be laid down by means of:\n\n\n(a)laws, regulations or administrative provisions provided there is consultation and efforts are made to encourage all relevant forms of social dialogue; or\n\n\n(b)collective agreements or agreements between the two sides of industry.\n\n\n6.If exceptions under paragraph 5 are allowed to the limits laid down in paragraph 3, the fishermen concerned shall receive compensatory periods of rest as soon as practicable.\n\n\n7.Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisherman to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea. Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest and require a fisherman to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure that any fishermen who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.\n\n\n8.Each Member State may provide that fishermen on board fishing vessels flying its flag or registered under its plenary jurisdiction for which national legislation or practice determines that these vessels are not allowed to operate in a specific period of the calendar year exceeding one month, shall take annual leave in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2003/88/EC within that period.\n\n\n\nCREW LIST\n\n\n\nArticle 12\n\n\nEvery fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel, or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel. The competent authority shall determine to whom and when such information shall be provided and for what purpose or purposes.\n\n\n\nFISHERMAN\u2019S WORK AGREEMENT\n\n\n\nArticle 13\n\n\nArticles 14 to 18 inclusive apply without prejudice to Directive 91/533/ EEC.\n\n\nArticle 14\n\n\nEach Member State shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures:\n\n\n\n\n(a)requiring that fishermen working on vessels flying its flag or registered under its plenary jurisdiction have the protection of a fisherman\u2019s work agreement that is comprehensible to them and is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement; and\n\n\n(b)specifying the minimum particulars to be included in fisherman\u2019s work agreements in accordance with the provisions contained in Annex I to this Agreement.\n\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nEach Member State shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures regarding:\n\n\n(a)procedures for ensuring that a fisherman has an opportunity to review and seek advice on the terms of the fisherman\u2019s work agreement before it is concluded;\n\n\n(b)where applicable, the maintenance of records concerning the fisherman\u2019s work under such an agreement; and\n\n\n(c)the means of settling disputes in connection with a fisherman\u2019s work agreement.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\nThe fisherman\u2019s work agreement, a copy of which shall be provided to the fisherman, shall be carried on board and be available to the fisherman and, in accordance with national law and practice, to other parties concerned on request.\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nArticles 14 to 16 inclusive and Annex I to this Agreement do not apply to a fishing vessel owner who is also single-handedly operating the vessel.\n\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the fishing vessel owner to ensure that each fisherman has a written fisherman\u2019s work agreement, which is signed by all parties to that agreement, and which provides the fisherman with decent work and living conditions on board the vessel as required by this Agreement.\n\n\n\nREPATRIATION\n\n\n\nArticle 19\n\n\n1. Each Member State shall ensure that fishermen on a fishing vessel that flies its flag or is registered under its plenary jurisdiction and that enters a foreign port are entitled to repatriation in the event that the fisherman\u2019s work agreement has expired or has been terminated for justified reasons by one or more of the parties to that agreement, or the fisherman is no longer able to carry out the duties required under the fisherman\u2019s work agreement or cannot be expected to carry them out in the specific circumstances. This also applies to fishermen from that vessel who are transferred for the same reasons from the vessel to the foreign port.\n\n\n\n\n2. The cost of the repatriation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be borne by the fishing vessel owner, except where the fisherman has been found, in accordance with national laws, regulations or other measures, to be in serious default of his or her obligations under the fisherman\u2019s work agreement.\n\n\n3. Member States shall prescribe, by means of laws, regulations or other measures, the precise circumstances entitling a fisherman covered by paragraph 1 of this Article to repatriation, the maximum duration of service periods on board following which a fisherman is entitled to repatriation, and the destinations to which fishermen may be repatriated.\n\n\n4. If a fishing vessel owner fails to provide for the repatriation referred to in this Article, the Member State whose flag the vessel flies shall arrange for the repatriation of the fisherman concerned and shall be entitled to recover the cost from the fishing vessel owner.\n\n\n5. National laws and regulations shall not prejudice any right of the fishing vessel owner to recover the cost of repatriation under third party contractual agreements.\n\n\n\nPRIVATE LABOUR MARKET SERVICES\n\n\n\nArticle 20\n\n\n1. This Article applies without prejudice to Directive 2008/104/EC.\n\n\n2. For the purpose of this Article private labour market services consist of recruitment and placement services in the private sector and the services of private employment agencies.\n\n\n3. A Member State shall:\n\n\n(a)prohibit private labour market services from using means, mechanisms or lists intended to prevent fishermen from engaging for work; and\n\n\n(b)require that no fees or other charges for private labour market services be borne directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the fisherman.\n\n\n4. Nothing in this Article shall prevent any Member State who has ratified C188 from exercising the right it may have to allocate, within the limitations prescribed by the Convention, certain responsibilities under C188 to private employment agencies.\n\n\nPART 5\n\n\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH\n\n\n\n\nFOOD AND ACCOMMODATION\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\n1. Articles 22 to 25 inclusive apply without prejudice to Directive 93/103/EC.\n\n\n2.
