Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25\u00b0C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for two hours (phase at\u00a025\u00b0C). The combination of the successive phases at 50\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to two thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of  20 (\u00b13)\u00b0C for the determination of the oil retention value.\n\n\n4.1.2.Apparatus\n\n\n4.1.2.Normal laboratory apparatus, in particular:\n\n\n(a)water baths thermostated at 25 (\u00b1 1) and 50 (\u00b1 1)\u00b0C respectively,\n\n\n(b)Erlenmeyer flasks with an individual capacity of 150\u00a0ml.\n\n\n4.1.3.Procedure\n\n\n4.1.3.1.Put each test sample of 70 ( 5)\u00a0grams into an Erlenmeyer flask which is then sealed with a stopper.\n\n\n4.1.3.2.Move each flask every two hours from the 50\u00b0C bath to the 25\u00b0C bath and vice versa.\n\n\n4.1.3.3.Maintain the water in each bath at constant temperature and keep in motion by rapid stirring to ensure the water level comes above the level of the sample. Protect the stopper from condensation by a foam rubber cap.\n\n\n4.2.Thermal cycles prior to the detonation resistance test referred to in paragraph 5 under PFC\u00a01(C)(I)(a)(iii)(A) in Annex I\n\n\n4.2.1.Principle and definition\n\n\n4.2.1.In a watertight box heat the sample from ambient temperature to 50\u00b0C and maintain at this temperature for a period of one hour (phase at 50\u00b0C). Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25\u00b0C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for one hour (phase at 25\u00b0C). The combination of the successive phases at 50\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to the required number of thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of 20 (\u00b13)\u00b0C pending the execution of the detonability test.\n\n\n4.2.2.Apparatus\n\n\n(a)A water bath, thermostated in a temperature range of 20 to 51\u00b0C with a minimum heating and cooling rate of 10\u00b0C/h, or two water baths, one thermostated at a temperature of 20\u00b0C, the other at 51\u00b0C. The water in the bath(s) is continuously stirred; the volume of the bath shall be large enough to guarantee ample circulation of the water.\n\n\n(b)A stainless steel box, watertight all around and provided with a thermocouple in the centre. The outside width of the box is 45 (\u00b1 2)\u00a0mm and the wall thickness is 1,5\u00a0mm (see Figure 1). The height and length of the box can be chosen to suit the dimensions of the water bath, e.g. length 600\u00a0mm, height 400\u00a0mm.\n\n\n4.2.3.Procedure\n\n\n4.2.3.Place a quantity of fertilisers sufficient for a single detonation into the box and close the cover.  Place the box in the water bath. Heat the water to 51\u00b0C and measure the temperature in the centre of the fertiliser. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 50\u00b0C cool the water. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 25\u00b0C heat the water to start the second cycle. In the case of two water baths, transfer the box to the other bath after each heating/cooling period.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.Detonation resistance test referred to in paragraph 5 under PFC\u00a01(C)(I)(a)(iii)(A)  in Annex I\n\n\n4.3.1.Description\n\n\n4.3.1.1The test shall be carried out on a representative sample of the CE marked fertilising product. Before being tested for resistance to detonation, the whole mass of the sample is to be thermally cycled five times complying with the provisions under heading\u00a04.2 above.\n\n\n4.3.1.2.The CE marked fertilising product shall be subjected to the test of resistance to detonation in a horizontal steel tube under the following conditions:\n\n\n(a)seamless steel tube,\n\n\n(b)Tube length: 1\u00a0000\u00a0mm at least,\n\n\n(c)Nominal external diameter: 114\u00a0mm at least,\n\n\n(d)Nominal wall thickness: 5\u00a0mm at least,\n\n\n(e)Booster: the type and mass of the booster chosen shall be such as to maximise the detonation pressure applied to the sample in order to determine its susceptibility to the transmission of detonation,\n\n\n(f)Test temperature: 1525\u00b0C,\n\n\n(g)Witness lead cylinders for detecting detonation: 50\u00a0mm diameter and 100\u00a0mm high\n\n\n(h)placed at 150\u00a0mm intervals and supporting the tube horizontally. The test is to be carried out twice. The test is deemed conclusive if in both tests one or more of the supporting lead cylinders is crushed by less than 5%.\n\n\n4.3.2.Principle\n\n\n4.3.2.The test sample is confined in a steel tube and subjected to detonation shock from an explosive booster charge. Propagation of the detonation is determined from the degree of crushing of lead cylinders on which the tube rests horizontally during the test.\n\n\n4.3.3.Materials\n\n\n(a)Plastic explosive containing 83 to 86% penthrite\n\n\n\uf0b7Density: 1\u00a0500 to 1\u00a0600\u00a0kg/m3\u00a0\n\n\n\uf0b7Detonation velocity: 7\u00a0300 to 7\u00a0700\u00a0m/s\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Mass: 500 (\u00b1 1)\u00a0gram.\n\n\n(b)Seven lengths of flexible detonating cord with nonmetallic sleeve\n\n\n\uf0b7Filling mass: 11 to 13\u00a0g/m\n\n\n\uf0b7Length of each cord: 400 (\u00b1 2)\u00a0mm.\n\n\n(c)Compressed pellet of secondary explosive, recessed to receive detonator\n\n\n\uf0b7Explosive: hexogen/wax 95/5 or tetryl or similar secondary explosive, with or without added graphite.\n\n\n\uf0b7Density: 1\u00a0500 to 1\u00a0600\u00a0kg/m3\n\n\n\uf0b7Diameter: 19 to 21\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Height: 19 to 23\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Central recess to receive detonator: diameter 7 to 7,3\u00a0mm, depth 12\u00a0mm.\n\n\n(d)Seamless steel tube as specified in ISO 65 \u2013 1981 \u2013 Heavy Series, with nominal dimensions DN 100 (4'')\n\n\n\uf0b7Outside diameter: 113,1 to 115,0\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Wall thickness: 5,0 to 6,5\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Length: 1 005 (\u00b1 2)\u00a0mm.\n\n\n(e)Bottom place\n\n\n\uf0b7Material: steel of good weldable quality\n\n\n\uf0b7Dimensions: 160 \u00d7 160\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Thickness: 5 to 6\u00a0mm.\n\n\n(f)Six lead cylinders\n\n\n\uf0b7Diameter: 50 (\u00b1 1)\u00a0mm\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7Height: 100 to 101\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Materials: soft lead, at least 99,5% purity.\n\n\n(g)Steel block\n\n\n\uf0b7Length: at least 1\u00a0000\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Width: at least 150\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Height: at least 150\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Mass: at least 300\u00a0kg if there is no firm base for the steel block.\n\n\n(h)Plastic or cardboard cylinder for booster charge\n\n\n\uf0b7Wall thickness: 1,5 to 2,5\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Diameter: 92 to 96\u00a0mm\n\n\n\uf0b7Height: 64 to 67\u00a0mm.\n\n\n(i)Detonator (electric or nonelectric) with initiation force 8 to 10\n\n\n(j)Wooden disc\n\n\n\uf0b7Diameter: 92 to 96\u00a0mm.

The diameter of the holes shall be 6 to 7\u00a0mm (see Section AB in Figure 2), depending on the diameter of the detonating cord used (point\u00a0(b) under Heading 4.3.3. above).\n\n\n4.3.4.1.1.2.Cut seven lengths of flexible detonating cord (point\u00a0(b) under Heading 4.3.3. above) each 400\u00a0mm long, avoiding any loss of explosive at each end by making a clean cut and immediately sealing the end with adhesive. Push each of the seven lengths through each of the seven holes in the wooden disc (point\u00a0(j) under Heading 4.3.3. above) until their ends project a few\u00a0centimetres on the other side of the disc. Then insert a small dressmaking pin (point\u00a0(l) under Heading 4.3.3. above) transversally into the textile sleeve of each length of cord 5 to 6\u00a0mm from the end and apply adhesive around the outside of the lengths of cord in a band 2\u00a0cm wide adjacent to the pin. Finally, pull the long piece of each cord to bring the pin into contact with the wooden disc.\n\n\n4.3.4.1.1.3.Shape the plastic explosive (point (a) under Heading 4.3.3. above) to form a cylinder 92 to 96\u00a0mm in diameter, depending on the diameter of the cylinder (point\u00a0(h) under Heading 4.3.3. above). Stand this cylinder upright on a level surface and insert the shaped explosive. Then insert the wooden disc\u00a0\n17\n carrying the seven lengths of detonating cord into the top of the cylinder and press it down onto the explosive. Adjust the height of the cylinder (64 to 67\u00a0mm) so that its top edge does not extend beyond the level of the wood. Finally, fix the cylinder to the wooden disc for instance with staples or small nails, around its entire circumference.\n\n\n4.3.4.1.1.4.Group the free ends of the seven lengths of detonating cord around the circumference of the wooden rod (point (k) under Heading 4.3.3. above) so that their ends are all level in a plane perpendicular to the rod. Secure them in a bundle around the rod by means of adhesive tape\n18\n.\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.Central initiation by a compressed pellet\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.The booster charge prepared for use is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.1.Preparing a compressed pellet\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.1.Taking the necessary safety precautions, place 10\u00a0grams of a secondary explosive\u00a0(point (c) under Heading 4.3.3. above) in a mould with an inside diameter of 19 to 21\u00a0mm and compress to the correct shape and density. (The ratio of diameter: height should be roughly 1:1). In the centre of the bottom of the mould there is a peg, 12\u00a0mm in height and 7,0 to 7,3\u00a0mm in diameter (depending on the diameter of the detonator used), which forms a cylindrical recess in the compressed cartridge for subsequent insertion of the detonator.\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.2.Preparing the booster charge\n\n\n4.3.4.1.2.2.Place the explosive (point (a) under Heading 4.3.3. above) into the cylinder (point (h) under Heading 4.3.3. above) standing upright on a level surface, then press it down with a wooden die to give the explosive a cylindrical shape with a central recess. Insert the compressed pellet into this recess. Cover the cylindrically shaped explosive containing the compressed pellet with a wooden disc (point (j) under Heading 4.3.3. above) having a central hole 7,0 to 7,3\u00a0mm in diameter for insertion of a detonator. Fix the wooden disc and the cylinder together with a cross of adhesive tape. Ensure that the hole drilled in the disc and the recess in the compressed pellet are coaxial by inserting the wooden rod (point (k) under Heading 4.3.3. above).\n\n\n4.3.4.2.Preparing steel tubes for the detonation tests\n\n\n4.3.4.2.At one end of the steel tube (point (d) under Heading 4.3.3. above), drill two diametrically opposed holes 4\u00a0mm in diameter perpendicularly through the side wall at a distance of 4\u00a0mm from the edge. Butt weld the bottom plate (point (e) under Heading\u00a04.3.3. above) to the opposite end of the tube, completely filling the right angle between the bottom place and the wall of the tube with weld metal around the entire circumference of the tube.\n\n\n4.3.4.3.Filling and charging the steel tube\n\n\n4.3.4.3.See Figures 2 and 3.\n\n\n4.3.4.3.1.The test sample, the steel tube and the booster charge shall be conditioned to temperatures of 20 ( 5)\u00b0C. 16 to 18\u00a0kg of the test sample are needed for two detonation tests.\n\n\n4.3.4.3.2.1Place the tube upright with its square bottom place resting on a firm, flat surface, preferably concrete. Fill the tube to about onethird of its height with the test sample and drop it 10\u00a0cm vertically onto the floor five times to compact the prills or granules as densely as possible in the tube. To accelerate compaction, vibrate the tube by striking the side wall with a 750 to 1\u00a0000gram hammer between drops for a total of 10 times.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4.3.2.2.Repeat this charging method with another portion of the test sample. Finally, a further addition shall be made such that, after compaction by raising and dropping the tube 10\u00a0times and a total of 20 intermittent hammer blows, the charge fills the tube to a distance of 70\u00a0mm from its orifice.\n\n\n4.3.4.3.2.3The filling height of the sample shall be adjusted in the steel tube so that the booster charge (referred to above under Heading\u00a04.3.4.1.1. or 4.3.4.1.2.) to be inserted later will be in close contact with the sample over its entire surface.\n\n\n4.3.4.3.3.Insert the booster charge into the tube so that it is in contact with the sample; the top surface of the wooden disc shall be 6\u00a0mm below the end of the tube. Ensure essential close contact between explosive and test sample by adding or removing small quantities of sample. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, split pins should be inserted through the holes near the open end of the tube and their legs opened flat against the tube.\n\n\n4.3.4.4.Positioning of the steel tube and lead cylinders (see figure 4)\n\n\n4.3.4.4.1.Number the bases of the lead cylinders (point (f) under Heading 4.3.3. above) 1 to 6.  Make six marks 150\u00a0mm apart on the centre line of a steel block (4.3.7) lying on a horizontal base, with the first mark at least 75\u00a0mm from the edge of the block.  Place a lead cylinder upright on each of these marks, with the base of each cylinder centred on its mark.\n\n\n4.3.4.4.2.Lay the steel tube prepared according to 4.3.4.3. horizontally on the lead cylinders so that the axis of the tube is parallel to the centre line of the steel block and the welded end of the tube extends 50\u00a0mm beyond lead cylinder No\u00a06. To prevent the tube from rolling, insert small wooden wedges between the tops of the lead cylinders and the tube wall (one on each side) or place a cross of wood between the tube and the steel block.\n\n\nNote: Make sure that the tube is in contact with all six lead cylinders; a slight curvature of the tube surface can be compensated for by rotating the tube about its longitudinal axis; if any of the lead cylinders is too tall, tap the cylinder in question carefully with a hammer until it is the required height.\n\n\n4.3.4.5.Preparation for detonation\n\n\n4.3.4.5.1.Set up the apparatus as described under Heading\u00a04.3.4.4. in a bunker or suitably prepared underground site (e.g. mine or tunnel). Ensure that the temperature of the steel tube is kept at\u00a020\u00a0(\u00a05)\u00b0C before detonation.\n\n\nNote: Should such firing sites not be available, the work can, if necessary, be done in a concretelined pit covered over with wooden beams. Detonation can cause steel fragments to be projected with high kinetic energy, therefore, firing shall be carried out at a suitable distance from dwellings or thoroughfares.\n\n\n4.3.4.5.2.If the booster charge with sevenpoint initiation is used, ensure that the detonation cords are stretched out as described in the footnote to paragraph\u00a04.3.4.1.1.4 above and arranged as horizontally as possible.\n\n\n4.3.4.5.3.Finally, remove the wooden rod and replace with the detonator. Do not carry out firing until the danger zone has been evacuated and the test personnel have taken cover.\n\n\n4.3.4.5.4.Detonate the explosive.\n\n\n4.3.4.6.1Allow sufficient time for the fumes (gaseous and sometimes toxic decomposition products such as nitrous gases) to disperse, then collect the lead cylinders and measure their heights with a Vernier caliper\n\n\n4.3.4.6.2.Record for each of the marked lead cylinders, the degree of crushing expressed as a percentage of the original height of 100\u00a0mm. If the cylinders are crushed obliquely, record the highest and the lowest values and calculate the average.\n\n\n4.3.4.7.A probe for continuous measurement of the detonation velocity can be used; the probe should be inserted longitudinally to the axis of the tube or along its side wall.\n\n\n4.3.4.8.Two detonation tests per sample are to be carried out.\n\n\n4.3.5.Test report\n\n\n4.3.5.Values for the following parameters are to be given in the test report for each of the detonation tests:\n\n\n\uf0b7the values actually measures for the outside diameter of the steel tube and for the wall thickness,\n\n\n\n\n\uf0b7the Brinell hardness of the steel tube,\n\n\n\uf0b7the temperature of the tube and the sample shortly before firing,\n\n\n\uf0b7the packing density (kg/m3) of the sample in the steel tube,\n\n\n\uf0b7the height of each lead cylinder after firing, specifying the corresponding cylinder number,\n\n\n\uf0b7method of initiation employed for the booster charge.\n\n\n4.3.5.1.Evaluation of test results\n\n\n4.3.5.1.If, in each firing, the crushing of at least one lead cylinder is less than 5%, the test shall be considered conclusive.\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.Conformity marking and EU declaration of conformity\n\n\n5.1.The manufacturer shall affix the CE mark to each individual fertilising product that satisfies the applicable requirements of this Regulation.\n\n\n5.2.The manufacturer shall draw up a written EU declaration of conformity for each CE marked fertilising product lot and keep it together with the technical documentation at the disposal of the national authorities for 10 years after the CE marked fertilising product has been placed on the market.

Such products are eligible to be labelled 'ECfertilisers'. Companies wishing to market products of other types as EC-fertilisers must first obtain a new type-approval through a Commission decision amending that Annex. Virtually all product-types currently included in the existing Fertilisers Regulation are conventional, inorganic fertilisers, typically extracted from mines or chemically produced in line with a linear economy model. Also, the chemical processes for producing for example nitrogen-based fertilisers are both energy consuming and CO2-intensive.\n\n\n4.Around 50 % of the fertilisers currently on the market, however, are left out of the scope of the Regulation. This is true for a few inorganic fertilisers and for virtually all fertilisers produced from organic materials, such as animal or other agricultural by products, or recycled bio-waste from the food chain. Research, innovation and investment are currently developing rapidly, contributing to the circular economy by creating local jobs and by generating value from secondary, domestically sourced resources which would otherwise have been used directly on land or disposed as landfill waste, causing unnecessary eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions. There is also a servitization trend in the business, with increasing product customisation based on analysis of the soil where the fertiliser will be used. SMEs and other enterprises throughout Europe are increasingly interested in contributing to this development. However, for customised products containing organic fertilisers, access to the internal market is currently depending on mutual recognition, and therefore often hindered. \n\n\n5.The problem for innovative fertilisers with the existing regulatory construction is two-fold\n\n\n6.The first angle of the problem is that inclusion in the existing Fertilisers Regulation of types of products sourced from organic or secondary raw material is challenging. Regulators hesitate because of the relatively variable composition and characteristics of such materials. The existing Fertilisers Regulation is clearly tailored for well characterised, inorganic fertilisers from primary raw materials, and lacks the robust control mechanisms and safeguards necessary for creating trust in products from inherently variable organic or secondary material sources. Furthermore, the links with existing legislation on control of animal by-products and waste are not clear. \n\n\n7.As a result, fertilisers sourced in line with the circular economy remain non-harmonised. Many Member States have detailed, national rules and standards in place for such non-harmonised fertilisers, with environmental requirements (such as heavy metal contaminant limits) that do not apply to EC-fertilisers. Furthermore, free movement between Member States through mutual recognition has proven extremely difficult. As a result, a producer of fertilisers sourced from organic or secondary raw materials, established in one Member State and seeking to expand its market to the territory of another Member State, is often faced with administrative procedures making the market expansion prohibitively expensive. The resulting lack of critical mass hampers investment in this important sector of the circular economy. The problem is of particular importance for producers established in Member States with a small domestic market compared to the surplus of organic, secondary raw materials (typically manure) of which they dispose.\n\n\n8.In summary, the playing field in the competition between those fertilisers sourced from domestic organic or secondary raw material in line with the circular economy model and those produced in line with a linear economy model is tilted in favour of the latter. This competition distortion hampers investment in the circular economy.\n\n\n9.The problem is aggravated by the fact that one of the main fertiliser constituents is phosphate rock, which has been identified by the Commission as a critical raw material. For phosphate fertilisers, the EU is currently highly dependent on import of phosphate rock mined outside of the EU (more than 90% of the phosphate fertilisers used in the EU are imported, mainly from Morocco, Tunisia and Russia). This while domestic waste (in particular sewage sludge) contains large amounts of phosphorus, which \u2013 if recycled in line with a circular economy model \u2013 could potentially cover about 20-30% of EU's demand of phosphate fertilisers. The related investment potential remains, however, currently largely unexploited, which is partially due to the above-mentioned difficulties to access the internal market.\n\n\n10.The second angle of the current Fertilisers Regulation's limitations for innovative fertilisers is that, even for new, inorganic fertilisers from primary raw materials, the type-approval procedure is lengthy, and cannot keep up with the innovation cycle of the fertilisers sector. It has therefore been deemed necessary to fundamentally reconsider and modernise the regulatory technique, in order to increase flexibility with regard to product requirements, while maintaining a high level of protection of human, animal, and plant health, safety and the environment. The considerations undertaken in this respect are detailed below in Section\u00a03: Results of ex-post evaluations, stakeholder consultations and impact assessment.\n\n\n11.The main policy objective of the initiative is therefore to incentivise large scale fertiliser production in the EU from domestic organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops. The proposal will provide a regulatory framework radically easing access to the internal market for such fertilisers, thereby levelling their playing field with that of mined or chemical fertilisers produced in line with a linear economy model. This would contribute to the following circular economy objectives:\n\n\n\uf0b7It would allow valorisation of secondary raw materials, hence enabling improved use of raw materials and turning eutrophication and waste management problems into economic opportunities for public and private operators.\n\n\n\uf0b7It would increase resource efficiency and decrease import dependency for raw materials essential to European agriculture, in particular phosphorus.\n\n\n\uf0b7It would boost investment and innovation in the circular economy, hence creating jobs in the EU. \n\n\n\uf0b7It would contribute to relieving the fertilisers industry from its current pressure to reduce CO2-emissions under ETS, by allowing it to produce fertilisers from less carbon-intensive feedstock.\n\n\n\n\n12.Increased production and trade in innovative fertilisers would also diversify the fertilisers offered to farmers, potentially contributing to making food production more cost- and resource-effective. \n\n\nThe second reason and objective\n\n\n13.Second, the existing Fertilisers Regulation fails to address environmental concerns arising from contamination by EC-fertilisers of soil, inland waters, sea waters, and ultimately food. A well-recognised issue is the presence of cadmium in inorganic phosphate fertilisers. In the absence of EU limit values, some Member States have imposed unilateral cadmium limits for EC-fertilisers by virtue of Article 114 TFEU, hence creating a certain market fragmentation also in the harmonised field. The presence of contaminants in those fertilisers which are currently subject to national rules (e.g. nutrients recycled from sewage sludge) poses similar concerns.\n\n\n14.A second policy objective is therefore to address this issue and introduce harmonised cadmium limits for phosphate fertilisers. The setting of such limit values, aiming at minimising the negative impact of fertiliser use on the environment and on human health, will contribute to a reduction of cadmium accumulation in soil and of cadmium contamination of food and water. It will also remove the market fragmentation to which the concern currently gives rise in the form of national cadmium limits in some Member States.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n15.The proposal will repeal the existing Fertilisers Regulation, but allow already harmonised fertilisers to remain on the market subject to compliance with the new safety and quality requirements. It will define the conditions under which fertilisers produced from waste and animal by-products can leave the controls provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\u00a0October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption and repealing Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01774/2002 (Animal by-products Regulation)\n3\n and the Directive\u00a02008/98/EC on waste and repealing certain Directives\n4\n and circulate freely as CE marked fertilisers. It will be complementary to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\u00a0December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)\n5\n, which will continue to apply to chemical substances incorporated into fertilising products.\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\n16.The initiative supports the Commission's agenda for jobs, growth and investment,\u00a0by providing the right regulatory environment for investment in the real economy. \n\n\n17.In particular, the initiative will make an important and concrete contribution to the Commission's Circular Economy Package. It will create a level playing field for all fertilising products and facilitate recourse to domestic, secondary raw materials.\n\n\n18.Furthermore, the initiative supports the aim to create a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base, by removing existing barriers to free movement of certain innovative fertilisers and facilitating the market surveillance by Member States.\n\n\n19.The initiative is related to the following policy initiatives:\n\n\n\uf0b7The Circular Economy Package: The Fertilisers Regulation revision aims at establishing a regulatory framework enabling production of fertilisers from recycled bio-wastes and other secondary raw materials, in line with the Bioeconomy strategy\n6\n, which encompasses the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products. This would boost domestic sourcing of plant nutrients which are essential for a sustainable European agriculture, including the critical raw material phosphorus. It would also contribute to a better implementation of the waste hierarchy, by minimising landfilling or energy recovery of bio-wastes, and hence to solving related waste management problems.\n\n\n\uf0b7The Single Market Strategy: As described above, a well-known barrier to free movement on the internal market constitutes of heavy and diverging national regulatory frameworks for those fertilisers currently not covered by harmonisation legislation. While economic operators often regard the diverging national rules as a prohibitive obstacle to entering new markets, Member States regard the rules as essential for protecting the food chain and the environment. Because of those concerns relating to health and the environment, mutual recognition has proven exceptionally difficult in the field of non-harmonised fertilisers, and economic operators have asked for the possibility to get access to the entire internal market by complying with harmonised rules addressing those concerns at EU level.\n\n\n\uf0b7Horizon 2020: The proposal will have the potential to stimulate relevant research activities launched under Societal Challenges 2 (\u201cFood security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research, and the Bioeconomy\u201d) and 5 (\u201cClimate action,\u00a0environment, resource efficiency and raw materials\u201d), which aim, among other objectives, at providing innovative solutions for a more efficient and safer recovery of resources from waste, wastewater and bio-wastes, and at encouraging researchers to deliver innovative products in compliance with the market needs, the societal needs and the environmental protection policies. The Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking has identified i.a. phosphorus recycling for production of fertilisers as an emerging and economically promising new value chain from (organic) waste.\n7\n Easy access to the internal market for such fertilizers would be a pre-condition for achieving these goals and bringing results from research to the market.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\n20.The aim of the proposal is to improve the functioning of the internal market for fertilising products, hence addressing the issues first identified in the ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010.\u00a0The legal basis is therefore Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which is also the legal basis for the existing Fertilisers Regulation.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\n21.The first objective of the proposed action is to boost investment in production and uptake of effective, safe, innovative fertilisers produced from organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model and the Bioeconomy strategy, by helping those products reach a critical mass through access to the entire internal market. More efficient recourse to such fertilisers can offer significant environmental benefits, reduced dependency on import of critical raw materials from outside of the EU, as well as an increased variety of high quality fertilising products to farmers. The existing barriers to the free movement of such products, in the form of diverging, national regulatory frameworks, cannot be removed through Member States' unilateral actions. In particular, mutual recognition in this field has proven exceptionally difficult, and becomes an increasingly important obstacle as the interest in producing and trading high-quality fertilisers from organic or secondary raw materials tends to increase. EU action, on the other hand, could ensure the free movement of such fertilisers by establishing harmonised high quality, safety and environmental criteria. \n\n\n22.The second objective is to address cadmium contamination of soil and food through fertiliser use. Since most of the fertilisers from which the concern originates (i.e., inorganic phosphate fertilisers) are already harmonised, Member States cannot achieve this objective unilaterally. EU-wide maximum limits, on the other hand, can effectively reduce contaminants in harmonised fertilisers to safer levels. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\n23.The first objective of the initiative is that of boosting investment in production of effective, safe, innovative fertilisers produced from organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, with the related benefits for environmental impact, reduced import dependency, and increased variability of high-quality products on offer. The initiative aims at reaching a critical mass through internal market for such products. Mutual recognition of non-harmonised fertilisers has proven extremely difficult in the past, whereas product harmonisation legislation has been an effective way of securing internal market access for inorganic fertilisers. It is therefore concluded that product harmonisation legislation for fertilisers from organic or secondary raw materials does not go beyond what is necessary for providing the regulatory certainty required to incentivise large scale investment in the circular economy. The regulatory technique chosen in this proposal leaves economic operators a maximum of flexibility to put new products on the markets without compromising on safety and quality. Furthermore, it leaves Member States free to allow non-harmonised fertilisers to on the market, without depriving those economic operators seeking larger markets of the possibility to opt for the benefits of the harmonised regulatory framework.\n\n\n24.The form of a Regulation is deemed the most appropriate for harmonisation of products in a field of such technical complexity and potential impact on the food chain and the environment as fertilisers. That conclusion is supported by the fact that the existing harmonisation legislation for fertilisers also has the form of a Regulation. \n\n\n25.Regarding the second objective, i.e., addressing cadmium contamination of soil and food through use of fertilisers many of which are already harmonised, maximum levels in the product legislation is seen as an effective means of addressing the problem at source. The economic impacts are deemed proportionate to the objective of preventing irrevocable soil contamination affecting current and future generations of farmers and food consumers. \n\n\n26.The proportionality is further developed in section 4.2.2 of the Impact Assessment.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\n27.The form of a Regulation is deemed the most appropriate for harmonisation of products in a field of such technical complexity and potential impact on the food chain and the environment as fertilisers. That conclusion is supported by the fact that the existing harmonisation legislation for fertilisers also has the form of a Regulation.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\n28.The ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010 concluded\n8\n that the Regulation had been effective in meeting its objective of simplifying and harmonising the regulatory framework in relation to an important part of the fertiliser market. \n\n\n29.However, the evaluation also concluded that the Regulation could be more effective in promoting innovative fertilisers, and that adjustments would also be needed to better protect the environment. Furthermore, regarding the organic fertilisers currently left out of the scope of the Regulation, the evaluation showed that neither economic operators, nor national authorities considered that mutual recognition was the most appropriate tool for ensuring free movement, since fertilisers are products for which legitimate product quality, environmental, and human health concerns can warrant stringent rules.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\n30.Consultation of Member States and other stakeholders has been conducted extensively throughout the preparatory phase starting in 2011, in particular in the context of the Fertilisers Working Group.\n9\n The public consultation on Circular economy published in May 2015 included questions on this topic.\n10\n Stake holders were also invited to give feedback to the Roadmap for the revision of the Fertilisers Regulation published on 22\u00a0October\u00a02015.\n11\n\n\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\n31.The existing draft Impact Assessment report relies largely on the abovementioned ex-post evaluation of the Fertilisers Regulation of 2010 as well as on the study carried out in 2011 on options to fully harmonise the EU legislation on fertilising materials including technical feasibility, environmental, economic and social impacts\n12\n.\n\n\n32.Phosphorus recycling has also been addressed by FP7 research projects, the results of which have been analysed during the workshop 'Circular approaches to phosphorus: from research to deployment', held in Berlin on 4 March 2015\n13\n. One of the identified priorities is to revise the EU Fertiliser Regulation to extend its scope to nutrients from secondary sources (e.g. recycled phosphates) and organic sources.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\n33.The proposal is supported by an impact assessment, the key documents of which can be found [Once the IAR is published, insert link to the summary sheet and to the positive opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board]. The opinions of the Impact Assessment Board were taken into account by providing better evidence of the divergent national standards as a cause for market fragmentation, by clarifying the content of the various options assessed, and by better justifying the key impacts of the proposal. \n\n\n34.The impact assessment compared status quo (referred to as option 1) with four other policy options (referred to as options 2-5). Under all of the options 2-5, the scope of harmonisation would be extended to fertilisers from organic raw materials and to other fertiliser-related products, and limit values would be introduced for contaminants. The options would build on different control mechanisms: Under option 2, the regulatory technique of the Fertilisers Regulation, i.e., type-approval, would remain un-changed. Under option 3, the type-approval would be replaced by a positive, exhaustive list of materials eligible for intentional incorporation into a fertiliser. Option 4 would achieve the necessary control through the 'New Legislative Framework' ('NLF'), with one conformity assessment procedure applicable across the board. Finally, option 5 would also build on the NLF, but the conformity assessment procedure would vary between material categories. For all four options 2-5, it was also examined whether the harmonisation should be mandatory for all products with a given function, or whether fertilisers could comply with the harmonised legislation on an optional basis, as an alternative to any applicable national legislation and mutual recognition, as is the case under status quo for inorganic fertilisers.\n\n\n35.The final proposal corresponds with option\u00a05, coupled with the variant of optional harmonisation. It was considered to be the best policy choice because it would lead to administrative simplification, in particular for fertilising products from well identified, primary raw materials, and ensure flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the use of harmonised fertilising products does not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n36.The proposal will mainly affect those producers of innovative fertilisers produced from organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, who will be able to reach a critical mass through radically facilitated access to the internal market. Such producers will benefit from the initiative in particular in those Member States which are not providing a sufficiently large home market for new types of fertilisers.\n\n\n37.It will also affect private and public recovery operators (such as operators of waste water treatment plants, or of waste management plants producing compost or digestate) who will be able to valorise their output, and thus facilitate investments in such infrastructure. \n\n\n38.Many national authorities will see a decreased workload when national registration or authorisation systems for fertilisers are fully or partially replaced by EU-wide control mechanisms. \n\n\n39.Finally, farmers and other fertiliser users are likely to see an increase in the product variety offered to them, while the general public will be better protected from contamination of soil, water and food.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\n40.The proposal will lead to simplification and reduction of the administrative burden for producers of fertilising products seeking access to more than one national territory on the internal market, since such access will no longer depend on mutual recognition. At the same time, it will avoid banning or restricting market access for producers that do not aim at compliance with EU-level rules, by keeping open the possibility to access national markets subject to any national rules and mutual recognition.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n41.The proposal will have no implications on the EU budget. Human and administrative resources within the European Commission will remain unchanged compared with the implementation and monitoring of the existing Fertilisers Regulation.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\n42.The European Commission will assist and monitor Member States' implementation of the Regulation. It will also analyse the need for guidance, standards or schemes proving sustainability of fertilising products, thus allowing sustainability-claims on the product labels. \n\n\n43.The Commission furthermore intends to include additional component material categories in the Annexes, to keep up with technological progress allowing the production of safe and effective fertilisers from recovered, secondary raw materials, such as biochar, ashes and struvite. Finally, the Commission will keep the requirements in the Annexes under constant review, and revise them wherever necessary to provide an adequate protection of human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n44.Chapter\u00a01 of the proposed Regulation sets out the subject matter, scope and definitions, as well as the fundamental principles of free movement and marketability of CE marked fertilising products. The provision on product requirements refers to Annexes\u00a0I and II, which contain the substantive requirements for the categories of end-products in accordance with their intended function (Annex\u00a0I), as well as for the categories of component materials that can be contained in CE marked fertilising products (Annex\u00a0II). It also refers to Annex\u00a0III, which specifies the labelling requirements.\n\n\n45.Chapter\u00a02 lays down the obligations of economic operators involved in making CE\u00a0marked fertilising products available on the market. \n\n\n46.Chapter\u00a03 sets out the general principle for conformity of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products. It refers to Annex\u00a0IV, which describes in detail the conformity assessment procedures applicable to CE\u00a0marked fertilising products, depending on their component material categories and their product function categories. It also refers to Annex\u00a0V, which sets out the model structure for the EU declaration of conformity.\n\n\n47.Chapter\u00a04 sets out the provisions on notified bodies, and Chapter\u00a05 sets out the provisions on market surveillance. Chapter\u00a06 sets out the conditions for the Commission's adoption of delegated and implementing acts, and Chapter\u00a07 sets out final provisions.\n\n\n2016/0084 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\n\n\nlaying down rules on the making available on the market of CE marked fertilising products and amending Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n14\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n15\n, which almost exclusively covers fertilisers from mined or chemically produced, inorganic materials. There is also a need to make use of recycled or organic materials for fertilising purposes. Harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from such recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market should be established in order to provide an important incentive for their further use. The scope of the harmonisation should therefore be extended in order to include recycled and organic materials.\n\n\n(2)Certain products are being used in combination with fertilisers for the purpose of improving nutrition efficiency, with the beneficial effect of reducing the amount of fertilisers used and hence their environmental impact. In order to facilitate their free movement on the internal market, not only fertilisers, i.e. products intended to provide plants with nutrient, but also products intended to improve plants' nutrition efficiency, should be covered by the harmonisation.\n\n\n(3)Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n16\n lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking. That Regulation should be applicable to products covered by the scope of this Regulation in order to ensure that products benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Union fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as health and safety in general, protection of consumers and protection of the environment.\n\n\n(4)Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n17\n lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02003/2003 should therefore be replaced by a Regulation drafted to the extent possible in accordance with that Decision.\n\n\n(5)Contrary to most other product harmonisation measures in Union legislation, Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02003/2003 does not prevent non-harmonised fertilisers from being made available on the internal market in accordance with national law and the general free movement rules of the Treaty. In view of the very local nature of certain product markets, this possibility should remain. Compliance with harmonised rules should therefore remain optional, and should be required only for products, intended to provide plants with nutrient or improve plants' nutrition efficiency, which are CE\u00a0marked when made available on the market. This Regulation should therefore not apply to products which are not CE marked when made available on the market.\n\n\n(6)Different product functions warrant different product safety and quality requirements adapted to their different intended uses. CE marked fertilising products should therefore be divided into different product function categories, which should each be subject to specific safety and quality requirements.\n\n\n(7)Similarly, different component materials warrant different process requirements and control mechanisms adapted to their different potential hazardousness and variability. Component materials for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products should therefore be divided into different categories, which should each be subject to specific process requirements and control mechanisms. It should be possible to make available on the market a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product composed of several component materials from various component material categories, where each material complies with the requirements of the category to which the material belongs.\n\n\n(8)Contaminants in CE\u00a0marked fertilising products, such as cadmium, can potentially pose a risk to human and animal health and the environment as they accumulate in the environment and enter the food chain. Their content should therefore be limited in such products. Furthermore, impurities in CE\u00a0marked fertilising products derived from bio-waste, in particular polymers but also metal and glass, should be either prevented or limited to the extent technically feasible by detection of such impurities in separately collected bio-waste before processing. \n\n\n(9)Products complying with all the requirements of this Regulation should be allowed to move freely on the internal market. Where one or more of the component materials in a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n, but reaches a point in the manufacturing chain beyond which it no longer poses any significant risk to public or animal health (the 'end point in the manufacturing chain'), it would represent an unnecessary administrative burden to continue subjecting the product to the provisions of that Regulation. Such fertilising products should therefore be excluded from the requirements of that Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(10)The end point in the manufacturing chain should be determined for each relevant component material containing animal by-products in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009. Where a manufacturing process regulated under this Regulation starts already before that end point has been reached, the process requirements of both Regulation (EC) No\u00a01069/2009 and this Regulation should apply cumulatively to CE\u00a0marked fertilising products, which means application of the stricter requirement in case both Regulations regulate the same parameter. \n\n\n(11)In the event of risks to public or animal health from CE\u00a0marked fertilising products derived from animal by-products, recourse to safeguard measures in accordance with Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n19\n should be possible, as is the case for other categories of products derived from animal by-products.\n\n\n\n\n(12)Where one or more of the component materials for a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 and has not reached the end point in the manufacturing chain, it would be misleading to provide for the product's CE marking under this Regulation, since the making available on the market of such a product is subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009. Therefore, such products should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n\n\n(13)For certain recovered wastes within the meaning of Directive\u00a02008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n20\n, a market demand for their use as fertilising products has been identified. Furthermore, certain requirements are necessary for the waste used as input in the recovery operation and for the treatment processes and techniques, as well as for fertilising products resulting from the recovery operation, in order to ensure that the use of those products does not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts. For CE\u00a0marked fertilising products, those requirements should be laid down in this Regulation. Therefore, as of the moment of compliance with all the requirements of this Regulation, such products should cease to be regarded as waste within the meaning of Directive\u00a02008/98/EC.\n\n\n(14)Certain substances and mixtures, commonly referred to as agronomic additives, improve the nutrient release pattern of a nutrient in a fertiliser. Substances and mixtures made available on the market with the intention of them being added to CE\u00a0marked fertilising products for that purpose should fulfil certain efficacy criteria at the responsibility of the manufacturer of those substances or mixtures, and should therefore as such be considered as CE\u00a0marked fertilising products under this Regulation. Furthermore, CE\u00a0marked fertilising products containing such substances or mixtures should be subject to certain efficacy and safety criteria. Such substances and mixtures should therefore also be regulated as component materials for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products.\n\n\n(15)Certain substances, mixtures and micro-organisms, commonly referred to as plant biostimulants, are not as such nutrients, but nevertheless stimulate plants' nutrition processes. Where such products aim solely at improving the plants' nutrient use efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, or crop quality traits, they are by nature more similar to fertilising products than to most categories of plant protection products. Such products should therefore be eligible for CE\u00a0marking under this Regulation and excluded from the scope of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n21\n. Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n\n(16)Products with one or more functions, one of which is covered by the scope of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01107/2009, should remain under the control tailored for such products and provided for by that Regulation. Where such products also have the function of a fertilising product, it would be misleading to provide for their CE\u00a0marking under this Regulation, since the making available on the market of a plant protection product is contingent on a product authorisation valid in the Member State in question. Therefore, such products should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n\n\n(17)This Regulation should not prevent the application of existing Union legislation relating to aspects of protection of health, safety and the environment not covered by this Regulation. This Regulation should therefore apply without prejudice to Council Directive\u00a086/278/EEC\n22\n, Council Directive\u00a089/391/EEC\n23\n, Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n24\n, Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n25\n, Commission Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 1881/2006\n26\n, Council Directive 2000/29/EC\n27\n, Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a098/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n28\n, and Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a01143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n29\n. \n\n\n(18)Where a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product contains a substance or mixture within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006, the safety of its constituent substances for the intended use should be established through registration pursuant to that Regulation. The information requirements should ensure that the safety of the intended use of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product is demonstrated in a manner comparable to that achieved through other regulatory regimes for products intended for use on arable soil or crops, notably Member States' national fertiliser legislation and Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01107/2009. Therefore, where the actual quantities placed on the market are lower than 10 tonnes per company per year, the information requirements determined by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 for the registration of substances in quantities of 10\u00a0to 100 tonnes should exceptionally apply as a condition for making available pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n\n(19)Where the actual quantities of substances in CE\u00a0marked fertilising products regulated by this Regulation are higher than 100\u00a0tonnes, the additional information requirements laid down in Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01907/2006 should apply directly by virtue of that Regulation. The application of the other provisions of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01907/2006 should also remain unaffected by this Regulation.\n\n\n(20)A blend of different CE\u00a0marked fertilising products, each of which has been subject to a successful assessment of conformity with the applicable requirements for that material, can itself be expected to be suitable for use as a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product, subject only to certain additional requirements warranted by the blending. Therefore, in order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, such blends should belong to a separate category, for which the conformity assessment should be limited to the additional requirements warranted by the blending.\n\n\n(21)Economic operators should be responsible for the compliance of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products with this Regulation, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the aspects of public interest covered by this Regulation, and also to guarantee fair competition on the internal market.\n\n\n(22)It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n\n\n(23)The manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n\n\n(24)It is necessary to ensure that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products from third countries that enter the internal market comply with this Regulation, and in particular that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those fertilising products. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Regulation and that they do not place on the market CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk to human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment. Provision should also be made for such importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n\n\n(25)When placing a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product on the market, the importer should indicate on the packaging of the fertilising product his or her name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he or she can be contacted, in order to enable market surveillance.\n\n\n(26)Since the distributor makes a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer, he or she should act with due care to ensure that his or her handling of the fertilising product does not adversely affect the compliance of that product with this Regulation.\n\n\n(27)An economic operator who either places a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product on the market under his or her own name or trade mark or modifies a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product in such a way that compliance with the provisions of this Regulation may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n\n\n(28)Since distributors and importers are close to the market place, they should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by competent national authorities, and should be required to participate actively and provide those authorities with all necessary information relating to the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product.\n\n\n(29)Ensuring traceability of a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities\u2019 task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising products available on the market. When keeping the information required for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product or to whom they have supplied a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product, since such updated information is normally not available to them.\n\n\n(30)In order to facilitate the assessment of conformity with safety and quality requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a01025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n30\n.\n\n\n(31)Where harmonised standards have not been adopted, or do not with sufficient detail cover all elements of the quality and safety requirements laid down in this Regulation, uniform conditions for implementing those requirements may be needed. The Commission should therefore be empowered to adopt implementing acts setting out those conditions in common specifications. For reasons of legal certainty, it should be clarified that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products must comply with such specifications even if they are considered to be in conformity with harmonised standards.\n\n\n\n\n(32)In order to enable the economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to verify that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products made available on the market comply with the requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. However, it is necessary to adapt those modules in order to reflect specific aspects of fertilising products. In particular, it is necessary to reinforce the quality systems and the involvement of notified bodies for the conformity assessment of certain CE\u00a0marked fertilising products derived from recovered waste.\n\n\n(33)In order to ensure that CE\u00a0marked ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content do not endanger safety, and that such fertilisers are not used for purposes other than those for which they are intended, for example as explosives, such fertilisers should be subject to specific requirements relating to detonation resistance testing and to traceability.\n\n\n(34)To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, information regarding conformity with all Union acts applicable to CE marked fertilising products should be given in the form of a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n\n\n(35)The CE marking, indicating the conformity of a fertilising product, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Specific rules governing the affixing of the CE marking in the case of fertilising products should be laid down. \n\n\n(36)Certain conformity assessment procedures set out in this Regulation require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n\n\n(37)It is essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n\n\n(38)If a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Regulation.\n\n\n(39)In order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of CE marked fertilising products, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n\n\n(40)The system set out in this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n\n\n(41)Due to the variable nature of certain fertilising product component materials, and the potentially irreversible nature of some of the damages to which soil and crop exposure to impurities could lead, transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity of CE marked fertilising products containing such components, should be the only means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies.\n\n\n(42)Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for CE marked fertilising products to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n\n\n(43)It is necessary to provide for an efficient and transparent notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n\n\n(44)Since the services offered by notified bodies may relate to CE marked fertilising products made available on the market throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n\n\n(45)In the interest of easing market access, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n\n\n(46)In order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on internal market surveillance and control of products entering the internal market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to CE marked fertilising products covered by this Regulation. This Regulation should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks. \n\n\n(47)CE-marked fertilising products should be placed on the market only if they are sufficiently effective and do not present unacceptable risks to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, and under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour. Therefore, requirements for safety and quality, as well as appropriate control mechanisms, should be established. Furthermore, the intended use of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products should not lead to food or feed becoming unsafe. \n\n\n(48)Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02003/2003 provides for a safeguard procedure allowing the Commission to examine the justification for a measure taken by a Member State against EC fertilisers considered to constitute a risk. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with the view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.\n\n\n(49)The existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to CE\u00a0marked fertilising products presenting an unacceptable risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage in respect of such fertilising products.\n\n\n(50)Where the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, further involvement of the Commission should be required only where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard, in which case the procedure of formal objection to harmonised standards laid down in Regulation\u00a0(EU) No\u00a01025/2012 should apply.\u00a0\n\n\n(51)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n31\n.\n\n\n\n\n(52)The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requiring the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification, since such acts do not fall within the ambit of Article\u00a02(2) of Regulation\u00a0(EU) No 182/2011.\n\n\n(53)The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which present an unacceptable risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, since such acts fall within the ambit of Article\u00a02(2) of Regulation\u00a0(EU) No 182/2011. For the same reason, it should also be used for the adoption, amendment or repeal of common specifications.\n\n\n(54)The Commission should, by means of implementing acts, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising products are justified or not. Since those acts will relate to the question whether national measures are justified, there is no need for the acts to be subject to control by the Member States.\n\n\n(55)Promising technical progress is being made in the field of recycling of waste, such as phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge, and fertilising product production from animal by-products, such as biochar. It should be possible for products containing or consisting of such materials to access the internal market without unnecessary delay when the manufacturing processes have been scientifically analysed and process requirements have been established at Union level. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of defining larger or additional categories of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products or component materials eligible for use in the production of such products. For animal by-products, component material categories should be expanded or added only to the extent an end point in the manufacturing chain has been determined in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01069/2009, since animal by-products for which no such end point has been determined are in any event excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n\n\n(56)Furthermore, it should be possible to react immediately to new findings regarding the conditions for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products to be sufficiently effective and to new risk assessments regarding human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to amend the requirements applicable to various categories of CE\u00a0marked fertilising products.\n\n\n(57)In exercising those powers, it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n\n(58)Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n\n(59)It is necessary to provide for transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market of EC fertilisers that have been placed on the market in accordance with Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02003/2003 before the date of application of this Regulation without those products having to comply with further product requirements. Distributors should therefore be able to supply EC fertilisers that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of this Regulation.\n\n\n(60)It is necessary to provide for sufficient time for economic operators to comply with their obligations under this Regulation, and for Member States to set up the administrative infrastructure necessary for its application. The application should therefore be deferred to a date where those preparations can reasonably be finalised.\n\n\n(61)Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to guarantee the functioning of the internal market while ensuring that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of human, animal, and plant health, safety and the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\n\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n\nArticle 1\n\nScope\n\n\n1.This Regulation shall apply to CE\u00a0marked fertilising products.\n\n\nHowever, this Regulation shall not apply to the following products:\n\n\n(a)animal by-products which are subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009,\n\n\n(b)plant protection products covered by the scope of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01107/2009.\n\n\n2.This Regulation shall not affect the application of the following acts :\n\n\n(a)Directive\u00a086/278/EEC;\n\n\n(b)Directive\u00a089/391/EEC;

Where compliance of such a fertilising product with the applicable requirements laid down in this Regulation has been demonstrated by that procedure, manufacturers shall affix the CE\u00a0marking, draw up an EU declaration of conformity and ensure that the declaration accompanies the fertilising product when placed on the market. \n\n\n3.Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product covered by those documents has been placed on the market.\n\n\n4.Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products that are part of a series production to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Changes in production method or characteristics of those fertilising products and changes in the harmonised standards, common specifications referred to in Article\u00a013 or other technical specifications by reference to which conformity of a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product is declared shall be adequately taken into account. \n\n\nWhen deemed appropriate with regard to the performance of, or the risks presented by, a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product, manufacturers shall carry out sample testing of such fertilising products made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming CE\u00a0marked fertilising products and recalls of such products, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring. \n\n\n5.Manufacturers shall ensure that the packaging of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which they have placed on the market bears a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification or, where the fertilising products are supplied without packaging, that the required information is provided in a document accompanying each fertilising product.\n\n\n6.Manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted on the packaging of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product or, where the fertilising product is supplied without packaging, in a document accompanying the fertilising product. The postal address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n\n\n7.Manufacturers shall ensure that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products are labelled in accordance with Annex\u00a0III, or where the fertilising product is supplied without packaging, that the labelling statements are provided in a document accompanying the fertilising product and accessible for inspection purposes when the product is placed on the market. The labelling statement shall be in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned, and shall be clear, understandable and intelligible.\n\n\n8.Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that fertilising product into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, if appropriate. \n\n\nFurthermore, where manufacturers consider or have reason to believe that CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which they have placed on the market present an unacceptable risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, they shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the fertilising products available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of any non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n\n\n9.Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.

The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose. \n\n\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation, the market surveillance authorities find that the CE market fertilising product does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions within a reasonable period to bring the fertilising product into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the fertilising product from the market, to recall it, or to remove the CE marking.\n\n\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\n\n\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph.\n\n\n\n\n2.Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n\n\n3.The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the CE\u00a0marked fertilising products concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. \n\n\n4.Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product being made available on their national market, to withdraw the fertilising product from that market or to recall it.\n\n\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n\n\n5.The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising product, the origin of that fertilising product, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:\n\n\n(a)failure of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product to meet the requirements set out in Annexes\u00a0I, II or III \n\n\n(b)shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 12 conferring a presumption of conformity.\n\n\n6.Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n\n\n7.Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n\n\n8.Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal, are taken without delay in respect of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product concerned.\n\n\nArticle 38\n\nUnion safeguard procedure\n\n\n1.Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 37(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act in the form of a decision determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\n\n\nIf the national measure is considered justified, the decision shall order all Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising product is withdrawn from their market, and to inform the Commission accordingly. \n\n\nIf the national measure is considered unjustified, the decision shall order the Member State concerned to withdraw that measure.\n\n\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n\n\n2.Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 37(5), the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n\nArticle 39\n\nCompliant CE\u00a0marked fertilising products which present a risk\n\n\n1.Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 37(1), a Member State finds that although a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product is in compliance with this Regulation it presents an unacceptable risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures within a reasonable period to ensure that the fertilising product concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the fertilising product from the market or to recall it.\n\n\n2.The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the CE\u00a0marked fertilising products concerned that he or she has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n\n\n3.The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of that fertilising product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n\n\n\n\n4.The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act in the form of a decision determining whether the national measure is justified or not, and where necessary, ordering appropriate measures.\n\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\u00a041(3).\n\n\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 41(4).\n\n\n5.The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n\n\nArticle 40\n\nFormal non-compliance\n\n\n1.Without prejudice to Article 37, where a Member State makes one of the following findings on a CE\u00a0marked fertilising product, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n\n\n(a)the CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0765/2008 or of Article 17 of this Regulation;\n\n\n(b)the identification number of the notified body has been affixed in violation of Article 17 or has not been affixed, where required by Article 17;\n\n\n(c)the EU declaration of conformity does not accompany the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product;\n\n\n(d)the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly;\n\n\n(e)technical documentation is either not available or not complete;\n\n\n(f)the information referred to in Article 6(6) or Article 8(3) is absent, false or incomplete;\n\n\n(g)any other administrative requirement provided for in Article 6 or Article 8 is not fulfilled.\n\n\n2.Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the Member State concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the CE\u00a0marked fertilising product being made available on the market or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market or that the CE\u00a0marking is removed.\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nCommittee and delegated acts\n\n\nArticle 41\n\nCommittee procedure\n\n\n1.The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Fertilising products. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011. \n\n\n2.Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 shall apply.\n\n\n3.Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 shall apply.\n\n\n4.Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011, in conjunction with Article 5 thereof, shall apply.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 42\n\nAmendments of Annexes\n\n\n1.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 43 to amend Annexes\u00a0I to IV for the purposes of adapting them to technical progress and facilitating internal market access and free movement for CE\u00a0marked fertilising products\n\n\n(a)which are likely to be subject of significant trade on the internal market, and \n\n\n(b)for which there is scientific evidence that the they do not present an unacceptable risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, and that they are sufficiently effective.\n\n\n2.Where the Commission amends Annex\u00a0II in order to add new micro-organisms to the component material category for such organisms pursuant to paragraph\u00a01, it shall do so on the basis of the following data:\n\n\n(a)name of the micro-organism;\n\n\n(b)taxonomic classification of the micro-organism;\n\n\n(c)historical data of safe production and use of the micro-organism\n\n\n(d)taxonomic relation to micro-organism species fulfilling the requirements for a Qualified Presumption of Safety as established by the European Food Safety Agency;\n\n\n(e)information on residue levels of toxins;\n\n\n(f)information on the production process; and\n\n\n(g)information on the identity of residual intermediates or microbial metabolites in the component material.\n\n\n3.When adopting delegated acts in accordance with paragraph\u00a01, the Commission may amend the component material categories set out in Annex II in order to add animal by-products within the meaning of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 1069/2009 only where an end point in the manufacturing chain has been determined for such products in accordance with the procedures laid down in that Regulation.\n\n\n4.The Commission shall also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 43 to amend Annexes\u00a0I to IV in the light of new scientific evidence. The Commission shall use this empowerment where, based on a risk assessment, an amendment proves necessary to ensure that any CE\u00a0marked fertilising product complying with the requirements of this Regulation does not, under normal conditions of use, present an unacceptable risk to human, animal, or plant health, to safety or to the environment.\n\n\nArticle 43\n\nExercise of the delegation\n\n\n1.The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n\n\n2.The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 42 shall be conferred on the Commission for five years from [Publications office, please insert the date of entry into force of this Regulation].
