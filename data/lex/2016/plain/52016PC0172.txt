In this context, the revised agreement provided for the possibility for GPA Parties to use arbitration procedures in cases where objections regarding proposed rectification, transfer of an entity from one annex to another, withdrawal of an entity or other modification of Party's annexes to Appendix I were raised and the objection could not be solved through consultations. Article XIX:8 of the revised agreement stipulates that the GPA Committee has to adopt arbitration procedures to facilitate resolution of objections as mentioned above.\n\n\nIn view of the entry into force of the revised GPA Parties have extensively discussed the content of such arbitration procedures considering various options to be applied in case of objections to proposed modification of Party's procurement coverage and could find a consensus on the matter. In this regard, a draft decision on arbitration procedures has been prepared. In order to adopt this draft decision, the Commission needs to be enabled by the Council to express the Union\u2019s opinion within the GPA Committee on the adoption of the decision. \n\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\n\n\nThis is the standard procedure followed when the Commission needs to express the Union\u2019s opinion within the GPA Committee on decisions which entail changes in the rights and obligations of the Union.\n\n\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\n\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, when a decision having legal effect needs to be taken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. The decision of the GPA Committee adopting the arbitration procedures pursuant to Article XIX: 8 of the revised GPA falls under Article 218(9) TFEU as the decision is taken in a body set up by an international agreement and it will have legal effects.\n\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) \n\n\nThe Union has exclusive competence in trade related matters. The concerted action at Union level can ensure the best leverage towards third countries.\n\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\n\nArticle 218(9) TFEU provides that, when a decision having legal effect needs to be taken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, should adopt a Decision establishing the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n \u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\n\nThe adoption of a decision on arbitration procedures in the framework of an international agreement where the Union is a party does not necessitate an impact assessment.\n\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Explanatory documents (for directives)\n\n\nNot relevant.\n\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\n\n\n\nContent of the draft decision on arbitration procedures pursuant to Article XIX:8 of the revised GPA\n\n\nInvocation of arbitration procedures\n\n\nThe draft decision on arbitration procedures sets out conditions of substance and time under which GPA Parties may refer a proposed modification of a Party's procurement coverage to arbitration. It also clarifies the procedure to be followed where several Parties object to the same modification in view of agreement on a single arbitration.\n\n\nAppointment of the arbitrators\n\n\nThe draft decision indicates the number and the requirements to be met by arbitrators in order to be appointed. In particular, it stipulates that citizens of the Parties to the arbitration and government officials of the third Parties should not be appointed as arbitrators.\n\n\nThird Party participation\n\n\nAccording to the draft decision, third Parties will be entitled to participate in the arbitration procedures when they have a substantial interest in the proposed modification brought to  arbitration and when they have notified their interest to the Committee on Government Procurement. The draft decision stipulates the rights of such third Parties.\n\n\nProcedures\n\n\nThe working procedures to be followed by the appointed arbitrators are set out in the draft decision. These refer to the adoption of a timetable for the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, the conduct of substantive meetings with the Parties and the treatment of confidential information submitted by the Parties. The draft decision stipulates the way how substantive meetings and the deliberations of the arbitrators are to be conducted.\n\n\nArbitrators' determination\n\n\nThe draft decision provides indications for the points of content, form and timeline of the arbitrators' determination and in relevant cases, the possibility for Parties to ask the arbitrators to determine the level of compensatory adjustment as to obtain a comparable level of procurement coverage by the modifying Party and maintain the balance of rights and obligations under the GPA.\n\n\nCommission position on the draft decision on arbitration procedures\n\n\nThe draft decision stipulates the conditions under which Parties will be able to refer to  arbitration procedures objections regarding a modification proposed by a Party to its procurement coverage, in cases where divergences could not be solved through consultations. It sets out a procedural framework which will provide clarity, legal certainty and efficiency in the handling of objections to proposed modifications of coverage.  \n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\nThe Commission recommends that the draft decision on arbitration procedures as attached be adopted by the GPA Committee.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is proposed that the Commission be authorised to express within the Committee on Government Procurement the position of the Union in favour of the adoption of the draft GPA Committee decision on arbitration procedures pursuant to article XIX:8 of the revised GPA.\n\n\n2016/0090 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\nestablishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Committee on Government Procurement as regards the draft decision on arbitration procedures pursuant to Article XIX:8 of the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement\n\n\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)The Revised Agreement on Government Procurement (\u02bbthe GPA\u02bc) which entered into force on 6 April 2014, lays down a revamped legal framework applicable by the GPA Parties to covered procurement.
