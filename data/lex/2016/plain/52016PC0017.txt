The negotiations were launched in September 2013 in Brussels and were conducted in a smooth and resource-efficient way as well as in a relatively short time, and they were concluded in June 2015. Both sides initialled the Agreement in Brussels on 23 September 2015. The Agreement was signed on XXX in Brussels. The European Parliament was consulted and has given its consent for the conclusion of this agreement.\n\n\nThe Agreement with New Zealand will establish a legal basis to allow direct and structured cooperation including mutual administrative assistance against fraud, in customs matters, with a trade partner being influential on the international customs scene (namely in the World Customs Organisation) and in the Pacific region.\n\n\nThe general objective of the Agreement is to develop and intensify cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters with New Zealand; in particular, to establish the legal basis for a cooperation framework which aims at securing the supply chain and facilitating legitimate trade, as well as enabling information exchange to ensure the proper application of customs legislation and the prevention, investigation and combating of breaches of customs legislation.\n\n\nThe Agreement provides a basis to further develop customs cooperation in future if warranted, for example through the establishment of Mutual Recognition of respective trade partnership programmes (Authorised Economic Operators in the EU).\n\n\nThe EU has already concluded similar customs cooperation agreements with the USA, China, Japan, Korea, India, Canada and Hong Kong.\n\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\nThe Council is asked to adopt a decision on the conclusion of the draft Agreement based on Article 207 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\nThe proposal falls under the common commercial policy, exclusive competence of the Union.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nMember States were consulted in the framework of the Council Working Party on Customs Union.\n\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe proposal has no budgetary implications for the Union budget.\n\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\n\nA Joint Customs Cooperation Committee will be established, consisting of representatives of the customs and other competent authorities of both parties. It shall guarantee the proper functioning and implementation of the Agreement and examine all issues arising from its application.\n\n\n\n2016/0006 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament\n1\n,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)In accordance with Council Decision XXX of (date) the Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters was signed on XXX, subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n\n\n(2)The European Union and New Zealand should establish the legal basis for a cooperation framework which aims at securing the supply chain and facilitating legitimate trade, as well as enabling information exchange to ensure the proper application of customs legislation and the prevention, investigation and combating of breaches of customs legislation.\n\n\n(3)The Agreement should be approved on behalf of the European Union,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.\n\n\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe President of the Council shall designate the person empowered to give, on behalf of the European Union, the notification provided for in Article 21(1) of the Agreement, in order to express the consent of the European Union to be bound by the Agreement.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOJ C , , p. .\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION\nBrussels, 21.1.2016\nCOM(2016) 17 final\nANNEX\nAgreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters\n\nto the\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX\n\n\nAgreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters\n\n\n\nto the\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Union\u201d) and NEW ZEALAND, (hereinafter referred as the Contracting Parties)\n\n\n\nCONSIDERING the importance of the commercial links between New Zealand and the Union and desirous of contributing, to the benefit of both Contracting Parties, to the harmonious development of those links;\n\n\n\nRECOGNISING that, in order to attain this objective, there should be an undertaking to develop customs cooperation;\n\n\n\nTAKING into account the development of customs cooperation between the Contracting Parties, concerning customs procedures;\n\n\n\nCONSIDERING that operations in breach of customs legislation are prejudicial to the economic, fiscal and commercial interests of both Contracting Parties, and recognising the importance of ensuring the accurate assessment of customs duties and other taxes;\n\n\n\nCONVINCED that action against such operations can be made more effective by cooperation between customs authorities;\n\n\n\nRECOGNISING the significant role of customs authorities and the importance of customs procedures in promoting trade facilitation and the protection of citizens;\n\n\n\n\n\nAIMING to provide a framework to enhance cooperation with a view to further simplifying and harmonising customs procedures and promoting joint action in the context of relevant international initiatives including trade facilitation and enhanced supply chain security;\u00a0\n\n\n\nRECOGNISING the significance of the Trade Facilitation Agreement negotiated under the auspices of the WTO and highlighting the importance of its adoption and effective implementation;
