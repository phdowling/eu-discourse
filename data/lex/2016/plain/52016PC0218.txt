The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee (annexed to the proposed Council Decision) aims to amend Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement on cooperation in specific fields outside the

Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement Decision (EU) 2015/2240 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 establishing a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2 programme) as a means for modernising the public sector\n1\n needs to be incorporated in the EEA Agreement.\n\n\nProtocol 31 to the EEA Agreement should therefore be amended in order to allow for this extended cooperation to take place from 1 January 2016.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Liechtenstein shall be exempted from the participation in, and the financial contribution to, this programme.\n\n\n2016/0115 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European
