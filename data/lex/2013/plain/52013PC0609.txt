In accordance with Article 395(2) of\r\nthe VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter\r\ndated 10 June 2013 of the request made by the Italian Republic. By letter dated\r\n14 June 2013, the Commission notified the Italian Republic that it had all the\r\ninformation necessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nChapter 1 of Title XII of the VAT Directive\r\nallows for the possibility for Member States to apply special schemes for small\r\nenterprises, including the possibility of exempting taxable persons below a\r\ncertain annual turnover. This exemption implies that a taxable person does not\r\nhave to charge VAT on his supplies and, consequently, he cannot deduct VAT on\r\nhis inputs.\nThis measure was first introduced in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 14 of Council Directive 67/228/EEC[1]. However, those Member States\r\nwhich did not make use of the option provided for under that provision could\r\nsubsequently, according to Article 24(2)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC now recast\r\nas the first paragraph of Article 285 of the VAT Directive, only exempt taxable\r\npersons from VAT whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 5 000. The Italian Republic did not make use of the option provided by Article 14 of Council Directive\r\n67/228/EEC.\nBecause of a significant number of taxable\r\npersons with a very low annual turnover, the Italian Republic requested a\r\nderogation in 2007 in order to simplify VAT obligations for small traders and\r\nto ease the collection of the tax for the national tax administration by\r\nexempting taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 30 000.\r\nThis derogation was authorised by Council Decision 2008/737/EC[2] until 31 December 2010, and\r\nsubsequently extended by Council Decision 2010/688/EU[3] up to 31 December 2013. The Italian Republic has now requested that the measure, which is optional for taxable persons,\r\nbe extended to 31 December 2016. The Italian Republic has also requested that the\r\nannual turnover threshold be increased to EUR 65 000. By increasing the threshold, Italy makes the measure\r\navailable to a greater number of SMEs. This is in line\r\nwith the objectives of the\r\nCommission Communication \u201cThink Small First\u201d - A \u201cSmall Business Act\u201d for\r\nEurope (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008), which calls on the Member\r\nStates to take account of the special features of SMEs when designing\r\nlegislation and, therefore, to simplify the existing regulatory environment.\r\nMoreover, no problems have been identified in the application of the measure,\r\nnor in monitoring those businesses it covers.\nIn its proposal for a Directive simplifying\r\nVAT obligations of 29 October 2004 (COM (2004) 728 final)[4] the Commission included\r\nprovisions aimed at allowing the Member States to exempt taxable persons whose\r\nannual turnover does not exceed a ceiling of EUR 100 000 with the possibility\r\nof updating this amount each year. However, the Council has, as at this stage,\r\nnot yet reached an agreement on that proposal.\nFrom information provided by the Italian Republic it appears that the impact of the measure on tax revenue collected at the\r\nfinal consumption stage will be negligible.\nIt is therefore proposed to extend the\r\nderogation for another period until the earliest of 13 December 2016 or the\r\nentry into force of a Directive on the annual turnover thresholds below which\r\ntaxable persons may be exempt from VAT, and to increase the threshold to EUR 65\r\n000.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nIn 2004, the Commission made a proposal to\r\n- inter alia - increase the annual turnover threshold available to Member\r\nStates (COM(2004) 728 final[5])\r\nfor the exemption from VAT of taxable persons to EUR 100 000. That\r\nproposal is still on the table of the Council.\nIn the medium term, the Commission\r\nconsiders that the adoption of that proposal would be a more appropriate way\r\nforward than having a piecemeal approach based on individual derogations. The\r\nCommission therefore calls on the Council to resume the negotiations on that\r\nproposal.\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union.\nThe measure is in line with the Union's\r\nobjectives for small businesses, as laid out in Commission Communication\r\n\"Think small first\" \u2013 a \"Small Business Act\" for\r\nEurope\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe decision aims at continuing a\r\nsimplification measure which removes many of the VAT obligations for businesses\r\noperating below an annual turnover, and increasing that turnover from EUR 30\r\n000 to EUR 65 000.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the\r\nderogation, and its limited application in time, the scope will in any case be\r\nlimited. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for the Italian Republic to\r\ncontinue to apply a derogating measure from Directive 2006/112/EC as regards\r\nthe introduction of a simplification measure for businesses with an annual\r\nturnover no higher than a certain threshold, and to increase that threshold to\r\nEUR 65 000.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nbudget of the Union because Italy will carry out a compensation calculation in\r\naccordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (ECC EURATOM) 1553/89[6].\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0299 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising the Italian Republic to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[7], and in particular Article\r\n395(1) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter registered by\r\nthe Commission on 8 April 2013 Italy requested authorisation for a measure\r\nderogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to continue to\r\nexempt certain taxable persons whose annual turnover falls below a certain\r\nthreshold, and to raise this threshold from EUR 30 000 to EUR 65 000. Through\r\nthat measure, those taxable persons would be exempt from certain or all of the\r\nobligations in relation to value added tax (VAT) referred to in Chapters 2 to 6\r\nof Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States by letter dated 10 June 2013 of the request made by Italy. By letter dated 14 June 2013 the Commission notified Italy that it had all the\r\ninformation necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A special scheme for small\r\nenterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC. The extended measure derogates from Article 285 of that Directive\r\nin its application to Italy only insofar as the annual turnover threshold for\r\nthe scheme is higher than the EUR 5 000 threshold.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\r\n2008/737/EC of 15 September 2008[8],\r\n  Italy was authorised, as a derogating measure, to exempt taxable persons\r\nwhose annual turnover is no higher than 30 000 until 31 December 2010. The\r\napplication of this derogation was subsequently extended until 31 December 2013\r\nby Council Decision 2010/688/EU[9].\r\nGiven that this threshold has resulted in reduced VAT obligations for smaller\r\nbusinesses, Italy should be authorised to apply the measure for a further\r\nlimited period, and to increase the threshold to EUR 65 000. Taxable persons\r\nmay still opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sake of making the\r\nmeasure available to a greater number of SMEs, and thereby corresponding to the\r\nobjectives of Commission Communication \"Think small first\" \u2013 a\r\n\"Small Business Act\" for Europe\" (COM(2008) 394 of 25 June 2008),\r\nItaly should be authorised to increase the annual turnover threshold under\r\nwhich certain taxable persons can be VAT exempt from EUR 30 000 to EUR 65 000.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In it proposal for a\r\nCouncil Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC with a view to simplifying the\r\nvalue added tax obligations of 29 October 2004[10],\r\nthe Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the\r\nannual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100 000 or\r\nthe equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that\r\namount each year. The extension request submitted by Italy is compatible with\r\nthat proposal on which the Council has not yet been able to reach an agreement.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From information provided\r\nby Italy, the increased threshold will have a negligible impact on the overall\r\namount of tax revenue collected at the final stage of consumption.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 285 of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC, Italy is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons\r\nwhose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 65 000.\nItaly may raise\r\nthat ceiling in order to maintain the value of the exemption in real terms.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2014 until the entry into force of a Directive amending the amounts of the\r\nannual turnover ceilings below which taxable persons may be exempted from VAT,\r\nor until 31 December 2016, whichever is the earlier.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ 71, 14.4.1967, p. 1303-1312\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 249, 18.9.2008, p. 13\u201314\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 294, 12.11.2010, p. 12-13\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 24, 29.1.2005, p. 10\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2004:0728:FIN:EN:PDF\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 155, 7.6.1989, p. 9\u201313\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 249, 18.9.2008, p. 13\u201314\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 294, 12.11.2010, p. 12-13\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM (2004) 728 final (OJ C 24, 29.1.2005, p. 10)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
