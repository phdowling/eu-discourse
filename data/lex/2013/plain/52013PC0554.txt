General Context\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on\r\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\r\ncommercial matters (the \"Brussels I Regulation\") sets out rules determining\r\nthe international jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States and rules\r\npreventing parallel proceedings before the courts of different Member States. It\r\nalso lays down rules for the recognition and enforcement of judgments of\r\nnational courts in other Member States. It covers, among other matters,\r\nlitigation in the area of intellectual property rights, including patents. On 12\r\nDecember 2012, Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of\r\nthe Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in\r\ncivil and commercial matters[1]\r\n(\"Brussels I Regulation (recast)\"), recasting Regulation (EC) No 44/2001,\r\nwas adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 will enter into application on 10\r\nJanuary 2015. \nIn December 2012, an agreement was reached on\r\nthe so-called \u201cpatent package\u201d \u2013 a legislative initiative consisting of\r\ntwo Regulations[2]\r\n(the \"Unified Patent Regulations\") and an international Agreement (the\r\n\"Unified Patent Court Agreement\" or \"UPC Agreement\"), laying\r\nthe ground for the creation of unitary patent protection in the European Union.\r\n\nThe Unified Patent Regulations were adopted in\r\nenhanced cooperation including 25 Member States (all Member States except Italy and Spain). The UPC Agreement was signed on 19 February 2013 by most Member States. Once the\r\nRegulations apply, it will be possible to obtain a European patent with unitary\r\neffect \u2013 a legal title ensuring uniform protection for an invention across 25\r\nMember States \u2013 on a one-stop shop basis, providing cost advantages and\r\nreducing administrative burdens. \nArticle 89(1) of the UPC Agreement provides\r\nthat the Agreement cannot enter into force prior to the entry into force of the\r\namendments to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) regulating the relationship\r\nbetween both instruments. The aim of these amendments is twofold. First, the\r\namendments aim at ensuring compliance between the UPC\r\nAgreement and Brussels I Regulation (recast), and second, at addressing the particular\r\nissue of jurisdiction rules vis-\u00e0-vis defendants in non-European Union\r\nStates. \nOn 15 October 2012, the three Member States\r\nContracting Parties to the Treaty of 31 March 1965 concerning the establishment\r\nand statute of a Benelux Court of Justice have signed a Protocol modifying the\r\nsaid Treaty. The Benelux Court of Justice is a court common to Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands which has the task to ensure the uniform application of\r\nrules common to the Benelux Member States concerning various matters such as\r\nintellectual property (in particular certain types of rights relating to\r\ntrademarks, models and designs). Up to today, the Benelux Court's task consists\r\nmainly in giving preliminary rulings on the interpretation of these rules. The\r\n2012 Protocol, however, creates the possibility to extend the competences of\r\nthe Benelux Court of Justice to include jurisdictional competences in specific\r\nmatters which come within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation. This\r\npossibility may be executed by a revision of the separate agreements between\r\nthe Benelux Member States on specific matters; this revision will effectively\r\ntransfer jurisdiction from the national courts to the Benelux Court of Justice.\r\nAs a result, similar to the UPC Agreement, the Protocol to the Benelux Treaty\r\nrequires an amendment to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) with the aim first,\r\nto ensure compliance between the revised Treaty and the\r\nBrussels I Regulation (recast), and second, to address the lack of common jurisdiction\r\nrules vis-\u00e0-vis defendants in non-European Union States.\n1.2. Grounds for and objectives of the\r\nproposal\nThe present proposal aims, firstly, at\r\nallowing the entry into force of the UPC Agreement. Art. 89(1) of the UPC\r\nAgreement makes the entry into force of the Agreement dependent on the\r\namendment of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2012. In addition, the proposal aims at\r\nensuring compliance with the Brussels I Regulation of this Agreement as well as\r\nthe Protocol to the Benelux Treaty of 1965.\nThe Unified Patent Court will be a court\r\ncommon to certain Member States and will be subject to the same obligations\r\nunder Union law as any national court. The Unified Patent Court will have\r\nexclusive competence, thus replacing national courts, for the matters governed\r\nby the UPC Agreement. The UPC Agreement regulates the internal distribution of\r\ncompetences between the different divisions of the Unified Patent Court and the\r\nenforcement of the judgments of the Unified Patent Court in the Contracting\r\nMember States. The Benelux Court of Justice is equally a court common to\r\ncertain Member States which will have jurisdictional competence in matters to\r\nbe defined by the Contracting Member States concerned.\nIn order to ensure the combined and coherent\r\napplication of the above Agreement and Protocol and the\r\nBrussels I Regulation (recast) it\r\nis necessary to address the following issues in the Brussels I Regulation\r\n(recast):\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clarify\r\nin the text of the Regulation that the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux\r\nCourt of Justice are \u2018courts\u2019 within the meaning of the Brussels I Regulation;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clarify\r\nthe operation of the rules on jurisdiction with respect to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice insofar as defendants domiciled in\r\nMember States are concerned. Create uniform rules for the international\r\njurisdiction vis-\u00e0-vis third State defendants in proceedings against\r\nsuch defendants brought in the Unified Patent Court and Benelux Court of\r\nJustice in situations where the Brussels I Regulation does not itself provide\r\nfor such rules but refers to national law; \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Define\r\nthe application of the rules on lis pendens and related actions in\r\nrelation to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice on the\r\none hand and the national courts of Member States which are not Contracting\r\nParty to the respective international agreements on the other hand. Define also\r\nthe operation of these rules during the transitional period referred to in\r\nArticle 83(1) UPC Agreement; and\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clarify\r\nthe operation of the rules on recognition and enforcement in the relations\r\nbetween Member States which are and Member States which are not Contracting\r\nParties to the respective international agreements.\nDetailed explanation on the issues to be\r\naddressed is given in point 3 below (\u201cLegal elements of the proposal\u201d). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe patent package has been the subject of\r\nextensive consultation prior to its adoption. This consultation showed broad\r\nsupport not only for the creation of a unified patent but also for the\r\nestablishment of a unified jurisdictional regime. The present proposal allows\r\nfor the entry into force of the UPC Agreement, as foreseen in Art. 89(1) of\r\nthat Agreement. Since the Protocol modifying the 1965 Treaty on the Benelux\r\nCourt of Justice raises identical issues as the UPC Agreement, both amendments\r\nshould be made at the same time. Insofar as jurisdiction rules vis-\u00e0-vis third\r\nState defendants is concerned, this matter was extensively assessed in the\r\nCommission's impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal amending\r\nRegulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement\r\nof judgments in civil and commercial matters (\"Brussels I\")[3]. This assessment concerned the\r\nharmonisation of jurisdiction vis-\u00e0-vis third State defendants\r\ngenerally; the conclusions of that assessment are a fortiori relevant\r\nfor the limited harmonisation foreseen in this proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposed amendments to the Brussels I\r\nRegulation (recast) are as\r\nfollows:\n\u00b7                        \r\nProvisions addressing the relationship between\r\nthe UPC Agreement and the Protocol to the 1965 Benelux Treaty on the one hand and\r\nthe Brussels I Regulation on the other hand;\n\u00b7                        \r\nProvisions completing the uniform jurisdiction\r\nrules in relation to third State defendants in civil and commercial disputes\r\nbrought before the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice in\r\nmatters covered by the UPC Agreement or the Protocol to the 1965 Benelux\r\nTreaty.\nThese amendments are combined in four new provisions,\r\nArticles 71a through 71d of the Brussels I Regulation.\n3.1. The explicit\r\ninclusion of the Unified Patent Court and Benelux Court of Justice as \u2018courts\u2019\r\nwithin the meaning of the Brussels I Regulation (recast)\nAs a result of the internal division of\r\ncompetences within the Unified Patent Court a defendant could find\r\nhim/herself before a division which would not be situated in the Member State of the court designated by the rules of the Brussels I Regulation. For\r\ninstance, a Dutch defendant expecting to be sued at its domicile on the basis\r\nof Art. 4(1) of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) may be brought before the\r\ncompetent central, regional or local division which may be situated in France, Germany or the United Kingdom (or any other Member State, depending on where regional or\r\nlocal divisions will be set up). This is also relevant when the defendant is\r\ndomiciled or habitually resident in a Member State which is not a Contracting\r\nParty to the UPC Agreement (e.g. a licensee domiciled in Spain had to perform\r\nan obligation under the license agreement in the Netherlands; proceedings are\r\nbrought before the German central division instead of the Netherlands as place\r\nof performance of the obligation). Equally, as a result of the transfer of\r\ncompetences to the Benelux Court of Justice, a defendant, including from a\r\nnon-Contracting Member State, could find him/herself before a court which would\r\nnot be situated in the Member State of the court designated by the rules of the\r\nBrussels I Regulation. While Article 71 of the Brussels I Regulation allows\r\nconventions on particular matters which already exist, it does not allow any\r\nsuch new conventions. As a result, it is necessary to clarify that both the\r\nUnified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice are to be considered as\r\ncourts of a Member State in the sense of the Brussels I Regulation, thus\r\nensuring that the Regulation applies fully to the these courts.\nThe Brussels I\r\nRegulation (recast) does not provide for a definition of the term \"court\".\r\nIt limits itself, in Article 3, to include certain specific authorities within\r\nthe concept of \u201ccourt\" for purposes of the operation of the Brussels I\r\nRegulation. Recital 11 does clarify, however, that the term \"court\"\r\nshould be understood as including courts or tribunals common to several Member\r\nStates. Recital 11 explicitly refers to the Benelux Court of Justice when it\r\nexercises jurisdiction in matters falling within the scope of the Brussels I\r\nRegulation. Recital 11 clarifies that judgments given by such common courts\r\nshould be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Brussels I Regulation.\r\nNevertheless, a recital does not have binding nature and cannot ensure with a\r\nsufficient degree of legal certainty compliance of the respective international\r\nagreements with the Brussels I Regulation (recast), in particular Article 71\r\nthereof. A specific legislative amendment is therefore necessary. This\r\namendment follows the approach taken for the Hungarian notary and Swedish\r\nenforcement authority in Article 3 of the Regulation; it includes specifically\r\nthe Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice in the concept of\r\n\"court\" of the Regulation. For reasons of readability, all necessary\r\nchanges relating to the UPC and Benelux Court of Justice Agreements are\r\ncombined in four new provisions (new Articles 71a to 71d).\nBy clarifying that both\r\nthe Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice should be considered\r\nas \"courts\" within the meaning of the Brussels I Regulation (recast),\r\nit will be ensured that the international jurisdiction of these courts will be\r\ndetermined by the Brussels I Regulation; in particular it will be ensured that\r\ndefendants which would expect to be sued in a specific Member State on the\r\nbasis of the rules of the Brussels I Regulation may be sued before either a\r\ndivision of the Unified Patent Court or before the Benelux Court of Justice which is located in another\r\nMember State than the national courts designated on the basis of the Brussels I\r\nRegulation. Legal certainty and predictability for defendants requires that\r\nthis change of territorial jurisdiction is set out clearly in the text of the Brussels\r\nI Regulation.\n3.2. The operation of the rules on\r\njurisdiction in relation to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of\r\nJustice on the one hand and the courts of Member States which are not Contracting\r\nParties to the UPC Agreement or the Protocol to the 1965 Benelux Treaty on the\r\nother hand\nIn order to create full\r\ntransparency on the combined and coherent application of the respective\r\ninternational agreements and the Brussels I Regulation (recast), the latter should\r\nprescribe how the jurisdiction rules of the Brussels I\r\nRegulation (recast) apply to the Unified Patent Court and Benelux Court of\r\nJustice, in the same way as Article 71 of the Brussels I Regulation (recast)\r\ndoes for other international conventions on particular matters. Similar\r\nclarifications are also found, for instance, in Articles 64 and 67 of the 2007\r\nLugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of\r\njudgments in civil and commercial matters. \nThe new rule in\r\nArticle 71b, paragraph 1 thus prescribes that the Unified Patent Court and the\r\nBenelux Court of Justice will have jurisdiction any time when a national court\r\nof one of the respective Contracting Member States would have jurisdiction\r\nbased on the rules of the Brussels I Regulation. A contrario, the Unified\r\nPatent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction when\r\nno national court of a Contracting Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to\r\nthe Brussels I Regulation (for example, when jurisdiction pursuant to\r\nthe Brussels I Regulation would lie with the courts of a non-Contracting\r\nMember State).\n3.3. The completion of the jurisdictional\r\nrules in relation to third State defendants\nArticle 31 of the UPC Agreement provides\r\nthat the international jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court shall\r\nbe established in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 or, where\r\napplicable, on the basis of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition\r\nand enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Lugano Convention). However, insofar as the Brussels I Regulation (recast) and the\r\n2007 Lugano Convention determine jurisdiction by reference to national law (see\r\nArticle 6 of that Regulation and Article 4 of the Lugano Convention), it is not\r\ndetermined which rules should apply to determine the jurisdiction of courts\r\nwhich are common to several Member States such as the Unified Patent Court and\r\nthe Benelux Court of Justice. In addition, a reference to the one or the other\r\nnational law for the several divisions of the Unified Patent Court would create an unequal access to justice in a unified\r\njurisdictional system which could not be justified on any objective reason.\nA similar problem has already been addressed\r\nin the existing Trademark Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 on\r\nthe Community Trade Mark) and Design Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n6/2002 on Community designs), which each do contain a complete set of uniform\r\nrules on jurisdiction vis-\u00e0-vis third State defendants.\nIt is therefore necessary to complete the\r\njurisdiction rules of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) for matters which will\r\ncome within the competence of the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice insofar as\r\ndefendants domiciled in non-European Union States are concerned. Uniform\r\njurisdiction rules already exist in certain situations (such as exclusive\r\njurisdiction with respect to the registration and validity of patents, choice\r\nof court agreements), but not in others (such as proceedings concerning the\r\ninfringement of patents, licensing agreements in the absence of choice of\r\ncourt). \nThe new proposal in Art. 71b, paragraph 2\r\ntherefore extends the Regulation's jurisdiction rules to disputes involving\r\nthird State defendants domiciled in third States. In addition, the Unified Patent Court's and\r\nBenelux Court of Justice's jurisdiction to issue provisional, including\r\nprotective measures is ensured even when the courts of third States have\r\njurisdiction as to the substance of the matter. This extension will apply\r\nwithout prejudice to the 2005 Agreement between the European Community and the\r\nKingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of\r\njudgments in civil and commercial matters, which already regulates the\r\nsituation of Danish defendants, and the 2007 Lugano Convention on the same\r\nsubject matter which already regulates the situation of Swiss, Norwegian, and\r\nIcelandic defendants. \nAs a result of this extension, access to\r\nthe Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice will be ensured in situations where\r\nthe defendant is not domiciled in an EU Member State as access is ensured in\r\nsituations where the defendant is domiciled in an EU Member State. In addition,\r\nsuch access is ensured independently of which instance or division within the Unified Patent Court is\r\nseized of a claim. \nIn addition, the new proposal in Art. 71b,\r\nparagraph 3 establishes one additional forum for disputes involving defendants\r\ndomiciled outside the EU. The proposal provides that a non-EU defendant can be\r\nsued at the place where moveable assets belonging to him are located provided\r\ntheir value is not insignificant compared to the value of the claim and that\r\nthe dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court\r\nseized. The forum of the location of assets balances the absence of the\r\ndefendant in the Union. Such a rule currently exists in a sizeable group of\r\nMember States and has the advantage of ensuring that a judgment can be enforced\r\nin the State where it was issued. It is a rule which fits better in the general\r\nphilosophy of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) than other rules of subsidiary\r\njurisdiction such as those provided for in the Trademark and Design Regulations\r\nmentioned above which allow proceedings against third State defendants to be\r\nbrought, in particular, before the courts of the Member State where the\r\nplaintiff is domiciled (forum actoris). An asset-based forum may ensure\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice\r\nin situations where the Regulation's extended jurisdiction rules would not\r\nprovide for jurisdiction and where such jurisdiction may be appropriate. For\r\ninstance, with respect to the Unified Patent Court, the asset-based\r\njurisdiction would ensure that the Court would have jurisdiction vis-\u00e0-vis a\r\nTurkish defendant infringing a European patent covering several Member States and Turkey.\n3.4. The operation of the rules on lis\r\npendens and related actions in relation to the Unified Patent Court and the\r\nBenelux Court of Justice on the one hand and the courts of Member States which\r\nare not Contracting Parties to the UPC Agreement or the Protocol to the 1965\r\nBenelux Treaty on the other hand\nIn addition, the new rule in Art. 71c\r\nprescribes that the rules on lis pendens and\r\nrelated actions of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) apply between the Unified Patent Court or the Benelux Court of Justice on the one hand and the courts of\r\nnon-Contracting Member States on the other hand. Finally, this Article also\r\nprescribes that the rules of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) apply when,\r\nduring the transitional period referred to in Article 83(1) UPC Agreement,\r\nproceedings are brought before the Unified Patent Court on the one hand and before\r\nthe national courts of Contracting Member States to that Agreement on the other\r\nhand.\n3.5. The operation of the rules on\r\nrecognition and enforcement in relation between Member States that have\r\nratified the UPC Agreement and the Member States that have not ratified the UPC\r\nAgreement\nIn order to create full transparency on the\r\ncombined and coherent application of the respective international agreements\r\nand the Brussels I Regulation (recast), the latter should prescribe how the rules on recognition and enforcement of the Brussels I Regulation\r\n(recast) will apply in the relations between the Member States Contracting\r\nParties to the respective international agreements and the Member States which\r\nare not Contracting Parties to those agreements. Similar provisions are found\r\nin Article 71 of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) with respect to other international\r\nconventions on particular matters and Articles 64 and 67 of the 2007 Lugano\r\nConvention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in\r\ncivil and commercial matters.\nThe new Art. 71d thus regulates the\r\nrecognition and enforcement of judgments of the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court\r\nof Justice in Member States which are not Contracting Parties to the respective\r\ninternational agreements, as well as the recognition and enforcement of\r\njudgments given in Member States which are not Contracting Parties to these\r\nagreements in matters governed by such agreements which need to be recognised\r\nand enforced in Member States Contracting Parties to the international\r\nagreements.\n2013/0268 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on\r\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\r\ncommercial matters\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 67(4) and points\r\n(a), (c) and (e) of Article 81(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 19 February 2013,\r\ncertain Member States signed an Agreement on a Unified Patent Court. This\r\nAgreement provides that it shall not enter into force prior to the first day of\r\nthe fourth month after the date of entry into force of the amendments to\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1215 concerning the relationship of the latter with the\r\nAgreement.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 October 2012, the\r\nthree Member States Contracting Parties to the Treaty of 31 March 1965\r\nconcerning the establishment and statute of a Benelux court of Justice signed a\r\nProtocol modifying this Treaty, creating the possibility to grant certain jurisdictional competences to the Benelux Court of Justice in\r\nspecific matters which come within the scope of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1215/2012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\nregulate the relationship between the above international agreements and Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1215/2012.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Unified Patent Court and\r\nthe Benelux Court of Justice should be considered as courts within the meaning\r\nof this Regulation in order to ensure legal certainty and predictability for\r\ndefendants which may be brought before those courts in a Member State different\r\nfrom the one designated by the rules of this Regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Unified Patent Court\r\nand the Benelux Court of Justice should be able to exercise jurisdiction with\r\nrespect to defendants not domiciled in a Member State. Insofar as matters\r\ncoming within the jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux\r\nCourt of Justice are concerned, the rules of this Regulation should therefore\r\napply to defendants domiciled in non-Union Member States. The existing rules on jurisdiction ensure a close link between\r\nproceedings to which this Regulation applies and the territory of the Member\r\nStates which justifies their extension to defendants wherever they are\r\ndomiciled.
