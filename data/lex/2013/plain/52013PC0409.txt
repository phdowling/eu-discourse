The Single European\nSky (SES) initiative aims to improve the overall efficiency of the way in which\nEuropean airspace is organised and managed through a reform of the industry\nproviding air navigation services (ANS). Its development has involved two\ncomprehensive legislative packages \u2013 SES I and SES II composed of four\nregulations, i.e. Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No\n551/2004 and (EC) No 552/2004[2],\nand also includes a comprehensive project to modernise equipment and systems\nfor air navigation services under the SESAR title[3]. \nIn 2009, Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009\nextended the competences of EASA to include air traffic management and air\nnavigation services (ATM/ANS). Whilst this also implied the incorporation of\nvarious ATM/ANS technical regulation elements into the scope of EASA, the\ncorresponding changes to the four SES Regulations were not completed\nsimultaneously. Instead the European Parliament and the Council preferred to\nleave the corresponding and existing competencies in the four abovementioned\nSES Regulations intact to ensure that there would be no gaps during the move\nfrom the old legal framework to the new one and also to support the idea that\nthe new EASA-based framework should be built on existing SES principles. \nThe legislators addressed this overlap in\nthe Regulations by inserting a new Article 65a into Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008. This article requires the Commission to propose amendments to the\nfour SES Regulations to take into account the requirements of Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008.\nSecondly, there is a more general mismatch\nbetween the approach used for all other sectors of aviation (airworthiness,\ncrew licensing, air operations etc.) in the EASA framework and air traffic\nmanagement (ATM/ANS). Generally speaking the approach is that all technical\nregulations are concentrated within the scope of EASA to meet the objectives of\nArticle 2 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and economic regulation is carried out\nby the Commission. However in ATM/ANS (i.e. SES) the picture is more mixed,\nwith technical regulations stemming from various sources[4]. It would therefore be\nbeneficial to ensure a harmonised approach to this important regulatory area,\nso that all consultations are conducted with the same thoroughness, all rules\nfit in the same structure and serve the same objectives, making life easier for\nthose responsible for applying the rules and finally to ensure that the\nimpending wave of technological innovations stemming from the SESAR initiative\ncan be implemented in a co-ordinated manner in both airborne and ground\nequipage and procedures.\nThis regulatory initiative aims to fulfil\nthe requirement of article 65a, by deleting the overlaps between the SES and\nEASA Regulations and simplifying and clarifying the border line between EASA and\nSES legal frameworks. In doing so, the amendment also supports the political\nobjective of ensuring clarity of tasks between the Commission, EASA and the\nEurocontrol organisation so that , the Commission focuses on economic and technical\nregulation, with EASA acting as its agent on technical regulation drafting and\noversight, while Eurocontrol will focus on operational tasks, in particular\nbuilt around the Network Manager concept[5].\nAs well as deleting SES provisions as part\nof the SES recast, some minor adaptations are also required to Regulation (EC)\nNo 216/2008, because previously the text of this Regulation relied on the\nterminology of some SES provisions \u2013 in particular in the area of\ninteroperability \u2013 and hence the same terminology needs to be introduced in\nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008, now that it is being repealed from the four SES\nRegulations.. \n\n2.                      \nRESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\nDG MOVE has prepared an impact assessment\n(IA) to support legislative proposals for improving the efficiency, safety and\ncompetitiveness of the Single European Sky. The amendments to Regulation (EC)\nNo 216/2008 in this package however intend to address issues that were left\nover from a previous amendment through Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009, notably\nArticle 65a, These amendments, were covered by the 2008 impact assessment\nleading up to the approval of Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009. \nAlthough there has not been any specific\nconsultation on the EASA-related amendments, there was a three-month public\nconsultation was held between September and December 2012 on the DG MOVE\nwebsite on the DG MOVE website between September and December 2012 concerning\nthe SES changes. In addition, two high-level events \u2013 a conference in Limassol\nand a hearing in Brussels \u2013 have been organised and numerous bilateral meetings\nhave taken place with all affected stakeholders. The issue of EASA's role was\nalso raised during these events and stakeholders expressed the need to ensure a\nmore co-ordinated drafting of technical rules.\n\n3.                      \nLEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.                \nScope (Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008)\n\nWhile traditionally the Union has had very\nlimited competences in military matters, the dividing line in SES has\ntraditionally been that if a service provider at an airport or at an en-route\ncentre serves primarily (i.e. more than 50%) civilian traffic, that service\nprovider should comply with the same rules that apply to other service\nproviders. Military airspace users on the other hand have had the choice of either\nflying in accordance with the ICAO and SES rules (defined as General Air\nTraffic [GAT] rules). They could also opt out of these rules for operational\npurposes by declaring that the operation in question is performed as\noperational air traffic (OAT), in which case the SES rules do not apply to\nthese users. Thus the division ensures the safety of civilian traffic, but\nretains the possibility of the military to operate per their own mission\nrequirements. The adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 resulted in a\ndifference between SES and EASA rules, leading for example to a situation where\nunder SES rules the same provider and its air traffic controllers had to be\ncertified, while under EASA rules certification was not necessary. The current\namendment realigns the scopes of the EASA Basic Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and\nthe SES Regulations (EC) Nos 549-552/2004 to avoid such inconsistencies,\nrestoring the application of the rules to the intended concept, where the\nservice provider falls under EU rules, if more than 50% of the traffic it\nserves flies under GAT rules.\n\n3.2.                \nObjectives (Article 2)\n\nThe development and implementation of the\nATM master plan (SESAR[6])\nrequires regulatory measures in a wide variety of aviation issues. Previously\nthe coordination and alignment of rules (between air traffic management and\nairworthiness for example) has created problems as there has been no central\ncoordinator ensuring consistency between the drafts prepared by different\ncontributors. This problem does not exist in other fields than ATM/ANS as EASA\nprepares and co-ordinates the whole range of technical rules, while ATM/ANS has\nstill been split between two frameworks. The amendment to Article 2 underlines\nthat ATM/ANS should be treated in the same way as other sectors. More specifically,\nin supporting the Commission in the drafting of technical rules, EASA should\nadopt a balanced approach to regulating different activities based on their\nspecific characteristics, acceptable safety levels and an identified risk\nhierarchy of users to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated development of\naviation.\n\n3.3.                \nDeclarations (from Article 3 onwards throughout\nthe Regulation)\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1108/2009 introduced the\npossibility of self-declaration rather than certification, of certain flight\ninformation services. The text of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 has been adapted\nthroughout to take account of this possibility in the various places where\ncertification is mentioned.\n\n3.4.                \nDefinitions (Article 3)\n\nWith a view to covering the repeals in the\nfour SES Regulations (Regulations (EC) Nos 549-552/2004) as explained above,\nalign the two frameworks and to clarify the text in Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008, the definitions of \"qualified entity\" and\n\"ATM/ANS\" have been modified. Furthermore definitions of \"ATM\nMaster Plan\" and \"general air traffic\" have been copied to this\nRegulation, from the SES Regulations.\n\n3.5.                \nATM/ANS (Article 8b)\n\nArticle 8b has been amended to align the\nwording with the proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, thus ensuring\nthat the existing principles and concepts of the interoperability Regulation\n(EC) No 552/2004 remain.\n\n3.6.                \nEssential requirements (Annex Vb)\n\nAn error has been corrected in part\n(2)(c)(iv) to bring the text back in line with International Civil Aviation\nOrganisation (ICAO) provisions as well as existing EU rules. This was an\nunintentional mistake in the drafting of Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009. It led\nto an unfeasible requirement for air traffic controllers to provide aircraft\nwith obstacle clearance even when they were outside the aerodrome manoeuvring\narea.\nSecondly, in parts (2)(g) and (2)(h) as\nwell as part 3 some text has been inserted from Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 to\nhighlight the fact that the approach used to regulate these matters will not be\nneedlessly changed from what it is today. These additions do not change the\nscope, but further align the SES and EASA frameworks.\n\n3.7.                \nMiscellaneous\n\nA number of small typographical corrections\nhave been made (in Article 7, for example) and some small editorial amendments\nhave been made to rules (in Article 9, 19 and 33) where the text did not\nreflect the actual situation after previous amendments to the Regulation.\nFurthermore some small changes have been made throughout (for example in\nArticle 52,59 and Annex Vb) to avoid any unintended changes to the principles\nagreed in SES since 2004.\nThe Regulation has also been aligned with\nthe regime established by Articles 290 and 291 TFEU and Regulation (EC) No\n182/2011, governing the use of implementing acts and delegated acts.\nFurthermore the core elements of agreed standard provisions for agencies'\nfounding acts in accordance with the Commission Roadmap on implementation of\nthe Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the\nEuropean Commission on decentralised agencies, of July 2012, have been included.\nThe latter agreement includes also standardisation of the names of EU Agencies,\nso that the name of EASA shall be modified to \"European Union Agency for\nAviation (EAA).\n\n4.                      \nOPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\nSince a separate explanatory memorandum has\nbeen drafted to accompany the proposed recast of the four SES Regulations Nos\n549-552/2004, this document contains mainly the amendments required in the\nRegulation 216/2008 to ensure continuity of the current SES approach after the\nalignment of the four SES Regulations on accordance with Article 65a of\nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008\n2013/0187 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in\nthe field of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \nIn order to take into account the changes\nintroduced in Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 21 October 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the\nfield of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services and\nrepealing Directive 2006/23/EC[8]\nand in Regulation (EC) No 1070/2009 amending Regulations\n(EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No 551/2004 and (EC) No 552/2004 in\norder to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation\nsystem[9] , it is necessary to align the content of Regulation (EC) No\n216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on\ncommon rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European\nAviation Safety Agency with Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework\nfor the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation)[10], Regulation (EC)\nNo 550/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004\non the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky (the\nservice provision Regulation)[11],\nRegulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single\nEuropean sky (the airspace Regulation)[12]\nand Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic\nManagement network (the interoperability Regulation)[13].\n(2)              \nThe development and implementation of the ATM\nmaster plan requires regulatory actions in a wide variety of aviation subjects.\nThe Agency should, in supporting the Commission for drafting technical rules,\nadopt a balanced approach to regulating different activities based on their\nspecificities, acceptable levels of safety and an identified risk hierarchy of\nusers to ensure a comprehensive and co-ordinated development of aviation. \n(3)              \nIn order to take into account technical,\nscientific, operational or safety needs, by amending or supplementing the\nprovisions on airworthiness, environmental protection, pilots, air operations,\naerodromes, ATM/ANS, air traffic controllers, third-country operators,\noversight and enforcement, flexibility provisions, fines and periodic penalty\npayments and fees and charges, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission\ncarries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at\nexpert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts,\nshould ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and Council.\n(4)              \nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the\nimplementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on\nthe Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February\n2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\ncontrol by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers. \n(5)              \nThe Commission should adopt immediately\napplicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to\naerodrome exemptions and decisions not to permit application of flexibility\nprovisions, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(6)              \nCertain principles regarding the governance and\noperation of the Agency should be adapted to the Common Approach on EU\ndecentralised agencies endorsed by the European Parliament, the Council and the\nCommission in July 2012\n(7)              \nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008 should therefore be\namended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008 is amended
