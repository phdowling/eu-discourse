However, the obligations for care and assistance\nare upheld even in such situations.\nThe Regulation also requires Member States\nto establish National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs) to ensure the correct\napplication of the Regulation.\nThe rights of passengers under the\nRegulation should not be confused with their rights under the Montreal\nConvention: whilst the Convention provides for individualised damage to\ntravellers, assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on the individual\ncircumstances of the passenger, Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 establishes\nstandardised entitlements (with regard to assistance and care) applicable to\nall passengers, regardless of their individual circumstances.\nUnder the Montreal Convention (as\ntranslated by Regulation (EC) No 2027/97[2]\ninto EU law), a passenger may be entitled to compensation in case of mishandled\nbaggage (but with a limit of about \u20ac1200), except if the airline can\ndemonstrate it has taken all reasonable measures to avoid the damages or it was\nimpossible to take such measures. Unlike Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, neither\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97 nor the Montreal Convention requires the\nestablishment of enforcement bodies to ensure their correct application.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recent\ndevelopments\nAirlines often fail to offer passengers the\nrights to which they are entitled in instances of denied boarding, long delays,\ncancellations or mishandled baggage, in particular under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004\n(\"the Regulation\") and Regulation (EC) No 2027/97.\nThe Commission EU Citizenship Report\nof October 2010 on dismantling obstacles to EU citizens' rights[3] announced measures to ensure a\nset of common rights for passengers travelling by any transport mode across the\nEU and the adequate enforcement of these rights.\nThe Commission White Paper on Transport adopted on 28 March 2011 mentioned among\nits initiatives the need to \"develop a\nuniform interpretation of EU law on passenger rights and a harmonised and\neffective enforcement, to ensure both a level playing field for the industry\nand a European standard of protection for the citizens\".[4]\nThe Commission Communication of 11 April\n2011[5]\nreported on the varying interpretation being taken on the provisions of\nRegulation (EC) No 261/2004, due to grey zones and gaps in the current text,\nand the non-uniform enforcement across Member States. Furthermore, it is\ndifficult for passengers to enforce their individual rights.\nOn 29 March 2012, the European\nParliament (EP) adopted a resolution[6] in response to the above\nCommission Communication. The EP believes that proper application of the\nexisting rules by Member States and air carriers, enforcement of sufficient and\nsimple means of redress and providing passengers with accurate information\nconcerning their rights should be the cornerstones of regaining passengers\u2019\ntrust. The EP regrets that the national enforcement bodies do not always ensure\neffective protection of passenger rights. With regard to Regulation (EC) No 261/2004,\nthe EP asks the Commission to propose a clarification of the passengers'\nrights, in particular the notion of \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019.\nEU legislation must be in full conformity\nwith the Charter of Fundamental Rights[7].\nMore specifically, it follows from Article 38 that a high level of consumer\nprotection should be attained in all Union policies. Other relevant provisions\ninclude the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8), the\nprohibition of any form of discrimination and the integration of persons with\ndisabilities (Articles 21 and 26) and the right to an effective remedy and to a\nfair trial (Article 47).\nCase law has\nhad a decisive impact on the interpretation of the Regulation. In case C-344/04\n(IATA), the ECJ confirmed its full compatibility with the Montreal Convention\nand the complementarities between the two legal instruments. In case C-549/07\nWallentin-Herrman, the Court clarified when a technical problem in an aircraft should\nnot be regarded as an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019. In the Sturgeon case (Joined\nCases C-402/07 and C-432/07), the ECJ held that a long delay of at least three\nhours at arrival entitles passengers to compensation.\nThis\nproposal aims to promote the interest of air passengers by ensuring that air\ncarriers comply with a high level of air passenger protection during travel\ndisruptions, while taking into account the financial implications for the air\ntransport sector and ensuring that air carriers operate under harmonised\nconditions in a liberalised market.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation process\nA public consultation was carried out\nbetween 19 December 2011 and 11 March 2012; 410\nsubmissions were received. The results are available on the Commission's\nwebsite[8].\nMoreover, a consultant undertook individual and more\ndetailed interviews and consultations with 98 stakeholders from all stakeholder\ngroups. \nFinally, on 30 May 2012, the Commission and\nthe European Economic and Social Committee co-organised a conference giving\nstakeholders the opportunity to respond to the results of the public\nconsultation. The presentations and the minutes of the conference can be found\non the Commission's website[9].\nThe consumer and passenger\nrepresentatives mainly focused on poor compliance and inadequate\nenforcement, especially with regard to financial compensation in case of delay.\nAirlines and their associations mainly considered that the financial\ncost of the Regulation is excessive, particularly that airlines face unlimited\nliability for incidents which are not their fault (e.g. volcanic ash cloud\ncrisis in April 2010). The airlines heavily criticised the consequences of the\nSturgeon judgement as causing excessive costs. The views of the travel agent\nand tour operator associations were similar to those of the airlines, but\nwith some notable exceptions such as in regard to the right to rerouting or to\nthe use of individual segments of a flight ticket (\"no show\" policy).\nAirports expressed strong opposition towards being given any\nresponsibilities under the revised Regulation.\nThe national and sub-national\nauthorities that responded to the public consultation expressed views on\nmost issues which were similar to those of the consumer/passenger associations,\nbut were more sensitive to economic, budgetary and legal constraints.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Commission has assessed four policy\noptions in view of improving the application and enforcement of air passenger\nrights. They differ by the chosen trade-off between stronger enforcement and\nadjusted economic incentives for airlines: a heavier cost is an incentive for\nairlines for minimising costs of compliance and trying not to grant passengers\ntheir rights. A stronger sanctioning policy is an incentive for compliance.\nTherefore, for options where the cost imposed by the obligations of the\nRegulation is higher, the enforcement policy must be stricter and better\ncoordinated, and vice versa.\nSuch a selection was considered because a\nfull focus on enforcement without addressing the economic disincentives for\ncompliance would require considerable public resources to be devoted to the\nenforcement bodies.\nOption 1: focus on economic incentives\n(moderate change of enforcement): under option\n1, enforcement is better coordinated, mainly via a better stream of information\nbetween the NEBs and the Commission. The option mainly focuses on the reduction\nof costs by replacing some of the obligations with regard to care (i.e. catering,\naccommodation) by the obligation for airlines to propose optional insurance to\npassengers.\nOption 2: balancing stronger enforcement\npolicy with economic incentives: enforcement policy\nis reinforced through stronger coordination of NEBs. NEBs would be required to\nimprove the information they provide to the Commission about their activities\nand the Commission may request investigations, especially in cases involving\nseveral Member States. Additional costs flowing from enhanced care and\nassistance are compensated by adjustments in the global amount of financial\ncompensation. This can be achieved by reducing the frequency of compensation\npayments via two variants:\n\u00b7              \nVariant 2a:\nincreasing the time threshold after which the passenger has a right to compensation\nin case of delays from the current three hours to at least five;\n\u00b7              \nVariant 2b:\nextending the scope of \"extraordinary circumstances\" to include most\ntechnical defaults.\nFor both variants 2a and 2b, the impact\nassessment report analyses whether an additional adjustment of the lump-sum\ncompensation amounts would be useful.\nUnder option 2, there would be a limit of 3\nor 4 days on the obligation of accommodation in situations of extraordinary\nevents of long duration. To mitigate the impact on passengers, contingency\nplanning and a quicker rerouting are introduced.\nOption 3: focus on enforcement: this option entirely focusses on stronger enforcement and\nclarifies existing passenger rights to render their application more effective.\n\nOption 4: centralised enforcement: option 4 entirely focuses on a fully centralised enforcement policy\nwhich must counteract the negative incentives from the compliance cost: a\ncentral EU enforcement body is therefore part of this option.\nIn options 3 and 4, an industry fund \u2013 financed\nby a levy on every airline ticket - would ensure continued care in cases of extraordinary\nevents of long duration by reimbursing at least part of the costs airlines\nincurred.\nAll policy options have some common\nfeatures such as:\n\u00b7                        \nthe clarification of a number of issues (e.g. extraordinary\ncircumstances as mentioned above, rerouting obligations, care during tarmac\ndelays, rights in case of missed connections, etc.);\n\u00b7                        \na functional separation of general enforcement\nand of individual complaint handling where the latter may be taken charge of by\nalternative dispute resolution bodies (ADR). Both, the air carriers and the\nbodies in charge of individual complaints would be submitted to clear complaint\nhandling procedures (including maximum response times);\n\u00b7                        \ninvolvement of other market players: enhanced\npossibility for recourse of airlines against third parties responsible for\ndisruptions; setting up of contingency plans among airport users.\nThe impact assessment concludes that option\n2 is preferable over the others as it would most effectively and efficiently\nenhance passengers' rights while taking into account the financial impact on\nthe air transport sector. Variant 2a is slightly preferred over 2b because\nkeeping the delay threshold too short (as in 2b) might lead to more\ncancellations and because 2a ensures a better consistency between the right to\ncompensation and the right to reimbursement (both arise at the earliest after 5\nhours). The impact assessment does not indicate a preference with regard to\nfurther sub-variants of option 2a (i.e. adjusted compensation levels and/or\nmultiple time thresholds for delay compensation).\nCompliance costs for air carriers would be\nsimilar under option 2 compared to today's Regulation, but its upward potential\nwould be limited in case a growing proportion of passengers claim their\ncompensation or in an extraordinary event of long duration.\nThe Commission has decided to present a\nproposal in line with the conclusion of the impact assessment, i.e.\ncorresponding to its option 2a, including a uniform 5-hour threshold for delay\ncompensation for all intra-EU journeys. With regard to the sub-options, the\nproposal does not modify the compensation levels, but it introduces a longer threshold\nfor delay compensation for extra-EU journeys of more than 3500 km, given the specific\nproblems encountered by long-haul journeys to deal with the causes of delays\nfar from the air carrier's home base (9 hours for extra-EU journeys between 3500\nand 6000 km and 12 hours for extra-EU journeys of 6000 km and more).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 100(2)\nTFEU.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nFirstly, there is limited scope for Member\nStates to act alone to protect consumers, as the Air Services Regulation (EC)\nNo 1008/2008[10]\ndoes not allow Member States to place additional requirements on air carriers operating\nintra-EU services.\nSecondly, most of the\nproblems with air passenger rights refer to divergences of\napplication/enforcement of Regulations (EC) No 261/2004 and (EC) No 2027/97\nacross Member States weakening passengers' rights and affecting the\nlevel-playing field between air carriers. Only coordinated EU intervention can address\nthese problems.\nFurthermore, the proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle. Any additional costs for economic operators and\nnational authorities are limited to those necessary to improve the application\nand enforcement of passengers' rights. Cost increases related to the provision\nof care and assistance or to compensation in case of long delays are offset by modifications\nin the time thresholds giving rise to the right to compensation.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\n3.3.1. Ensure effective and\nconsistent enforcement of passenger rights\nThe proposal aims to improve enforcement by\nclarifying key principles and implicit passenger rights that have given rise to\nmany disputes between airlines and passengers in the past; and by enhancing and\nbetter coordinating the enforcement policies carried out on a national level.\n3.3.1.1. Clarification of key principles\n\u00b7                        \nDefinition of \"extraordinary\ncircumstances\": the proposal clearly defines\nthe term in line with the European Court's decision in the case C-549/07\n(Wallentin-Herman), i.e. circumstances which, by their nature or origin, are not\ninherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned\nand are beyond its actual control. Furthermore, for further legal certainty,\nthe proposal introduces a non-exhaustive list of circumstances to be regarded\nas extraordinary and of circumstances to be regarded as non-extraordinary\n(Article 1(1e) of the proposal \u2013 Article 2(m) of the amended Regulation\n261/2004 \u2013 and Annex 1).\n\u00b7                        \nRight to compensation in case of long delays: the proposal explicitly introduces the right to compensation in\ncase of long delays - as announced by the ECJ in the joined cases C-407/07 and\nC-432/07 (Sturgeon) - into the text of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004. However, to\navoid an increase in cancellations (which are in general more inconvenient to\npassengers), the time threshold after which the right to compensation arises is\nproposed to be increased from three to five hours for all journeys within the\nEU. While a single threshold is proposed for the EU, for journeys to/from third\ncountries, the threshold will be made dependent upon the journey distance to\ntake into account the practical problems encountered by air carriers when\naddressing the causes of delays at remote airports (see below; paragraph 3.3.2)\n(Article 1(5) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6(2) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nRight to rerouting: the proposal clarifies that if the air carrier cannot reroute the\npassenger on its own services within 12 hours, it must consider other carriers\nor other transport modes, subject to seat availability (Article 1(8) of the\nproposal \u2013 Article 8(5) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nRight to care:\nwhere currently the time threshold for care is dependent on the flight distance\n(2, 3 or 4 hours), the proposal simplifies by introducing a single time\nthreshold of 2 hours for flights of all distances (Article 1(5) of the proposal\n\u2013 Article 6(1)(i) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nMissed connecting flight: the proposal confirms that passengers that miss a flight\nconnection because their previous flight was delayed have a right to care (to\nbe provided by the operating air carrier of the missed flight which is best\npositioned to provide this care) and, under certain circumstances, a right to\ncompensation (to be provided by the air carrier operating the delayed flight as\nit was at the origin of the total delay). However, such right would only apply\nwhere the connecting flights are part of a single contract of carriage as in\nthat case the air carriers concerned have committed to and are aware of the\nintended connection between the flights. The air carriers retain the right to\nagree on distributing costs between themselves (Article 1(6) of the proposal \u2013\nArticle 6a of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nRescheduling: the\nproposal confirms that passengers of flights rescheduled with a notice of\nperiod of less than two weeks in advance of the originally scheduled time have\nsimilar rights to delayed passengers (Article 1(5) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6\nof the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nTarmac delays:\nthe proposal clearly sets out the rights of passengers when their aircraft is\ndelayed on the tarmac, in particular a right to disembark after five hours (in\nline with the right to reimbursement) (Article 1(5) of the proposal \u2013 Article\n6(5) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nPartial ban of the \"no show\" policy: the proposal confirms that passengers may not be denied boarding\non a return journey of the same ticket on the grounds that they did not take\nthe outward journey. However, such ban does not affect the right of airlines to\nimpose particular rules with regard to the sequential use of flights within a\nsame journey. The Commission decided against a full ban of the \"no\nshow\" policy because it would impair airlines from offering indirect\nflights at lower prices than direct flights and therefore hurt competition\n(Article 1(3(b)) of the proposal \u2013 Article 4(4) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nRight to information: passengers should have a right to information about the flight\ndisruption as soon as the information is available (Article 1(13) of the\nproposal \u2013 Article 14 of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n3.3.1.2. Ensure effective and consistent\nsanctioning\nThe proposal clarifies the role of the\nNational Enforcement Bodies (NEBs) by clearly allocating the role of general\nenforcement to the NEBs while out-of-court handling of individual complaints\nwill be a role for complaint handling bodies which may become Alternative\nDispute Resolution Bodies (ADR) under the new ADR Directive[11]. Both types of bodies will\nclosely cooperate (Article 1(15) of the proposal \u2013 Articles 16 and 16a of the\namended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\nThe NEBs will adopt a more proactive\nmonitoring policy than today and their role will be extended to the\nmonitoring of compliance with the baggage provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (and of the Montreal\nConvention) (Article 2(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6b of the amended\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97).\nThe exchange of information and the\ncoordination between the NEBs, and between the NEBs and the Commission,\nwill be enhanced with reporting obligations and formal coordination procedures (Article\n1(15) of the proposal \u2013 Article 16b of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n3.3.1.3. Ensure effective handling of\nindividual claims and complaints\nUnder the proposal, air carriers should\ninform passengers, at the time of reservation, about their claim and complaint\nhandling procedures, provide electronic means to submit complaints and give information\nabout competent complaint handling bodies. Airlines will be required to respond\nwithin a deadline of two months to passengers (Article 1(15) of the proposal \u2013\nArticle 16a of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n3.3.2. Better take into account the\nfinancial capacities of the air carriers\nA limited number of measures aim to reduce\nthe most costly aspects of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004:\n\u00b7                        \nThe right to compensation in case of delay will arise\nafter five hours for all journeys within the EU. For journeys to/from third\ncountries, to take into account the particular problems encountered by air\ncarriers to handle causes of delays at remote airports, these thresholds will\nbe made dependent upon the journey distance: 5 hours for extra-EU journeys of 3500\nkm or less, 9 hours for extra\u2013EU journeys between 3500 and 6000 km, and 12\nhours for extra-EU journeys of 6000 km and more (Article 1(5) of the proposal \u2013\nArticle 6(2) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nIn the case of delays and cancellations due to\nextraordinary circumstances, the air carrier may limit the right to\naccommodation to 3 nights with a maximum of EUR 100 per night and passenger\n(Article 1(9) of the proposal \u2013 Article 9(4) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004). However, the impact on\npassengers is mitigated by two additional measures: first, faster rerouting\nshould reduce the risk of passengers being stranded for so long (see above);\nsecond, airports, air carriers and other actors in the air transport chain will\nbe required to set up contingency plans to optimise the care and assistance to stranded\npassengers (Article 1(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 5(5) of the amended\nRegulation (EC) No 261/2004). Furthermore,\nthe limitation in the provision of accommodation does not apply to passengers\nwith reduced mobility (PRMs), those persons accompanying them, pregnant women,\npersons in need of specific medical assistance and unaccompanied children -\nprovided they have pre-notified the air carrier 48 hours before the scheduled\ntime of departure (Article 1(11) of the proposal \u2013 Articles 11(3) and 11(4) of\nthe amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nIn view of the specificities of small-scale\n(regional) operations, air carriers are not compelled to provide accommodation\nto passengers of flights of less than 250 km on aircraft with a maximum\ncapacity of 80 seats (except on connecting flights). Again, this derogation\ndoes not apply to PRM, persons accompanying them, pregnant women, persons in\nneed of specific medical assistance and unaccompanied children (Articles 1(9)\nand 1(11) of the proposal \u2013 Articles 9(5), 11(3) and 11(4) of the amended\nRegulation 261/2004).\n\u00b7                        \nThe proposal specifies that national law may not\nrestrict the air carriers' right to seek compensation from third parties\nresponsible for delays or cancellations (Article 1(12) of the proposal \u2013\nArticle 13 of the amended Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).\n3.3.3. Ensure better enforcement of\npassenger rights with regard to mishandled baggage\nTaking into account the UN Convention on\nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Charter of Fundamental Rights\n(Articles 21 and 26), passengers with reduced mobility should have the\nsame right to free movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination as other\ncitizens.\nThe liability of air carriers with regard\nto mobility equipment will be increased up to the actual value of the\nequipment. This is achieved, in conformity with the Montreal Convention, by\ncompelling air carriers to automatically offer the option to make a special\ndeclaration of interest laid out within the Convention, at no additional cost\n(Article 2(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6a of the amended Regulation (EC) No 2027/97).\nThe proposal enhances the transparency with\nregard to baggage allowances. It explicitly requires air carriers to\nclearly indicate the cabin and hold baggage allowances, at booking and at the\nairport (Article 2(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6d of the amended Regulation (EC) No 2027/97).\nThe proposal includes measures with regard\nto musical instruments. It compels air carriers to accept small\ninstruments inside the passenger cabin, subject to certain conditions, and to\nclarify their rules with regard to the carriage of larger instruments in the cargo\ncompartment (Article 2(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6e of the amended Regulation\n(EC) No 2027/97).\nTaking into consideration the strict time\nlimits of the Montreal Convention within which passengers can submit claims\nfor mishandled baggage to air carriers, it is proposed that air carriers\nissue a claim form at the airport where passengers can complain about delayed,\ndamaged or lost baggage (such as the common Property Irregularity Report or\nPIR) and then to accept this as a claim for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 and the Montreal Convention\n(Article 2(1) of the proposal \u2013 Article 3(2) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 2027/97).\nUnder the proposal, the National\nEnforcement Bodies designated under Regulation 261/2004 will also be\nresponsible for the enforcement of the provisions of Regulation 2027/97\nthat relate to the rights of passengers with regard to delayed, lost or damaged\nbaggage (Article 2(4) of the proposal \u2013 Article 6b of the amended Regulation (EC) No 2027/97).\n3.3.4. Adapt liability limits in\naccordance to general price inflation\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 889/2002, introduces the Montreal Convention into EU law and extends\nits scope to domestic flights (in addition to international flights). The\nConvention sets limits of liability with respect to the carriage of passengers,\nbaggage and cargo, which have been revised upwards by 13.1% with effect from 30\nDecember 2009. The present proposal updates the limits in the EU Regulation to\ntake into account these revised amounts in the Convention (Articles 2(2) and\n2(3) and annex 2 of the proposal \u2013 Articles 5(2) and 6(1) and the annex of the\namended Regulation 2027/97).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implication\nThe proposal has no implications for the\nEU budget.\n2013/0072 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 261/2004\nestablishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the\nevent of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in respect of the carriage\nof passengers and their baggage by air \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[13],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004\nestablishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the\nevent of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and\nrepealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91[14],\nand Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 of the Council of 9 October 1997 on air carrier\nliability of the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air[15] have significantly contributed\nto protecting the rights of air passengers when their travel plans are\ndisrupted by denied boarding, long delays, cancellations or mishandled baggage.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of shortcomings\nrevealed during the implementation of the rights under the Regulations, have\nhowever prevented their full potential in terms of passenger protection from\nbeing realised. In order to ensure a more effective, efficient and consistent\napplication of air passenger rights across the Union, a series of adjustments\nto the current legal framework is required. This was underlined in the\nCommission 2010 EU Citizenship Report on dismantling obstacles to EU citizens'\nrights[16]\nwhich announced measures to ensure a set of common rights notably for air\npassengers and the adequate enforcement of these rights.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to increase legal\ncertainty for air carriers and passengers, a more precise definition of the\nconcept of \"extraordinary circumstances\" is needed, which takes into\naccount the judgement of the European Court of Justice in the case C-549/07\n(Wallentin-Hermann). Such a definition should be further clarified via a non-exhaustive\nlist of circumstances that are clearly identified as extraordinary or not.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case C-173/07\n(Emirates), the European Court of Justice held that the concept of \u2018flight\u2019\nwithin the meaning of Regulation No 261/2004 must be interpreted as consisting\nessentially of an air transport operation, as a \u2018unit\u2019 of such transport,\nperformed by an air carrier which fixes its itinerary. In\norder to avoid uncertainty, a clear definition of a \"flight\" should\nnow be provided, as well as for the associated notions of \"connecting\nflight\" and \"journey\".\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case C-22/11\n(Finnair), the European Court decided that the concept of \u2018denied boarding\u2019\nmust be interpreted as relating not only to cases where boarding is denied\nbecause of overbooking but also to those where boarding is denied on other\ngrounds, such as operational reasons. Given this confirmation, there is no\nreason to modify the current definition of \"denied boarding\".\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\n(EC) No 261/2004 also applies to passengers that have\nbooked their air transport as part of a package travel. However, it should be\nclarified that passengers may not cumulate corresponding rights, in particular\nunder both this Regulation and Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on\npackage travel, package holidays and package tours[17]. The passengers should be able\nto choose under which law they introduce their claims, but should not have the\nright to cumulate compensation for the same problem under both legal acts. Passengers\nshould not be concerned about how air carriers and tour operators allocate such\nclaims between them.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to improve levels\nof protection, passengers should not be denied boarding on the return journey\nof a two-way (return) ticket because they have not taken the outward journey.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At present, passengers are\nsometimes penalised for spelling errors in their names by the application of punitive\nadministrative fees. Reasonable corrections of booking errors should be provided\nfree of charge provided they do not imply a change of times, date, itinerary or\npassenger.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be clarified\nthat in cases of cancellation the choice between receiving reimbursement,\ncontinuation of travel by rerouting or travel at a later date is the decision\nof the passenger and not that of the air carrier.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Airports and airport users\nsuch as air carriers and ground handling companies should cooperate to minimise\nthe impact of multiple flight disruptions on passengers by ensuring their care\nand rerouting. To this end, they should prepare contingency plans for such\noccurrences and work together in the development of such plans.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 261/2004\nshould explicitly include the right to compensation for passengers suffering\nlong delays, in line with the judgement of the European Court of Justice in the\nJoined cases C-402/07 and C-432/07 (Sturgeon). At the same time, the thresholds\nabove which delays give rise to a right to compensation should be increased to\ntake account of the financial impact on the sector and to avoid any increase in\nthe frequency of cancellations as a consequence. To ensure that citizens\ntravelling within the EU face homogenous conditions for compensation, the threshold\nshould be the same for all travel within the Union, but it should depend upon\nthe journey distance for travel to and from third countries to take into\naccount the operational difficulties encountered by air carriers to deal with\ndelays on remote airports.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure legal certainty,\nRegulation (EC) No 261/2004 should explicitly confirm that the changing of\nflight schedules has a similar impact on passengers to long delays and should\ntherefore give rise to similar rights.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passengers missing a\nconnecting flight should be properly cared for while waiting for rerouting. In\nline with the principle of equal treatment, such passengers should be able to\nclaim compensation on a similar basis to passengers whose flights are delayed\nor cancelled in light of the delay upon reaching the final destination of their\njourney.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance\npassenger protection, it should be clarified that delayed passengers enjoy\nrights to care and compensation irrespective of whether they are waiting in the\nairport terminal or are already seated on board the aircraft. However, as the\nlatter have no access to the services available in the terminal, their rights\nshould be reinforced with regard to basic needs and with regard to the right to\ndisembark.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a passenger has taken\nup the choice of rerouting at the earliest possibility, the air carrier often\nmakes the rerouting conditional upon the availability of seats on its own\nservices, thereby denying their passengers the option of being rerouted more\nquickly by alternative services. It should be established that after a certain period\nof time has elapsed, the carrier should offer rerouting on another carrier's\nservices or on other transport modes where this can speed up rerouting.\nAlternative rerouting should be dependent upon the availability of seats.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air carriers currently face\nunlimited liability for the accommodation of their passengers in the case of\nextraordinary circumstances of long duration. This uncertainty linked with the\nabsence of any foreseeable limit in time may risk endangering a carrier's\nfinancial stability. An air carrier should therefore be able to limit the\nprovision of care after a certain duration of time. Moreover, contingency\nplanning and speedy rerouting should lessen the risk of passengers being\nstranded for long periods.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of\ncertain passenger rights, in particular the right to accommodation, has been\nshown to be out of proportion to air carriers' revenues for certain small-scale\noperations. Flights performed by small aircraft on short distances should\ntherefore be exempted from the obligation to pay for accommodation, although\nthe carrier should still help the passenger to find such accommodation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For disabled persons,\npersons with reduced mobility and other persons with special needs such as\nunaccompanied children, pregnant women and persons in need of specific medical\nattention, it may be more difficult to arrange accommodation when flight\ndisruptions occur. Therefore, any limitations on the right for accommodation in\ncases of extraordinary circumstances or for regional operations should not\napply to these categories of passenger.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reasons behind the\ncurrent level of long delays and cancelled flights in the EU are not\nattributable solely to air carriers. In order to incentivise all actors in the\naviation chain to seek efficient and timely solutions to minimise the\ninconvenience that long delays and cancellations cause to passengers, air\ncarriers should have the right to seek redress from any third party which\ncontributed to the event triggering compensation or other obligations.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passengers should not only\nbe correctly informed about their rights in cases of flight disruption, but\nthey should also be adequately informed about the cause of the disruption\nitself, as soon as the information becomes available. This information should\nalso be provided where the passenger has acquired the ticket through an\nintermediary established in the Union.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a better\nenforcement of passenger rights, the role of the National Enforcement Bodies\nshould be more precisely defined and clearly distinguished from the handling of\nindividual passenger complaints.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passengers should be\nadequately informed about the relevant procedures for submitting claims and\ncomplaints to air carriers and should receive a reply within a reasonable time\nperiod. Passengers should also have the option to complain about air carriers\nvia out-of-court measures. However, since the right to an effective remedy\nbefore a tribunal is a fundamental right recognised in Article 47 of the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, those measures should\nneither prevent nor hinder passengers' access to courts.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case C-139/11 (Mor\u00e9 vs\nKLM), the European Court of Justice clarified that the time-limits for bringing\nactions for compensation are determined in accordance with the national rules\nof each Member State.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A regular flow of\ninformation between the Commission and enforcement bodies would enable the\nCommission to better fulfil its monitoring and coordinating role of the\nnational bodies and to support them.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, implementing\npowers should be conferred to the Commission. These powers should be exercised\nin accordance with Regulation (EC) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\nconcerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's\nexercise of implementing powers[18].\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\nshould be used for adopting implementing decisions with regard to the content\nof the activity reports provided by the Member States to the Commission.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\ndamage to or loss of mobility equipment is compensated to its full value, air\ncarriers should offer free of charge to persons with reduced mobility the\nopportunity to make a special declaration of interest, which pursuant to the\nMontreal Convention, allows them to seek full compensation for loss or damage.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passengers are sometimes\nconfused about the baggage they are allowed to take on board, in terms of\ndimensions, weight or number of items. In order to ensure that passengers are\nfully aware of the baggage allowances included in their ticket, both for cabin\nand hold baggage, air carriers should clearly indicate these allowances at\nbooking and at the airport.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Musical instruments should\nas far as possible be accepted as baggage within the passenger cabin and, where\nthis is not possible, should where possible be carried under the appropriate\nconditions in the cargo compartment of the aircraft. Regulation (EC) No 2027/97\nshould be amended accordingly.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncorrect and consistent application of the rights conferred to passengers by\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97, the National Enforcement Bodies designated under\nRegulation (EC) No 261/2004 should also monitor and enforce the rights under\nRegulation (EC) No 2027/97.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the short deadlines\nfor the submission of complaints for lost, damaged or delayed baggage, air\ncarriers should give passengers the possibility to submit a complaint by\nproviding a complaint form at the airport. This could also take the form of the\ncommon Property Irregularity Report (PIR).\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 2027/97[19]\nhas become obsolete as insurance matters are now regulated by Regulation (EC)\nNo 785/2004. It should accordingly be deleted.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary that the\nmonetary limits expressed in Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 should be amended in\norder to take into account economic developments, as reviewed by the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2009 pursuant to Article\n24(2) of the Montreal Convention.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncontinued correspondence between Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 and the Montreal\nConvention, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission. This power will allow the Commission to amend the monetary limits\nexpressed in Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 in case they are adapted by the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) pursuant to Article 24(2) of\nthe Montreal Convention.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\nrespect fundamental rights and observe the principles recognised in particular\nby the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably consumer\nprotection, the right to protection of personal data, the prohibition of any\nform of discrimination and the integration of persons with disabilities, the\nright to an effective remedy and to a fair trial.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation 261/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2 is amended as\nfollows:\n(a)                   \nThe definition in point (c) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n'\u00abCommunity air carrier\u00bb means an air carrier\nwith a valid operating licence granted by a Member State in accordance with the\nprovisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of 24 September 2008 on common rules\nfor the operation of air services in the Community[20].'\n(b)                   \nThe definition in point (d) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n'\u00abOrganiser\u00bb means a person within the meaning\nof Article 2(2) of Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package\ntravel, package holidays and package tours[21];\n(c)                   \nThe definition in point(i) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n'\u00abperson with reduced mobility\u00bb means any\nperson as defined in Article 2(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 concerning\nthe rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when\ntravelling by air[22].'\n(d)                   \nThe following sentence is added to the\ndefinition of \"cancellation\" in point (l):\n'A flight where the aircraft took off but, for\nwhatever reason, was subsequently forced to land at an airport other than the\nairport of destination or to return to the airport of departure, shall be\nconsidered a cancelled flight.'\n(e)                   \nThe following definitions are added: \n'(m)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00abextraordinary circumstances\u00bb means circumstances\nwhich, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in the normal exercise of\nthe activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual control.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, extraordinary circumstances shall include\nthe circumstances set out in the Annex;\n(n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00abflight\u00bb means an air transport\noperation between two airports;

Where a musical instrument is too large to\nbe stowed safely in a suitable baggage compartment within the cabin or under an\nappropriate passenger seat, an air carrier may request the payment of a second\nfare where such musical instruments are carried as hand luggage on a second\nseat. Where a second seat is purchased an air carrier should make reasonable\nefforts to seat the passenger and the musical instrument concerned together.\nWhere available and if requested, musical instruments shall be carried in a heated\npart of an aircraft cargo hold subject to applicable safety rules, space\nconstraints and the technical specifications of the aircraft concerned.

The following circumstances shall be\nconsidered as extraordinary:\ni. natural disasters rendering impossible the\nsafe operation of the flight;\nii. technical problems which are not inherent\nin the normal operation of the aircraft, such as the identification\nof a defect during the flight operation concerned and which prevents the normal\ncontinuation of the operation; or a hidden manufacturing defect revealed by the\nmanufacturer or a competent authority and which impinges on flight safety;\niii. security risks, acts of sabotage or terrorism rendering impossible the safe\noperation of the flight;\niv. life-threatening health risks or medical\nemergencies necessitating the interruption or deviation of the flight concerned;\nv. air traffic management restrictions or closure\nof airspace or an airport;\nvi. meteorological conditions incompatible with\nflight safety; and\nvii. labour disputes at the operating air\ncarrier or at essential service providers such as airports and Air Navigation Service\nProviders.\n2. The following circumstances shall not be\nconsidered as extraordinary:\ni. technical problems inherent in the normal\noperation of the aircraft, such as a problem identified during the routine\nmaintenance or during the pre-flight check of the aircraft or which arises due\nto failure to correctly carry out such maintenance or pre-flight check; and\nii. unavailability of flight crew or cabin crew\n(unless caused by labour disputes).\nAnnex 2\n'ANNEX\nAir\ncarrier liability for passengers and their baggage\nThis information notice summarises the\nliability rules applied by Community air carriers as required by EU legislation\nand the Montreal Convention.\nCompensation\nin the case of death or injury\nThere are no financial limits to the\nliability for passenger injury or death caused by an accident on board the\naircraft or during any of the operations of embarkation and disembarkation. For\ndamages up to 113,100 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency), the carrier\ncannot exclude or limit its liability. Above that amount, the air carrier is\nnot liable if it proves that it was not negligent or otherwise at fault, or\nthat the damage was solely due to the negligence or other fault of a third\nparty.\nAdvance\npayments\nIf a passenger is killed or injured, the\nair carrier must make an advance payment, to cover immediate economic needs,\nwithin 15 days from the identification of the person entitled to compensation.\nIn the event of death, this advance payment shall not be less than 18 096\nSDRs (approximate amount in local currency).\nPassenger\ndelays\nIn case of passenger delay, the air carrier\nis liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage\nor it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for passenger delay\nis limited to 4 694 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency).\nbaggage\nloss, damage or delay\nIn case of baggage loss, damage or delay,\nthe air carrier is liable for damage up to 1 113 SDRs (approximate amount in\nlocal currency), the compensation limit being applicable per passenger and not\nper piece of checked baggage, unless a higher limit has been agreed upon\nbetween the carrier and the passenger through a special declaration of\ninterest. For damaged or lost baggage, the air carrier is not liable if the\ndamage or loss is caused by an inherent quality or defect of the baggage. For\ndelayed baggage, the air carrier shall not be liable when it has taken all\nreasonable measures to avoid the damage resulting from the delay of the baggage\nor when it was impossible to take such measures. In case of hand luggage,\nincluding personal items, the airline is only liable if the damage has resulted\nfrom its fault. \nHigher\nlimits for baggage\nA passenger can benefit from a higher\nliability limit by making a special declaration at the latest at check-in and\nby paying a supplementary fee if so required. Such supplementary fee shall be\nbased on a tariff which is related to the additional costs involved in\ntransporting and insuring the baggage concerned over and above the liability\nlimit of 1 131 SDRs. The tariff shall be made available to passengers upon\nrequest. Disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility shall systematically\nbe offered free of charge the option of making a special declaration of\ninterest for the transportation of their mobility equipment.\nTime\nLimit for complaints on baggage\nIf the baggage is damaged, delayed, lost or\ndestroyed, the passenger must in all cases write and complain to the air\ncarrier as soon as possible. A time limit to complain of 7 days applies in case\nthe baggage was damaged and 21 days in case it was delayed, in both cases from\nthe date on which the baggage was placed at the passenger's disposal. In order\nto easily meet these deadlines, the air carrier must offer passengers the\npossibility to fill in a complaint form at the airport. Such complaint form,\nwhich may also take the form of a Property Irregularity Report (PIR), must be\naccepted by the air carrier at the airport as a complaint.\nLiability\nof contracting and actual carriers\nIf the air carrier actually performing the\nflight is not the same as the contracting air carrier, the passenger has the\nright to address a complaint or to make a claim for damages against either. This\nincludes cases where a special declaration of interest at delivery has been\nagreed with the actual carrier.\nTime\nlimit for action\nAny action in court to claim damages must\nbe brought within two years from the date of arrival of the aircraft, or from the\ndate on which the aircraft ought to have arrived.\nBasis\nfor the information\nThe basis for the rules described above is\nthe Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999, which is implemented in the Community\nby Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No 889/2002 and by\nRegulation (EU) No xxx) and national legislation of the Member States.'\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on\ncompensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and\nof cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No\n295/91, (OJ L46, 17.2.2004, p.1).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 of the Council of 9\nOctober 1997 on air carrier liability in respect of the carriage of passengers\nand their baggage by air (OJ L 285, 17.10.1997, p.1) as amended by Regulation\n(EC) No 889/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 May 2002\n(OJ L 140, 30.5.2002, p.2)\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2010) 0603, 16 Octobre 2010\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards\na competitive and resource efficient transport system COM(2011) 144 final, see\npage 23: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0144:FIN:EN:PDF\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Communication from the Commission to the European\nParliament and the Council on the application of Regulation 261/2004 establishing\ncommon rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied\nboarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0174:FIN:EN:PDF).\nCOM (2011) 174 final\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Parliament resolution on the functioning and\napplication of established rights of people travelling by air, 2011/2150(INI), http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P7-TA-2012-99\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C364, 18.12.2000, p. 1\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://ec.europa.eu/transport/passengers/consultations/2012-03-11-apr_en.htm\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://ec.europa.eu/transport/passengers/events/2012-05-30-stakeholder-conference_en.htm\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 24 September 2008 establishing common rules for\nthe operation of air services in the Community, OJ L 293 of 31.10.2008.\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See the Commission's proposals: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/redress_cons/adr_policy_work_en.htm\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L46, 17.2.2004, p.1\n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L285, 17.10.1997, p.1;
