The reason at that time was the total isolation of the\nIcelandic road system from the European road system. Practically there were no\nroad transport vehicles engaged in the international carriage of goods between\nIceland and Europe. For that reason, Icelandic statistics on domestic carriage\nof goods by road would not add any further information to the statistics on European\ncarriage of goods by road. The situation in 2012 is the same. Therefore\nRegulation (EU) No 70/2012 shall not apply to Iceland.\nThe main reason that Liechtenstein was not\nexempted from Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 of 25 May 1998 was the\nassumption that the number of the road transport vehicles would increase in the\nfuture, but the contrary was the case. There was a substantial reduction of the\nfreight transports from 2005, the first year of the survey, until 2010:\nnumber of enterprises minus 25%;\nnumber of road transport vehicles minus\n19%;\nnumber of laden vehicle kilometres minus\n32%;\nfreight in tons minus 24%;\nton kilometres minus 22%. \nIn 2010, Liechtenstein\u2019s road transport\nvehicles had 491 EU transport licenses. But not all vehicles do regularly carry\nout road freight transport operations on the territory of EU Member States.[3] The Swiss Customs Authorities\nregister each transport vehicle leaving the customs area of Switzerland and\nLiechtenstein. In the year 2010, 458 different transport vehicles left the\ncustoms area of Switzerland and Liechtenstein but only 268 vehicles crossed the\nborder into the European Union once every two weeks.\nThe demand for the results of the survey is\nvery limited. There are only six subscribers for the publications from outside\nthe administration and very few downloads of the publications on the internet. \nIn the case of the survey on carriage of\ngoods by road, there is no balance between the burden on respondents, the high\ncosts for the statistical office and the benefits at European and national\nlevel. The data's value added for European Statistics is very limited and there\nis no domestic demand for the results of the survey. This contradicts two major\nprinciples of the statistical Code of Practice:\nAccording\nto principle 9 of the statistical Code of Practice the reporting burden has to\nbe proportionate to the needs of the users and may not be excessive for\nrespondents. An obligation for Liechtenstein to carry out the survey on\ntransport of goods by road is not in line with this principle as the excessive\nburden for respondents is not proportionate to the very small interest of users\nfor these data.\nAccording to principle 11 of the\nstatistical Code of Practice, European statistics have to meet the need of\nusers. It follows from this that statistical data which neither respond to a\nneed at European nor at national level should not be collected. \nIn view of this, a discussion took place\nwith representatives of Eurostat and DG Move and Lichtenstein at a meeting in\nLuxembourg on 21 February 2013, on an adaptation text according to which\nRegulation (EU) No 70/2012 shall not apply to Liechtenstein for as long as the\nnumber of Liechtenstein-registered goods road transport vehicles which\nregularly carry out road freight transport operations on the territory of EEA\nMember States (thus outside the Swiss-Liechtenstein Customs territory) does not\nexceed 400 vehicles. \nIn order for Eurostat to be able to monitor\nthe number of Liechtenstein-registered goods road transport vehicles which\nregularly carry out road freight transport operations on the territory of EEA\nMember States, the adaptation furthermore foresees an obligation for\nLiechtenstein to annually submit this number to Eurostat. As Liechtenstein\nreceives these numbers from Switzerland (as mentioned above the Swiss Customs\nAuthorities register each transport vehicle leaving the customs area of\nSwitzerland and Liechtenstein) with some months delay, the deadline for\nsubmission of these numbers to Eurostat shall be end of April following the\nyear to which the numbers relate.\nFor the purpose of the adaptation, the term\n\u201cregularly\u201d is defined as \u201cleaving the Swiss-Liechtenstein Custom Union\nterritory towards the EU more than twice a month\u201d.\nFor the case that the number of\nLiechtenstein-registered goods road transport vehicles which regularly carry\nout road freight transport operations on the territory of EEA Member States\nexceeds 400 vehicles and Regulation (EU) No 70/2012 becomes applicable to\nLiechtenstein, the adaptation clarifies (in line with what has been so far\nforeseen with regard to Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 and due to the reasons\nhighlighted above) that the data collection method shall be adapted to the\nstructural characteristics of road transport in the country, in agreement with\nEurostat. In particular, Liechtenstein may transmit data covering only vehicles\nwhich regularly carry out road freight transport operations on the territory of\nEEA Member States.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\n2894/94 concerning arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement provides\nthat the Council establishes the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf\non such Decisions, on a proposal from the Commission. \nThe Commission submits the Draft
