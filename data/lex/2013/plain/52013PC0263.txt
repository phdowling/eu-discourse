Following an anti-circumvention investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, this duty was extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97[2] to imports of certain bicycles parts originating in the PRC. Following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000[3], decided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained. Following an interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005[4], decided to increase the anti-dumping duty in force to 48.5%. Following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011[5], decided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained. \n   || Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || Consultation of interested parties \n   || Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n   || Collection and use of expertise \n   || There was no need for external expertise. \n   || Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 9 March 2012, the Commission announced by a notice, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the initiation of an interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of bicycles originating in the PRC. The review was initiated on an ex officio basis. The review investigation found that circumstances with regard to the dumping and injury have not changed significantly and that therefore the continued imposition of the measures was necessary to offset the dumping. It has also established that, should anti-dumping measures be lifted, this would result in a continuation of dumping and material injury to the Union industry. It was further established that the continuation of measures was not against the interest of the Union. As regards the three co-operating exporting producers, the investigation showed that there was a lasting change of circumstances and therefore their individual dumping margins should be amended. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to amend Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 5 June 2013 at the latest. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n   || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n   || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0138 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n990/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of bicycles\noriginating in the People's Republic of China following an interim review\npursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[6]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 9(4) and 11(3), (5) and\n(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('Commission') after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA. PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures in force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nRegulation (EEC) no 2474/93[7] the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 30.6% on\nimports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China ('the PRC' or 'the country concerned) (the \u2018original investigation\u2019). Following an\nanti-circumvention investigation in accordance with Article 13 of the basic\nRegulation, this duty was extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97[8] to imports of certain bicycles parts originating in the PRC. In\naddition, it was decided to create an 'exemption scheme' on the basis of\nArticle 13(2) of the basic Regulation. The details of the scheme were provided\nfor in Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97[9]. In\norder to receive an exemption from the extended duty, bicycle producers in the\nUnion have to respect the conditions of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation,\nnamely to respect a ratio of less than 60% of Chinese bicycle parts in their\noperation or the addition of more than 25% value to all parts brought into the\noperation. To date, more than 250 exemptions have been\ngranted.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an expiry review\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation\n(EC) No 1524/2000[10],\ndecided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nan interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation ('amending\ninterim review'), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005[11], decided to increase the anti-dumping duty in force to 48.5%. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a review of the\nanti-circumvention measures pursuant to Article 13(4) and 11(3) of the basic\nRegulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 171/2008[12], decided to maintain the\nextension of the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of bicycles originating in\nthe PRC to imports of certain bicycles parts from the PRC.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nan expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the\nCouncil, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011[13] (the\n'previous investigation'), decided that the above mentioned measures should be\nmaintained.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ex officio initiation \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe expiry review concluded in October 2011, evidence at the disposal of the\nCommission indicated that as far as dumping and injury are concerned, the\ncircumstances on the basis of which the existing measures were imposed might\nhave changed and that these changes may be of a lasting nature.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prima facie\nevidence at the Commission\u2019s disposal indicated that the export quota system\nthat applied to bicycle producers in the PRC and that hindered the exporting\nproducers in being granted market economy treatment in the amending interim\nreview, has been abolished in January 2011.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nchanges to the structure of the Union industry have taken place. In particular,\nseveral Union producers switched from the complete cycle of production to\n(partial) assembly operations using imported parts.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\ndue to the enlargements of the European Union of 2004 and 2007, a significant\nnumber of producers joined the Union bicycle industry. In addition, several\nproducers which had been part of the Union industry before the two enlargement\nrounds moved their production facilities or set up new facilities in the new\nMember States. As a result, the cost level of the Union industry might have\nchanged.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nthe present injury elimination level was calculated on the basis of bicycles\nmade out of steel whereas it appears that currently the majority of bicycles\nare made of aluminium alloys. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All these developments\nappeared to be of a lasting nature and therefore substantiated the need to\nreassess the injury and dumping findings.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the number of\ncompanies benefiting from the exemption scheme is rapidly growing, without the\nscheme having been adapted since its introduction in 1997. In addition, the\nmonitoring system of the imports of parts exempted from the anti-dumping\nmeasures has become highly complex and burdensome, which might endanger its\neffectiveness.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima facie evidence\nexisted for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 11(3) of the\nbasic Regulation, the Commission announced by a notice (\u2018Notice of initiation\u2019)[14], published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 March\n2012, the initiation, on an ex officio basis, of an interim review of\nthe anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of bicycles originating in the\nPRC.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel\nanti-circumvention investigation\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 25 September 2012 by\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 875/2012[15], the\nCommission initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of\nanti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n990/2011 on imports of bicycles originating in the PRC by imports of bicycles\nconsigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as\noriginating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, and making\nsuch imports subject to registration ('the\nanti-circumvention investigation').\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nMay 2013, the Council by Regulation (EU) No XXX/2013[16] (the 'anti-circumvention Regulation') extended the anti-dumping\nmeasures in force on imports of bicycles originating in the PRC to imports of\nbicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether\ndeclared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not,\nas these imports were found to circumvent the measures by transhipment and/or assembly\noperations within the meaning of Article 13(1) and (2) of the basic Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel anti-subsidy\ninvestigation \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n27 April 2012, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union[17], the\ninitiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with regard to imports into the Union\nof bicycles originating in the PRC ('anti-subsidy\ninvestigation').\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In November 2012 the\nCommission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union[18], that the findings in the anti-circumvention investigation may be\nused in the anti-subsidy investigation mentioned in recital (14) and (15)\nabove. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In May 2013 the Commission\nby Regulation (EU) No xxx/2013,\nterminated the anti-subsidy investigation without imposing measures[19].\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission officially notified known Union producers, known associations of\nUnion producers, the known exporting producers in the PRC and an association of\nChinese producers, the representatives of the country concerned, known\nimporters and associations of importers, known Union producers of bicycle parts\nand their associations and known association of users of the initiation of the\ninvestigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in\nthe Notice of initiation.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nhigh number of exporting producers, Union producers and unrelated importers,\nsampling was provided for in the Notice of initiation in accordance with\nArticle 17 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable the Commission to decide\nwhether sampling would be necessary and if so, to select samples, all exporting\nproducers and their known association, all Union producers and unrelated\nimporters were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide,\nas specified in the Notice of initiation, basic information on their activities\nrelated to the product concerned during the period from 1 January 2011 to 31\nDecember 2011.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe representatives of the country concerned did not come forward at\ninitiation, the Commission contacted about 70 Chinese companies already known\nto the Commission services from the previous investigation. At a later stage,\nwhen the anti-subsidy investigation mentioned in recital (16) above was\ninitiated, the Commission identified around 300 additional Chinese exporting\nproducers that were contacted in the context of this interim review as well.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nspite of the Commission's efforts to obtain cooperation, only eight Chinese groups\nof exporting producers came forward, out of which only four reported exports to\nthe Union in the review investigation period ('RIP') defined in recital (37)\nbelow, representing less than 4% of the total imports from the PRC of bicycles\nin the RIP. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\nit was decided that sampling was not necessary for exporting producers in the\nPRC.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nstated in recitals (63) to (64) and (131) below, for one Chinese exporting group,\nGiant China, application of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation was\nwarranted. Consequently, the cooperation of the Chinese exporting producers\ndecreased even further. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (32)\nto (35) below, a sample of Union producers was selected.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (36)\nbelow, it was decided that sampling was not necessary for unrelated importers.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\nquestionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other parties\nthat so requested within the deadlines set out in the Notice of initiation,\nnamely the sampled Union producers, the cooperating exporting producers in the\nPRC, unrelated importers that made themselves known as described in recital (36)\nbelow and to the known producers of bicycle parts in the Union.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replies to the\nquestionnaires and other submissions were received from four groups of Chinese\nexporting producers and their representative, eight sampled Union producers,\none association of users and eight associations of the Union producers, 53\nbicycle parts producers and one association of producers of bicycle parts. None\nof the contacted unrelated importers submitted a questionnaire reply. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for a\ndetermination of dumping, resulting injury, causality and Union interest and\ncarried out verifications at the premises of the following companies:\n(a)         \nProducers of bicycles in the Union\n\u2013              \nAccell Hunland, Hungary\n\u2013              \nDecathlon RGVS, Portugal\n\u2013              \nDenver srl, Italy\n\u2013              \nSC Eurosport DHS, Romania\n\u2013              \nKoninklijke Gazelle, Netherlands\n\u2013              \nMaxcom Ltd, Bulgaria\n\u2013              \nMIFA, Germany\n\u2013              \nSprick Rowery, Poland\n(b)         \nProducers of bicycle parts in the Union\n\u2013              \nChimsport, Romania \n\u2013              \nTelai Olagnero, Italy\n(c)         \nExporting producers in the PRC\n\u2013              \nIdeal (Dong Guan) Bike Co., \n\u2013              \nOyama Bicycles (Taicang) Co.,\n\u2013              \nZhejiang Baoguilai Vehicle Co.,\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the need to\nestablish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC to which MET might\nnot be granted, a verification visit to establish normal value on the basis of\ndata from an analogue country took place at the premises of the following\ncompanies:\n\u2013              \nDistribuidora de Bicicletas Benotto, S.A. DE\nC.V., Mexico City, Mexico,\n\u2013              \nBicicletas Magistroni, Mexico City, Mexico,\n\u2013              \nBicicletas Mercurio SA DE CV, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure of\nessential facts and considerations ('the disclosure') some parties argued that\nan inadequate period was provided for the parties to comment. In this respect it\nis noted that the parties were provided sufficient time to comment in\naccordance with Article 20(5) of the basic Regulation. The comment is therefore\ndismissed. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling of Union\nProducers\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission announced in the\nNotice of initiation that it had provisionally selected a sample of Union\nproducers. This sample consisted of eight companies, out of over 380 Union\nproducers that were known prior to the initiation of the investigation,\nselected in particular on the basis of the largest representative volume of\nproduction and sales that can reasonably be investigated within the time\navailable taking into account the geographical spread. The sample covered the largest producing countries ranked according\nto the production volumes. For each of these countries, the companies included\nin the sample were among the largest representative cooperating producers. The\nsample also captured entities from the largest cooperating groups. Particular\nattention was given in this case to sampling an equal number of companies from\nthe old and the new Member States. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsample represented around 25% of the total estimated Union production and sales\nduring the RIP. Interested\nparties were invited to consult the file and to comment on the appropriateness\nof this choice within 15 days of the date of publication of the Notice of\ninitiation. All interested parties, who so requested\nand showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were\ngranted a hearing. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain\ninterested parties raised objections concerning the sampling of Union\nproducers. They claimed that: (i) the provisional sample included only certain\nlegal entities pertaining to groups of related companies rather than all legal entities making up the full economic entity\nproducing the product at issue; and (ii) the proposal included a company that\nhas been recently operating at a loss, whereas the Union producers were\nthriving during that period. In addition, it was claimed that these losses were not linked\nto the product concerned.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These\narguments were dismissed on the following grounds: (i) The entities\nbelonging to larger groups that were found to operate independently from other\nsubsidiaries of the same group were considered representative of the Union\nindustry and there was therefore no need to investigate the entire group on a\nconsolidated basis. (ii) The interested\nparty concerned did not substantiate its claim that the company selected in the\nsample and which allegedly realised losses would indeed not be representative\nfor the Union industry. Finally, while the selected sample should be\nrepresentative for the Union industry, the companies selected do not\nnecessarily need to be homogeneous. The claim of this party had to be therefore\nrejected. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling of Unrelated\nImporters\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling of unrelated importers was also provided for in the Notice\nof Initiation. All known unrelated importers were contacted upon initiation.\nGiven the small number of replies received in the framework of the sampling\nexercise, no sample was selected. All unrelated importers that came forward\nwere invited to cooperate and received a questionnaire. None of the unrelated importers provided a questionnaire reply,\nnor did they cooperate further in the present investigation.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 January 2011 to\n31 December 2011 (the 'review investigation period' or 'RIP'). The examination\nof trends in the context of the analysis of injury covered the period from\nJanuary 2008 to the end of the RIP (the 'period considered').\nB. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product subject to this review investigation is bicycles and\nother cycles (including delivery tricycles but excluding unicycles), not\nmotorised ('the product under review') originating in the PRC, currently falling within CN codes 8712 00\n30 and ex 8712 00 70.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nin the previous investigation,\nthe bicycles were classified in the following categories:\n\u2013              \n(A) ATB (al-terrain bicycles including mountain\nbicycles 24\u2033 or 26\u2033),\n\u2013              \n(B) trekking/city/hybrid/VTC/touring bicycles\n26\u2033 or 28\u2033,\n\u2013              \n(C) junior action (BMX) and children's bicycles\n16\u2033 or 20\u2033,\n\u2013              \n(D) other bicycles/cycles (excluding unicycles).\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All types of bicycles as\ndefined above have the same basic physical and technical characteristics.\nFurthermore, they are sold through similar distribution channels such as\nspecialised retailers, sport chains and mass merchandisers on the Union market.\nThe basic application and use of bicycles being identical, they are largely\ninterchangeable and models from different categories therefore compete with\neach other. On this basis, it was concluded that all the categories form one\nsingle product. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nparty argued that the different types of bicycles have significantly\ndifferent characteristics and intended uses and also significantly different prices,\nwhile from the consumers\u2019 perspective these different types of bicycle are not\ninterchangeable. Furthermore, it was argued that steel\nand aluminium bicycles are not considered interchangeable and that their prices\nare different as well.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nsupport of its argument, the party submitted a study about the basic physical\nand technical characteristics and uses of five different product types as well\nas their interchangeability. It should be noted that the study was allegedly\nbased on the replies of 36 individuals, however it is not clear how the\nrespondents have been chosen. It seems furthermore that it was prepared\nspecifically for the current investigation. The study does not include any\nquantifiable data. It is noted that the content of this study is apparently\nbased on statements of customers and/or bicycles producers rather than\nverifiable evidence. Therefore, the representativity of the results of this\nstudy is questionable.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The party has not brought\nany other evidence in support of its claim. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has confirmed that all types of bicycles, as defined\nabove, have the same basic physical and technical characteristics. In\nparticular, it was found that the use of different raw materials did not have\nan impact on the basic characteristics of a bicycle. Although steel and\naluminium have some different technical properties like weight, the basic\ncharacteristics of the bicycles made of steel and aluminium remain similar. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, there was no\nspecific evidence provided by the party that bicycles made of steel on one hand\nand those made of aluminium on the other hand had indeed different basic\nphysical and technical characteristics.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the specific\napplication, use and consumer perception, the current investigation has\nconfirmed that all bicycles have the same basic applications and perform\nessentially the same function. While it is true that different categories are\nin principal intended to meet different end users requirements, end-users will\nregularly put a bicycle in a particular category to a variety of uses. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are consequently no\nclear dividing lines based on end-users' use and consumers' perceptions of\ndifferent categories.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Union\nproducers themselves often make no distinction among the bicycles classified in\ndifferent categories with regard to production, distribution and accounting.\nIndeed, they often have a similar manufacturing process for all categories of\nbicycles. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the bicycles\nin the various categories are sold through similar distribution channels such\nas specialised retailers, sport chains and mass merchandisers on the Union\nmarket. \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\nconcluded that all the categories form one single product.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party raised the point\nthat the current investigation covers two CN codes as stated in recital (38)\nabove while the previous investigation stated in recital (5) above covered\nthree CN codes, i.e. ex 8712 00 10, 8712 00 30 and ex 8712 00 80. In this\nregard, it is noted that the changing of the codes was due to amendments to the\nCombined Nomenclature imposed by Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011 with the effect\nas from 1.1.2012[20].\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, the party\nclaimed that bicycles without ball bearings should not be considered a single\nproduct with the bicycles with ball bearings. However, the investigation showed\nthat bicycles with ball bearings and bicycles without ball bearing share the\nsame technical characteristics and uses. Furthermore, the party has not\nsubstantiated its claim with any supporting evidence and therefore, the claim\nis rejected.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the party argued\nthat there is a significant difference in the average import prices as recorded\nin Eurostat between the two CN codes covering the product concerned. In this\nregards, it is highlighted that as stated in recital (157) below due to the\nproduct mix, the average price as recorded in Eurostat can only serve as an\nindicator of price trends, but is not useful when comparing sales prices\nbetween various countries and the Union. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\nthe disclosure one party reiterated its claim that the different types of\nbicycles covered by the scope of this investigation are not like products and\nclaimed that it had submitted positive evidence in support of the differences\nin raw materials, physical characteristics, technological features, end-uses\nthat allegedly exist among the different type of bicycles.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it should\nbe noted that the positive evidence that the party claims to have submitted is\nactually the study assessed by the Commission in the recital (42) above. After\nduly assessment, the Commission concluded that the representativity\nof the results of this study was questionable for the reasons mentioned in\nrecital (42) above. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties claimed that\nchildren's bicycles defined by the party as bicycles with the size of the wheel\nof less than and including 16 inch should be excluded from the product scope of\nthe investigation. These claims were based on the assumption that in particular\nduration of uses and simplicity in characteristics clearly divided these\nbicycles from other type of bicycles falling within the scope of the current\ninvestigation.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, these claims were\ndeemed insufficient to exclude bicycles with the size of the wheel of less than\nand including 16 inch from the definition of the product concerned because they\nwere not substantiated with sufficient evidence showing that in this\ninvestigation a clear dividing line could be drawn between bicycles with the\nsize of the wheel of less than and including 16 inch and other bicycles types\nwithin the scope of the investigation. In fact, to the contrary it was found\nthat the essential physical and technical characteristics of the bicycles with\nthe size of the wheel of less than and including 16 inch which were common to\nthose of the product concerned \u2013 a human-powered, pedal-driven vehicle having\nmore than one wheel attached to a frame \u2013 were much more important than any\ndifferences (i.e. essentially size of the wheel). Furthermore, it appeared that\nproduction, sales channels and consumer service were not fundamentally\ndifferent from other bicycles types under investigation. Just the mere fact\nthat bicycles with the size of the wheel of less than and including 16 inch\nform a distinctive product sub-group within the scope of the product concerned\ndoes not warrant the exclusion from the product scope. Indeed, it was found\nthat there is no clear dividing line between bicycles with the size of the\nwheel of less than and including 16 inch and the product concerned, but that\nthere is rather a large overlap regarding the definition of the product\nconcerned, notably that it is a human-powered, pedal-driven vehicle having more\nthan one wheel used essentially for transportation and spot. In this regard,\nthe investigation revealed that one of the co-operating Chinese exporting\nproducers was actually exporting to the Union bicycles with the wheel size of\n12 inch which were not considered necessarily bicycles for children but they\nwere actually folding bicycles used by adults for which storage was an\nimportant feature of the bicycles. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the request to\nexclude bicycles with the size of the wheel of less than and including 16 inch\nfrom the product scope of the investigation is rejected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bicycles produced and sold\nby the Union industry on the Union market, those produced and sold on the\nanalogue country market and those imported into the Union market originating in\nthe PRC have the same basic physical and technical characteristics and the same\nuses and are, therefore, considered to be alike within the meaning of Article\n1(4) of the basic Regulation. \nC. DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market Economy Treatment\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MET assessment\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 2(7)(b)\nof the basic Regulation, in anti-dumping investigations concerning imports\noriginating in the PRC, normal value shall be determined in accordance with\nparagraphs 1 to 6 of the said Article for those producers which were found to\nmeet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. Briefly\nand for ease of reference only, these criteria are set out in summarised form\nbelow:\n\u2013              \nBusiness decisions are made in response to\nmarket signals, without significant State interference, and costs reflect\nmarket values; \n\u2013              \nFirms have one clear set of basic accounting\nrecords, which are independently audited in line with international accounting\nstandards (IAS) and are applied for all purposes; \n\u2013              \nThere are no significant distortions carried\nover from the former non-market economy system; \n\u2013              \nBankruptcy and Property laws guarantee stability\nand legal certainty; and \n\u2013              \nExchange rate conversions are carried out at\nmarket rates.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present\ninvestigation, all exporting groups that initially cooperated with the\ninvestigation requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation\nand replied to the MET claim form within the given deadlines.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For all exporting groups\nthat initially cooperated with the investigation, the Commission sought all\ninformation deemed necessary and verified information submitted in the MET\nclaim at the premises of the groups in question.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nreply of one group, Giant China, was considered as being significantly\ndeficient as it did not include all the required information on the structure\nof the group, notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s efforts to obtain the necessary\ninformation from the group.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nrequired by Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation, Giant China was informed of\nthe likely application of facts available to it and invited to provide\ncomments. As Giant China, however, refused to provide the Commission with the\nnecessary information, Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation was applied and\nthe claim for MET was rejected. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the\ninvestigation revealed that MET could not be granted to any of the Chinese\ncompany groups as none of them fulfilled all the criteria set out in Article\n2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, for the following reasons.\nCriterion 1\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All cooperating exporting\ngroups failed to demonstrate that they fulfil Criterion 1 because of State\ninterference in decisions concerning the main raw materials (steel &\naluminium). The cost of steel and aluminium for the cooperating exporting\ngroups represents at least around 20% to 25% of the cost of production of the\nproduct concerned. Many companies are fully vertically integrated, meaning that\nthey purchase the aluminium ingots or steel to produce tubes which then are\nused to produce frames/forks and finally the bicycles. \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation\ndemonstrated that the three cooperating Chinese groups of exporting producers\nacquired the steel and aluminium used for the production of the product\nconcerned on the Chinese domestic market. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices are based on the\nquotation of aluminium in the State-controlled Shanghai Non-ferrous Metal\nExchange market (\u2018the Exchange\u2019 or \u2018SHFE\u2019). The SHFE is a closed exchange for\nChinese-registered companies and Chinese citizens and it is controlled by the\nState Securities Regulatory Commission. Several rules governing the functioning\nof the Exchange contribute to low volatility and prices\nwhich do not reflect the market value at the SHFE: daily price\nfluctuations are limited to 4% above or below the settlement price of the\nprevious trading day, trading happens at a low frequency (until the 15th day of\neach month), futures contracts are limited to a duration of up to 12 months,\nand transaction fees are charged by both the Exchange and brokers.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, as concerns SHFE\ntransactions, physical deliveries can only take place in an approved warehouse\nwithin the PRC, unlike international exchanges, where delivery can take place\nworldwide. Moreover, as the SHFE is a platform for physical exchanges only (no\nderivatives are sold), this completely insulates the Chinese aluminium market.\nAs a consequence, arbitrage with the worldwide benchmark, the London Metals\nExchange (\u2018LME\u2019) or other markets is practically not possible and the exchange\nworks in isolation from other world markets. Therefore, an arbitrage among\nthese markets cannot take place. During the RIP primary aluminium prices were\naround 7% lower on the SHFE (excluding VAT) as compared to the LME (also\nexcluding VAT), compared on a spot price basis. \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The State also interferes\nwith the price setting mechanisms in the SHFE as it is both a seller and a\npurchaser, via the State Reserve Bureau and other State Bodies, of primary\naluminium. In addition, the State sets daily price limits via the rules of the\nSHFE which have been approved by the State Regulator, the China Securities\nRegulatory Commission (\u2018the CSRC\u2019).\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The PRC supports the\nprocessing of aluminium products by granting a partial VAT refund on the export\nof many aluminium products (for bicycles, the rate is 15%); in case of exports\nof primary aluminium instead, there is no refund. This is an incentive for\nChinese industry to further process aluminium and has a direct bearing on the\navailability and price of primary aluminium on the domestic market. In\naddition, the investigation demonstrated that primary aluminium for export is\nsubject to a 17 % tax, while no export tax is applied on exports of bicycles.\nThis strengthens the finding of interference of the Chinese State on the domestic market of aluminium. These tools have a downward impact on domestic\nprices encouraging domestic industry to manufacture finished goods\nincorporating aluminium (such as the product concerned) for both the domestic\nand export markets. \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A further distortion by the\n  Chinese State is in the form of interventions in the market by the State\nReserves Bureau (\u2018SRB\u2019) which is part of the National Development Reform\nCommission (\u2018NDRC\u2019). At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 the SRB\nstarted buying up stocks of primary aluminium from Chinese aluminium smelters,\nin order to stimulate the price of the commodity. The SRB sold primary\naluminium back onto the market such as at the start of November 2010 as\nreported by Bloomberg[21].\nThe Xinhua News Agency reported the stockpiling measures in December 2008,\nexplaining that it was planned to accumulate 300 000 tonnes of aluminium at\nprices which were 10% higher than the market price in a measure designed to\nprop up prices[22].\nThe SRB stockpiling plan involved buying from several Chinese smelters although\naround half was to be bought from the Aluminium Corporation of China Ltd. The\nabove demonstrates that the Chinese State has a primary role in the setting of\nprices of primary aluminium and that it interferes in the market. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That the significant State\ninterference, as described above, is clearly targeted is, inter alia,\ncorroborated by the 12th 5 Year Development Plan for Aluminium\n(2011-2015) in which the Government of the PRC explicitly states its intention\nof \u2018adjusting tax and export tax rebates and other economic levers, and\nstrictly control the total amount of expansion and exports of primary\nproducts\u2019. This plan continues the policy which existed in the previous\nAluminium Plan. Furthermore these plans have been implemented over many years\nand, as demonstrated above, during the RIP several implementing measures were\nin operation.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, the multiple\nState-induced distortions in the Chinese primary aluminium prices affect the\nraw material prices. In addition, the producers enjoy an advantage from these\ndistortions, in the sense that they normally make their purchases in the\nChinese market from local suppliers using Chinese spot markets prices (or SHFE)\nas a benchmark. During the RIP, these prices were around 7 % lower than the\nworld market prices. In theory, Chinese companies can also buy certain\nquantities at LME prices when prices in the Chinese market are higher as a\nresult of State intervention \u2013 whilst the opposite is impossible for\nnon-Chinese operators.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was therefore concluded\nthat the Chinese aluminium market is distorted due to significant intervention\nof the State.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interference by the Chinese\nState in the steel sector is demonstrated by the fact that a large majority of\nthe large Chinese steel producers are State-owned and steel installed capacity\nand output are influenced by the various five-year Industrial Plans, in\nparticular the current 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) for the iron and steel\nsector.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The State also exercises\nsignificant control over the market of raw materials. Coke (together with iron\nore the major raw material to produce steel) is subject to quantitative\nrestrictions on exports and to an export duty of 40%. It may therefore be\nconcluded that the Chinese steel market is distorted due to significant State\ninterference.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An anti-dumping\ninvestigation which has been conducted by the Commission[23], confirmed the importance of\nthe State intervention also in the specific sector of pipes and tubes, which\nare the main raw material used for the production of steel bicycles.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was therefore concluded\nthat the Chinese steel market is distorted due to significant intervention of\nthe state.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under such circumstances,\nneither of the companies has been in a position to prove that their business\ndecisions regarding acquisition of raw materials are not subject to significant\nState interference and that costs of major inputs substantially reflect market\nvalues. Therefore, they could not demonstrate that they fulfil criterion 1.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the other four\ncriteria, the three co-operating Chinese exporting producers were able to\ndemonstrate that they met the remaining criteria. \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above\nfindings on criterion 1, it was considered, after consultation of the Advisory\nCommittee, that MET should be rejected for the three cooperating Chinese group\nof exporting producers.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission officially disclosed the results of the MET findings to the\ncompanies concerned in the PRC and to the complainant. They were also given an\nopportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing if\nthere were particular reasons to be heard.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the parties\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the MET\ndisclosure, one company argued that the refusal to grant MET is based on the\nChinese bicycle industry as a whole, rather than on an individual company\nbasis. In this respect it is noted that although the Commission made an\nassessment of the steel and aluminium sectors in China, there is a clear link\nbetween the steel and aluminium markets in the PRC and the purchases of steel\nand aluminium products as a raw material by the co-operating groups.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover it was argued that\nthe cost advantage for the Chinese bicycle producers concerning steel and\naluminium is insignificant as it represents only between 1.4% and 1.75% when\nconsidering that primary aluminium and steel account for 20%-25% of the manufacturing\ncost of bicycles and that the price difference between LME and SHFE prices was\n7% during the RIP. \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it is\nhighlighted that the pivotal factor in the analysis is the proportion of the\nraw material in the manufacturing cost (which in this case was significant as\nit accounted for at least 20%-25% of the manufacturing costs) and the fact that\nthe raw material market is distorted in the PRC. The exact quantitative impact\nof the distortion in the company's cost is not considered as a decisive factor.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it was argued\nthat in another investigation the Commission has analysed the prices of the\ndirect raw materials used in the manufacturing of the product concerned rather\nthan the price of the primary raw material and, therefore, in the current case,\nthe Commission should have assessed the State interference in prices of direct\nraw material, i.e. aluminium alloy extrusion, rather than in the primary\naluminium which is the primary raw material. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it is noted\nthat each investigation is analysed on its own merits. Moreover, the fact that\nthe market of primary aluminium is controlled by the State indicates that the\nmarket of intermediary aluminium products also does not operate under market\neconomy conditions, i.e. responding to supply and demand. The claim was\ntherefore rejected.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that any\nprice difference for primary aluminium between SHFE and LME may not lead to a\nprice difference for aluminium alloy extractions between the respective markets,\nand that factors such as production efficiency, residual capacity, and cost of\nenvironmental obligations need to be taken into account. \n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nhighlighted that no evidence was submitted in support of this allegation. In\nthe absence of supporting evidence, the Commission was not in the position to\nanalyse and verify this allegation, which was therefore rejected. \n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it was claimed\nthat, by ignoring the fact that there are a number of subsequent intermediary\nproducts, the Commission ignored the actual characteristics and factors for\npricing the bicycle finish products. In particular, as the bicycle is sold\ndirectly to the end-consumer (unlike the primary aluminium), other factors than\nthe price of the raw material determine the price of the bicycles such as the\nspecific technical features of the bicycle and the demand of the consumers. \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, no concrete\ndetails were provided on these characteristics and factors that should be taken\ninto consideration and therefore it was not possible for the Commission to\ncomment on them. \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was further alleged that\nthe Commission made a wrong assessment of the principles under which the SHFE\noperates. It was argued that the CSRC regulates SHFE functions similarly to, among\nothers, the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers ('AMF') in France or the Financial\nServices Authority ('FSA') in UK and that CSRC's role and specific\nregulatory/supervision measures are consistent with the G-20 principles. As a\nconsequence the MET conclusions that are based on the role of the CSRC and\noperation of the SHFE are without merit. \n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the\ncompany failed to take into account the fact that while FSA[24] and AMF[25] are independent non-governmental bodies, CSRC is a ministry level\nunit operating directly under the State Council[26]. The\nState Council is the highest executive organ of State power, as well as the\nhighest organ of State administration[27]. This\nis another example of the fact that the State is actively involved in the\nregulation of the aluminium market in the PRC. As concerns the compliance to\nG-20 principles, the company merely provided a statement, without really\nexplaining the principles to which it referred. The argument was therefore\nrejected.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, one company\ndisagreed with the Commission's assessment that arbitrage between the worldwide\nbenchmark, the LME, or other markets and SHFE prices is practically not\npossible and that therefore SHFE works in isolation from other world markets. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that this contradicts\nthe company's acceptance of the price difference between the SHFE and the LME\nduring the period when the SHFE price was higher than LME prices by arguing\nthat during that period of time the Chinese producers paid more for the\naluminium products than the Union producers. \n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the company\nargued that as from 2010 the SHFE started to allow aluminium physical delivery\nto bonded warehouses in Shanghai's free trade zone. It follows that this\nstatement does not contradict, but rather confirms the Commission's assessment\nthat physical deliveries can take place only in a warehouse within the PRC\nwhich has been approved by the SHFE, unlike international exchanges, where\ndelivery can take place worldwide.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that the\nSHFE is a futures market and aluminium futures contracts have been traded on\nthe SHFE since 1991 and therefore the Commission's assessment that no\nderivatives are sold on the SHFE is wrong. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed the SHFE is a\nfutures market. However, the futures contracts traded on SHFE are settled by\nphysical delivery. Derivatives products without physical delivery, i.e. not\nactually exercised but traded before their delivery date, are limited in the\nPRC and therefore the SHFE is merely a platform for physical exchanges which\ninsulates the Chinese aluminium market. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that the\nCommission's reasoning relating to the effects on bicycle pricing of the\nVAT/tax measures and inventory measures relating to primary aluminium are\neconomically dubious and insufficiently reasoned.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 However, since the company\ndid not explain which elements the Commission is missing in its analysis, nor\ndid it further substantiate this claim, it was not possible for the Commission\nto comment.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it was argued\nthat there are similarities between the industrial policy in the PRC and the EU\npolicies and that the Commission has not demonstrated that the industrial\npolicy in the PRC has any direct or significant impact on the input decisions,\nbicycles production or sales operation of the Chinese bicycles exporting\nproducers. \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect it is noted\nthat it was not specified to which EU policies the company was referring and\ntherefore the Commission cannot comment on this allegation. In addition,\nconcerning the statement that it has not been demonstrated that the industrial\npolicy in the PRC has a significant impact on the input decisions, production\nor sales of the Chinese exporting producers of bicycles, it is noted that the\nexistence of a 5-year Plan in the Aluminium sector in the PRC, the distortions\nof the aluminium price which is traded on an isolated Exchange when aluminium\nrepresents 20-25% of the total manufacturing costs of a bicycle, indicate a\nclear link between the industrial policy in the PRC and the input decisions,\nproduction and sales of the Chinese exporting producers of bicycles.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that the\nCommission breached the three-month deadline specified in the basic Regulation.\nIn this respect it is noted that due to the fact that the cooperation of the\nChinese exporters was very low, the Commission made extra efforts to obtain\nmore cooperation by contacting a large number of additional exporters that were\nidentified later in the investigation. As a result, it was not possible to make\nthe MET determination within the stipulated period. Moreover, it is recalled\nthat the General Court[28] has recently held that a MET determination made outside the three\nmonth deadline laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation is not in\nitself sufficient to lead to an annulment of a regulation imposing anti-dumping\nmeasures. It is also noted that Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation has\nmeanwhile been amended with the effect that the Commission shall only make MET\ndeterminations in respect of companies included in a sample and that such a\ndetermination shall normally be made within seven months of, but in any event\nnot later than eight months after the initiation of the investigation[29]. This amendment is applicable to all new and pending investigations,\nincluding the present one. The determinations were made within eight months\nfrom the date of the initiation. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nclaim relating to breach of the three month deadline is herewith rejected.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request of parties \n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 One party requested that\nMarket Economy Treatment ('MET') claims of producers in the PRC which stopped\nexporting to the Union should also be analysed. It was alleged that those\nproducers only stopped exporting to the Union due to the anti-dumping duties in\nplace since 2005. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard it is\nhighlighted that the findings with regard to dumping and injury relate to the\nreview investigation period ('RIP') fixed in accordance with the Article 6(1)\nof the basic Regulation. This means that data collected from the exporting\nproducers in view of establishing normal value and the export price also\nstrictly relate only to that period. The MET analysis is carried out in the\ncontext of determining normal value of exporting producers in the PRC which is\nthen compared to the export price during the same period. If a producer did not\nexport the product concerned during the RIP, no export price can be established\nand no dumping margin can be calculated. Therefore, there is no reason to\nexamine MET for a producer which did not export the product concerned during\nthe RIP. Nevertheless, it is recalled that all exporting producers have the\npossibility to request an \"interim review\" to have their situation\nrevised pursuant to Article 11.3 of the basic Regulation or, those exporting\nproducers who have not exported the product concerned during the period of\ninvestigation on which the measures were based, have the possibility to request\na \"new exporter review\" pursuant to Article 11.4 of the same\nRegulation.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, in its request,\nthe party also mentioned the Brosmann Judgement[30] of the\nCourt of Justice of the European Communities and seemed to imply that on that\nbasis, producers in the PRC should be allowed to submit MET claim forms even if\nthey did not export the product concerned to the Union during the current\ninvestigation period. It is noted that the judgement does not address the\nsituation of MET claims by exporting producers who did not export during the\ninvestigation period and is therefore not relevant in the present context. \n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the request\nwas rejected.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that\nexport prices for the companies without exports to the Union in the RIP should\nbe determined on the basis of Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, i.e. on any\nother reasonable basis.\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard it is noted\nthat Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation does not positively imply that an\nexport price shall be constructed for producers of the concerned country in the\ncase that they did not export any quantity to the Union. To the contrary,\nArticle 2(9) of the basic Regulation refers to the re-sales price of the\nimported product as a basis to construct the export price, and to adjustments\nfor all costs incurred between importation and resale, which implies that imports\nto the Union were in fact made. The \"any other reasonable basis\" in\nthe first sentence of this provision refers to specific cases where the\npreceding methodologies mentioned therein cannot be applied. It does not\ndetract from the fact that the Article implies that imports into the Union have taken place during the RIP.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nnone of the Chinese groups that had requested MET could show that they\nfulfilled the criteria set out in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. It\nwas therefore considered that MET should be rejected for all these groups. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual Treatment\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 By\nRegulation (EU) No 765/2012[31], which\nentered into force on 6th September 2012, the European Parliament\nand the Council amended Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. Article 2 of\nRegulation (EU) No 765/2012 stipulated that the amendment shall only apply to\ninvestigations initiated following its entry into force. Consequently, as the\ncurrent investigation was initiated on 9th March 2012, the amendment\ndid not apply to the current investigation.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 2(7)(a)\nof the basic Regulation a country-wide duty, if any, is established for\ncountries falling under Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, except in those\ncases where companies are able to demonstrate, in accordance with Article 9(5)\nof the basic Regulation, that their export prices and quantities as well as the\nconditions and terms of the sales are freely determined, that exchange rates\nare carried out at market rates, and that any State interference is not such as\nto permit circumvention of measures if exporters are given different rates of\nduty. \n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nthree cooperating exporting groups which requested MET also claimed individual\ntreatment in the event they would not be granted MET. On the basis of the\ninformation available, it is established that all three groups in the PRC meet\nall the requirements for individual treatment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal Value\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 2(7)(a)\nof the basic Regulation, normal value for the exporting producers not granted\nMET has to be established on the basis of the domestic prices or constructed\nnormal value in an analogue country.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 For this purpose, in the\nNotice of initiation the Commission suggested Mexico, which was also the\nanalogue country used in the previous investigation concerning the PRC.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to comment on the choice of analogue country envisaged. \n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that Mexico did not represent the best choice of analogue country, but that Taiwan was a better option\ndue to the fact that Taiwan is a major producer of bicycles, had greater\ncommonality with the PRC than Mexico and is likely to result in a more reliable\nnormal value. \n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission tried to\nobtain cooperation from 15 countries, namely Bangladesh, Canada, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and USA. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission received\nreplies to the questionnaire only from three Mexican producers of bicycles\nwhich also accepted a verification of their response at their premises. No\nother companies from any contacted countries cooperated. These three producers\nhad domestic sales representing more than 30% of the Mexican market, which was\nestimated at about 1.7 million units in 2011. More than 14 producers and\nseveral importers were found to operate in a competitive environment. The\nimports of bicycles in 2011 were originating principally in the PRC (more than 60%)\nand Taiwan (20%). These imports represented some 5% of the domestic market\n(source: annual report of ANAFABI, the Mexican association of bicycle\nmanufacturers).\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 The Mexican market profile\nfor the product concerned, number of operators, domestic competition and the\nfeatures of production process confirmed that Mexico was still an appropriate\nanalogue country. In view of the above, the Mexican market could be considered\nto be representative and competitive. It was therefore concluded that Mexico was an appropriate analogue country.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of normal\nvalue in the analogue country\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 2(7)(a)\nof the basic Regulation, normal value was established on the basis of verified\ninformation received from the producers in the analogue country as set out\nbelow.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the product concerned was sold in representative quantities on the Mexican\ndomestic market.\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it was analysed\nwhether it could be considered as being sold in the ordinary course of trade\npursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing\nfor each product type the proportion of profitable sales to independent\ncustomers on the domestic market during the RIP. \n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 Where sales volume of a\nproduct type, sold at net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of\nproduction, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type,\nand where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the\ncost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price. This\nprice was calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales\nof that type made during the RIP, irrespective of whether the sales were\nprofitable or not.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 Where the volume of\nprofitable sales of a product type represent 80 % or less of the total sales\nvolume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below\nthe cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price,\ncalculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the investigation\ndid not reveal any product type where no profitable sales were made.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 In all cases where the\nproduct concerned was exported to independent customers in the Union, the\nexport price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic\nRegulation, namely, on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 In cases where sales were\nmade via a related importer or trader, the export prices were constructed in\naccordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the resale\nprices of that related importer to first independent customers in the Union.\nAdjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale\nincluding sales, general and administrative expenses and profit. With respect\nto profit margin, the profit realised by an unrelated importer/trader of the\nproduct concerned was used since the actual profit of the related\nimporter/trader was not considered reliable because of the relationship between\nthe exporting producers and the related importer/trader.\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nstated in recitals (63) and (64) above, Giant China refused to provide the\nCommission's services with the necessary information on the structure of the\ngroup and essential information concerning production, export sales volume and\nprices of the product concerned to the Union in the RIP of the companies part\nof Jinshan Development and Construction Ltd group ('Jinshan Group') involved in\nthe production and sale of the product concerned in the PRC and consequently,\nArticle 18(1) of the basic Regulation was applied concerning the export price.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 Giant China challenged the\napplication of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation both in respect of refusal\nof MET and application of facts available to the export price calculations. It\nargued that the information requested by the Commission was not necessary for\nthe calculation of the dumping margin. In this regard, Giant China argued that\nthe information requested from Jinshan Group located in the PRC was not pertinent\nfor the MET assessment or export price calculations as it was only very\nindirectly related to Giant China and its related companies ('Giant Group'). \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the investigation\nhas confirmed that one of Giant Group's subsidiaries, actively producing and\nexporting the product concerned to the Union during part of the RIP, namely\nShanghai Giant & Phoenix Bicycles Co Ltd ('GP'), was related, via common\nshareholding, structural and management links to Jinshan Group and that this\ngroup was involved in the production and sales of the product concerned. In the\nabsence of a reply to the MET claim form and the anti-dumping questionnaire\nfrom the companies part of Jinshan Group that were involved in the production\nand sales of the product concerned in the PRC, it could not be assessed to what\nextent the production and sales of the product concerned of Jinshan Group had\nan impact on the export price determination with regard to GP and as a\nconsequence for the Giant as a whole group. It could further not be\ninvestigated whether the conditions of Article 2(7)(c ) of the basic Regulation\nwere met. In the absence of cooperation in this respect, Giant China\u2019s claims\nhad to be rejected. \n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Giant China argued\nthat there is no need to take into account price information relating to other\nexporting producers when calculating the individual margin of an exporting\nproducer unless Giant Group and Jinshan Group form a single entity in view of\nthe existing close financial, commercial and management links.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence on the file\nsupports the finding that GP and Jinshan Group are related and have close shareholding,\nstructural and management links. In the absence of complete information on all\nparties related to GP, in particular on the Chinese bicycle exporting producers\nthat are subsidiaries of Jinshan Group, it is impossible to perform complete\nand reliable calculations on the export price and therefore to obtain an\nindividual margin determination for GP and as a consequence for the Giant Group\nas a whole. \n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also claimed that the\ninformation requested placed an unreasonable burden on Giant China and that it\nacted to the best of its ability in the investigation. In this regard it should\nbe noted that no evidence was submitted, until comments to definitive\ndisclosure, showing that Giant China made any efforts to collect the\ninformation required in the MET claim form and the anti-dumping questionnaire\nfor the companies part of Jinshan Group, involved in the production and sale of\nthe product concerned. During the investigation Giant China claimed that it was\nunnecessary to provide the information requested but did not claim that\nobtaining such information was unreasonable burdensome. Giant China submitted evidence of alleged efforts only after final disclosure, at a stage where\nsuch information was unverifiable. It could therefore not be taken into account\nanymore.\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 Giant China claimed that\nthere was in any event no risk of circumvention of any potential anti-dumping\nmeasures by, for example, shifting production between the two groups as GP, the\nonly link between the two groups, has ceased all operations in September 2011.\nIn this regards, it should be noted that at the end of RIP, GP still existed as\nan entity as also confirmed by Giant China. Therefore, the production activity\ncould have resumed at any moment in the future and the fact the GP allegedly\nceased all operations in September 2011 is not relevant. In addition, Giant\nChina argued that the risk of circumvention could have been addressed in a\ndifferent manner i.e. the monitoring clause mentioned in recitals (276) and (277)\nbelow. In this regard, it should be noted that the monitoring clause only\napplies to unrelated companies, so the risks involved are not of similar nature\nand the same remedies could not have been applied.\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, Giant China argued\nthat an on-spot verification at GP's premises in the PRC should have taken\nplace in order to check the production and sales activities of GP after\nSeptember 2011. In this regard, it should be noted that it was not considered\nrelevant whether GP ceased its activities after September 2011. Indeed, even if\nthis would have been the case, GP could have resumed its bicycles production\nand sales activities anytime and an on-spot verification would not have\ndecreased such risk.\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Giant China submitted\nsome evidence showing that Giant Group's shares in GP have been sold on 30\nMarch 2013. However, it is to be noted that this transaction occurred after the\nRIP and in conjunction with the advanced stage of the investigation, this\ninformation cannot be verified nor is pertinent in the framework of this\ninvestigation. In this regard, should Giant request a review of their situation\nfollowing the sale of the shares, this can be considered in due time in line\nwith the provisions of the basic Regulation.\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 In the same submissions Giant\nChina provided other clarifications to the Commission assessment warranting application\nof Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation. However, they were not as such as to\nchange the Commission's initial assessment. \n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the findings concerning\napplication of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation in relation to Giant Group\nare confirmed. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 The normal value and export\nprice were compared on an ex-works basis. For the purpose of ensuring a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the\nform of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAdjustments were made, where appropriate, in respect of indirect taxes,\ndiscounts, level of trade, transport, insurance, handling and ancillary costs,\npacking, credit, bank charges and commissions in all cases where they were\nfound to be reasonable, accurate and supported by evidence.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the cooperating\nexporting producers\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe three cooperating companies, dumping margins were established by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value established for the co-operating Mexican\nproducers with each company's weighted average export price to the Union, as\nprovided for in Article 2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation.\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 The dumping margins expressed\nas a percentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty unpaid, are:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Baoguilai Vehicle Co.

All sampled Union\nproducers were benefiting from the exemption scheme described in recital (1)\nabove. \nE. SITUATION ON THE UNION MARKET\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption \n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry\u2019s sales were assessed on the\nbasis of data collected from producers in the reply to the sampling forms and data collected from various associations\nof bicycle producers in the Union.\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union consumption was established on the basis of the sales of all\nUnion industry on the Union market, as estimated in recital (151), plus imports\nfrom all countries as reported by Eurostat.\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 Total Union consumption\ndeclined from 22,459,062 units in 2008 to 20,116,602 units in the RIP, i.e. by\n10% over the period considered. This is mainly a result of a drop of 8% between\n2008 and 2009, while consumption remained stable afterwards and only slightly\ndecreased in the RIP (by 2%). In 2009, the market was in particular influenced\nby the impact of the economic crisis and it has not recovered since. Further drop in 2011 was mainly\ncaused by the continued cautious consumer spending at the current economic climate.\n\n Table 1 \n Consumption \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 \n Volume (units) ||   ||   ||   ||   \n + Total imports || 10,017,616 || 8,974,906 || 9,734,143 || 8,840,362 \n + Union production sold on the Union market || 12,441,446 || 11,604,072 || 10,946,875 || 11,276,240 \n = Consumption || 22,459,062 || 20,578,978 || 20,681,018 || 20,116,602 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 92 || 92 || 90 \n Source: Eurostat, questionnaire replies \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the PRC \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volumes of dumped imports and market share of bicycles\noriginating in the PRC\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 The volume of imports of the product concerned\noriginating in the PRC was established on the basis of statistical information\nprovided by Eurostat. The volume of imports from the PRC\ndeclined sharply between 2008 and 2009 from 941,522 units to 597,339 units\nrespectively, i.e. by 37%. In 2010 imports were increasing, but in the RIP\ndecreasing again where they reached 581,459 units. The significant decrease in\nChinese imports coincided with the economic crisis and did not recover since.\nOverall, Chinese imports decreased by 38% during the period considered. \n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 The Chinese market share decreased accordingly from 4.2% in 2008 to 2.9%\nin the RIP. The decline in market\nshare was partly\noffset by the reduction of the Union consumption.\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nit is to be emphasised that the relatively low and decreasing market share of\nChinese imports must be seen in the context of the findings in the parallel\non-going anti-circumvention investigation mentioned in recital (14) and (15)\nabove (see recitals (223) and (224) below). \n Table 2 \n Imports from the PRC \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume of imports from the country concerned (units) || 941,522 || 597,339 || 627,120 || 581,459 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 63 || 67 || 62 \n Market share of imports from the country concerned || 4.2% || 2.9% || 3.0% || 2.9%   \n Source: Eurostat \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of the imports\nconcerned\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution of prices\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nit was established in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005[32], Eurostat data could only be used to a limited extent for\nestablishing the price trends of dumped imports for the period between 2008 and\nthe RIP for the following reasons: \n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 The import prices based on\nEurostat data do not take into account the various product types and the\nsubstantial price differences among the various types of the product concerned.\nThe average prices per country are strongly influenced by the product mix of\neach country. Moreover, when comparing model by model of imports from the\ncooperating exporters that even within the same product types and models there\nexist substantial price differences depending on the components of the\nbicycles. Therefore, the prices found in Eurostat continue to be inconclusive\nfor the purpose of this investigation. The import prices of Eurostat for the\nPRC, hereafter indicated by index, can only serve as an indicator of price\ntrends, but are not useful when comparing sales prices between various\ncountries and the Union.\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 According to Eurostat data,\nthe weighted average import prices, hereafter indicated by index, from the PRC\nincreased significantly during the period considered as showed in Table 3.\nHowever, without knowing the type of the bicycles that were imported from the\nPRC and whether there was any shift in the product mix from one year to the\nother, no conclusion can be drawn.\n Table 3 \n Imports price from the PRC \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Import Price from the PRC ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 173 || 217 || 214 \n Source: Eurostat \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting of the cooperating exporting producers for which\ndumping was found was calculated on the basis of their actual verified export\nprice (CIF Union frontier) both with and without the anti-dumping duty. The\nrelevant sales prices of the Union industry were those to independent customers\nin the Union adjusted, when necessary, to ex-works\nlevel. During the RIP, based on different product types defined in the\nquestionnaire, undercutting was only found for one of the exporting producers\nwhich amounted to 61% without the anti-dumping duty and 44% with the\nanti-dumping duty. \n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 Given\nthat the cooperation from the Chinese exporting producers was very low and the\nfindings for the cooperating companies could not be considered to be\nrepresentative for the country as well as the fact that the average price in\nEurostat could not be considered as conclusive, it was considered that undercutting\nlevels as established during the last expiry review concluded by Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1095/2005 mentioned in recital (3) should be taken as a\nreference when establishing the country-wide undercutting for the PRC, as no\nother more reliable information was available, i.e. 53% after deduction of the\nanti-dumping duty and of 39% with the duty . \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry \n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recitals (8), (9)\nand (10) above, the present investigation analysed whether there was a change\nin the situation of the Union industry justifying a need to reassess the injury\nfindings of the amending interim review. The investigation has confirmed that:\n(i) Following the global trend, the production of bicycles in the Union\nconsists mainly of labour intensive assembly of bicycle parts that are designed\naccording to the customers\u2019 specifications and sourced from various origins.\n(ii) In order to cut the cost of production the investigation has shown a\ncontinued effort of the Union industry to automatize and to streamline the\nassembly process. In addition, some Union producers benefitted from the\ncomparatively lower labour costs in Central and Eastern\n Europe as compared to the investigation period of the amending\ninterim review. The production statistics available to the Commission confirm\nthis trend. (iii) The investigation confirmed the preference for aluminium alloy\nas a raw material, while the steel remained the main raw material for lower end\nmodels and children's' bicycles. In light of these changes the economic\nsituation of the Union industry was examined as described below.\n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined\nall relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the\nUnion industry. \n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of the injury analysis, the injury indicators have been\nestablished as follows:\n\u00b7              \nmacroeconomic indicators (production, production\ncapacity, capacity utilisation, sales volume, market share, employment,\nproductivity, growth, magnitude of dumping margins and recovery from the\neffects of past dumping) were assessed at the level of the whole Union\nproduction for all Union producers, on the basis of the information collected\nfrom the national associations of Union producers and individual Union\nproducers. These factors were cross-checked, where possible, with the overall\ninformation provided by the relevant official statistics. \n\u00b7              \nmicroeconomic indicators (stocks, unit sales\nprice, cost of production, cash flow, profitability, return on investments,\nability to raise capital, investments and wages) were assessed for the sampled\nUnion producers on the basis of the information they submitted. \nMacro-economic indicators\n(a)         \nProduction,\nproduction capacity and capacity utilisation \n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 During the period considered, the Union industry\u2019s production decreased continuously and at a\nfaster pace than the Union consumption as shown above in table 1 under recital (153).\nThus, production decreased from 13,541,244 units in 2008 to 11,026,646 units in\nthe RIP, which reflected a 19% decline. \n Table 4 \n Total Union production \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume (units) ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Production || \u00a013,541,244 || \u00a012,778,305 || \u00a011,682,329 || \u00a011,026,646 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 94 || 86 || 81 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, relevant official statistics \n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 Production\ncapacity was reduced by 5% between 2008 and the RIP, which partly offset the\nimpact of the 19% decline of production on the capacity utilisation rate. The\nlater dropped by 14% points over the same period, reaching 74% in the RIP. \n Table 5 \n Production capacity and capacity utilisation \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume (units) ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Production capacity || \u00a015,804,000 || \u00a015,660,000 || \u00a015,150,000 || \u00a015,000,000 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 99 || 96 || 95 \n Capacity utilisation || 86% || 82% || 77% || 74% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 95 || 90 || 86 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, relevant official statistics \n(b)         \nSales volume \n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the sales volume of the\nUnion industry on the Union market declined in a similar way as the Union\nconsumption, showing a decrease of 9% over the period considered, from\n12,441,446 units in 2008 to 11,276,240 units in the RIP. Between 2009 and 2010 however, sales continue to decrease while\nconsumption had remained stable, which is reflected in the loss of market share\nof the Union industry in 2010 as shown below in table 7 under recital (168)\nbelow. In RIP the volumes of sales increased again but have not reached their\n2008 level.\n Table 6 \n Sales of the Union industry in the Union \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume (units) || \u00a012,441,446 || \u00a011,604,072 || \u00a010,946,875 || \u00a011,276,240 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 93 || 88 || 91 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, relevant official statistics \n(c)         \nMarket share\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 The market share held by the\nUnion industry increased from 55.4% in 2008 to 56.1% in the RIP, i.e. an\nincrease of 0.7 percentage points during the RIP. This slight improvement of\n0.7 percentage points over the period considered included a significant drop\nfrom 56.4% in 2009 to 52.9% in 2010. The overall\nincrease of market share of the Union industry, against the background of falling\nvolumes of sales (see recital (167) above), can be explained by the overall\ndrop in consumption (see recital (153) above). \n Table 7 \n Union industry market share \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Union market share || 55.4% || 56.4% || 52.9% || 56.1% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 102 || 96 || 101 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, relevant official statistics \n(d)         \nEmployment and productivity \n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 Direct\nemployment decreased by 17%, from 14 197 employees in 2008 to 11 783 during the\nRIP. This decline followed the reduction of the\nproduction volume. \n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the productivity decreased\nby 2% over the period considered. The decline of production between 2008 and\n2009 combined with constant employment over the same period caused a drop in\nproductivity between 2008 and 2009. This was followed by an increase of\nproductivity between 2009 and 2010, which can be explained by the restructuring\nof the industry and investments into more efficient production processes over\nthe same period. Further decline in production volume in RIP coupled with less\nsharp decline in employment resulted in another decrease of productivity in\nRIP.\n Table 8 \n Total Union employment and productivity \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Number of employees || \u00a014,197 || \u00a014,147 || \u00a012,067 || \u00a011,783 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 100 || 85 || 83 \n Productivity (units/year) || 954 || 903 || 968 || 936 \n Index (2008=100) || \u00a0100 || 95 || 102 || 98 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, relevant official statistics \n(e)         \nGrowth \n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 Over the period considered\nthe consumption decreased by 10%. The market share of the Union industry\nremained relatively constant (increasing only slightly, i.e. by +0.7percentage\npoints over the period considered as outlined in recital (168) above). The\ndeclining Union market indicates that the Union producers have not opportunity\nto benefit from any growth. \n(f)           \nMagnitude of dumping margin\n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping from the PRC\ncontinued during the RIP as explained in recitals (143) to (145) above. Given\nthe large spare capacity in the PRC (see recital (203) below) and the\nestablished circumvention (see recital (223) and (224) below), the impact on\nthe Union industry of the actual margins of dumping cannot be considered to be\nnegligible. \n(g)         \nRecovery from past dumping\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nwas analysed whether the Union industry recovered from the effects of past\ndumping. It was concluded that the expected recovery of the Union industry from\nthe effects of past dumping has not happened as shown, in particular, by the\npersistently low profitability and a decrease in the capacity utilisation. The\nrecovery of the Union industry has also been hampered by established\ncircumvention practices (see recital (223) and (224) below). \nMicro-economic indicators\n(h)         \nStocks \n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 The stocks of bicycles for\nthe Union producers stood at 517,977 units by the end of the RIP, broadly\nstable in relation to their level in 2008 despite a 25% decline between 2008\nand 2009.\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the Union producers\nhad very limited levels of stocks because they were selling their entire\nproduction to related companies within their respective group. In addition, the\nUnion producers were found to produce mostly on customer orders. The\ndevelopment of stocks over the period considered was distorted by all these\nfactors and, therefore, this indicator cannot be regarded as meaningful. \n Table 9 \n Stocks \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume (units) ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Closing stocks || \u00a0519,832 || \u00a0390,398 || \u00a0522,779 || \u00a0517,977 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 75 || 101 || 100 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(i)           \nSales prices and costs\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 The average ex-works sales\nprice in the Union remained stable over the period considered despite an\nincrease of 3% between 2008 and 2009. Sale price in the RIP dropped again to\nthe level of 2008. \n Table 10 \n Unit sales price in the Union \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Unit sales price in the EU (EUR) || 144 || 149 || 146 || 144 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 103 || 102 || 100 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 The cost of production was\ncalculated on the basis of the weighted average of all types of the like\nproduct produced by the Union producers. The cost of production increased slightly\nby 2% over the period considered as showed in Table 11 below. \n Table 11 \n Unit cost of production \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Unit cost of production (EUR per unit) || 141 || 147 || 146 || 145 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 104 || 103 || 102 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(j)          \nProfitability\n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nprofitability levels were established on the basis of the sales to unrelated\ncustomers. The Union industry was close to break-even between 2010 and RIP.\nOverall, profitability deteriorated during the period considered, showing a\ndecrease from 1.9% in 2008 to -0.1% in RIP. \n Table 12 \n Profitability \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Profitability Union sales || 1.9% || 1.6% || 0.3% || -0.1% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 100 || 98 || 98 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(k)         \nInvestments and return on investment\n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 Investments significantly\nincreased by 16% over the period considered from EUR 7,952,150 in 2008 to EUR\n9,263,184 during the RIP. This reflects the continued efforts of the Union\nindustry to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process and to remain\ncompetitive. \n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 Return on investment\nfollowed a similar trend as profitability. In 2008 the return on investment was\npositive (14%) but decreased to a - 1 % during the RIP.\n Table 13 \n Investments and Return on Investment \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Investments (EUR '000) || \u00a07,952,150 || \u00a09,421,745 || \u00a019,288,284 || \u00a09,263,184 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 118 || 243 || 116 \n Return on investment || 14% || 11% || 2% || -1% \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(l)           \nCash flow and ability to raise capital\n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 The cash flow followed a\nsimilar development as profitability but remained positive throughout the\nperiod considered. It is expressed in the table 14 below as a percentage of\nturnover. \n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 Only Union producers that\nwere part of larger groups did not report any particular problems to raise\ncapital. Union producers that were not part of larger groups reported increased\npressure on their cash situation linked to the low profitability and the\ndeterioration of the business terms with both suppliers and customers. The\nability to raise capital was further compromised by the reluctance of banks to\nfinance the bicycle market in the current economic climate. \n Table 14 \n Cash flow \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Cash flow || 3.2% || 3.1% || 1.8% || 1.3% \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 97 || 99 || 98 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(m)       \nWages\n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe period considered, the wage cost per employee remained\nbroadly stable, an increase only showing in 2009. This is mainly due the impact\nof the reduction of staff on companies\u2019 salary scales while retaining trained\nemployees in order to maintain efficiency and quality. \n Table 15 \n Wages \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Wage cost per employee (in EUR) || 15,747 || 17,393 || 17,383 || 16,581 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 110 || 110 || 105 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury \n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite\nthe measures in place, the majority of the\ninjury indicators relating to the performance of the Union industry\ndeteriorated during the period considered. In particular, the macroeconomic\nindicators such as production volumes (-19%), production capacity (-5%),\ncapacity utilization rate (-14%) and employment (-17%) decreased considerably.\nMoreover, the profit related microeconomic indicators declined over the period\nconsidered, with a profitability of -0.1% in the RIP.\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 The above shows that the Union industry remains in a fragile\nsituation, with declining profits and close to breaking even situation in 2010 and\nRIP. In addition, any possibility for further growth and profits has\nbeen undermined by the pressure of dumped imports from the PRC and by\ncircumventing imports (see recitals (223) and (224) below). \n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding, the Union\nindustry managed to maintain and even slightly increase its market share in a\nshrinking market. The increased investments over the period considered (+16%) show the\nefforts of the Union industry to remain competitive. This together with the\nlatest innovations of the Union industry described in recital (248) below shows\nits underlying vitality and economic viability.\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis, it is concluded that the Union Industry continued to suffer\nmaterial injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation and\nremained in a vulnerable state.\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 After disclosure, parties\nargued, by referring to the Preserved Mandarins[33] case,\nthat the Commission was obliged to take any steps to remedy the lack of certain\ninformation caused by the low cooperation of the Chinese exporting producers and\nin failing to do so the Commission has breached its procedural obligations\nunder the basic Regulation. Furthermore, the parties suggested to use the\nChinese export statistics, which break down the major types of bicycles\nexported to the EU market unlike Eurostat, or to request the national customs\nauthorities of the largest importing Member States pursuant to Article 6(3) or\n(4) of the basic Regulation to carry an analysis of the different types\nimported from the PRC.\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recitals (19)\nand (21) above the Commission officially notified the known exporting producers\nin the PRC, an association of Chinese producers, and the representatives of the\ncountry concerned of the initiation of the investigation. The Commission\ncontacted about 70 Chinese companies already known to the Commission services\nfrom the previous investigation and at a later stage, when the anti-subsidy\ninvestigation mentioned in recital (16) above was initiated, the Commission\nidentified around 300 additional Chinese exporting producers that were\ncontacted in the context of this interim review as well. Moreover, the\nrepresentatives of the country concerned were notified at the initiation of the\ninvestigation that in case sufficient cooperation on the part of exporting\nproducers is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings on the facts\navailable, in accordance with Article 18 of basic Regulation. It was stressed\nthat a finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party\nconcerned.\n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 In the Preserved Mandarins\ncase the element analysed by the Court was the degree of the efforts the\nCommission should have made in obtaining pertinent information concerning the\ncalculation of normal value based on the price or constructed value from domestic\nproducers in a market economy third country by seeking cooperation from\nidentified potential analogue markets. \n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 In the present\ninvestigation, the lack of information is due to the extensive non-cooperation\nof the parties that are actually subject to the investigation. As mentioned in\nrecital 186 above the parties were repeatedly invited to cooperate but failed\nto do so. Thus unlike in the Preserved Mandarins case the Commission actively\nand repeatedly sought the cooperation from the parties concerned. The parallel\nbetween Preserved Mandarins case and the current investigation is therefore not\nsubstantiated.\n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission assessed the\nusefulness of other sources, including the Chinese export statistics. It was\nconcluded that the alternative sources were not appropriate for this\ninvestigation due to the fact that the level of details\nwas not sufficient to allow for calculation of new margins. In addition, the\nChinese statistics were also found inconsistent with the Eurostat statistics\nshowing, for example, significantly higher level of imports than those reported\nin Eurostat. The proposed alternative sources therefore could not be used. Some parties\nalso suggested for the Commission to seek a cooperation from the national\ncustoms authorities of the largest importing Member States to carry out an\nanalysis of the different product categories imported from the PRC. In response\nto this claim it is considered that apart from the practical\nimpossibility, even if such data was collected, it could have not supplemented\nthe information gap caused by the non-cooperation. This is because, in\nparticular, the level of analysis required could not have\nbeen simply based on invoices, lacking relevant product type description at the\nlevel of detail necessary for meaningful product type comparability. \n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 Several\nparties also argued that the Commission had not carried out a product mix\nanalysis of the imports from the PRC, in order to achieve a fair comparison of\nthe imports with bicycles produced in the Union for purposes of making an\nobjective and fair comparison in its injury and the price undercutting\ndetermination. In addition the parties argued that the Commission referred to\nthe price undercutting figure determined in the previous investigation mentioned\nin recital (5) above which was calculated with reference to average prices from\nEurostat, without knowing the actual composition of the imports. Furthermore it\nwas argued that the Commission did not make any effort to determine whether the\nimported products were actually comparable to the Union-produced bicycles and,\ntherefore, the Commission\u2019s price undercutting analysis with respect to\nnon-cooperating producers is defective. For these reasons, the partied argued\nthat it must also be concluded that the Commission has failed to make an\nobjective assessment and adequate explanation of its determination that the\nUnion industry continues to suffer material injury.\n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis regard, it should be noted that as mentioned in recital (160) above the price undercutting of the cooperating exporting\nproducers for which dumping was found was calculated on the basis of their\nactual verified export price (CIF Union frontier) both with and without the\nanti-dumping duty taking into account the product mix of their exports during\nthe RIP. However, as cooperation of the Chinese exporting producers was very\nlow and, consequently, the findings of the cooperating Chinese exporting\nproducers could not be considered representatives for the PRC as a whole as\nmentioned recital (145) above, the undercutting levels as established in the\namending interim review mentioned in recital (3) above could not be modified. \n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nface of extensive non-cooperation the Commission had to rely on facts available\nfor the determination of the country-wide dumping, undercutting and injury\nelimination levels. In this context the Commission considered alternative\nsources of information that for the reasons stated in recitals (192) to (194)\nabove could not be used. Therefore, in the absence of contradicting findings,\nthe country-wide dumping, undercutting and injury elimination levels\nestablished in the\namending interim review mentioned in recital (3) above were\ntaken as a reference for\nthe purpose of this investigation. \n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis confirmed that contrary to the claim of the parties the reference levels\nused were those established during the expiry review\nconcluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005 mentioned in recital (3)\nabove and not those established in the expiry review concluded by Implementing\nRegulation (EU) No 990/2011 mentioned in recital (5) above. \n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it was argued that the Commission failed to analyse the\nclaimed national customs errors preventing a fair comparison of Chinese import\nprices. It is recalled that no meaningful price comparison could have been\ncarried out in the present investigation due to the extensive non-cooperation,\ntherefore, under these circumstances the claim was considered irrelevant.\nF. LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUATION OF DUMPING AND INJURY \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping\n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 It was analysed in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation,\nwhether the circumstances with regard to dumping and injury have changed\nsignificantly, and if this change could reasonably be said to be of a lasting\nnature.\n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 The three co-operating Chinese exporting producers were subject to the\nresidual duty rate in the previous investigation while in the current\ninvestigation individual duty rates were calculated for them. As mentioned above\nin recitals (113) and (115), all three exporting producers in the PRC\nmeet all the requirements for individual treatment. There was no information in the file which would have shown that the\nsituation of the cooperating exporting producers concerned could change in the\nforeseeable future. \n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the investigation has shown that the Chinese export\nquota system applicable during the amending interim review, was abolished by\nthe Government of the PRC and is not likely to be re-installed, in particular\nalso given the export oriented government policies for the bicycle sector\naddressed below in recital (203). Furthermore, the investigation did not reveal\nany evidence that the export price behaviour of these three companies will\nsignificantly change in the foreseeable future. \n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, it is considered that the changed circumstances which\nlead to the dumping margins calculated for the three co-operating Chinese\nexporting producers are of a lasting nature.\n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the country-wide duty for the PRC, the investigation did not\nreveal any changed circumstances and it is proposed to maintain the same duty\nlevel as established during the amending interim review. \n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also examined whether the continued\nimposition of the measure is no longer necessary to offset dumping. According\nto the Chinese Bicycles Association, total bicycle output in the PRC amounted\nto 83.45 million units in 2011, showing an increase of 2.3% as compared to\n2010. Moreover, the Chinese bicycle industry continues to be export oriented.\nThus in 2011, the PRC exported 55.72 million bicycles or 67% of the total\nproduction, a decrease of 4.2% from 2010. Domestic sales were approximately\n23.73 million units in 2011. The most important production region in the PRC is\nTianjin which produced about half of the\ntotal output in 2011. According to Tianjin Municipal\nLight Industry and Textile Industry Development Plan for the 12th Five-Year\nPlan, new\nindustrial parks specialised in the production of bicycles are being developed\nin this area. It follows that by 2015 the production capacity of bicycle in Tianjin area is estimated to reach 55 million bicycles, an increase of 44% as compared to\n2011 while about half of the output will be for export (more than the total\nconsumption of bicycles in the Union in the RIP). \n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the three cooperating companies reported a capacity\nutilization rate between 72% and 81% during the RIP. Extrapolating, we can\nestimate a spare capacity of the Chinese industry of more than 25 million bicycles,\nwhich is more than double the Union industry\u2019s total production during the RIP\nand 24% higher than the total Union consumption. In addition, as the production\nof bicycles is labour intensive, it seems that due to the significant cheap\nlabour force available in the PRC, Chinese producers are able build up new\ncapacity rather quickly.\n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, in volume terms, the Union market is the second largest\nworld-wide, after the Chinese market which makes the Union very attractive in\nterms of potential demand.\n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 The findings in the\nanti-circumvention investigation (see recital (14) above) confirms that the\nUnion market continues to be an attractive market for Chinese exporting\nproducers and that in the absence of any measures they would very likely re-direct\nsignificant volumes to the Union.\n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, other potential important export markets for the PRC have\nanti-dumping measures in place (Canada[34]) which is reducing the potential third\ncountries markets available for the Chinese exports without duties.\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that US used to have a domestic production of bicycles in\nthe past and had anti-dumping duties in place against the PRC. However, after\nthe anti-dumping duties were repealed at the end of the '90s, Chinese imports\nentered the US market massively. Domestic production almost disappeared in the\nfollowing years. In 2011 it was estimated that 99% of the bicycles sold in the US were imported; 93% from the PRC and 6% from Taiwan. Domestic production of bicycles in the US is estimated at approximately 56,000 units per year with an annual consumption of about\n16 million bicycles. The total US bicycles market (including sales of related\nparts and accessories) was valued at USD 6 billion in 2011.\n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 In conclusion, the Chinese bicycles industry is an export oriented\nindustry with a precedence of unfair pricing behaviour in several markets\nworld-wide. Moreover, the findings in the anti-circumvention investigation\nconfirmed the continued interest of the Chinese exporters in the Union market.\nMoreover, this behaviour suggests that if the measures were repealed, the Union\nmarket would be very likely targeted by low priced Chinese imports with a view\nof taking over the domestic market. Therefore it can be concluded that the\ncontinued imposition of the measures is still necessary to offset the dumping. \n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure it was argued that the analysis overlooked the\nfact that the production growth in the PRC is being restricted by labour\navailability and that the PRC is losing its labour cost advantage to other\nsouth-Asian countries operating under preferential trade agreements. In face of\nnon-cooperation the claim was unverifiable and was therefore disregarded.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury \n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the grounds for opening the ex officio interim review, the\ninvestigation examined the following\nchanges in the structure of the EU bicycle industry: (i) switch from the\ncomplete cycle of production to (partial) assembly operations using imported parts; (ii) change in the cost\nlevel due to the enlargement and relocation and setting up of new production\nfacilities in Central and Eastern Europe; (iii) increasing change in the use of\nraw material from steel to alloy following consumer trends. As a result of the\nfindings spelt out in recital (162) above, all the above-mentioned developments\nare on-going and of global nature and are therefore not likely to change in the\nforeseeable future.\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the assessment of the likelihood of continuation of the\ninjury, given the already fragile situation of the Union industry, described in\nrecitals (184) to (187), it is also likely that the Union producers will not be\nable to resist the further price pressure that would be exerted by the Chinese\ndumped imports and, as a consequence, will be forced to exit the Union market\nwith the consequence of a loss of employment and investments, technology and\nknow-how (see recitals (247) and (248) below). Therefore it can be\nconcluded that there is a likelihood of continuation of injury should the\nmeasures be repealed in this case. \nComments of the parties\n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\nUnion industry is not suffering material injury as publicly available\ninformation suggests that its financial situation is good. It is to be noted\nthat the financial situation of the Union industry is assessed based on the\ninformation gathered and verified during the investigation from a\nrepresentative sample of Union producers. This assessment cannot be substituted\nby publicly available information related to some Union producers even if their\nproduction and sales value is allegedly large. Therefore, the findings of the\ninvestigation analysed in recitals (162) to (187) above contradict the\ninformation submitted by these parties. Therefore, their arguments were\nconsidered unfounded. \n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also argued that the\ncontinuation of the anti-dumping measures against the PRC would be\ndiscriminatory as imports from other third countries are allegedly dumped and\ncausing injury in particular from Sri Lanka while no anti-dumping measures are\nin force on imports from these countries. As a result of the anti-circumvention\ninvestigation, the anti-dumping measures have been extended to imports of\nbicycles inter alia from Sri Lanka. In addition, no evidence was submitted\nshowing that the genuine producers in the country concerned would be dumping.\nTherefore, the argument from the party was considered unfounded and it was\nrejected. \nG. CAUSATION \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n3(6) and (7) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry had been caused by the dumped imports\nconcerned. Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same\ntime have injured the Union industry, were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these\nfactors was not attributed to the dumped imports. In particular the results of\nthe anti-circumvention investigation were analysed. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of the dumped\nChinese imports\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 The Chinese imports declined over the period considered,\nrepresenting 2.9% of market share in the RIP. This relatively low and\ndecreasing market share is to be seen in the context of the circumventing\nimports from, Indonesia,\nMalaysia Sri Lanka and Tunisia (see recital (223) and (224) below)\n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (160)\nabove, it was concluded that imports from the PRC continued to significantly\nundercut the Union industry's sales price on the Union market, thus exerting a\nsignificant pressure on the price level on the Union market. \n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, most of\nthe injury indicators showed a decreasing trend, in particular the production\n(-19%) and sales volume (-9%), capacity (-5%) and capacity utilisation (-14%).\n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 The profitability of the\nUnion industry declined throughout the period considered with the Union industry\nclose to breaking even due to the Chinese price pressure. Because of this the\nUnion industry was not able to raise the prices to profitable levels without\nlosing significant market share.\n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis therefore concluded that the pressure exerted by the imports of bicycles at\ndumped prices had a decisive impact on the current vulnerable economic\nsituation of the Union industry.\n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure it\nwas argued that the relevance of declining production levels and capacity\nutilisation was not adequately reasoned, in particular, in the light of the\nfact that the decline in production was considered to have no impact on\nprofitability. It is noted that all the injury elements are relevant for the\nassessment of the economic situation of the Union industry whether or not they\nhave an impact on the profitability levels in the particular case. As explained\nin recital (237) below the decline in profitability and of other profit related\nindicators was not caused by the shrinking market but can be attributed to the\ncontinued pressure of dumped Chinese imports. The argument is therefore\nrejected. \n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party also argued\nthat the market share evolution of the Chinese imports was not adequately\nanalysed as the analysis failed to address the sharp decline of imports over\nthe period considered. Also it was argued that the causality analysis failed to\ntake into account the increasing price trends of these exports. In response to\nthis argument it is recalled that the declining volume of Chinese imports must\nbe seen in the context of the findings of the parallel anti-circumvention\ninvestigation (see recital (216) above). The price trend of the Chinese imports\nestablished on the basis of Eurostat is not meaningful as it does not take into\naccount the price development of the imports of the Chinese bicycles via the\ncircumventing countries. On these grounds, the argument was therefore rejected.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of circumventing\nimports\n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (15)\nabove, the anti-circumvention investigation established circumvention of\nthe measures in force against the PRC by assembly operation and transhipment\nvia Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. Based on these findings the\ndifference between the volumes of imports from the countries in question\nreported in Eurostat and the volumes exported by known genuine producers i.e.\nthose that qualified for exemption from the extended measures for the\nreasons set out in Regulation (EU) No XX/2013\nwere considered as imports circumventing the measures in force ('circumventing\nimports').\n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\ncausality analysis, these imports were considered as effectively coming from\nChina and should therefore be considered together with the direct imports from\nChina. On this basis the volume of Chinese imports thus established reached\n1,904,761 units in the RIP. In 2008, imports reached 2,321,240 units. They were\ndeclining in 2009 to 1,802,101 units, i.e. by 22% and increasing in 2010 to\nalmost the same levels than in 2008, reaching 10.6% of the market share.\nFinally, imports decreased again in the RIP by 13%, reaching a market share of\n9.5%. Over the period considered, import volumes decreased by 18%. In the context of the shrinking market (see recital (153) above)\nthe described decrease of import volumes did not result in a significant loss\nin market share as the latter has declined by only 0.8% over the period\nconsidered. Since the product mix of the imports from\nthe PRC and the circumventing imports is unknown, it is not meaningful to\ncompare prices of these imports with those of the Union industry on the Union\nmarket. \n Table 16 \n Imports from the PRC together with circumventing imports from, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume of imports (units) || 2,321,240 || 1,802,101 || 2,194,354 || 1,904,761 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 78 || 95 || 82 \n Market share || 10.3% || 8.8% || 10.6% || 9.5% \n Source: Eurostat \n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some parties argued that the analysis of the\nimpact of the circumventing imports was deficient as solely based on the volume\neffects and thus lacking any price comparison based on a product mix analysis. It\nwas alleged that this lack of analysis was a result of procedural failure as\nthe product mix analysis was omitted despite cooperation of exporting producers\nfrom the countries concerned. In addition, it was alleged that the imports from\nthese countries into the Union concern low-cost children or other bicycles that\ndo not compete with the bicycles produced in the Union. In response to this\nargument it is noted that the product mix analysis could not have been carried\nout for the reasons explained in recital (192) above. Also, the majority of the\ncircumventing imports were transhipments in cases of which no information on\nthe product mix was available. Finally, it is noted that the Union producers\nwere found to produce all product segments; therefore, the argument on alleged\nnon-competing imports of the children and low end bicycles was found\nunsubstantiated. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from other countries\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 Total imports from other third countries amounted\nto 6,931,333 units during the RIP. This level of imports reflected a small\nincrease of 1% over the period considered.\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the contraction of the Union consumption, the market share of the\nimports from other third countries\nremained broadly stable, reaching 34% in the RIP. \n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 Taiwan remained the main\nexporting country to the Union with a relatively constant market share over the\nperiod considered and representing 14% of the Union consumption during the RIP.\n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 Thailand is the second\nlargest exporting country into the Union. Its market share decreased by 2\npercentage points during the period considered, i.e. form 7% in 2008 to 5% in\nthe RIP. \n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (157)\nabove, the prices in Eurostat do not take into consideration the various\nproduct mixes from each country and therefore only indexes are used to indicate\nthe price trends. Since the product mix of the imports from other third\ncountries is unknown, it is not meaningful to compare prices of these imports\nwith those from the Union industry on the Union market. \n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nit should be noted that only the imports from Taiwan exceed the volume of the Chinese imports\n(circumventing imports included). In this regard, it should be noted that the\nimports of bicycles from Taiwan are usually aimed for the high-end market and\nno evidence was submitted otherwise. Therefore it is concluded that these\nimports cannot be considered as a cause of injury to the Union industry. \n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed that\nimports from other third countries were made at lower prices than the Chinese\nimports and therefore the Chinese imports have not caused the material injury\nsuffered by the Union industry. This argument could not be accepted because the\naverage import prices could not be determined on the basis of Eurostat for the\nreasons explained in recital (157) above and therefore no conclusion could be\ndrawn on this basis. \n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nimports from third countries subject to General System of Preferences (GSP)\nfrom 1 January 2011 onwards are expected to increases (Cambodia and\nBangladesh). However, the impact on import prices and quantities and the effect\non the Union market cannot be evaluated a priori. In addition, no information\nwas available as to the ability of these countries to increase the production\ncapacity and the sales volume to the Union market. Therefore, no firm\nconclusion can be drawn on this basis and this claim had to be rejected.\n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure the\nparties claimed that the analysis of the impact of the imports from the third\ncountries with preferential trade agreements was not adequately addressed as\nthe imports from these counties were claimed to be significant in volumes as compared\nto the Chinese imports and some of them also significantly lower prices. In\nthis context it is recalled that the PRC is the second\nlargest importer into the Union. The imports from other third countries were\nall below the import volumes of the Chinese bicycles. Also, no allegations of\ndumping were brought forward against these countries. Therefore, it was\nconcluded that the imports from these countries could not have an impact so as\nto break the established causal link between the large volumes of dumped\nimports from China that coincided with the continuation of material injury of\nthe Union industry. On these grounds, the argument was rejected.\n Table 17 \n Imports from other third countries* \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n   || Units || Market share || Price EUR/unit || Units || Market share || Price EUR/unit || Units || Market share || Price EUR/unit || Units || Market share || Price EUR/unit \n Taiwan || 3,428,043 || 15% ||   || 2,949,433 || 14% ||   || 3,458,448 || 17% ||   || 2,864,114 || 14% ||   \n Indexed || 100 || 100 || 100 || 86 || 94 || 126 || 101 || 110 || 125 || 84 || 93 || 151 \n Thailand || 1,522,209 || 7% ||   || 1,384,410 || 7% ||   || 1,234,123 || 6% ||   || 993,952 || 5% ||   \n Indexed || 100 || 100 || 100 || 91 || 99 || 118 || 81 || 88 || 114 || 65 || 73 || 113 \n Others || 2,746,124 || 12% || 66 || 2,838,962 || 14% || 73 || 2,847,164 || 14% || 80 || 3,077,535 || 15% || 80 \n Indexed || 100 || 100 || 100 || 103 || 113 || 111 || 104 || 113 || 122 || 112 || 125 || 121 \n Total || 7,696,376 || 34% || 99 || 7,172,805 || 35% || 116 || 7,539,735 || 36% || 122 || 6,935,601 || 34% || 132 \n Indexed || 100 || 100 || 100 || 93 || 102 || 118 || 98 || 106 || 124 || 90 || 101 || 134 \n *Circumventing imports from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia excluded Source: Eurostat \n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of consumption \n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned in recital (153) above, from 2008 to the RIP the consumption\ndecreased by 10%. However, the Union industry maintained and even slightly\nincreased its market share (see recital (168) above). Therefore, shrinking\nmarket cannot be a source of injury.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic crisis and\nclimatic conditions\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nthe prevailing negative economic conditions in the Union had an impact on the\nconsumers' purchase behaviour over the period considered. It was also claimed\nthat the poor weather conditions in the Union in 2011 had at least partly an\neffect on the situation of the Union industry. These factors allegedly resulted\nin the overall decrease of consumption of bicycles in the Union.\n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed the investigation\nrevealed a decrease of the Union consumption during the period considered.\nHowever, as mentioned above in recital (234), the shrinking of the market\ncannot be considered a source of injury.\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 These\nparties also claimed that production and employment only decreased to follow\nthe consumption trend and not because of the dumped imports. However, as the\nbicycle industry does not have high fixed costs, the decline in production did\nnot have an impact on the profitability of the Union bicycles industry. As far\nas employment in concerned this is due to the restructuring process undertaken\nby the Union industry. In any event this development does not explain the\nnegative trends for other injury indicators. \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-dumped imports\n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 The non-dumped imports from\none co-operating exporting producer represented negligible quantities, i.e.\nclose to 0% of the total imports from the PRC and therefore they could not have\na discernible effect on the situation on the Union industry.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electric bicycles\n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 It was argued that the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry was caused by the development of electric\nbicycles which allegedly were replacing the product concerned. However, the\ndevelopment of the electric bicycles is very recent and represented only\nmarginal sales volumes during the RIP. Therefore, they could have not had an\nimpact on the situation of the Union industry.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of the structural\nchanges\n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one party argued that the Commission failed to\nanalyse the impact of the recognised structural changes of the market and of\nthe Union industry in its injury and causation analysis. As an example it was claimed that Commission failed\nto address the impact of the shift of production towards the eastern European\ncountries in its production cost analysis. In\nresponse to this claim, it is noted that the analysis of the lasting nature of\nthe changes has been carried out (see recital (162)) and it was concluded that\nthe changes were of lasting nature (see recital (211) above). For this reason,\nnew injury analysis was carried out based on a sample of the Union producers\nchosen to reflect the structural changes. Therefore, it is considered that the\nimpact of such changes was duly taken into account in the injury and causation analysis.\nThe argument is therefore rejected. \n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the shrinking Union\nconsumption, substantial volumes of direct or circumventing dumped imports of\nChinese bicycles were found entering the Union market. The rather stable and\nsignificant market share of these imports over the period considered coincided\nwith a period of continued economic vulnerability of the Union industry (see\nrecitals (184) to (187) above). It is concluded, therefore, that there is a\ncausal link between the imports from the PRC (direct and circumventing) and the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry.\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors were\nconsidered such as impact of imports from other third countries, development of\nconsumption, economic crisis and the climatic conditions, the non-dumped\nimports, the development of the electronic bicycles. None of these factors was\nfound significant enough to break the causal link established between the\ndumped Chinese imports and the material injury suffered.\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above analysis,\nwhich has properly distinguished and separated the effects of all known factors\non the situation of the Union industry from the injurious effects of the dumped\nexports, it was concluded that the dumped imports from the PRC together with\nthe circumventing imports have caused material injury to the Union industry\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation.\nH. UNION INTEREST\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n21 of the basic Regulation, it has been examined whether, despite the\nconclusion on injurious dumping, compelling reasons existed for clearly\nconcluding that it would not be in the Union interest to impose the\nanti-dumping measures against imports from the PRC at the rates set out below\n(see recital (279)). \n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be recalled that,\nin the previous investigations, the adoption of measures was considered not to\nbe against the interest of the Union. Furthermore,\nthe fact that the present investigation is an interim review pursuant to\nArticle 11(3) of the basic Regulation, thus analysing a situation in which anti-dumping\nmeasures have already been in place, allows the assessment of any undue\nnegative impact on the parties concerned by the current anti-dumping measures. \n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 The determination of the\nUnion interest was based on an appreciation of the various interests involved, i.e. those of the Union industry,\nproducers of bicycle parts, unrelated importers and users. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry \n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed that the industry is still in a fragile\nsituation. Given the substantial volume of dumped imports from the PRC and\nlikelihood of continuation of dumping and injury, there is a strong likelihood\nthat Union production would disappear should measures be repealed.\n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion industry contributes significantly to technological innovation and spin\noffs, such as the recently developed EPACs (Electronically Power Assisted\nCycles) and electronic bicycles that would not be economically viable without\nhaving a bicycle industry in the Union. Moreover, the Union industry contributes to the environmental\ngoals such as greening of transport and decarbonisation.\n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry is also a\ndriving force for related industries, such as production of bicycle parts,\nbicycle accessories and related services. In total the Union industry generates\ndirectly and indirectly between 60 000 and 70 000 jobs in the Union market.\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion industry had undertaken efforts to restructure and invested in innovation\nwhich would be lost should the Union industry disappear. To the contrary, with\nthe measures in place, the Union industry would be able to maintain and even increase sales volume and thereby generating the necessary return on investments which would\nenable it to continue to reinvest in new technology and innovation.\n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\non the situation of the Union industry as set out at recitals (184) to (187)\nabove, it can be expected that without measures the financial situation of the\nUnion industry would likely\ndeteriorate significantly and ultimately risk the closure of production.\nTherefore, the anti-dumping measures are in the interest on the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of producers of\nbicycle parts\n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 The Association of the\nBicycles Parts Producers (COLIPED) made itself known during the investigation.\nCOLIPED provided information that there are about 370 companies in the Union, which are supplying components to the bicycle producers and employ about 16,000\npeople. The suppliers industry is depending on the continuation of the bicycles\nproduction in the Union. \n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 53 producers of bicycle\nparts came forward in favour of the measures, representing 39% of the estimated\n1.2 billion EUR of total turnover of the bicycle part industry. The bicycles\nparts producers are benefiting from the extension of the existing measures to\nessential bicycle parts (see recital (1) above). The existing exemption scheme\n(see recital (1) above) encourages local production of bicycle parts by\nrestricting the Chinese content of bicycle parts used to less than 60% of the\ntotal value. Due to the measures in place the Union industry was able to\ndevelop and invest in new projects aiming to resume production of certain\nessential parts in the Union. \n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it was\nfound that without the measures and the expected closure of bicycles production\nin the Union, the bicycle parts industry in the Union will also suffer negative\nconsequences as they will lose their customers. It is therefore concluded that\nthe imposition of anti-dumping measures would be in the interest of the bicycle\nparts industry.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users/\nconsumers\n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 The European Cyclists' Federation (ECF), an umbrella\nfederation of the national cyclists' associations in Europe supported the continuation of the\nanti-dumping measures in force. The ECF argued that local production is in the\ninterest of the consumers as it ensures quality and safety as well as\nspecialised customer services. \n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 The ECF argued that an\nincrease of imports from the PRC would have a negative impact on the high\nquality and safety standards in the Union at the expense of the consumer. \n(258)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nimpact of the anti-dumping duties on the consumer price is estimated not to be\nsignificant as the majority of Union producers of bicycles operate under the\nexemption scheme whereas the essential bicycle parts can be imported from the\nPRC without any duty up to 60% of the total value of the parts used. \n(259)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that, in the\nprevious investigations, it was found that the impact of measures would not be\nsignificant for the users/consumers. Despite the existence of measures, the\nsupply of bicycles from the PRC, as well as countries without any measures is\navailable. It is therefore concluded that the anti-dumping measures do not have\na significant negative impact on users in the Union.\n(260)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one\nparty argued that the analysis failed to take into account the negative impact\nof the measures on the users in form of additional costs brought by the\nmeasures. It is noted that the ECF representing the consumers came forward in support\nof the measures for the quality and safety reasons (see recital (255)above).\nAlso, thanks to exemptions scheme the consumers already benefit from the\nreduced price of certain bicycle parts (see recital (257) above). Therefore,\nthe argument was found unsubstantiated.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters \n(261)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the unrelated importers co-operated in the investigation.\nTherefore, it was not possible to make an assessment of the impact of the\nmeasures during the RIP. It should also be recalled that the purpose of the\nanti-dumping measures is not to prevent imports, but to restore fair trade and\nensure that imports are not made at injuriously dumped prices.\n(262)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that there\nare other sources of imports and around 45% of the consumption of bicycles are\nin fact imported bicycles. \n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfairly-priced imports from the PRC would still be allowed to enter the Union\nmarket, and as imports from third countries would also continue, it is likely\nthat the traditional business of the importers would continue even if the\nanti-dumping measures with regard to the PRC were maintained. The amended\nanti-dumping measures for the three cooperating exporting producers would\nincrease the import possibilities from the PRC at 0% or reduced rate.\nTherefore, it is concluded that the anti-dumping measures do not have a\nsignificant impact on unrelated importers in the Union.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effectiveness of the\nmeasures\n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that\nmeasures would not be effective given that the Union industry is still\nsuffering injury after the anti-dumping measures being in force for almost 20\nyears. It is noted that despite the measures in force, it has been confirmed\nthat Chinese exporting producers were circumventing the measures via other\nthird countries which explained at least partly the situation of the Union\nindustry during the RIP. Therefore, the argument was rejected. \n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties argued that the measures existing for over twenty-three years are\nnot justified on either legal or trade policy grounds. In response to this\nclaim it is noted that no time limits restrict the\nduration of the measures as long as the conditions for their imposition or\nmaintenance are met. Also, in the case at hand the measures are justified as\nthe findings confirmed existence of injurious dumping. Furthermore, the\nsituation of the Union industry is further undermined by circumvention.\nTherefore, the argument is rejected.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion \n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 The continuation of measures\non imports of bicycles originating in the PRC would clearly be in the interest\nof the Union industry and the Union suppliers of bicycle parts. It will allow\nthe Union industry to grow and\nimprove its situation caused by the dumped imports. Furthermore, the importers would not be substantially affected since\nfairly priced bicycles would still be available on the market from the PRC and\nother third counties. Also, due to the extensive use of the existing exemption\nscheme by the Union industry, it was concluded that the existing measures had\nno significant negative impact on the users/consumers. In contrast, if measures\nwere repealed, Union bicycles producers will likely close production, thus also\nthreatening the existence of Union bicycle parts producers.\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that based on the information available concerning the Union\ninterest, there are no compelling reasons against imposing the measures at the\nrates indicated below (279) on imports of the product concerned originating in\nthe PRC. \nI. PROPOSED\nDUTIES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, resulting injury and Union interest, the existing measures, as imposed by Council\nRegulation (EU) No 990/2011, should be maintained except as provided herein\nbelow.\n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\ndetermining the level of these measures, account was taken of the dumping\nmargins found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury\nsustained by the Union producers.\n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 The measures should be\nimposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by the imports in\nquestion without exceeding the dumping margin found. When calculating the\namount of duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was\nconsidered that any measures should allow the Union industry to cover its costs\nof production and to obtain overall a profit before tax that could be\nreasonable achieved by an industry of this type in the sector under normal\nconditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports, on the sales\nof the like product in the Union. The pre-tax profit margin used for this\ncalculation was 8% of turnover of the sales of bicycles. It is the same as in\nthe previous investigation since there was no indication found that this rate\nshould be changed. \n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 Given that cooperation from\nthe PRC was very low as stated in recitals (22) and (24) above, the findings\nfor the cooperating companies cannot be considered to be representative for the\ncountry. Consequently, the country-wide injury margin is hereby maintained\nunchanged as established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005[35].\n(272)\u00a0\u00a0 For the two cooperating\nexporters, for which dumping was found, the injury margins were established on\nthe basis of their own export prices compared, at the same level of trade, to\nthe non-injurious prices of the Union industry for the corresponding product\ntype. No injury margin was calculated for the\nthird company, for which no dumping was found. For Oyama\nBicycles (Taicang) Co. Ltd., no injury margin was\nidentified. However, a substantial injury margin higher than the dumping margin\nwas found for Zhejiang Baoguilai Vehicle Co. Ltd. \n(273)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one\nparty argued that the 8% target profit was fixed at the\nmarket conditions that do not correspond to the current situation and the Commission\nfailed to provide adequate reasoning to justify why the target profit\ndetermined in the previous investigation mentioned in\nrecital (5) above is still justified. It is noted that\nthere was no indication found under the current review that the rate of the\ntarget profit should be changed. The party in question did not submit any\nsubstantiated calculation of an alternative target profit level to be used.\nTherefore, the argument was rejected. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(274)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the three\nco-operating Chinese exporting groups, the individual company anti-dumping duty\nrates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the\nfindings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation\nfound during that investigation with respect to these groups. These duty rates\n(as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019) are\nthus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and produced by these groups and thus by the specific legal\nentities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other group not\nspecifically mentioned in the operative part of this Regulation including\nentities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these\nrates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019.\n(275)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of these individual company anti-dumping duty rates (e.g. following\na change in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[36] forthwith with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s activities linked\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities. If\nappropriate, the Regulation will accordingly be amended by updating the list of\ncompanies benefiting from individual duty rates.\n(276)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a proper\nenforcement of the anti- dumping duty, the residual duty level should not only\napply to the non-cooperating exporting producers but also to those producers\nwhich did not have any exports to the Union during the RIP.\n(277)\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to minimise the risks of circumvention due to the high difference in the\nduty rates, it is considered that special measures are needed in this case to\nensure the proper application of the anti-dumping duties. These special\nmeasures include the following: The presentation to the Customs authorities of\nthe Member States of a valid commercial invoice, which shall conform to the\nrequirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation. Imports not accompanied\nby such an invoice shall be made subject to the residual anti-dumping duty\napplicable to all other exporting producers. \n(278)\u00a0\u00a0 Should\nthe exports by one of the companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates\nincrease significantly in volume after the imposition of the measures\nconcerned, such an increase in volume could be considered as constituting in\nitself a change in the pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures\nwithin the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In such\ncircumstances and provided the conditions are met an anti-circumvention\ninvestigation may be initiated. This investigation may, inter alia, examine the\nneed for the removal of individual duty rates and the consequent imposition of\na country-wide duty.\n(279)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n7(2) of the basic Regulation, the duty rates for the cooperating exporters are\nestablished at the level adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry.\nFor Zhejiang Baoguilai Vehicle Co. Ltd and Ideal (Dongguan) Bike Co., Ltd the\nduty rates are based on dumping margins established by the investigation since\nthey were lower than the injury margins. For Oyama Bicycles (Taicang) Co. Ltd.\nthe injury margin was lower than the dumping margin, therefore, the duty is\nestablished at the injury margin level.\n(280)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nindividual duty rates calculated for the RIP should be as follows:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive duty \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zhejiang Baoguilai Vehicle Co.
