The reduction in\r\nexcise duty is limited to an annual quota of 120 000 hl of pure\r\nalcohol. The derogation expired on 31 December 2013.\nThe purpose of this measure is to\r\ncompensate the producers from the French Overseas Departments (FOD) for their\r\ncompetitive disadvantage triggered by their remoteness, insularity, small size,\r\ndifficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products,\r\nnotably the sugar-cane-rum value chain, the permanence and combination of which\r\nseverely restrain their development.\nOn 12 March 2013, the French authorities\r\nasked the Commission to submit a proposal for a Council Decision extending Council\r\nDecision 2007/659/EC under the same conditions, for a further seven years until\r\n31 December 2020,. This request was supplemented and modified on 3 July\r\nand 2 August 2013. In particular, the French authorities asked the Commission\r\nto extend the scope of the Council Decision so as to apply also to the\r\n\u201ccotisation sur les boissons alcooliques\u201d (also known as the \u201cVignette S\u00e9curit\u00e9\r\nSociale (VSS)), a contribution levied for the National Sickness Insurance Fund\r\non alcoholic beverages to counter the health risks involved in immoderate use\r\nof this product, and to amend Council Decision 2007/695/EC retroactively, i.e.\r\nas of 1 January 2012 by extending it to cover the VSS so that a lower rate can\r\nbe applied to \u2018traditional\u2019 rum produced in the four French outermost regions\r\nlisted in Council Decision 2007/659/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE\r\nFRENCH AND THE EUROPEAN RUM MARKET AND OF THE DEROGATION \nThe size of the European rum market has fluctuated\r\nover time while showing an overall increase from about 250.000 to 300.000\r\nhectolitres of pure alcohol (hlpa) in the late 1980s to around 800 000 hlpa\r\nnowadays (table 1).\nWhile the size of the European rum market\r\nabout tripled between the late 1980s and today, the volumes of rum from the FOD\r\nsold on the European market only doubled between the early 1990s and today, and\r\nit grew by a mere 50% between the late 1980s and today. This resulted in a\r\ndecline of the share of rum from FOD in the entire European market from about\r\n50% in the late 1980s to about 25% today, where it seems to have stabilised.\nFluctuations from one year to another on\r\nthe entire European market had been as high as plus/minus 150.000 hlpa or\r\nplus/minus 20% of the annual market, e.g in the period 2002/2004 and 2007/2010.\r\nThese fluctuations were mirrored in both sales volumes for rum from third\r\ncountries as well as for rum from FOD. In 2011, the main countries of origin of\r\nimported rum from third countries were Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, the United States and Mexico. Rum produced in the FOD was mainly exported to mainland France (71%) and to other EU countries (27%), notably Spain and Germany.\nTable\r\n1\nTrends\r\non the European rum market\n(hectolitres\r\nof pure alcohol)\n Year || Total || Rum from third countries || Rum from the FOD || FOD share (%) \n 1986 || 313 459 || 152 252 || 161 207 || 51% \n 1987 || 300 152 || 158 117 || 142 035 || 47% \n 1988 || 252 877 || 130 976 || 121 901 || 48% \n 1989 || 293 462 || 161 485 || 131 977 || 45% \n 1990 || 368 913 || 227 975 || 140 938 || 38% \n 1991 || 336 252 || 221 861 || 114 391 || 34% \n 1992 || 332 145 || 223 522 || 108 623 || 33% \n 1993 || 322 743 || 231 059 || 91 684 || 28% \n 1994 || 357 936 || 253 215 || 104 721 || 29% \n 1995 || 284 178 || 184 835 || 99 343 || 35% \n 1996 || 359 295 || 249 239 || 110 056 || 31% \n 1997 || 453 050 || 354 858 || 98 192 || 22% \n 1998 || 500 295 || 395 031 || 105 264 || 21% \n 1999 || 567 449 || 428 790 || 138 659 || 24% \n 2000 || 645 237 || 495 625 || 149 612 || 23% \n 2001 || 695 033 || 534 316 || 160 717 || 23% \n 2002 || 734 249 || 557 458 || 176 791 || 24% \n 2003 || 880 653 || 713 535 || 167 118 || 19% \n 2004 || 727 772 || 569 278 || 158 494 || 22% \n 2005 || 726 876 || 571 317 || 155 559 || 21% \n 2006 || 791 542 || 626 157 || 165 385 || 21% \n 2007 || 785 695 || 608 449 || 177 246 || 23% \n 2008 || 851 748 || 657 725 || 194 023 || 23% \n 2009 || 720 958 || 523 172 || 197 786 || 27% \n 2010 || 838 749 || 640 923 || 197 826 || 24% \n 2011 || 809 393 || 603 911 || 205 485 || 25% \n 2012 || 764 490 || 574 562 || 189 928 || 25% \nSource: Eurostat\nIf one compares developments on the\r\nEuropean market to the French mainland market over the last decade, i.e.\r\nbetween 2000 and 2010/2012 one can see that certain patterns are common to both\r\nmarkets, but with a much more dynamic performance on the French mainland market\r\n(table 2):\n\u00b7              \r\nWhile the annual growth rate for the entire\r\nEuropean rum market reached on average between two to three per cent, it was\r\nalmost twice this size on the French mainland market.\n\u00b7              \r\nWhile between 2000 and 2010 the volumes of rum\r\nimported from third countries grew by about 50.000 hlpa on the entire European\r\nmarket, they grew by about 20.000 hlpa on the French market, a market that\r\nrepresents one quarter of the entire European market.\nTable 2\nTrends in the French rum market\r\n(mainland France)\r\n(hectolitres of pure alcohol)\n   || Released for consumption at the reduced rate of excise duty || Non-quota || From third countries || Total \n 2000 || 78 300 || 30 000 || 1 000 || 109 300 \n 2001 || 86 200 || 26 500 ||   ||   \n 2002 || 86 900 || 37 000 ||   ||   \n 2003 || 86 400 || 26 200 ||   ||   \n 2004 || 87 900 || 30 800 ||   ||   \n 2005 || 90 000 || 35 500 || 5 500 || 131 000 \n 2006 || 90 000 || 33 500 ||   ||   \n 2007 || 96 100 || 33 500 ||   ||   \n 2008 || 99 500 || 33 000 ||   ||   \n 2009 || 102 400 || 32 400 ||   ||   \n 2010 || 105 700 || 40 600 || 20 000 || 166 300 \n 2011 || 108 900 || 28 500 ||   ||   \n 2012 || 109 800 || 24 975 || 21 395 || 156 170 \nSource: French authorities, own\r\ncalculations\nAccording to the French authorities, the\r\nmarket share of rum of non-EU origin on the French mainland market has risen\r\nfrom less than 1% in 2000 to 4.2% in 2005, 12% in 2010 and 13.7% in 2012. Over\r\nthe same period, the market share of these imports decreased from 77% to 75% on\r\nthe entire European market.\nThe key reason for the strength of\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum on the French market is that France applies a reduced excise\r\nduty to \u2018traditional\u2019 rum, which it is allowed doing so up to a maximum of 50% of\r\nthe standard rate. Moreover, since 2012 it also applied this reduction to the\r\nVSS, to compensate for changes to the method of calculating the VSS - from VSS\r\nper hectolitre to VSS per hectolitre of pure alcohol, thus, \u2018penalising\u2019 strong\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum over rum from third countries. Taken both taxes together, France now applies a tax of EUR 1.264,20 per hlpa on \u2018traditional\u2019 rum and of EUR 2.193,00\r\nper hlpa on rum from third countries (table 3). \nTable\r\n3\nExcise\r\ntax and VSS on \u2018traditional\u2019 rum and on competing rum\r\n- per hlpa \u2013\n Rate at year end || FOD rum || All other rum || Advantage for FOD rum \n Excise || VSS[1] || Total || Excise || VSS[2] || Total || \u20ac per hlpa || reduction from sum of standard rates \n 2008 || 835.00 || 325.00 || 1,160.00 || 1,450.00 || 325.00 || 1,775.00 || 615.00 || 34.6% \n 2009 || 848.00 || 400.00 || 1,248.00 || 1,471.75 || 400.00 || 1,871.75 || 623.75 || 33.3% \n 2010 || 858.38 || 400.00 || 1,258.38 || 1,512.96 || 400.00 || 1,912.96 || 654.58 || 34.2% \n 2011 || 859.24 || 400.00 || 1,259.24 || 1,514.47 || 400.00 || 1,914.47 || 655.23 || 34.2% \n 2012[3] || 903.00 || 361.20 || 1,264.20 || 1,660.00 || 533.00 || 2,193.00 || 928.80 || 42.4% \n 2013 || 918.80 || 367.52 || 1,286.32 || 1,689.05 || 542.33 || 2,231.38 || 945.06 || 42.4% \nSource: Own calculations\nThis policy has helped to keep the market\r\nshare of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum on the French mainland market to 87%, way above its\r\nmarket share on the rest of the EU market, where it remains limited to just\r\nover 10%. On the other hand has it also come at a price in terms of revenues\r\nforegone by the French tax authorities. Indeed, the revenue foregone can be\r\nestimated to have increased from about EUR 70 million in 2007 to more than EUR\r\n120 million in 2012, when taking both the reduced excise duties and VSS and the\r\nVAT revenue forgone into account[4]\r\n(table 4).\nTable\r\n4\nRevenue\r\nforegone as a consequence of reduced excise and VSS for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum\n   || Volume of FOD rum sales in France under the quota[5] (hlpa) || Excise tax differential between FOD rum and other spirits[6](\u20ac per hlpa) || Excise duty and VSS revenue foregone as a consequence of reduced rates for FOD rum (\u20ac million) ||   VAT revenue foregone (19.6% of excise duty and VSS) (\u20ac million) \n 2007 || 96,100 || 615.00 || 59.1 || 11.6 \n 2008 || 99,500 || 615.00 || 61.2 || 12.0 \n 2009 || 102,400 || 623.75 || 63.9 || 12.5 \n 2010 || 105,700 || 654.58 || 69.2 || 13.6 \n 2011 || 108,900 || 655.23 || 71.3 || 14.0 \n 2012 || 109,800 || 928.80 || 102.0 || 20.0 \nSource: Own calculations\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COST DISADVANTAGE AND\r\nPROPORTIONALITY OF THE DEROGATION\nWith respect to the proportionality of the\r\nmeasures to compensate producers of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum in the French overseas\r\ndepartments three elements should be considered:\n\u00b7              \r\nthe difference in production (and shipping) cost,\r\n\n\u00b7              \r\nthe difference in marketing costs, triggered by\r\nhigher excise duties and VSS on bigger bottles and rum with higher alcohol\r\nstrength,\n\u00b7              \r\nthe development of the market share of\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum on both the French and on the entire European market.\nIn the latter context the figures above have\r\nalready shown that the market share of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum in mainland France\r\n(where it is subsidised) seems to continue edging down while it seems to have\r\nstabilised on the rest of the European market (where it is not subsidised).\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Difference in production cost\nThe best proxy as a starting point for\r\nquantifying in monetary terms the adverse effects of the special\r\ncharacteristics and constraints of the outermost regions on the producers of\r\nrum should be the difference in production costs compared to rum produced in\r\nother regions of the world, including the shipping cost to mainland Europe / France.\nDespite all efforts to modernise the\r\ncane-sugar-rum value chain in the French outermost departments, production of\r\nmarketable rum is, according to information provided by France, about three times as expensive as production in other regions of the world. While\r\nrum produced in FOD can be imported at costs (including freight and insurance\r\ncost) of about EUR 300 per hectolitre of pure alcohol, rum produced in other\r\nregions of the world can be imported at a price of about EUR 100 per litre of\r\npure alcohol (table 5).\nTable 5\nCost differences (after\r\ntaxes) between \u2018traditional\u2019 rum and rum from 3rd countries\nif taxed at standard rates\r\n(per litre of pure alcohol and per bottle)\n   || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || FOD Rum || Rum of 3rd countries ||   \n   || 70cl 40\u00b0 || 70cl 42\u00b0 || 70 cl 50\u00b0 || 1 litre 40\u00b0 || 1 litre 50\u00b0 || 1 litre 55\u00b0 || 1 litre 59\u00b0 || 70 cl 37,5\u00b0 ||   \n Cost of rum in bulk per litre of pure alcohol (insurance and freight costs included) || 3,00 || 3,00 || 3,00 || 3,00 || 3,00 || 3,00 || 3,00 || 1,01 ||   \n A : Cost of the liquid || 0,84 || 0,88 || 1,05 || 1,20 || 1,50 || 1,65 || 1,77 || 0,27 ||   \n B : Unloading costs || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 || 0,04 ||   \n C : Customs duties || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,00 || 0,17 ||   \n D : Bottling costs || 0,40 || 0,40 || 0,40 || 0,50 || 0,50 || 0,50 || 0,50 || 0,40 ||   \n E : Labour costs after unloading || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 || 0,25 ||   \n F :Mainland transport || 0,07 || 0,07 || 0,07 || 0,08 || 0,08 || 0,08 || 0,08 || 0,07 ||   \n Sum of A to F || 1,60 || 1,64 || 1,80 || 2,07 || 2,37 || 2,52 || 2,64 || 1,20 ||   \n G : Excise duty || 4,73 || 4,97 || 5,91 || 6,76 || 8,45 || 9,29 || 9,97 || 4,43 ||   \n H : Social security contribution \u00ab Cotisation sur les boissons alcooliques \u00bb || 1,52 || 1,59 || 1,90 || 2,17 || 2,71 || 2,98 || 3,20 || 1,42 ||   \n VAT || 1,54 || 1,61 || 1,89 || 2,16 || 2,65 || 2,90 || 3,10 || 1,38 ||   \n Sale price (all taxes included) before marketing and distribution margin || 9,39 || 9,81 || 11,51 || 13,15 || 16,18 || 17,69 || 18,90 || 8,43 ||   \n Number of bottles sold, in \u2018000, (Nielsen data base 2011) || 9029,9  || 1271,2 || 2618,0 || 6716,0 || 3941,6 || 3684,2 || 35,6 || 8150 ||   \n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Difference in \u2018marketing\u2019 cost\nThe effects of this cost difference are\r\naggravated by the fact that in France, \u2018traditional\u2019 rum is typically sold at\r\nhigher alcohol strengths (40\u00b0, 42\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 55\u00b0 and 59\u00b0 instead of 37.5\u00b0) and in\r\nlarger bottles (1 litre instead of 0.7 litre). The higher levels of alcohol\r\ncontent trigger in turn higher excise duties, a higher VSS (since 2012) and,\r\nadditionally, higher VAT per litre of rum sold. In consequence, the cost\r\ndisadvantage (including taxes) can range from EUR 0.95 to EUR 3.07 per bottle\r\nof 0.7 litres with maximum alcohol strength of 50\u00b0 and EUR 10.47 per bottle of\r\n1.0 litre with maximum alcohol strength of 59\u00b0 (table 5).\nThus, the cost disadvantage of marketing\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum results not only from higher production and transportation\r\ncosts, but also from higher \u201cmarketing costs\u201d that are linked to the\r\n'traditional' character of rum produced in the FOD, in the form of higher domestic\r\ntaxes and levies due to the specificities of how \u2018traditional\u2019 rum is marketed\r\n(notably higher degree of alcohol content and larger bottles).\nIndeed, only one third of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum\r\nis marketed in bottles that are somewhat similar to those of their competitors,\r\ni.e. 0.7 litres of content and alcohol strength of 40\u00b0 (instead of 37.5\u00b0). If\r\none takes these bottles as a benchmark to calculate the cost difference (after\r\ntaxes) compared to other supplies, the cost gap would correspond to around EUR\r\n340 per hlpa, or about 20% of the standard excise duty rate applied in 2012. In\r\nthe light of the above arguments on proportionality, compensating this \u201ccost\r\ndisadvantage\u201d (after taxes) can still be considered proportionate.\nMoreover, although \u2018traditional\u2019 rum sells\r\nat significantly lower prices than comparable rum imported from third countries\r\nas a result of the reduction in excise duties and VSS (table 6) it was\r\nnevertheless unable to avoid losing part of its mainland France market to competitors over the last decade. This indicates that \u2018traditional\u2019 rum\r\nseems to be established in a market segment where a (relative) increase in\r\nprices triggers a decline in market shares while a further (relative) decline\r\nin prices does not come with the benefit of higher market shares.\nTable\r\n6\r\nRetail prices for rum in France\r\n2008 to 2012, in \u20ac/bottle\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2012\nRum from 3rd countries\nHavana club (70cl,\r\n37.5\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.57\u00a0\u00a0 14.11\u00a0\u00a0 14.42\u00a0\u00a0 14.65\u00a0\u00a0 15.90\nBacardi (70cl 37.5\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.44\u00a0\u00a0 13.89\u00a0\u00a0 14.25\u00a0\u00a0 14.21\u00a0\u00a0 14.92\n\u2018Traditional\u2019 rum\nSaint James (70cl, 40\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11.14\u00a0\u00a0 11.17\u00a0\u00a0 11.32\nN\u00e9grita (100cl, 40\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10.49\u00a0\u00a0 10.66\u00a0\u00a0 10.54\u00a0\u00a0 10.47\u00a0\u00a0 10.66\nCharrette (100cl, 49\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.89\u00a0\u00a0 14.54\u00a0\u00a0 14.39\u00a0\u00a0 14.48\u00a0\u00a0 15.02\nDillon (100cl, 55\u00b0)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14.82\u00a0\u00a0 15.65\u00a0\u00a0 16.37\u00a0\u00a0 16.41\u00a0\u00a0 17.00\nSource: IRI market\r\nstudies\nAlso, to a large extent \u2018traditional\u2019 rum\r\nseems to be sold at lower marketing and distribution margins in the wholesale\r\nand retail sale value chain: When comparing the retail sales price\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum with competing rum brands on the one hand (table 6) and with\r\nthe cost price (before taxes and marketing and distribution margins) on the\r\nother (table 5) and then applying a reduction of up to 50% in excise duties and\r\nVSS, the marketing and distribution margins for rum from 3rd\r\ncountries easily exceeds 80%, while the same margins for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum\r\nmarketed in 1l bottles with high alcohol strengths are just over 60%.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality of a derogation\r\ndecision\nAccording to Article 110 TFEU no Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States\r\nany internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or\r\nindirectly on similar domestic products. Furthermore, no Member State shall impose on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of such a\r\nnature as to afford indirect protection to other products.\nHowever, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU\r\nthe Council may authorise Member States with outermost regions and departments\r\nto derogate from the provisions of Article 110 TFEU so as to take account of\r\nthe structural social and economic situation of these regions and which is\r\ncompounded by other factors that severely restrain their development. Such\r\nderogation may not undermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union legal\r\norder, including the internal market and common policies, such as common\r\ntaxation policies based on Article 113 TFEU. Thus, such derogations must remain\r\nproportionate, i.e. must not go further than necessary to address the adverse\r\nframework conditions hampering the economic development of these regions and it\r\nmust not excessively distort competition in the single market. In consequence, any\r\nderogation from Article 110 TFEU should in principle remain limited to fully or\r\npartially compensating the cost disadvantage from which producers in these\r\nregions suffer.\nOn the other hand, there are no producers\r\nof rum in other Member States, and the competition with other strong alcohol products\r\nsuch as whisky or cognac is rather limited. It would require a rather\r\nsignificant difference in prices in favour of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum so as to persuade\r\nconsumers to switch from these competing products to \u2018traditional\u2019.\nFrance claims that it should be allowed to\r\ncompensate for the entire \u201ccost disadvantage\u201d stemming from both higher\r\nproduction and shipping costs and higher excise duties and VSS per bottle irrespective\r\nof the size of the bottle, i.e. \u2018traditional\u2019 rum sold in bigger bottles and at\r\nhigher alcohol strength should receive a correspondingly higher reduction in\r\nexcise duties. The reasoning behind this claim is that, according to the French\r\nauthorities, French consumers of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum are not willing to pay more for\r\nrum in bigger bottles and with higher alcohol strength with the higher excise\r\nduty VSS and VAT such products would carry. This seems to be confirmed by the\r\nabove analysis.\nTherefore, France has requested (as it is\r\nauthorised by the Council until end 2013) to be allowed to reduce the excise\r\nduty by up to 50% of the national standard rate. At present, France applies a reduced rate corresponding to about 55% of the standard rate applied to other\r\nstrong alcohol marketed in France.\nMoreover, France has as of 1 January 2012\r\nswitched the basis for calculating the VSS from 160 EUR per hectolitre to 533 EUR\r\nper hectolitre of pure alcohol. This VSS comes on top of the national excise\r\nduty. As ruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union, this VSS is not\r\nan excise duty. However, a maximum VSS is generally applicable which\r\ncorresponds to 40% of the excise duty. At present, the standard rate of VSS\r\ncorresponds to about 32% of the standard rate of the excise duty. \nIn total, since 2012, the fiscal advantage\r\n(excise duty and VSS) for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum has been set to about 42% of the\r\nsum of the standard excise duty and the standard VSS rate.\nWhile a reduction in the standard rate of\r\nexcise duties of up to 50% of the standard rate had been authorised by Council\r\nDecision 2007/659/EC as amended by Council Decision 896/2011/EU for\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum for up to 120 000 hlpa, the reduction in the VSS for\r\n\u2018traditional\u2019 rum was not included in the Council Decision.\nHowever, as there is no reason to apply\r\ndifferent treatment for excise duties compared to other levies on alcoholic\r\nbeverages, in particular the VSS so long as the cumulative discrimination in\r\nfavour of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum remains proportionate, combining the two measures\r\ninto one single one might be justified.\nThe Council might in fact have authorised France to apply a reduced VSS along the same lines as it had authorised a reduced excise duty rate, if\r\n  France had notified this measure applied to VSS since January 2012. Thus, it\r\nis proposed that the Council should retroactively authorise the reduction in\r\nthe VSS up to a rate of 50% of the standard VSS rate for up to 120 000 hlpa\r\nof \"traditional\u2019 rum\".\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\nFor the period 2014 to 2020 it is therefore\r\nproposed that France should be allowed to apply a reduced rate of excise duty\r\nand VSS of up to 50% of the respective standard rates but that the cumulative reduction\r\nin both excise duty and VSS should not be higher than 50% of the full rate for\r\nalcohol set in application of Article 3 of Directive 92/84/EEC.\nIt is also proposed that France should draw\r\nup a mid-term report addressed to the European Commission by no later than 31\r\nJuly 2017 so that it can be assessed whether the reasons which justify the\r\ngranting of the tax derogation still apply and whether the fiscal advantage\r\ngranted by France remains proportionate and sufficient to support a competitive\r\ncane-sugar-rum value chain in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union.\r\nThis report should also provide information on \u201cmarketing costs\u201d. In case the\r\ninformation provided demonstrates that the tax derogation is not, partly or\r\nentirely, justified any more, or it is less suitable than alternative measures\r\nfor competitiveness reasons and also in view of its international dimension, a\r\nphasing out process could be introduced until the end of the period.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed measures The proposed decision authorises France to apply from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 a reduced rate of excise duty and of the \u201ccotisation sur les boissons alcooliques\u201d (VSS) on \u2018traditional\u2019 rum produced in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union in respect of a quota of 120 000 hlpa. The sum of the reduced rates of (referred to in Article 1) may be lower than the minimum rate of excise duty on alcohol set by Directive 92/84/EEC, but each individual reduced rate may not be more than 50% lower than the corresponding standard national rate on alcohol. For 2012 and 2013, the proposal amends Council Decision 2007/659/EC as amended by Council Decision 896/2011/EU in order to include the VSS within its scope, retroactively, i.e. as of 1 January 2012 so that a lower rate of VSS can be applied for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum produced in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union. For this period, the reduced rate of this VSS may also be lower than the minimum rate of excise duty on alcohol set by Directive 92/84/EEC, but may not be more than 50% lower than the standard rate of the VSS. The French authorities will have to send a mid-term report to the Commission by 31 July 2017 in order to assess whether the reasons which justify the granting of the tax derogation still apply and whether the fiscal advantage granted by France remains proportionate and sufficient to compensate the cane-sugar-rum value chain in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union for their unfavourable structural social and economic situation that is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development. This mid-term report shall also include up-dated information on the associated marketing costs and on any measures that have been undertaken to align them with those of competing rum. \n Legal basis Article 349 TFEU. \n Subsidiarity principle Only the Council is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific measures to adjust the application of the Treaties to the outermost regions, including the common policies, because of the permanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of those regions. This also holds for authorising derogations to Article 110 TFEU. The proposal for a Council Decision therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. \n Proportionality principle \n The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to offset the adverse social and economic conditions reflected in higher production and marketing costs associated with the production and marketing in mainland France of traditional rum. The existence of special tax and levy arrangements as proposed is not, therefore, preventing competing rums from continuing to increase their penetration of the French market. || \n Choice of instrument \n Proposed instrument: Council Decision. \n Other instruments would not have been appropriate for the following reasons. Derogations granted under Article 349 TFEU are contained in Council decisions. In addition, the proposal proposes to amend a legal text which is itself a Council Decision, adopted on the same legal basis (what was Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty). \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no impact on the budget of\r\nthe European Union.\n2013/0413 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising France to apply a reduced rate\r\nof certain indirect taxes on \u2018traditional\u2019 rum produced in Guadeloupe, French\r\nGuiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union and amending Decision 2007/659/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[7],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2007/659/EC[8] authorises France to apply to\r\n'traditional' rum produced in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and\r\nR\u00e9union, and sold on the French mainland a reduced rate of excise duty which\r\nmay be lower than the minimum rate of excise duty set by Council Directive 92/84/EEC[9] but not more than 50% lower\r\nthan the standard national excise duty on alcohol. As of 1 January 2011 the\r\nreduction in excise duty is limited to an annual quota of 120 000 hectolitres\r\nof pure alcohol (hlpa). That derogation expires on 31 December 2013. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 12 March 2013, the\r\nFrench authorities asked the Commission to submit a proposal for a Council Decision\r\nextending the derogation set out in Decision 2007/659/EC, under the same\r\nconditions, for seven years, until 31 December 2020. This request was\r\nsupplemented by submission of additional information and amended concerning the\r\ndifferent French taxes to be covered by the decision, on 3 July and 2\r\nAugust 2013. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The French authorities also\r\ninformed the Commission that the national legislation on the \u2018cotisation sur\r\nles boissons alcooliques\u2019 (also known as \u2018vignette s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale\u2019 or VSS),\r\nwhich is a contribution levied for the National Sickness Insurance Fund on\r\nalcoholic beverages sold in France to counter the health risks involved in\r\nimmoderate use of this product that is levied in addition to the national\r\nexcise duty, had been amended as of 1 January 2012. In particular, the tax base\r\nwas changed from 160 EUR per hectolitre to 533 EUR per hlpa, and a\r\nlimitation of the amount of the VSS was introduced which was linked to the\r\napplicable excise duty.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\r\nrequest by the French authorities for an extension of the derogation set out in\r\nDecision 2007/659/EC until 31 December 2020, the French authorities asked the\r\nCommission to include the VSS in the list of taxes for which a lower rate can\r\nbe applied for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum produced in the four outermost regions of\r\nFrance listed in Decision 2007/659/EC as of 1 January 2012.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore more\r\nappropriate to adopt a new Decision on a derogation covering both taxes: the\r\ndifferentiation of the excise duty as set out in Directive 92/84/EEC and the\r\nVSS, instead of extending the derogation set out in Decision 2007/659/EC.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the small scale of\r\nthe local market, the overseas departments\u2019 distilleries can develop their\r\nactivities only if they have sufficient access to the market in mainland France, which is the main outlet for their rum (71% of rum). The difficulty for \u2018traditional\u2019\r\nrum to compete on the Union market is attributable to two parameters: higher\r\nproduction costs and higher taxes per bottle as the \u2018traditional\u2019 rum is typically\r\nmarketed at higher levels of alcohol strength and in bigger bottles.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production costs of the cane-sugar-rum\r\nvalue chain in the overseas departments are higher than in other regions of the\r\nworld. In particular wage costs are higher as the French social legislation is\r\napplicable in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union. Those\r\noutermost regions are also subject to Union environment and safety standards, which\r\nentail important investments and costs which are not directly related to\r\nproductivity, even if part of those investments is covered by the Union structural\r\nfunds. Furthermore, distilleries of those outermost regions are smaller than\r\ndistilleries of international groups. This generates higher production costs\r\nper unit of output. Globally, all of those direct additional production costs,\r\nincluding freight and insurance correspond, according the French authorities, to\r\nabout 12% of the French excise duty applicable normally to strong alcohols in\r\n2012.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Traditional\u2019 rum sold in mainland\r\n  France is typically marketed in bigger bottles (60% of rum is sold in bottles\r\ncontaining 1 litre) and at higher levels of alcohol (ranging from 40\u00b0 to 59\u00b0)\r\nthan competing rum, which is typically marketed in bottles of 0,7 litre at 37,5\u00b0.\r\nThe higher levels of alcohol content trigger in turn higher excise duties, a\r\nhigher VSS and, in addition, a higher value added tax (VAT) per litre of rum\r\nsold. Thus, the cumulative \u201cadditional costs\u201d, i.e. higher production costs,\r\nhigher freight cost and higher taxes (excise duty and VAT) correspond to between\r\n40% and 50% of the French excise duty applicable normally on strong alcohols in\r\n2012. Moreover the change in the basis for calculating the VSS from 160 EUR\r\nper hectolitre to 533 EUR per hlpa as of 1 January 2012 would have had\r\n(including VAT) an additional adverse impact on the price of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum,\r\nwhich is marketed at higher levels of alcohol corresponding to about 10% of the\r\nstandard excise rate. In order to offset this additional adverse effect, a\r\nreduction of the VSS rate was introduced that benefits the \u2018traditional\u2019 rum of\r\nthe four outermost regions of France.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fiscal advantage covering\r\nboth the harmonised excise duties and the VSS to be authorised needs to remain\r\nproportionate so as not to undermine the integrity and the coherence of the\r\nUnion legal order, including safeguarding undistorted competition in the\r\ninternal market and state aid policies. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The extra costs stemming\r\nfrom the decade-long marketing practice of selling \u2018traditional\u2019 rum at higher\r\nlevels of alcohol and, thus, triggering higher taxes should therefore also be\r\ntaken into account.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2012, France applied an excise duty of EUR 903 per hlpa to \u2018traditional\u2019 rum, which corresponds\r\nto 54,4% of the standard rate. It also applied a VSS of EUR 361,20 per hlpa,\r\nwhich corresponds to 67,8% of the standard rate of VSS. Both reductions taken\r\ntogether correspond to a tax advantage of EUR 928,80 per hlpa, or a tax\r\nadvantage compared to the aggregated standard rates (excise duty and VSS) of 42,8%.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/659/EC\r\nauthorises France to reduce the national excise duty applicable on \u2018traditional\u2019\r\nrum by up to 50% of the standard national excise duty on alcohol. That Decision\r\ndid not include the reduced rate of the VSS for \u2018traditional\u2019 rum which was only\r\nintroduced as a compensatory measure for the additional burden created for that\r\nrum by the reform of the VSS system as of 1 January 2012.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to remedy that\r\nsituation by applying the same principles that had been applied to a derogation\r\nfrom Article 110 of the Treaty for harmonised excise duties also to the VSS. At\r\nthe same time, it should cap from January 2014 the tax advantage that can be granted\r\nat a maximum percentage of the standard rates per hlpa of the harmonised excise\r\nduty on strong alcohol and of the VSS.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new derogation should be\r\ngranted for seven years, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France should submit a mid\u2011term\r\nreport to enable the Commission to assess whether the reasons justifying the\r\nderogation still exist, whether the fiscal advantage granted by France is still\r\nproportionate and whether alternative measures to a tax derogation system which\r\nare also sufficient to support a competitive cane-sugar-rum value chain \u00a0can be\r\nenvisaged, taking into account their international dimension.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Decision 2007/659/EC could\r\nnot yet take account of the new circumstances after the reform of the VSS\r\nsystem.
