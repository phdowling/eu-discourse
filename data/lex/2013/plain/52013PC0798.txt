The directives concerned are the following:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/94/EC[1] relating to the protection of\r\nemployees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (hereafter referred\r\nto as \u2018the Employer Insolvency Directive\u2019);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/38/EC[2] on the establishment of\r\nEuropean Works Council (hereafter referred to as the \u2018European Works Council\r\nDirective\u2019);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2002/14/EC[3] establishing a general\r\nframework for informing and consulting employees (hereafter referred to as the \u2018Information\r\nand Consultation Directive\u2019);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 98/59/EC[4] on the approximation of the\r\nlaws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (hereafter\r\nreferred to as the \u2018Collective Redundancies Directive\u2019);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/23/EC[5] relating to the safeguarding of\r\nemployees\u2019 rights in the event of transfers of undertakings (hereafter referred\r\nto as the \u2018Transfer of Undertakings Directive\u2019);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 96/71/EC[6] concerning the posting of\r\nworkers in the framework of the provision of services (hereafter referred to as\r\nthe \u2018Posting of Workers Directive\u2019).\nDepending on the situation at national level,\r\nexclusions could have a negative impact on a number of rights recognised under\r\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the\r\nright to information and consultation within the undertaking (Article 27), and\r\nthe right to fair and just working conditions (Article 31).\nMost of the Member States have made little or\r\nno use of the exclusions. Eight Member States[7]\r\nhave not excluded seafarers from any of the Directives and eight Member States\r\nhave made use of only one exclusion. This situation gives rise to a potential\r\nsituation whereby the same categories of workers are treated differently in the\r\ndifferent Member States.\nFurthermore, as underlined by the Commission\r\npreviously, the number of EU national seafarers is steadily decreasing and this\r\ncould be problematic for the future, notably because experience off-shore is\r\nessential for certain shore-based jobs. Although this could be the consequence\r\nof different factors, the lack of interest in maritime careers may be\r\nreinforced by the impression that seafarers are less well protected than other\r\nemployees[8].\nHence, the current situation does not ensure a\r\nlevel playing field in the European market, since certain companies are\r\nexempted from certain obligations, notably in terms of information and\r\nconsultation, which are mandatory for competing companies based in other Member\r\nStates.\nAs a consequence, the aim of the proposal is to\r\nimprove the level of protection of the rights protected under the EU Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights in EU labour law and to ensure a level playing field at EU\r\nlevel. Furthermore, it contributes to general policy objectives which are\r\nenshrined in Article 151 TFEU, namely the promotion of employment, improved\r\nliving and working conditions, proper social protection and dialogue between\r\nmanagement and labour.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other EU\r\npolicies and horizontal objectives\nThis initiative aims at assessing the scope and\r\nreasons for the exclusion or faculty to exclude seafarers from labour law directives.\r\nThe Commission is committed to ensuring the compatibility of any new\r\nlegislative proposal with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and to assess\r\nthe impact of all such proposals on the rights and principles protected under\r\nthe Charter. In the case at stake, suppressing the exclusions would have a\r\npositive impact on the rights protected under Articles 27 and 31 of the\r\nCharter.\nIt is also fully in line with the Integrated\r\nMaritime Policy for the European Union established in 2007 through the\r\nso-called \u2018Blue Book\u2019[9].\r\nIn the \u2018Blue Book\u2019 the Commission insisted on its aim \u2018to increase the number\r\nand quality of maritime jobs for European citizens\u2019, stressing in\r\nparticular that:\n\u2018Improved staffing policies and working\r\nconditions (including health and safety), supported by a concerted effort by\r\nall maritime stakeholders and an efficient regulatory framework taking into\r\naccount its global context, are necessary if Europeans are to be attracted to\r\nthe sector.\u2019\nThe Commission stated that in order to meet the\r\nobjective it would \u2018reassess, in close cooperation with social partners, the\r\nexclusions affecting maritime sectors in EU labour legislation\u2019.\nThe Commission reaffirmed its objective to\r\nincrease the number and quality of jobs in the maritime sector in its\r\nCommunication on \u2018Blue Growth\u2019[10]\r\nwhich was endorsed by the European Ministers responsible for the Integrated\r\nMaritime Policy in the Limassol Declaration [11].\nThis proposal is also in line with the EU 2020\r\nStrategy and its goals, notably in terms of employment. Improving the quality\r\nof work and working conditions, and in particular reviewing the existing\r\nlegislation and providing for a smarter EU legal framework for employment and health\r\nand safety at work, constitute key actions within the context of \u2018An Agenda for\r\nnew skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment\u2019[12].. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations of\r\nstakeholders\nThis proposal was preceded by a number of\r\nconsultations, both specific and general. The Commission has also used external\r\nexpertise for the preparation of this initiative.\nGeneral\nIn the context of the setting up of an\r\nintegrated maritime policy, the issue of labour law exclusions was addressed in\r\nthe 2006 Green Paper[13].\r\nIn its 2007 Communication[14],\r\nthe Commission drew some conclusions from the consultation launched with the\r\nGreen Paper. On the issue of jobs in the maritime sector, it stated that \u2018there\r\nare divergences on whether, and which, exclusions concerning maritime sectors\r\nin EU social legislation are justified, but there is agreement on the need to\r\ncontribute to a global level playing field for the sector and the role that EU\r\nlegislation can play in this context\u2019.\nSpecific\nIn October 2007, the Commission adopted a\r\nCommunication[15]\r\nlaunching the first stage of consultation of European social partners as\r\nprovided for in Article 154 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion (TFEU). It was followed, in April 2009, by the launching of the second stage\r\nof consultation of the European social partners.\nThe consultation showed that the social\r\npartners in the maritime transport sector had differing views on the need to do\r\naway with the existing exclusions. While the European Transport Workers'\r\nFederation (ETF) were in favour of suppressing all exclusions, the European\r\nCommunity Shipowners' Associations (ECSA) considered that the reasons for\r\nintroducing them, which were linked to the specificities of the maritime\r\ntransport sector, remained valid and that the exclusions should therefore be\r\nmaintained.\nFor their part, both sides in the fisheries\r\nsector were in favour of doing away with some of the existing exclusions\r\n(Insolvency Directive, Collective Redundancies Directive and Transfer of\r\nUndertakings Directive) or the establishment of equivalent specific provisions,\r\nparticularly regarding information and consultation. They did not take a position\r\nregarding the European Works Councils Directive.\nA detailed questionnaire was sent to all Member\r\nStates. Replies were received from 20 Member States[16]. The information received is\r\ndetailed in Annex 3 of the Impact Assessment report.\nIn summary, it should be underlined that Member\r\nStates that have opted to apply the provisions of the Directives to seafarers\r\nare unanimous that they do not appear to represent significant additional costs\r\ncompared to their application to on-shore companies. None of these Member\r\nStates, notably some Member States with an important maritime sector, is aware\r\nof any negative impact, particularly in the event of the sale of a vessel. On\r\nthe contrary, the experience of some maritime nations which do not apply the\r\nexclusions has been an increase in the fleet, while the fleets of Member States\r\nthat applied the exclusions decreased.\nMember States having made use of the exclusions\r\nand derogations unanimously argue that they should be maintained and that the\r\napplication of the Directives to the maritime sector would have significant additional\r\ncosts. The Member States in question do not give any indication of the\r\nquantification of the additional costs.\nExternal expertise\nThe Task Force on maritime employment and\r\ncompetitiveness, established by the European Commission in the context of the\r\nintegrated maritime policy, delivered its report in July 2011[17]. On the issue of the exclusion\r\nof seafarers from certain labour law Directives, the Task Force stated:\n\u2018Important evolutions have occurred since\r\nthe provisions were adopted, notably as regards communications technology,\r\nwhich might now make information and consultation requirements more practical.\r\nElimination of the exclusions or the application of requirements adapted to the\r\nspecial circumstances of employment at sea would help to eliminate the\r\nimpression that seafarers are less well protected by European Union labour law\r\nthan other employees which may contribute to a lack of interest in maritime\r\ncareers\u2019.\nThe Commission launched a call for tenders for\r\na study aimed at supporting the preparation of an impact assessment concerning\r\nthe possible review of the current exclusions of seafaring workers from the\r\nscope of EU labour law. The Study was carried out by a consortium led by MRAG\r\nLimited. The final report[18]\r\nwas delivered in December 2010.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessments\nFrom the discussions and consultations with\r\nstakeholders, the following policy options emerged for impact assessment:\nPolicy option 1: no EU action\nUnder this policy option, the EU would take no\r\nnew initiative, legislative or non-legislative. The current Directives would\r\nremain in place as they stand.\nTrends indicate that the decline in the number\r\nof European seafarers is likely to continue, with more and more jobs aboard\r\nEuropean vessels taken up by personnel from third countries.\nPolicy option 2: derogation subject to the\r\nguarantee of an equivalent level of protection\nThis option would entail replacing the blank\r\nexclusions by a provision allowing Member States to deviate from the provisions\r\nof the Directive for seafarers, provided that a degree of protection equivalent\r\nto that of the Directives and its effective exercise by the employees concerned\r\nis ensured.\nThis option would allow for the adaptation of\r\nthe legal framework to the specificities of the maritime sector, notably the\r\nremoteness of workers from the headquarters of the company for very long\r\nperiods, but would still require Member States to ensure the substance of the\r\nprotection, if not the practical modalities of its implementation.\nPolicy option 3: suppress the exclusions in\r\nall Directives\nThis option would be based on the assumption\r\nthat all of the Directives were originally intended to include all sectors of\r\nactivity and that the exclusions of seafarers are unjustified.\nPolicy option 4: adapt the rules to the\r\nspecificities of the sector\nThis option would entail the adoption of\r\nsubstantive norms aimed at adapting the legal texts to the characteristics of\r\nthe maritime sector. For example, in the maritime sector, the buying and\r\nselling of vessels is common practice. In this highly competitive market the\r\nadoption of norms should not lead to a competitive disadvantage for the EU-based\r\nseller of a vessel.\nDepending on each particular Directive, it could\r\nbe necessary to put in place special arrangements concerning the eligibility as\r\nworkers\u2019 representative or the application of general rules to the sale of a\r\nvessel.\nThe ranking of the policy options was made\r\nautonomously for each Directive, since the best approach could differ from one\r\nDirective to another. Indeed, the preferred option for this initiative would be\r\na combination of the four different policy options, depending on the individual\r\nDirective:\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 3 (suppression of the exclusions)\r\nfor the Insolvency Directive;\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 3 (suppression of the exclusions)\r\nfor the European Works Council Directive;\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 2 (equivalent level of protection)\r\nfor the Information and Consultation Directive;\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 4 (specific provisions) for the\r\nCollective Redundancies Directive;\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 4 (specific provisions) for the Transfer\r\nof Undertakings Directive;\n\u00b7              \r\nPolicy option 1 (no action) for the Posting of\r\nWorkers Directive.\nThis proposal is in line with the\r\nconclusions of the Impact Assessment report in terms of the ranking of the\r\npolicy options.\nThe impact of this initiative on SMEs,\r\nessentially small and micro-enterprises, is reduced because most of the\r\nDirectives already exclude small and micro-enterprises.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis proposal introduces amendments to five\r\nDirectives in force. In particular, it recognises an unconditional right to\r\ninformation and consultation of seagoing workers in all Directives which\r\npreviously allowed for exceptions and derogations from this right (European\r\nWorks Councils Directive, Information and Consultation Directive, Collective\r\nRedundancies Directive, Transfer of Undertakings Directive).\nProcedures for information and consultation\r\nof workers contribute to improving corporate governance and to reducing the\r\nnegative consequences of sudden restructuring. Companies will benefit from better\r\ncommunication of information regarding company strategy and the rationale for\r\ncertain decisions to employees, particularly in times of change, with no\r\nsubstantial costs to the employer.\nIt also recognises other rights, taking\r\ninto account the specificity of the sector (suppression in some specific cases\r\nof cooling-off periods in the Collective Redundancies Directive or of the\r\ntransfer of the employment contract/relationship in the Transfer of\r\nUndertakings Directive).\nIn view of the type of amendments, its\r\nsectoral nature and the principle of procedural economy, it is preferable to\r\namend the Directives by means of a single Directive.\nLegal basis\nThis proposal introduces amendments to five\r\nexisting Directives: Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC\r\nand 2001/23/EC. Three of these Directives were adopted with Article 153 TFEU\r\n(former Article 137 EC) as legal basis: 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC and 2008/94/EC.\r\nThe legal bases of Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC were respectively\r\nArticles 100 EC and 94 EC, i.e., equivalent to the current Article 115 TFEU.\nDespite the different legal bases of the Directives\r\nto be amended, having regard to their content, it is clear that they all serve\r\nto support and complement Member States' activities in the fields enumerated in\r\nArticle 153(1) TFEU, in order to further the social policy objectives of the\r\nUnion.\nArticle 153(2) TFEU is therefore the\r\nadequate legal basis for a single proposal amending the abovementioned five\r\nDirectives.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThis exercise concerns the review of five\r\nDirectives. As such, this can only be done at the level of the EU, by a\r\nDirective or a series of Directives amending the existing acts.\nThis initiative covers a sector subject to\r\nstrong international competition, with a large proportion of the workforce\r\nemployed on vessels of one Member State and coming from other Member States or\r\nthird countries. Therefore the policy options chosen were considered carefully\r\nagainst the impact on the sector in terms of competitiveness and costs.\nGiven that the present legal situation\r\ngives rise to unequal treatment of the same category of workers by different\r\nMember States, according to whether or not those Member States apply the\r\nexemptions and derogations allowed by present legislation, an EU initiative\r\nwould ensure a greater level playing field, at least at the level of vessels\r\nflying the flag of a Member State.\nThe solution proposed seeks to avoid\r\nimposing excessive costs and is based on a careful analysis of proportionality.\nChoice of instrument\nThe instrument chosen is a Directive. No\r\nother instrument would have been suitable. The aim is to amend five Directives\r\nin force and this can only be done through a Directive.\nDetailed explanation of the provisions\r\nof the proposal\nThe choice of policy option implemented by\r\nprovisions described below is in line with conclusions of the impact assessment[19] carried out by the Commission\r\nregarding each one of the Directives (as described above in Section 2.2).\nArticle 1\nThis Article provides for the deletion of\r\nArticle 1(3), point (b) of Directive 2008/94/EC. This will suppress the\r\npossibility of excluding share-fishermen from the scope of the Insolvency\r\nDirective.\nArticle 2\nArticle 2 suppresses Article 1(7) of Directive 2009/38/EC. Merchant\r\nnavy crews will therefore be covered by the provisions of the European Works\r\nCouncil Directive.\nArticle 3\nThis Article amends Article 3(3) of\r\nDirective 2002/14/EC in order to clarify that Member States are able to\r\nderogate from the general provisions of the Directive only where an equivalent\r\nlevel of protection and effective exercise by the employees concerned is\r\nensured.\nArticle 4\nThis Article introduces four amendments to\r\nDirective 98/59/EC.\nThe first amendment inserts the definition\r\nof \u2018transfer\u2019, by reference to Directive 2001/23/EC.\nThe second amendment deletes Article\r\n1(2)(c), thus putting the crews of seagoing vessels within the scope of the\r\nCollective Redundancies Directive.\nThe third amendment clarifies that the\r\nnotification provided for by Article 3(1) of the Directive should always be\r\nmade to the competent authority of the State of the flag. This clarification is\r\nnecessary because of the potential coexistence of employment contracts under\r\ndifferent national laws.\nThe fourth amendment inserts a new\r\nprovision stating that Member States may grant the competent public authority\r\nthe right to derogate, in part of in full, from the provisions on the \u2018cooling-off\u2019\r\nperiod when the envisaged collective redundancy is carried out as a consequence\r\nof a transfer, having as its object exclusively one vessel or more vessels, or\r\nwhen the employer only operates one vessel. If Member States would like to make\r\nuse of this derogation, they have to consult social partners when transposing\r\nthis provision into their legislation. This amendment takes into account the\r\ncharacteristics of the maritime sector. Applying the \u2018cooling off\u2019 period in the\r\nhighly competitive market for the buying and selling of vessels would put the\r\nEU seller at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore it provides for mitigating\r\nmeasures for companies operating only one vessel. \nIt should be underlined that in the case of\r\na sale consisting exclusively of one vessel or more, or in the case of an\r\nemployer operating one vessel, the information and consultation obligation laid\r\ndown in Article 2 continues to apply.\nThe Directive remains fully applicable in\r\nall other circumstances where the collective dismissal of members of the crew\r\nof a vessel is envisaged.\nArticle 5\nCurrent Article 1(3) of Directive 2001/23/EC\r\nis repealed. The Directive is made fully applicable to seagoing vessels\r\nregistered in and/or flying the flag of a Member State, wherever they are\r\nsituated. However, taking into account the specific characteristics of the maritime\r\nsector, Member States may, after consultation of social partners, derogate from\r\nthe provisions of Chapter II of the Directive in the case of transfers\r\nconcerning exclusively one seagoing vessel or a number of seagoing vessels, or\r\nthe undertaking or business being transferred only operates one seagoing\r\nvessel. Consequently, in case of transfers concerning vessels exclusively or in\r\nthe case of the undertaking only operating one vessel, at least the provisions\r\nof the Directive concerning information and consultation shall apply.\nVessels are fully covered by the scope of\r\nthe Directive when they constitute one of the assets being transferred.\nArticle 6\nArticle 6 contains a non-regression clause.\r\nIt aims at safeguarding the rights of workers covered\r\nby the scope of the proposal as recognised by the Member States before its\r\nentry into force.\nArticle 7\nArticle 7 contains a review clause. The objective of the review is to monitor the implementation and\r\napplication of Articles 4 and 5 of the Directive in the Member States, in\r\nparticular on two issues: the phenomenon of flagging out and the level of\r\nemployment of EU seafarers. \nArticles 8 \nIn order to take into account the\r\ndifferences between Member States regarding the nature of the maritime sector\r\nand the extent to which seafarers are included in the scope of national labour\r\nlegislation, article 8 provides for a transition period of 5 years.\nArticle 9 and 10\nThese are standard provisions concerning entry\r\ninto force and addressees of the Directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal has no implications for the\r\nbudget of the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nCorrelation table\nThe Member States are required to\r\ncommunicate to the Commission the text of national provisions transposing the\r\nDirective but they are not requested to provide a correlation table.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\r\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0390 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non seafarers amending Directives\r\n2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC\n(with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[20],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee\r\nof the Regions[21],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 153 of the Treaty\r\non the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the European Parliament and\r\nthe Council may, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, adopt,\r\nby means of directives, minimum requirements for gradual implementation aiming\r\nat improving working conditions, the protection of workers where their\r\nemployment contract is terminated, information and consultation of workers and\r\nthe working environment to protect workers\u2019 health and safety. Such directives\r\nmust avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way that\r\nwould hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized\r\nundertakings.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/94/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on the protection\r\nof employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer[22], Directive 2009/38/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the establishment of a\r\nEuropean Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and\r\nCommunity-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and\r\nconsulting employees[23],\r\nDirective 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March\r\n2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in\r\nthe European Community[24],\r\nCouncil Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of\r\nthe Member States relating to collective redundancies[25] and Council Directive 2001/23/EC\r\nof 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating\r\nto the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of\r\nundertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses[26], either exclude seagoing\r\nworkers from their scope or allow the Member States to exclude them.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insofar the existence and/or\r\npossibility of introducing exclusions is not justified on objective grounds,\r\nthey should be suppressed.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to information and\r\nconsultation within the undertaking (Article 27) and the right to fair and just\r\nworking conditions (Article 31), as referred to in Article 6 of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union. This Directive has to be implemented in accordance with those\r\nrights and principles. However, the\r\nexistence and/or possibility of introducing exclusions may prevent or limit the\r\npossibility for seagoing workers to fully enjoy their right to information and\r\nconsultation, and the right to working conditions which respect workers'\r\nhealth, safety and dignity, both of which are enshrined by the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present legal\r\nsituation gives rise to unequal treatment of the same category of workers by\r\ndifferent Member States, according to whether they apply or not the exemptions\r\nand derogations allowed by present legislation. An important number of the Member\r\nStates have made limited use of the exclusions. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 10 October 2007 the\r\nCommission presented its vision for an Integrated Maritime Policy for the\r\nEuropean Union, the \u2018Blue Book\u2019[27].\r\nThis vision recognises that all matters relating to Europe\u2019s oceans and seas\r\nare interlinked, and that sea-related policies must develop in a joined-up way\r\nif they are to reap the desired results.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Blue Book[28] stressed the need for an\r\nincrease in the number and quality of maritime jobs for European citizens and\r\nthe importance of improving working conditions on board.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n154(2) TFEU, the Commission has consulted the social partners at the European\r\nlevel on the possible direction of Union action in this field.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the technological\r\ndevelopments of recent years notably as regards communications technology, the\r\ninformation and consultation requirements should be updated. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rights of seafarers covered\r\nby this Directive, recognised by the Member States in the national legislation\r\nimplementing Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and/or\r\n2001/23/EC should be respected.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive contributes\r\nto achieving the objectives under Article 151 TFEU.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore appropriate\r\nto amend the labour law Directives which exclude seafarers from their scope or\r\nallow for derogations which are not justified by objective reasons.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved\r\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle\r\nof subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
