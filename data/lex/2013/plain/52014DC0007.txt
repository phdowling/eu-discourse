It was based on the 7 applications submitted further\r\nto the Council Presidency's call in July 2013 for applications to provisionally\r\nhost the European Police College until a long-term solution for the future of\r\nthe Agency is found.\nThe Member\r\nStates submitting candidatures were Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, Hungary, The Netherlands and Finland. Finland subsequently withdrew its application.\nThe political\r\nagreement was confirmed at the JHA Council meeting on the same day, 8 October. \nHowever, first\r\nof all, the Commission notes that the draft Regulation amending the CEPOL\r\nDecision does not refer to the provisional relocation of the seat of CEPOL and\r\ntherefore it does not implement the abovementioned political agreement, but\r\ngoes much further. \nIn that regard,\r\nthe Member States' initiative is in direct opposition to the Commission's\r\nproposal for the Europol Regulation, including the merger of CEPOL into\r\nEuropol, which has been and remains on the table since 27 March 2013.\nThe Commission's\r\nproposal is driven by the aim of addressing, in a comprehensive manner, ways to\r\nimprove effectiveness in police cooperation and training. It is designed to achieve\r\nfunctional synergies and cost savings, in line with the overall goal of the proposed\r\nreform and in accordance with the recommendations set out in the Common\r\nApproach on decentralised agencies, endorsed by the three institutions. This is\r\nwhy the issue of CEPOL's seat should not be considered in isolation from this\r\nbroader context of a functional and operational reform that would match the\r\ngoals of rationalisation and operational improvement for both agencies.\nIn the same\r\ncontext, the Commission notes that the impact assessment attached to the\r\ninitiative consists only of the elaboration of costs and benefits of one single\r\nsolution, i.e. the relocation of CEPOL to Budapest, without taking into account\r\nand comparing it to the costs savings resulting from the proposed merger by the\r\nCommission of CEPOL into Europol or other alternative solutions. \nThe Commission further\r\nnotes the adverse budgetary effects of a double move and notes that the necessary\r\nadditional funding would need to come from the existing budget envelope, which\r\nmeans that those funds could not be used for other purposes.\nConclusion\nThe Commission therefore\r\ngives a negative opinion to the Member States' initiative. \nFurthermore,\r\nthe Commission invites the European Parliament and the Council to avoid any\r\nadverse budgetary effects of a solution that would not achieve functional synergies\r\nand cost savings and would not be in line with the recommendations set out in\r\nthe Common Approach on decentralised agencies endorsed by the 3 institutions. \nShould this Initiative\r\nbe pursued, the Commission would be obliged to make a Declaration, at the time\r\nof its adoption, on the provisional nature of this Regulation, its adverse\r\nbudgetary effects and the necessity of not prejudging the outcome of\r\ndiscussions on the Commission's own Proposal. In that regard, the Commission encourages\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council to build on the constructive progress\r\nthat is being made on its proposal to reform Europol\u2019s legal framework while\r\nreflecting on an alternative solution to co-locate CEPOL and Europol that would\r\nmatch the goals of rationalisation and operational improvement for both\r\nagencies.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
