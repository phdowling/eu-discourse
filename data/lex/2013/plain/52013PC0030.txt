Furthermore, the Commission Communication on Action for Stability, Growth and Jobs adopted on 30 May 2012\n2\n stresses the importance of a further reduction in the regulatory burden and barriers to entry in the rail sector, making country-specific recommendations in that direction. In the same vein, on 6 June 2012 the Commission adopted the Communication on strengthening the governance of the single market, which likewise stresses the importance of the transport sector\n3\n.\n\n\nIn the last decade, the EU railway market has seen massive changes, gradually introduced by three legislative \u2018railway packages\u2019 (with some accompanying acts) intended to open up national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high levels of safety. However, despite the considerable development of the \u2018EU acquis\u2019 establishing an internal market for rail transport services, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport remains modest. Thus, the Commission has planned to come forward with the fourth railway package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This Directive is a component of the fourth railway package, focusing on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers, in particular by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs and accelerating administrative procedures; and by avoiding disguised discrimination.\n\n\n1.2.Legal framework for interoperability\n\n\nUnder the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Articles 170 and 171), the Union must contribute to the establishment and development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport. In order to achieve these objectives, the Union must take any measures necessary to ensure the interoperability of the networks, particularly in the field of technical standardisation.\n\n\nThe initial measures taken in the rail sector were Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive 2001/16/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system, amended by Directive 2004/50/EC. These Directives were recast by Directive 2008/57/EC on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community, which is currently in force as amended by Directive 2009/131/EC and Directive 2011/18/EU.\n\n\n1.3.Why recast interoperability Directive 2008/57/EC as amended?\n\n\nSeveral lessons have been learned based on the work done on developing TSIs, the application of the interoperability Directives to specific projects, the work of the Committee set up under Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC and feedback from stakeholders. Furthermore, the legislative context for the marketing of products has evolved in recent years, with the result that the interoperability legislation needs to be updated.\n\n\nOn this basis, the Commission intends to propose a number of changes to Directive 2008/57/EC, which can be grouped into three different categories:\n\n\n\uf0b7new provisions: a number of new definitions, the concept of a vehicle authorisation for placing on the market, and some provisions on registers;\n\n\n\uf0b7clarification of existing provisions: scope of the Directive, application of TSI to existing systems, TSI derogations, TSI deficiencies and applicability of national rules;\n\n\n\uf0b7updates due to the evolution of the legislative framework: provisions concerning conformity assessment and conformity assessment bodies, as well as references to comitology procedures and delegated acts;\n\n\n\uf0b7editorial changes: consolidation of previous amendments to the text of the Directive, renumbering of articles and annexes, references to other components of the fourth railway package, targeted rewording of a few sentences to avoid translation ambiguities.\n\n\n2.RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\nThe European Commission carried out a thorough impact assessment to support legislative proposals for improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the Single European Railway Area in the field of interoperability and safety.\n\n\nAn Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG) was created in June 2011. While all DGs were invited by DG MOVE to participate, the DGs most concerned were ENTR, EMPL, SG, SJ, HR, RTD, BUDG, REGIO, ENER and ELARG.\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission departments have discussed developments in the Single European Railway Area with sector representatives on an ongoing basis. In 2010-2011 they also conducted an ex-post evaluation of Regulation 881/2004 establishing the European Railway Agency.\n\n\nTo support the Commission in the impact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an impact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of stakeholders.\n\n\nThe targeted consultation of interested parties started on 18 November 2011 with an internet survey which finished on 30 December 2011. It was followed by interviews with major stakeholders and a stakeholder workshop at the end of February 2012.\n\n\nSince then, DG MOVE has taken part in bilateral meetings with the sector to gauge their views on what should be done in the fourth railway package with respect to interoperability and safety.\n\n\nGiven the technical nature of the initiative, there was no public consultation. However, the Commission made sure that all interested parties were consulted at the appropriate time and that the discussions covered all the key elements of the initiative.\n\n\nMore information on the impact assessment and the results of the stakeholder consultation is provided in the Commission staff working document accompanying legislative proposals to eliminate remaining administrative and technical barriers in the field of interoperability and safety on the EU railway market.\n\n\n3.LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\n\nThis section provides comments and explanations relating to significant changes in the text of the Directive. It does not provide detailed comments on minor changes introduced as a consequence of the Lisbon Treaty, editorial modifications and other obvious amendments.\n\n\nThe numbering corresponds to the renumbered articles and annexes, unless preceded by \u2018ex\u2019, in which case it refers to the numbering as it is in Directive 2008/57/EC.\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe Commission services, together with the committee referred to in Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC, had already addressed in February 2009 the clarification of the scope of the Directive as far as lines and vehicles used for local, urban and suburban services were concerned. The conclusion of this analysis was a three-fold approach: i) exclusion of urban rail and clarification of the scope; ii)\u00a0development of a dedicated urban rail European voluntary standardisation framework; and iii) development of essential requirements for urban transport.\n\n\nThe first action was initiated in October 2009, when the Commission services invited Member States to exclude from the scope of the measures transposing Directive 2008/57/EC cases (a) and (b) as defined in its Article 1(3). This was to avoid a situation in which a Member State might apply the Directive to de facto cases not covered by the TSIs. Such a situation would in fact imply that Member States notify all national rules in use for metro, tram and light rail systems in the absence of TSIs and follow for these systems all the procedures set out by the Directive for heavy rail, which would amount to a disproportionate administrative, technical and legal burden. To avoid this situation, the proposed amendment formalises in paragraph 3 the indication already given by the Commission services in October 2009, thus completing the first action.\n\n\nThe second action was formally initiated in February 2011, when the Commission issued a mandate addressed to the European standardisation bodies to develop voluntary standards in urban rail.\n\n\nTo contribute to the abovementioned third action, in October 2011 the associations representing the urban rail sector issued a set of \u2018fundamental requirements\u2019, which are being used as basic references for the execution of the urban rail standardisation programme proposed by CEN/CENELEC and ETSI in October 2011.\n\n\nOn this basis, interoperability for local, urban and suburban systems is considered to be adequately addressed in the voluntary field and does not need to be covered by this Directive.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nFor the sake of clarity, and to take account of the evolution of the legal framework, some definitions have been reworded or added.\n\n\nEx Article 3\n\n\nIt has been deleted because redundant with Article 1.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nNo substantial change.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nArticle 4\n\n\nFurther provisions are to be specified in the TSIs to cover existing subsystems and to enable railway undertakings to check compatibility between vehicles and routes on which these vehicles are intended to be operated.\n\n\nArticle 5\n\n\nNo substantial change, apart from those required by the Lisbon Treaty.\n\n\nArticle 6\n\n\nThis clarifies the use of Agency opinions pending the amendment of TSIs as a result of deficiencies discovered.\n\n\nEx Article 7\n\n\nThis article has been deleted because it has become obsolete. In fact, the TSIs will have been extended by the time this Directive enters into force.\n\n\nArticle 7\n\n\nThe cases of possible non-application of TSIs have been reduced because case 1(b) of Article 9 of the current Directive is unclear, has never been used and could be covered, as in cases 1(c) and 1(f), by specific cases in TSIs.\n\n\nArticles 8, 9 and 10\n\n\nNo substantial change, apart from those required by the Lisbon Treaty.\n\n\nEx Article 12\n\n\nDeleted because covered by Directive 1025/2012/EU.\n\n\nArticle 11\n\n\nNo substantial change.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n\n\nEx Article 15\n\n\nIts provisions are transferred to articles in Chapter V.\n\n\nArticle 12\n\n\nNo substantial change.\n\n\nArticles 13 and 14\n\n\nThese articles have been reworded for consistency with the revised text of this Directive and for consistency with the Agency Regulation and the Safety Directive. They clarify the role of national rules, the cases in which national rules may be introduced, and the procedures for their withdrawal and their publication.\n\n\nThe Agency retains its tasks concerning the classification of national rules (ex Article 27); in addition, the Agency shall examine notified national rules and invite Member States to repeal them in case of redundancy or incompatibility with the EU legislation.\n\n\nArticle 15\n\n\nIt clarifies the circumstances which trigger a new EC declaration of verification.\n\n\nArticle 16\n\n\nNo substantial change.\n\n\nArticle 17\n\n\nIt recalls the general principle of presumption of conformity set out in Directive 1025/2012/EU.\n\n\nEx Article 20\n\n\nSome of the content has been clarified and transferred to Chapter V. The remaining content is already covered by Article 7 (non-application of TSIs).\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nEx Articles 21 to 25 have been deleted and replaced with new articles 18 to 20.\n\n\nArticle 18\n\n\nFor fixed installations the procedure is practically identical to that of Directive 2008/57, except for trackside control-command and signalling subsystems, which will be authorised by the Agency for consistency with the corresponding on-board subsystems.\n\n\nArticle 19\n\n\n\n\nIt addresses the placing on the market of mobile subsystems, which can be done by both railway undertakings and manufacturers. In practice, mobile subsystems are not placed in service individually; their placing in service is done when they are integrated in a vehicle, and the placing in service of a vehicle is addressed in Article 21.\n\n\nArticle 20\n\n\nIt introduces the notion of vehicle authorisation for placing on the market, which is partially replacing the concept of vehicle authorisation for placing in service issued by the national safety authority as set out in Directive 2008/57/EC.\n\n\nThe vehicle authorisation for placing on the market is issued by the Agency and contains all information needed later by the railway undertaking to place a vehicle in commercial service. The applicant (railway undertaking, manufacturer, etc.) may ask the Agency to complement the vehicle authorisation for placing on the market with a statement concerning the technical compatibility of the vehicle with a particular set of lines or networks defined by the applicant on the basis of commercial and/or technical considerations. This complementary statement will facilitate the railway undertaking in its task of placing the vehicle in service.\n\n\nArticle 21\n\n\nIt clarifies the role of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in checking the technical compatibility of the vehicle with the route and the safe integration of the vehicle in the system in which it is intended to operate.\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nIt concerns the authorisation for placing on the market for types of vehicles and has been amended to reflect the provisions of Articles 18 to 21.\n\n\nex Article 27\n\n\nIt has been deleted because some of its provisions have been transferred to the Agency Regulation.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nArticles 23 to 41 concerning conformity assessment bodies replace and complement ex Article 28 and ex Annex VIII to include the provisions of the new legislative framework for the marketing of products as defined in Decision 768/2008/EC.\n\n\nEx Article 31\n\n\nThis article has been deleted because it is obsolete.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nArticles 42 to 45 on EVN and registers have been updated to reflect the provisions of Chapter\u00a0V.\n\n\nEx Article 36\n\n\nThis article has been deleted because it is obsolete.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nArticles 46 and 47\n\n\n\n\nThese articles concern the delegation of powers to the Commission under the Lisbon Treaty.\n\n\nArticle 48\n\n\nIt has been modified to take into account the new comitology procedures.\n\n\nEx Article 30\n\n\nThis article has been deleted because it is obsolete.\n\n\nArticles 49 and 50\n\n\nThese articles have been updated for consistency with the text of this Directive.\n\n\nArticle 51\n\n\nIt includes the new provisions with respect to the transitional regime for placing in service of vehicles. This will enable the parallel application of both regimes (Directive 2008/57/EC and this Directive) for a limited period.\n\n\nArticle 52\n\n\nAs a consequence of the Lisbon Treaty, a number of Annexes to Directive 2008/57/EC are transformed into implementing acts to be adopted by the Commission. This article sets out the provisions to be applied until the date of application of those implementing acts.\n\n\nArticles 53\n\n\nIt provides for correspondence tables to be communicated by Member States when transposing this Directive into national legislation. These tables are needed because of the substantial changes introduced by this Directive in Chapters V and VI and are considered necessary to enable all actors to easily identify the national legislation applicable.\n\n\nArticle 54\n\n\nNew article concerning the role of Agency opinions and recommendations.\n\n\nArticles 55 to 57\n\n\nThey have been updated for consistency with the text of this Directive.\n\n\nAnnex I\n\n\nThere is no longer any mention of the trans-European rail system because the TSIs will have been extended de facto by the time this Directive enters into force.\n\n\nThe separation between high-speed (HS) and conventional rail (CR) has also been removed in view of the merging of a number of HS and CR TSIs.\n\n\n\n\nTaking account of the above, the classification of vehicles has been simplified.\n\n\nAnnexes II and III\n\n\nNo substantial change.\n\n\nEx Annex IV\n\n\nIt is transformed into an implementing act, see Article 8(2).\n\n\nEx Annexes V and VI\n\n\nThey are transformed into implementing acts, see Article 15(7).\n\n\nEx Annex VII\n\n\nIt is transformed into an implementing act, see Article 14(8).\n\n\nEx Annex VIII\n\n\nThis article has been deleted because it is included in Articles 27, 28 and 29.\n\n\nEx Annex IX\n\n\nIt is transformed into an implementing act, see Article 7(3).\n\n\nAnnexes IV and V\n\n\nThey have been updated for consistency with the text of this Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC (adapted)\n\n\n2013/0015 (COD)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\n\n\n\non the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union\u00a0\n\n\n(Recast)\n\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u00a0establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 71 and 156\u00a0\u00d6\u00a091(1), 170 and 171\u00a0\u00d5 thereof,\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\u00a0European Commission,\n\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\n4\n,\n\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions\n5\n,\n\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\u00a0\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 1 (adapted)\n\n\nCouncil Directive 96/48/EC of 23\u00a0July 1996on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system\n6\n and Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19\u00a0March 2001 on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system\n7\n were substantially amended by Directive 2004/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n8\n. As new amendments are now being introduced, it is appropriate to recast the Directives for the sake of clarity and merge their provisions together into a single instrument with a view to simplification.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(1)Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the rail system\u00a0within the Community\n9\n\u00a0has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 2 (adapted)\n\n\n(2)In order to enable citizens of the Union, economic operators and regional and local authorities to benefit to the full from the advantages deriving from the establishing of an area without internal frontiers, it is appropriate, in particular, to improve the interlinking and interoperability of the national rail networks as well as access thereto, implementing any measures that may prove necessary in the field of technical standardisation, as provided for in Article 155 of the Treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(3)The pursuit of interoperability within the Union's rail system should lead to the definition of an optimal level of technical harmonisation and make it possible to facilitate, improve and develop international rail transport services within the Union and with third countries and contribute to the progressive creation of the internal market in equipment and services for the construction, renewal, upgrading and operation of the rail system within the Union.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 3 (adapted)\n\n\nBy signing the Protocol adopted in Kyoto on 12\u00a0December 1997 the European Union has undertaken to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. These objectives require an adjustment to the balance between the various modes of transport, and consequently an increase in the competitiveness of rail transport.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 43 (adapted)\n\n\nThe\u00a0Community strategy for the integration of environmental and sustainable development concerns into its transport policy highlights the need to act to reduce the environmental impact of transport.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 5\n\n\n(4)The commercial operation of trains throughout the rail network requires in particular excellent compatibility between the characteristics of the infrastructure and those of the vehicles, as well as efficient interconnection of the information and communication systems of the different infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Performance levels, safety, quality of service and cost depend upon such compatibility and interconnection, as does, in particular, the interoperability of the rail system.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 6 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(5)Member States are responsible\u00a0\u00f0\u00a0The railway regulatory framework should set clear responsibilities\u00a0\u00ef for ensuring compliance with the safety, health and consumer protection rules applying to the railway networks in general during the design, construction, putting into service and operation of those railways.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 7 (adapted)\n\n\n(6)There are major differences between the national regulations,\u00a0and between internal rules and technical specifications which the railways apply\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0applicable to rail systems, subsystems and components\u00a0\u00d5 , since they incorporate techniques that are specific to the national industries and prescribe specific dimensions and devices and special characteristics. This situation prevents trains from being able to run without hindrance throughout the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 8 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(7)Over the years, this situation has created very close links between the national railway industries and the national railways, to the detriment of the\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d5 genuine opening-up of markets \u00f0\u00a0allowing new entrants to emerge\u00a0\u00ef. In order to enhance their competitiveness at world level, these industries require an open, competitive European market.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 9 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(8)It is therefore appropriate to define basic essential requirements \u00f0\u00a0related to rail interoperability\u00a0\u00ef for the whole of the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 which will\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 apply to its rail system.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 10\n\n\nTo achieve these objectives an initial measure was taken by the Council on 23\u00a0July 1996 with the adoption of Directive 96/48/EC. The European Parliament and the Council subsequently adopted Directive 2001/16/EC.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 11\n\n\nThe entry into force of Directives 2001/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0February 2001 amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways\n10\n, 2001/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0February 2001 amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings\n11\n\u00a0and 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification\n12\n has had an impact on the implementation of interoperability. As in the case of other transport modes, the extension of access rights must be accompanied by the requisite harmonisation measures. It is therefore necessary to implement interoperability on the whole network by extending progressively the geographical scope of Directive 2001/16/EC. It is also necessary to extend the legal basis of Directive 2001/16/EC to Article\u00a071 of the Treaty, on which Directive 2001/12/EC is founded.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 12 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(9)The development of technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) has shown the need to clarify the relationship between the essential requirements and the TSIs on the one hand, and the European standards and other documents of a normative nature on the other. In particular, a clear distinction should be drawn between the standards or parts of standards which must\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be made mandatory in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive, and the \"harmonised standards\" that have been developed \u00f0\u00a0in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n13\n\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0in the spirit of the new approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation. \u00f0\u00a0Where strictly necessary, the TSIs may make an explicit reference to European standards or specifications, which become mandatory from the moment the TSI is applicable.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(10)In order to genuinely increase the competitiveness of the Union railway sector without distorting competition between key actors of the rail system, the TSIs, should be drafted by respecting the principles of openness, consensus and transparency as defined in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n\n\n\n(11)The quality of rail services in the Union depends, inter alia, on excellent compatibility between the characteristics of the network in the broadest sense, including the fixed parts of all the subsystems concerned and those of the vehicles including the onboard components of all the subsystems concerned. Performance levels, safety, quality of service and cost depend upon that compatibility.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 13\n\n\nAs a rule, European specifications are developed in the spirit of the new approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation. They enable a presumption to be made of conformity with certain essential requirements of this Directive, particularly in the case of interoperability constituents and interfaces. These European specifications, or the applicable parts thereof, are not mandatory and no explicit reference to these specifications may be made in the TSIs. References to these European specifications are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and Member States publish the references to the national standards transposing the European standards.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 14\n\n\nTSIs may in certain cases make an explicit reference to European standards or specifications where this is strictly necessary in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive. Such explicit reference has consequences which must be made clear; in particular, these European standards or specifications become mandatory from the moment the TSI is applicable.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 15 (adapted)\n\n\n(12)A TSI sets all the conditions with which an interoperability constituent\u00a0must\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 conform, and the procedure to be followed in assessing conformity. In addition, it is necessary to specify that every constituent must \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 undergo the procedure for assessing conformity and suitability for the use indicated in the TSIs, and have the corresponding certificate.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 16 (adapted)\n\n\n(13)When developing new TSIs the aim should always be to ensure compatibility with the existing authorised system. This will help to promote the competitiveness of rail transport and prevent unnecessary additional costs through the requirement of upgrading or renewal of existing authorised subsystems to ensure backward compatibility. In those exceptional cases where it will not be possible to ensure compatibility, TSIs may establish the framework necessary to decide whether the existing subsystem may need to be re-authorised\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0needs a new decision or authorisation for placing in service\u00a0\u00d5 , and the corresponding deadlines.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 17 (adapted)\n\n\n(14)It is necessary for safety reasons to require Member States to assign an identification code to each vehicle placed in service. The vehicle should then be entered in a national vehicle register. The registers \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0must be open to consultation by all Member States and by certain Community economic players \u00d6\u00a0within the Union\u00a0\u00d5. The\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0national vehicle\u00a0\u00d5 registers should be consistent as regards the data format. They should therefore be covered by common operational and technical specifications.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(15)If certain technical aspects corresponding to the essential requirements cannot be explicitly covered in a TSI, such aspects which need still to be addressed are identified in an annex to the TSI as open points. For these open points, pending the completion of the TSI, national rules apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 18 (adapted)\n\n\n(16)The procedure to be followed in the case of essential requirements applicable to a subsystem which have not yet been covered by detailed specifications in the corresponding TSI should be specified. In such case, the bodies responsible for the conformity assessment and verification procedures should be the notified bodies referred to in Article\u00a017\u00a020 of Directives\u00a02008/57/EC\u00a096/48/EC and 2001/16/EC.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(17)Directive 2008/57/EC applies to the entire rail system within the Union\u00a0and the scope of the TSIs is being extended to cover also the vehicles and networks not included in the trans-European rail system. Therefore, Annex I should be simplified by removing specific references to the trans-European rail system. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 19\n\n\nThe distinction between a high-speed rail system and a conventional rail system does not warrant two separate directives. The procedures for developing TSIs are the same for both systems, as are those for the certification of the interoperability constituents and the subsystems. The essential requirements are practically identical, as is the subdivision of the system into subsystems for which technical specifications have to be prepared. Moreover, since trains have to be able to move freely from the high-speed network to the conventional network, the technical specifications for the two systems overlap to a large extent. Work on developing the TSIs has shown that, for certain subsystems, a single TSI can serve both systems. It is therefore appropriate to combine Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(18)The functional and technical specifications to be met by the subsystems and their interfaces may vary according to the use of subsystems, for example according to the categories of lines and vehicles.\n\n\n(19)In order to ensure the progressive implementation of rail interoperability within the whole Union and gradually reduce the diversity of legacy systems, the TSIs should specify the provisions to be applied in the event of renewal or upgrading of existing subsystems and may specify deadlines for achieving the target system. \n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 20\n\n\nDirective 2004/50/EC provided for the progressive extension of the scope of Directive 2001/16/EC as new TSIs were adopted or existing ones revised. When this Directive enters into force, its scope will cover conventional and high-speed European networks as defined in Decision No\u00a01692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\u00a0July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network\n14\n, and the vehicles likely to travel on those networks. The scope will be progressively extended to the whole network and all vehicles, provided that an impact assessment shows the economic benefit of so doing.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 21\n\n\n(20)In view of the gradual approach to eliminating obstacles to the interoperability of the rail system and of the time consequently required for the adoption of TSIs, steps should be taken to avoid a situation where Member States adopt new national rules or undertake projects that increase the diversity of the present system.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n\n\n(21)In order to eliminate the obstacles to interoperability, and as a consequence of extending the scope of the TSIs to the whole Union's rail system, the amount of national rules should progressively be reduced. National rules should be differentiated between rules strictly related to local requirements and rules needed to cover open points in TSIs. The second type of rules should progressively be removed as a result of closure of open points in the TSIs.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 22\n\n\n(22)The adoption of a gradual approach satisfies the special needs of the objective of the interoperability of the rail system, which is characterised by old national infrastructure and vehicles requiring heavy investment for adaptation or renewal, and particular care should be taken not to penalise rail economically vis-\u00e0-vis other modes of transport.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 23\n\n\nIn its Legislative Resolutions of 10\u00a0March 1999 on the railway package, the European Parliament asked that the progressive opening up of the rail sector go hand-in-hand with the fastest and most effective technical harmonisation measures possible.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 24\n\n\nThe Council, at its meeting on 6\u00a0October 1999, asked the Commission to propose a strategy on improving the interoperability of rail transport and reducing bottlenecks with a view to eliminating technical, administrative and economic obstacles to the interoperability of networks without delay while guaranteeing a high level of safety and training and qualifications of the staff concerned.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 26\n\n\nPursuant to Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29\u00a0July 1991 on the development of the Community's railways\n15\n, railway companies must have increased access to Member States' rail networks, which in turn requires the interoperability of infrastructure, equipment, rolling stock and systems of management and operation, including those staff qualifications and hygiene and safety conditions at work required for the operation and maintenance of the subsystems in question and for the implementation of each TSI. However, it is not the aim of this Directive, directly or indirectly, to harmonise working conditions in the rail sector.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 26 (adapted)\n\n\n(23)In view of the extent and complexity of the rail system, it has proved necessary, for practical reasons, to break it down into the following subsystems: infrastructure, \u00d6\u00a0trackside\u00a0\u00d5 control-command and signalling, \u00d6\u00a0on-board control-command and signalling,\u00a0\u00d5 energy, rolling stock, operation and traffic management, maintenance and telematics applications for passenger and freight services. For each of these subsystems the essential requirements must be specified and the technical specifications determined for the whole of the Community, particularly in respect of constituents and interfaces, in order to meet these essential requirements. The same system is broken down into fixed and mobile elements comprising, on the one hand, the network, composed of the lines, stations, terminals, and all kinds of fixed equipment needed to ensure safe and continuous operation of the system and, on the other hand, all vehicles travelling on this network. Therefore, for the purposes of this Directive, a vehicle is composed of one subsystem (rolling stock) and where applicable one or more parts of other subsystems (mainly the on-board part of the control-command and signalling subsystemand the onboard part of the energy subsystem).\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(24)The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to which the Union is a party establishes accessibility as one of its general principles and requires States Parties to take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access on an equal basis with others, including by developing, promulgating and monitoring the implementation of minimum standards and guidelines for accessibility. Accessibility is therefore an important requirement for the interoperability of the rail system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 27 (adapted)\n\n\n(25)Implementation of the provisions on the interoperability of the rail system should not create unjustified barriers in cost-benefit terms to the preservation of the existing rail network of each Member State, but must \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 endeavour to retain the objective of interoperability.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 28\n\n\n(26)TSIs also have an impact on the conditions of use of rail transport by users, and it is therefore necessary to consult these users on aspects concerning them.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 29\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(27)Each Member State concerned should be allowed not to apply certain TSIs in \u00f0\u00a0a limited number of duly substantiated situations. These situations and the procedures to be followed in case of non-application of the TSI should be clearly defined\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0special cases, provided that there are procedures to ensure that these derogations are justified.Article\u00a0155 of the Treaty requires Community activities in the field of interoperability to take account of the potential economic viability of projects.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 30\n\n\n(28)The drawing up of TSIs and their application to the rail system should not impede technological innovation, which should be directed towards improving economic performance.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 31\n\n\nAdvantage should be taken of the interoperability of the rail system, particularly in the case of freight, to bring about the conditions for greater interoperability between modes of transport.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 32 (adapted)\n\n\n(29)To comply with the appropriate provisions on procurement procedures in the rail sector and in particular Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0of 31\u00a0March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services\n16\n, the contracting entities should include technical specifications in the general documents or in the terms and conditions for each contract. To this end it is necessary to build up a \u00d6\u00a0set\u00a0of rules \u00d5\u00a0body of European specifications in order to serve as references for these technical specifications.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 33 (adapted)\n\n\n\n\n(30)An international system of standardisation capable of generating standards which are actually used by those involved in international trade and which meet the requirements of Community \u00d6\u00a0the Union\u00a0\u00d5 policy would be in the Community\u2019s \u00d6\u00a0Union\u2019s\u00a0\u00d5 interest.

These specifications should meet the essential requirements that have been harmonised at Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 level and which the rail system must satisfy.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 35\n\n\n(32)The procedures governing the assessment of conformity or of suitability of use of constituents should be based on the use of the modules covered by Council Decision 93/465/EEC\n17\n\u00a0Commission Decision 2010/713/EU of 9 November 2010 on modules for the procedures for assessment of conformity, suitability for use and EC verification to be used in the technical specifications for interoperability adopted under Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n18\n. As far as possible and in order to promote industrial development, it is appropriate to draw up the procedures involving a system of quality assurance.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 36 (adapted)\n\n\n(33)Conformity of constituents is mainly linked to their area of use in order to guarantee the interoperability of the system and not only to their free movement on the Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 market. The suitability for use of the most critical constituents as regards safety, availability or system economy should be assessed. It is therefore not necessary for a manufacturer to affix the CE marking to constituents that are subject to the provisions of this Directive. On the basis of the assessment of conformity and/or suitability for use, the manufacturer\u2019s declaration of conformity should be sufficient.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 37 (adapted)\n\n\n(34)Manufacturers are nonetheless obliged to affix the CE marking to certain components in order to certify their compliance with other Community\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0Union\u00a0\u00d5 provisions relating to them.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 38\n\n\n(35)When a TSI enters into force, a number of interoperability constituents are already on the market. A transitional period should be provided for so that these constituents can be integrated into a subsystem, even if they do not strictly conform to that TSI.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 39 (adapted)\n\n\n(36)The subsystems constituting the rail system should be subjected to a verification procedure.

Under Directive\u00a0[\u2026/\u2026]\u00a02004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on safety on the Community railways\n19\n [Railway Safety Directive]\n20\n, responsibility for meeting these requirements lies, for their respective subsystems, with the infrastructure manager or the railway undertaking. Member States can check compliance with these requirements when granting safety certificates and safety approvals pursuant to Articles\u00a010 and 11 of the Railway Safety Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 41 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n(38)As far as vehicles are concerned,\u00a0The procedure for placing in service \u00f0\u00a0of vehicles and fixed installations\u00a0\u00ef should be clarified taking into account the \u00f0\u00a0responsibilities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0definition of vehicle which is composed of one or more subsystems. In addition, as Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC deal with new and upgraded subsystems and Directive 2004/49/EC deals with in-use vehicles, all provisions regarding authorisations for placing in service of vehicles should be integrated in this Directive. Furthermore, a procedure for authorisation of vehicle types should be added. In order to facilitate this procedure and help identify vehicle types, a European register of authorised types of vehicles should be set up and maintained by the European Railway Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency).\n\n\n(39)\u00d6\u00a0In order\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0with a view to \u00d6\u00a0facilitate\u00a0\u00d5\u00a0facilitating the placing in service of vehicles and reduce administrative burdens, \u00f0\u00a0the notion of a vehicle authorisation for placing on the market valid throughout the Union should be introduced as a precondition to enable railway undertakings to place in service a vehicle. In addition, this notion is more in line with Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision 93/465/EEC\n21\n\u00a0\u00ef .\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(40)To ensure traceability of the vehicles and their history, the references of the vehicle authorisations for placing on the market should be recorded together with the other vehicle data.\n\n\n(41)The TSIs should specify the procedures for checking the compatibility between vehicles and network after the delivery of the vehicle authorisation for placing on the market and before the decision to place into service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 42\n\n\nExperience has shown that the implementation of such a procedure at national level is often complicated and subject to different national requirements that lack transparency, or even duplicate each other. Consequently, this procedure poses a major obstacle to the creation of new railway undertakings, particularly in the freight sector. Steps should therefore be taken to clarify and simplify the procedures for authorising vehicles. Firstly, the general principle that one authorisation is sufficient for the whole Community rail network should be established. Secondly, the procedure for authorising vehicles which are TSI conform should be simpler and quicker than in the case of non-TSI conform. Thirdly, the principle of mutual recognition should be applied as far as possible: when a vehicle has already been placed in service in one Member States, other Member States should not invoke national rules to impose unnecessary requirements and redundant verifications, unless these are strictly necessary for verifying the technical compatibility of the vehicle with the relevant network. To this end national rules should be classified and compared according to a check-list in order to determine to which extent national rules can be declared as equivalent in terms of requirements, performances and safety. Fourthly, the principle of legal certainty as regards the outcome of the procedure should be pursued. To this end, in the absence of a decision of a national safety authority within the prescribed time limits an applicant should be authorised to place in service a vehicle. Such an authorisation would only be possible if the vehicle has already been authorised in another Member State. In addition, it would only be possible for a railway undertaking or an infrastructure manager duly certified in accordance with Directive 2004/49/EC to use such a vehicle under their full responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(42)To help railway undertakings decide on the placing into service of a vehicle and to avoid redundant verifications and unnecessary administrative burden, national rules should also be classified to establish the equivalence between national rules of different Member States covering the same topics.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 43\n\n\n\n\nThe authorisation procedures for TSI conform and non-TSI conform vehicles are different. There may be cases where the choice of the procedure is not straightforward. Vehicles which come within the scope of TSI conform vehicles should be those vehicles where all the relevant TSIs have entered into force, including at least the TSI on rolling stock. This would mean that a significant part of the essential requirements has been laid down. For example, until such time that the conventional TSI on locomotives has entered into force, locomotives fall within scope of non-TSI conform vehicles, even though they might comply with other relevant TSIs in force at the time of their placing in service.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 44\n\n\nIf certain technical aspects corresponding to the essential requirements cannot be explicitly covered in a TSI, they are identified in an annex to the TSI as open points. When a TSI conform vehicle has already been authorised in one Member State, additional authorisations should only consider those open points that relate to technical compatibility between the vehicle and the network.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 45\n\n\nThe list of parameters to be checked in conjunction with the placing in service of non-TSI conform vehicles is a key element for the achievement of interoperability of railway systems, in particular with regard to existing vehicles. This list takes into account experience across a limited number of networks. Therefore it is necessary that the Agency review the parameters in Annex\u00a0VII and make the recommendations it considers appropriate to the Commission.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 46 (adapted)\n\n\n(43)The 'EC' verification procedure should be based on TSIs. These TSIs are subject to the provisions of Article\u00a018\u00a034 of Directive 93/38/EEC. The notified bodies responsible for examining the procedures for conformity assessment and suitability for the use of constituents, together with the procedure for the assessment of subsystems must\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 , in particular in the absence of any European specification, coordinate their decisions as closely as possible.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 47\n\n\nThe notified bodies should be structured in such a way as to meet the criteria which must apply to this type of body in all sectors of the new approach to technical harmonisation and conformity verification, especially criteria relating to independence and competence.\n\n\n\n\u00f2\u00a0new\n\n\n(44)Transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93\n22\n, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in conformity certificates, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of notified and, mutatis mutandis, the bodies designated to check the compliance with national rules. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out this evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n\n\n(45)This Directive should be limited to establishing the interoperability requirements for interoperability constituents and subsystems. In order to facilitate compliance with those requirements it is necessary to provide for presumption of conformity for interoperability constituents and subsystems which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC recital 48 (adapted)\n\n\n\u00f0\u00a0new\n\n\n\n\n(46)\u00d6\u00a0The\u00a0\u00d5 TSIs will \u00d6\u00a0should\u00a0\u00d5 be revised at regular intervals. When errors\u00a0\u00d6\u00a0deficiencies\u00a0\u00d5 are discovered \u00f0\u00a0in the TSIs, the European Union Agency for Railways\u00a0(hereinafter referred to as the Agency) should be asked to issue an opinion which, under certain conditions, might be published and used by all stakeholders (including industry and notified bodies) as an acceptable means of compliance pending the revision of the TSIs concerned.\u00a0\u00ef\u00a0an ad hoc rapid procedure should be set up in such a way that a provisional corrigendum is first agreed in the context of a committee and then published by the Agency. This will allow an earlier use of this corrigendum by all stakeholders, including industry, notified bodies and authorities, pending a formal revision of the TSI by the Commission. In order to avoid confusion with official corrigenda of the Commission, the term technical opinion will be used. This procedure is in line with the mandate adopted by the Commission in Decision of 13\u00a0July 2007 concerning a framework mandate to the European Railway Agency for the performance of certain activities under Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC.

Many entities can be identified as a keeper of a vehicle, such as the owner, a company carrying on a business with a fleet of wagons, a company leasing vehicles to a railway undertaking, a railway undertaking or an infrastructure manager using vehicles for maintaining its infrastructure. These entities have control over the vehicle with a view to its use as a means of transport by the railway undertakings and the infrastructure managers.

In particular, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State, require that alternative solutions be examined and that the assessment of the cost and benefits of these alternative solutions be set out in the report annexed to the draft TSI.\n\n\n56. On the adoption of each TSI, the date of entry into force of that TSI shall be established in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article\u00a029(4). Where different subsystems have to be placed in service simultaneously for reasons of technical compatibility, the dates of entry into force of the corresponding TSIs shall be the same.\n\n\n67. The drafting, adoption and review of the TSIs shall take account of the opinion of users, as regards the characteristics which have a direct impact on the conditions in which they use the subsystems. To that end the Agency shall consult associations and bodies representing users during the drafting and review phases of the TSIs.

These decisions shall be recorded in the national vehicle registers referred to in Article 43.\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of renewal or upgrading of existing vehicles, a new 'EC' declaration of verification shall be needed as set out in Article 15(4). In addition, a new decision taken by the railway undertaking for placing in service of these vehicles shall be required when:\n\n\n(a)the overall safety level of the subsystem concerned may be adversely affected by the works envisaged, or\n\n\n(b)it is required by the relevant TSIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC\n\n\nArticle 22\n\n\nFirst authorisation for placing in service of TSI conform vehicles\n\n\n1. This Article shall apply to vehicles which are in conformity with all the relevant TSIs which are in force at the moment of placing in service, provided that a significant part of the essential requirements is laid down in these TSIs and that the relevant TSI on rolling stock has entered into force and is applicable.\n\n\n2. The first authorisation shall be granted by a national safety authority as follows:\n\n\n(a) where all the structural subsystems of a vehicle have been authorised in conformity with the provisions of Chapter\u00a0IV, the authorisation shall be granted without further checks;\n\n\n(b) in the case of vehicles bearing all necessary 'EC' declarations of verification as provided for in Article\u00a018, the criteria which a national safety authority may check with a view to granting an authorisation for placing in service may concern only:\n\n\n\u2013technical compatibility between the vehicle\u2019s relevant subsystems and their safe integration in accordance with Article\u00a015(1),\n\n\n\u2013technical compatibility between the vehicle and the network concerned,\n\n\n\u2013national rules applicable to the open points,\n\n\n\u2013national rules applicable to the specific cases duly identified in the relevant TSIs.\n\n\nArticle 23\n\n\nAdditional authorisations for placing in service of TSI conform vehicles\n\n\n1. Vehicles in complete conformity with TSIs covering all aspects of the relevant subsystems without specific cases and without open points strictly related to technical compatibility between vehicle and network, shall not be subject to any additional authorisation for placing in service as long as they run on TSI conform networks in the other Member States or under the conditions specified in the corresponding TSIs.\n\n\n2. In the case of vehicles placed in service in accordance with Article\u00a022 but not covered by paragraph\u00a01, Member States shall decide if additional authorisations are necessary on their territory. In this case, paragraphs\u00a03 to 7 shall apply.\n\n\n3. The applicant shall submit to the national safety authority a file on the vehicle or type of vehicle and the intended use thereof on the network. The file shall contain the following information:\n\n\n(a) documentary evidence that the placing in service of the vehicle has been authorised in another Member State in accordance with Article\u00a022;\n\n\n(b) a copy of the technical file as referred to in Annex\u00a0VI. This shall include, in the case of vehicles equipped with data recorders, information on the data collection procedure, permitting read out and evaluation, as long as this information is not harmonised by the corresponding TSI;\n\n\n(c) records showing the vehicle\u2019s maintenance history and, where applicable, technical modifications undertaken after the authorisation;\n\n\n\n\n(d) evidence on technical and operational characteristics that shows that the vehicle is compatible with the infrastructures and fixed installations, including climate conditions, energy supply system, control-command and signalling system, track gauge and infrastructure gauges, maximum permitted axle load and other constraints of the network.\n\n\n4. The criteria checked by a national safety authority may concern only:\n\n\n\u2013technical compatibility between the vehicle and the network concerned, including the national rules applicable to the open points needed to ensure such compatibility,\n\n\n\u2013the national rules applicable to the specific cases duly identified in the relevant TSIs.\n\n\n5. The national safety authority may request additional information to be supplied, risk analyses to be carried out in accordance with Article\u00a06(3)(a) of Directive 2004/49/EC or tests to be conducted on the network in order to verify the criteria referred to in paragraph\u00a04. However, after the adoption of the reference document referred to in Article\u00a027 of this Directive, the national safety authority may only carry out such verification on the basis of the national rules relating to Group B or C featuring in that document.\n\n\n6. The national safety authority shall define, after consultation with the applicant, the scope and content of the additional information, the risk analyses and the tests requested. The infrastructure manager, in consultation with the applicant, shall make every effort to ensure that any tests take place within three months of the applicant\u2019s request. Where appropriate, the national safety authority shall take measures to ensure that the tests take place.\n\n\n7. All applications for an authorisation to place in service submitted in accordance with this Article shall be the subject of a decision by the national safety authority, to be taken as soon as possible and not later than:\n\n\n(a) two months after submission of the file referred to in paragraph\u00a03;\n\n\n(b) where applicable, one month after provision of any additional information requested by the national safety authority;\n\n\n(c) where applicable, one month after provision of the results of any tests requested by the national safety authority.\n\n\nArticle 24\n\n\nFirst authorisation for placing in service of non-TSI conform vehicles\n\n\n1. This Article shall apply to vehicles which are not in conformity with all the relevant TSIs in force at the moment of placing in service, including vehicles subject to derogations, or where a significant part of the essential requirements is not laid down in one or more TSIs.\n\n\n2. The first authorisation shall be granted by a national safety authority as follows:\n\n\n\u2013for the technical aspects covered by a TSI, if any, the 'EC' verification procedure shall apply,\n\n\n\u2013for the other technical aspects, national rules as notified under Article\u00a017(3) of this Directive and under Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/49/EC shall apply.\n\n\nThis first authorisation shall be valid only on the network of the Member State granting it.\n\n\nArticle 25\n\n\nAdditional authorisations for placing in service of non-TSI conform vehicles\n\n\n1. In the case of vehicles that have been authorised to be placed in service in one Member State in accordance with Article\u00a021(12) or Article\u00a024, other Member States may decide in accordance with this Article whether additional authorisations to place in service are necessary on their territory.\n\n\n\n\n2. The applicant shall submit to the national safety authority a technical file on the vehicle or type of vehicle, together with details of planned use on the network. The file shall contain the following information:\n\n\n(a) documentary evidence that the placing in service of the vehicle has been authorised in another Member State together with documentation on the procedure followed in order to show that the vehicle complied with the safety requirements in force, including, where applicable, information on derogations enjoyed or granted in accordance with Article\u00a09;\n\n\n(b) the technical data, the maintenance programme and the operational characteristics.

It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.\n\n\n2. In the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of notification, or where the notified conformity assessment body has ceased its activity, the notifying Member State shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that body are either processed by another notified conformity assessment body or kept available for the responsible notifying and market surveillance authorities at their request.\n\n\nArticle 37\n\n\nChallenge of the competence of notified bodies\n\n\n1. The Commission shall investigate all cases where it doubts, or doubt is brought to its attention, regarding the competence of a notified conformity assessment body or the continued fulfilment by a notified conformity assessment body of the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject.\n\n\n2. The notifying Member State shall provide the Commission, on request, with all information relating to the basis for the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the body concerned.\n\n\n3. The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated confidentially.\n\n\n4. Where the Commission ascertains that a notified conformity assessment body does not meet or no longer meets the requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State accordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including withdrawal of notification if necessary.\n\n\nArticle 38\n\n\nOperational obligations of notified bodies\n\n\n1. Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in the relevant TSI.\n\n\n2. Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Conformity assessment bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.\n\n\nIn so doing they shall nevertheless operate with the aim of assessing the compliance of the product with the provisions of this Directive.\n\n\n3. Where a notified conformity assessment body finds that requirements laid down in the relevant TSI or corresponding harmonised standards or technical specifications have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a conformity certificate.\n\n\n4. Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issue of a certificate, a notified conformity assessment body finds that a product no longer complies with the relevant TSI or corresponding harmonised standards or technical specifications, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n5. Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified conformity assessment body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates, as appropriate.\n\n\nArticle 39\n\n\nInformation obligation on notified bodies\n\n\n1. Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:\n\n\n(a) any refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a certificate;\n\n\n(b) any circumstances affecting the scope of and conditions for notification;\n\n\n(c) any request for information which they have received from market surveillance authorities regarding conformity assessment activities;\n\n\n(d) on request, conformity assessment activities performed within the scope of their notification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.\n\n\n2. Notified bodies shall provide the other bodies notified under this Directive carrying out similar conformity assessment activities covering the same products with relevant information on issues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results. \n\n\n3. Notified bodies shall provide to the Agency the EC certificates of verification of subsystems, the EC certificates of conformity of interoperability constituents and the EC certificates of suitability of use of interoperability constituents.\n\n\nArticle 40\n\n\nExchange of experience\n\n\nThe Commission shall provide for the organisation of exchange of experience between the Member States\u2019 national authorities responsible for notification policy.\n\n\nArticle 41\n\n\nCoordination of notified bodies\n\n\nThe Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and cooperation between bodies notified under this Directive are put in place and properly operated in the form of a sectoral group of notified bodies. The Agency shall support the activities of notified bodies in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0\u2026/\u2026 [establishing a European railway agency].\n\n\nMember States shall ensure that the bodies notified by them participate in the work of that group, directly or by means of designated representatives.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC\n\n\nCHAPTER\u00a0VII\n\n\n\n\nCOMMITTEE AND WORK PROGRAMME\n\n\nArticle 31\n\n\nWork programme\n\n\n1.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\n\nThe verification procedure for a subsystem involves checking and certifying that a subsystem:\n\n\n\u2013is designed, constructed and installed in such a way as to meet the essential requirements concerning it, and\n\n\n\u2013may be authorised to be placed in service.\n\n\n2.\u2018EC\u2019 VERIFICATION PROCEDURE\n\n\n2.1.Introduction\n\n\n\u2018EC\u2019 verification is the procedure whereby a notified body checks and certifies that the subsystem:\n\n\n\u2013complies with the relevant TSI(s),\n\n\n\u2013complies with the other regulations deriving from the Treaty.\n\n\n2.2.Parts of the subsystem and stages\n\n\n2.2.1Intermediate statement of verification (ISV)\n\n\nIf specified in the TSIs or, where appropriate, at the applicant\u2019s request, the subsystem could be divided into certain parts or checked at certain stages of the verification procedure.\n\n\nThe intermediate statement of verification (ISV) is the procedure whereby a notified body checks and certifies certain parts of the subsystem or certain stages of the verification procedure.\n\n\nEach ISV leads to the issuing of an \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificate by the notified body chosen by the applicant, which in turn, where applicable, draws up an \u2018EC\u2019 ISV declaration. The ISV certificate and ISV declaration must provide reference to the TSIs with which the conformity has been assessed.\n\n\n2.2.2Parts of the subsystem\n\n\nThe applicant may apply for an ISV for each part. And each part shall be checked at each stage as described in Section 2.2.3.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3Stages of the verification procedure\n\n\nThe subsystem, or certain parts of the subsystem, shall be checked at each of the following stages:\n\n\n\u2013overall design,\n\n\n\u2013production: construction, including, in particular, civil-engineering activities, manufacturing, constituent assembly and overall adjustment,\n\n\n\u2013final testing.\n\n\nThe applicant may apply for an ISV for the design stage (including the type tests) and for the production stage.\n\n\n2.3.Certificate of verification\n\n\n2.3.1. The notified body responsible for \u2018EC\u2019 verification assesses the design, production and final testing of the subsystem and draws up the \u2018EC\u2019 certificate of verification intended for the applicant, who in turn draws up the \u2018EC\u2019 declaration of verification. The \u2018EC\u2019 verification certificate must provide reference to the TSIs with which the conformity has been assessed.\n\n\nWhere a subsystem has not been assessed for its conformity with all relevant TSI(s) (e.g. in the case of a derogation, partial application of TSIs for upgrade or renewal, transitional period in a TSI or specific case), the \u2018EC\u2019 certificate shall give the precise reference to the TSI(s) or their parts whose conformity has not been examined by the notified body during the \u2018EC\u2019 verification procedure.\n\n\n2.3.2. Where \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificates have been issued the notified body responsible for the \u2018EC\u2019 verification of the subsystem takes these \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificates into account, and, before issuing the \u2018EC\u2019 certificate of verification, it:\n\n\n\u2013verifies that the \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificates cover correctly the relevant requirements of the TSI(s),\n\n\n\u2013checks all aspects that are not covered by the \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificate(s), and\n\n\n\u2013checks the final testing of the subsystem as a whole.\n\n\n2.4.Technical file\n\n\nThe technical file accompanying the \u2018EC\u2019 declaration of verification must contain the following:\n\n\n\u2013technical characteristics linked to the design including general and detailed drawings with respect to execution, electrical and hydraulic diagrams, control-circuit diagrams, description of data-processing and automatic systems, documentation on operation and maintenance, etc., relevant for the subsystem concerned,\n\n\n\u2013list of interoperability constituents, as referred to in Article 5(3)(d), incorporated into the subsystem,\n\n\n\u2013copies of the \u2018EC\u2019 declarations of conformity or suitability for use with which the abovementioned constituents must be provided in accordance with Article 13 of the Directive, accompanied, where appropriate, by the corresponding calculation notes and a copy of the records of the tests and examinations carried out by the notified bodies on the basis of the common technical specifications,\n\n\n\u2013where available, the \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificate(s) and, in such a case, where relevant, the \u2018EC\u2019 ISV declaration(s), that accompany the \u2018EC\u2019 certificate of verification, including the result of verification by the notified body of the certificates validity,\n\n\n\u2013\u2018EC\u2019 certificate of verification, accompanied by corresponding calculation notes and signed by the notified body responsible for the \u2018EC\u2019 verification, stating that the subsystem complies with the requirements of the relevant TSI(s) and mentioning any reservations recorded during performance of the activities and not withdrawn; the \u2018EC\u2019 certificate of verification should also be accompanied by the inspection and audit reports drawn up by the same body in connection with its task, as specified in Sections 2.5.3 and 2.5.4,\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2018EC\u2019 certificates issued in accordance with other legislation deriving from the Treaty,\n\n\n\u2013when safe integration is required pursuant Commission Regulation (EC) No 352/2009\n31\n, the applicant shall include in the technical file the assessor\u2019s report on the Common Safety Methods (CSM) on risk assessment referred to in Article 6(3) of Directive 2004/49/EC.\n\n\n2.5.Monitoring\n\n\n2.5.1. The aim of \u2018EC\u2019 monitoring is to ensure that the obligations deriving from the technical file have been met during the production of the subsystem.\n\n\n2.5.2. The notified body responsible for checking production must have permanent access to building sites, production workshops, storage areas and, where appropriate, prefabrication or testing facilities and, more generally, to all premises which it considers necessary for its task. The notified body must receive from the applicant all the documents needed for that purpose and, in particular, the implementation plans and technical documentation concerning the subsystem.\n\n\n2.5.3. The notified body responsible for checking implementation must periodically carry out audits in order to confirm compliance with the relevant TSI(s). It must provide those responsible for implementation with an audit report. Its presence may be required at certain stages of the building operations.\n\n\n2.5.4. In addition, the notified body may pay unexpected visits to the worksite or to the production workshops. At the time of such visits the notified body may conduct complete or partial audits. It must provide those responsible for implementation with an inspection report and, if appropriate, an audit report.\n\n\n2.5.5. With a view to delivering the \u2018EC\u2019 declaration of suitability for use referred to in Section 2 of Annex IV, the notified body shall be able to monitor a subsystem on which an interoperability constituent is mounted in order to assess, where required by the corresponding TSI so requires, its suitability for use in its intended railway environment.\n\n\n2.6.Submission\n\n\nThe complete file referred to in paragraph 2.4 must be lodged with the applicant in support of the \u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificate(s), if available, issued by the notified body responsible for this or in support of the certificate of verification issued by the notified body responsible for \u2018EC\u2019 verification of the subsystem. The file must be attached to the \u2018EC\u2019 declaration of verification which the applicant sends to the competent authority with which he lodges the application for authorisation for placing in service.\n\n\nA copy of the file must be kept by the applicant throughout the service life of the subsystem. It must be sent to any other Member States which so request.\n\n\n2.7.Publication\n\n\nEach notified body must periodically publish relevant information concerning:\n\n\n\u2013requests for \u2018EC\u2019 verification and ISV received,\n\n\n\u2013request for assessment of conformity and/or suitability for use of ICs,\n\n\n\u2013\u2018EC\u2019 ISV certificates issued or refused,\n\n\n\u2013\u2018EC\u2019 certificates of conformity and/or suitability for use issued or refused,\n\n\n\u2013\u2018EC\u2019 certificates of verification issued or refused.\n\n\n2.8.Language\n\n\nThe files and correspondence relating to the \u2018EC\u2019 verification procedures must be written in an EU official language of the Member State in which the applicant is established or in an EU official language accepted by the applicant.\n\n\n\n\n3. VERIFICATION PROCEDURE IN THE CASE OF NATIONAL RULES\n\n\n3.1.Introduction\n\n\nThe verification procedure in the case of national rules is the procedure whereby the body designated pursuant to Article 17(3) (the designated body) checks and certifies that the subsystem complies with the national rules notified in accordance with Article 17(3).\n\n\n3.2.Certificate of verification\n\n\nThe designated body responsible for the verification procedure in the case of national rules draws up the certificate of verification intended for the applicant.\n\n\nThe certificate shall contain a precise reference to the national rule(s) whose conformity has been examined by the designated body in the verification process, including those related to parts subject to derogation from a TSI, upgrade or renewal.\n\n\nIn the case of national rules related to the subsystems composing a vehicle, the designated body shall divide the certificate into two parts, one part including the references to those national rules strictly related to the technical compatibility between the vehicle and the network concerned, and the other part for all other national rules.\n\n\n3.3.Technical file\n\n\nThe technical file accompanying the certificate of verification in the case of national rules must be included in the technical file referred to in point 2.4 and shall contain the technical data relevant for the assessment of the conformity of the sub-system with the national rules.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC\n\n\nANNEX VII\n\n\nPARAMETERS TO BE CHECKED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLACING IN SERVICE OF NON-TSI CONFORM VEHICLES AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE NATIONAL RULES\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02009/131/EC Art. 1 and Annex \n\n\n1.

Classification of the rules\n\n\nThe national rules relating to the parameters identified in section 1 shall be attributed to one of the following three groups. Rules and restrictions of a strictly local nature are not involved; their verification involves checks to be put in place by mutual agreement between the railway undertakings and the infrastructure managers.\n\n\nGroup A\n\n\nGroup A covers:\n\n\n\u2013international standards,\n\n\n\u2013national rules deemed to be equivalent, in railway safety terms, to national rules of other Member States.\n\n\nGroup B\n\n\nGroup B covers all rules that do not fall within the scope of Group A or Group C, or that it has not yet been possible to classify in one of these groups.\n\n\nGroup C\n\n\nGroup C covers rules that are strictly necessary and are associated with technical infrastructure characteristics, in order to ensure safe and interoperable use in the network concerned (e.g. the loading gauge).\n\n\nANNEX VIII\n\n\nMINIMUM CRITERIA WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY THE MEMBER STATES WHEN NOTIFYING BODIES\n\n\n1. The body, its Director and the staff responsible for carrying out the checking operations may not become involved either directly or as authorised representatives in the design, manufacture, construction, marketing or maintenance of the interoperability constituents or subsystems or in their use. This does not exclude the possibility of an exchange of technical information between the manufacturer and that body.\n\n\n2. The body and the staff responsible for the checks must carry out the checks with the greatest possible professional integrity and the greatest possible technical competence and must be free of any pressure and incentive, in particular of a financial type, which could affect their judgment or the results of their inspection, in particular from persons or groups of persons affected by the results of the checks.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, the body and the staff responsible for the checks must be functionally independent of the authorities designated to issue authorisations for placing in service in the framework of this Directive, licences in the framework of Directive 95/18/EC and safety certificates in the framework of Directive 2004/49/EC, and of the bodies in charge of investigations in the event of accidents.\n\n\n3. The body must employ staff and possess the means required to perform adequately the technical and administrative tasks linked with the checks; it should also have access to the equipment needed for exceptional checks.\n\n\n4. The staff responsible for the checks must possess:\n\n\n\u2013proper technical and vocational training,\n\n\n\u2013a satisfactory knowledge of the requirements relating to the checks that they carry out and sufficient practice in those checks,\n\n\n\u2013the ability to draw up the certificates, records and reports which constitute the formal record of the inspections conducted.\n\n\n5. The independence of the staff responsible for inspections must be guaranteed. No official must be remunerated either on the basis of the number of inspections performed or of the results of those inspections.\n\n\n6. The body must take out civil liability insurance unless that liability is covered by the State under national law or unless the checks are carried out directly by that Member State.\n\n\n7. The staff of the body are bound by professional secrecy with regard to everything they learn in the performance of their duties (with the exception of the competent administrative authorities and accident investigation bodies in the State where they perform those activities as well as accident investigation bodies responsible for the investigation of accidents caused by the failure of the interoperability constituents or subsystems checked) in pursuance of this Directive or any provision of national law implementing the Directive.\n\n\n\n\u00ea\u00a02008/57/EC\n\n\nANNEX\u00a0IX\n\n\nFILE FOR SUBMITTING A DEROGATION\n\n\nWhen submitting a request for a derogation, Member States must supply the following documents:\n\n\n(a) A formal letter communicating the proposed derogation to the Commission.\n\n\n(b) A file, annexed to the letter, comprising at least:\n\n\n\u2013a description of the work, goods and services subject to the derogation, specifying the key dates, the geographical location and the operational and technical area,\n\n\n\u2013a precise reference to the TSIs (or their parts) for which a derogation is requested,\n\n\n\u2013a precise reference to and details of the alternative provisions which will be applied,\n\n\n\u2013for requests made under Article\u00a07(1)(a), justification of the advanced stage of development of the project,\n\n\n\n\n\u2013justification of the derogation, including the main reasons of a technical, economic, commercial, operational and/or administrative nature,\n\n\n\u2013any other information justifying the request for a derogation,\n\n\n\u2013a description of the measures that the Member State proposes to take in order to promote the final interoperability of the project. In the case of a minor derogation, this description is not required.\n\n\nDocumentation must be supplied in paper form and as electronic files, so that it can be distributed among the members of the
