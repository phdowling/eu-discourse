The Transport White Paper \u2018Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area \u2014 Towards a competitive\r\nand resource efficient transport system\u2019 recognises\r\nthat transport accounts for a large share of GHG emissions (~20 %) and\r\ntherefore proposes reducing transport GHG emissions by 60 % between 1990\r\nand 2050. Europe 2020 also calls for an \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 to tackle the\r\nsocietal challenges we face and the Horizon 2020\r\nproposal includes the Smart, Green and Integrated Transport challenge aiming,\r\namong other things, to secure both resource-efficient\r\ntransport that respects the environment and global leadership for the European\r\ntransport industry. Finally, Europe 2020 also calls for action on sustainable\r\ngrowth and promotes a more resource-efficient, greener and competitive economy.\r\nAt the same time, the current economic and financial crisis Europe is facing demands\r\nbold measures towards robust and sustainable growth.\nOne of the main aims of Horizon 2020, the\r\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation covering the period 2014-2020, is\r\nto strengthen European industry through actions supporting research and innovation\r\nacross a range of industrial sectors. In particular, it provides for the\r\ncreation of public-private partnerships that will contribute to tackling some\r\nof the key challenges Europe is facing.\nWith reference to aeronautics and\r\nrecognising the evolving challenges facing the sector, a High Level Group on\r\nAviation Research produced in 2011 a new vision for the European aviation\r\nsector, \u2018Flightpath 2050\u2019, following the objectives of Europe 2020 and the\r\nTransport White Paper. It sets ambitious goals to reduce the environmental\r\nimpact by 2050, through the implementation of a new Strategic Research and\r\nInnovation Agenda of the ACARE (Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in\r\nEurope) Technology Platform, and aims to guide and support future actions in\r\npublic and private funding programmes along a common roadmap across Europe.\nClean Sky contributes to this goal in Europe through advanced research and full-scale demonstration actions in green technology for\r\nair transport in line with the strategic research agenda identified, with the\r\ninvolvement of all public and private stakeholders and a time horizon that runs\r\nup to 2050.\nThis new proposal relates to a Joint\r\nUndertaking in the field of Aeronautics. It follows on from and partly builds\r\nup on the results obtained by the previous Clean Sky JTI in this area\r\nestablished in 2008 under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and partly\r\ndevelops new technologies and research lines. This proposal is in line with the\r\nCommission Communication' Public-private partnerships, in Horizon 2020: a\r\npowerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe'.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reasons\r\nand objectives for a Joint Undertaking in the field of aeronautics\nToday, the European aeronautics sector is\r\none of the world leaders in terms of production, employment and exports,\r\ngenerating annual turnover in excess of \u20ac 100 billion and providing\r\nemployment for about 750 000 people. At the same time, air travel accounts\r\nfor about 7 % of all emissions produced by the transport sector and around\r\n2 % of total global CO2 emissions.\nThe predicted traffic growth will lead to\r\nsignificant increases in emissions if no measures are taken and it is therefore\r\nurgent to drastically reduce air transport environmental impacts if Europe is to meet the targets of the climate and energy package.\nDespite its current leadership, the\r\nEuropean aeronautical industry is increasingly confronted with strong, publicly\r\nsupported international competition from traditional or emerging competitors.\nThe future international competitiveness of\r\nthe sector, and consequently its contribution to societal challenges in terms\r\nof service provision, economic performance and job creation, will depend on the\r\nenvironmental performance and fuel efficiency of its technologies. In order to\r\nmaintain world leadership, the EU aeronautics industry should develop\r\ninnovative fuel-efficient technologies and provide competitive and high-quality\r\nproducts, through a pan-European R&D programme that encompasses all actors\r\nin the supply and know-how chain.\nImproving the environmental performance of\r\naeronautics technologies is a very complex and expensive process and requires a\r\nlong-term commitment of resources. Private companies have difficulties\r\nmobilising the human and financial resources necessary to develop radical and\r\nrisky technological advances for future aircraft because of the costs and risks\r\ninvolved. Market failure and economic spill-overs call for public intervention\r\nto support the transition between pre-competitive R&D and result exploitation\r\nleading to marketable products.\nThe aeronautics sector is global in nature\r\nand the necessary technical competences are not available in individual countries.\r\nThe technical and know-how supply chain is very scattered, with a continuous\r\ndistribution of competences from major \u2018aeronautical states\u2019 to \u2018non-aeronautical\r\nstates\u2019, where nonetheless technical excellence is found that is instrumental\r\nin stimulating the whole supply chain.\nIt is proposed that the new Clean Sky\r\nprogramme be implemented by continuing and building on the Clean Sky Joint\r\nUndertaking with the objective of improving the environmental impact of\r\nEuropean aeronautical technologies and securing the future international\r\ncompetitiveness of the European aeronautical industry. The proposed initiative\r\naims:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To contribute to the\r\nfinalisation of research activities initiated under Regulation (EC) No 71/2008\r\nand to the implementation of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing the Horizon 2020 Framework\r\nProgramme, and in particular the Smart, Green and Integrated Transport\r\nChallenge under the Societal Challenges pillar... of Decision (EU) No \u2026/2013/EU\r\n[of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing the Horizon 2020 Specific Programme];\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To contribute to the objectives\r\nof the Joint Technology Initiative on Clean Sky 2 , in particular to integrate,\r\ndemonstrate and validate technologies capable of:\n(a)         \r\nincreasing aircraft fuel efficiency thus\r\nreducing CO2 emissions by 20 to 30 % compared to \"state-of-the-art\"\r\naircraft entering into service as from 2014;\n(b)         \r\nreducing aircraft NOx and noise emissions by 20\r\nto 30 % compared to \"state-of-the-art\" aircraft entering into service\r\nas from 2014.\nThese objectives will be achieved for the\r\nbenefit of Europe at large. Environmental benefits are transnational by nature\r\nand the economic spill-over of sector growth will affect the service community\r\nof the air transport sector (airlines, airports) as a whole.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building\r\non past experience\nThe current proposal builds on the achievements\r\nof the current JTI under FP7. The Clean Sky Joint Undertaking was established\r\nin 2007 in response to the need to curtail the environmental impact of growing\r\nair traffic and cut aircraft emissions. Its research programme focuses on these\r\nobjectives with a delivery timeline of 2017.\nClean Sky has been successful in attracting\r\nextensive and wide-ranging participation by all key stakeholders, including a\r\nlarge number of SMEs. In the Clean Sky programme, 12 leaders (11 major\r\nindustries and one research establishment), 74 associated members and more than\r\n450 partners are working together in a number of technology domains to address\r\nthe environmental objectives and to demonstrate and validate the required\r\ntechnological innovations in a commonly defined programme.\nSince its establishment, the Clean Sky\r\nJoint Undertaking has successfully stimulated developments towards the\r\nstrategic environmental targets, as confirmed by the Interim Evaluation of the\r\nprogramme. It has already begun its campaign for demonstrators testing the\r\ntechnological feasibility of the research results at sub-system level and the\r\nassessment of its early results show that its environmental targets will be\r\nmet. The legal, financial and governance frameworks have shown, after the\r\ninitial phase, their effectiveness and responsiveness to operational needs. The\r\nfirst Interim Evaluation carried out in 2010 recognised its merits and provided\r\na number of recommendations on governance and technical issues that have been\r\ntackled, leading to the \u2018improved JU\u2019 infrastructure which is proposed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe proposed Regulation has been the\r\nsubject of a Commission Impact Assessment which is attached to the proposal.\r\nThe Impact Assessment has analysed the different implementation options for the\r\npublic-private partnership taking into account the need for the new\r\ntechnologies to be ready for deployment at the time when the renewal of the air\r\nfleet kicks in, which will be dictated by global market conditions. The Impact\r\nAssessment concluded that the improved JU option, which takes on board the\r\nlessons learnt from the current Clean Sky JU operation, represents the best approach\r\nto reach the stated objectives of the R&D programme. It was complemented by\r\na number of consultations carried out in parallel, the findings of which are\r\nappended to the Impact Assessment document.\nA public consultation was launched in July\r\n2012 and closed in October 2012, providing answers to a number of questions, in\r\nparticular on the scope and most appropriate set-up in order to optimise\r\nfulfilment of the technical objectives: 95 % of the answers considered it\r\nappropriate to set up a public-private partnership in aeronautics under Horizon\r\n2020. Most of the participants (89 %) agreed or strongly agreed that the\r\nPPP in aeronautics research should focus on large-scale demonstration of\r\npromising new technologies. In addition, the majority of the answers (41 %\r\nfavourable and 33 % very favourable) supported setting up a dedicated\r\nlegal structure with improved governance and a lighter regulatory framework.\nThe Clean Sky 2 proposal was presented to\r\nstakeholders in the aeronautical community at the Berlin Air Show in September\r\n2012. The community at large had endorsed early on the approach to extending the\r\nClean Sky initiative to address a new programme of work that would capitalise\r\non the results of the current programme and address novel technology areas.\nAn independent Expert Group was established\r\nby the Commission in June 2012. It provided an expert opinion on the content\r\nand relevance of the new Clean Sky programme and assessed the different\r\nscenarios for the way forward. Its opinion was very positive with regard to the\r\nimproved JTI approach.\nSpecific requests were made to national governments\r\nand interest groups/associations to provide their position with respect to\r\nsetting up Clean Sky 2 as a PPP. All position papers strongly supported the\r\ninitiative and the improved JTI option.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7       \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal consists of a Council\r\nRegulation on Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking. The Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nwas initially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/2008 of 20 December\r\n2007, which is to be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.\n\u00b7       \r\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\r\n187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe Rules for Participation and\r\nDissemination of Horizon 2020 will apply. However, given a specific operational\r\nneed of this initiative, a derogation from these Rules is necessary.\r\nNevertheless, this specific derogation is not included in the present proposal\r\nat this stage, in order not to prejudice the inter-institutional discussions\r\nconcerning the appropriate legal basis/procedural modalities for their\r\nadoption, which are still pending in the context of the legislative works\r\nconcerning the Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council laying down the Rules for Participation and dissemination in\r\nHorizon 2020 (COM(2011) 0810 - 2011/0399 (COD). The specific derogation will be\r\nintroduced at a later stage in view of the outcome of the abovementioned\r\ndiscussions.\nIn order to attract SMEs, universities, as\r\nwell as newcomers to European research programmes and to widen the supply and\r\nknow-how chains while enabling close contacts and cooperation between small\r\nentities and large integrators, the derogation will set out that the minimum\r\ncondition for participation to calls for proposals issued by the Clean Sky 2\r\nJoint Undertaking will systematically be one legal entity established in a\r\nMember State or associated country.\n\u00b7       \r\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved through national programmes because the scale of the\r\nchallenge exceeds the capacity of any Member State to act alone. Significant\r\ndifferences exist among national programmes. Their fragmentation and occasional\r\noverlapping calls for more efficient action at European Union level. The\r\npooling and coordination of research and development efforts at EU level stands\r\na better chance of success, given the transnational nature of the\r\ninfrastructure and technologies to be developed, and also the need to achieve a\r\nsufficient mass of resources. The involvement of the European Union will help\r\nto rationalise research programmes and ensure interoperability of the systems developed,\r\nnot only through common pre-normative research to support the preparation of\r\nstandards, but also through the de facto standardisation which will\r\narise from the close research cooperation and the transnational demonstration\r\nprojects. This standardisation will open a wider market and promote\r\ncompetition. The scope of the proposal should encourage individual states to\r\npursue complementary initiatives at national level, in the spirit of\r\nreinforcing the European Research Area. Indeed, it is the intention of the JTI\r\nto leverage these national and regional programmes to make best use of the\r\ncombined efforts.\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, the provisions of this Regulation do not go beyond what is\r\nnecessary to achieve its objectives.\n\u00b7       \r\nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation.\nOther means would not be appropriate for\r\nthe following reason:\nThe creation of an\r\nundertaking in which the Union participates requires a Council Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Legislative Financial Statement\r\npresented with this regulation sets out the indicative budgetary implications. The maximum amount of EU contribution (including EFTA contribution)\r\nshall be EUR 1,8 billion[1]\r\nin current prices. This contribution will be made from the\r\nSmart, Green and Integrated Transport Challenge under the Societal Challenges\r\npillar, DG Research & Innovation envelope, as part of the implementation of\r\nHorizon 2020 \u2013 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum\r\namount of Union contribution foreseen for operational costs shall be EUR 1760\r\nmillion. The maximum amount of Union contribution foreseen for running costs\r\nshall be EUR 40 million. \n2013/0244 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 187 and the first\r\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[3],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public-private\r\npartnerships in the form of Joint Technology Initiatives were initially provided\r\nfor in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nof 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European\r\nCommunity for research, technological development and demonstration activities\r\n(2007-2013)[4].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2006/971/EC\r\nof 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme 'Cooperation'\r\nimplementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for\r\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[5] identified specific\r\npublic-private partnerships to be supported, including a public-private\r\npartnership in the specific area of the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe 2020 Strategy[6] underscores the need to develop\r\nfavourable conditions for investment in knowledge and innovation so as to\r\nachieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Union. Both the European\r\nParliament and the Council have endorsed this strategy. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing Horizon\r\n2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[7] aims to achieve a greater\r\nimpact on research and innovation by combining Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\r\nand private-sector funds in public-private partnerships in key areas where\r\nresearch and innovation can contribute to the Union's wider competitiveness\r\ngoals and help tackle societal challenges. Union involvement in these\r\npartnerships can take the form of financial contributions to joint undertakings\r\nestablished on the basis of Article 187 of the Treaty under Decision No\r\n1982/2006/EC.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nDecision (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing the Specific\r\nProgramme implementing Horizon 2020 (2014-2020)[8]\r\nfurther support should be provided to joint undertakings established under Decision\r\nNo 1982/2006/EC under the conditions specified in Decision (EU) No \u2026/2013.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Clean Sky Joint\r\nUndertaking set up by Regulation (EC) No 71/2008 of the Council of 20 December\r\n2007 setting up the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking[9]\r\nis fulfilling its objectives of stimulating new research within the framework\r\nof a public-private partnership which enables long-term cooperation to take\r\nplace among European aeronautical stakeholders. Small and medium-sized\r\nenterprises (SMEs) have participated very extensively in Clean Sky, with\r\napproximately 40% of the budget for calls for proposals allocated to them. The\r\ninterim evaluation[10]\r\nof the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking has shown that the Joint Undertaking is\r\nsuccessfully stimulating developments towards environmental targets. In\r\naddition, it has been highly successful in attracting extensive and\r\nwide-ranging participation by all Union key industries and a large number of\r\nSMEs. It has led to new collaborations and to the participation of new organisations.\r\nIts research area should therefore continue to be supported in order to achieve\r\nits objectives as set out in Article 2 of this Regulation. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continued support for the\r\nClean Sky research programme should also take into account the experience\r\nacquired from the operations of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking including the\r\nresults of its interim evaluation and the stakeholders' recommendations[11]. It should be implemented\r\nusing a more fit-for-purpose structure and rules in order to enhance efficiency\r\nand to ensure simplification. To this end, the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nshould adopt financial rules specific to its needs in accordance with Article\r\n209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general\r\nbudget of the Union[12].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The private members of the\r\nClean Sky Joint Undertaking have expressed in writing their agreement for the\r\nresearch activities in the area of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking to be\r\npursued with a structure better adapted to the nature of a public-private\r\npartnership. It is appropriate that the private members of the Clean Sky 2\r\nJoint Undertaking accept the Statutes set out in Annex I to this Regulation by\r\nmeans of a letter of endorsement. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve its\r\nobjectives, the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking should provide financial support,\r\nmainly in the form of grants to members and grants to participants following\r\nopen and competitive calls for proposals. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributions from the\r\nprivate members should not only be limited to the administrative costs of the\r\nClean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking and to the co-financing required to carry out\r\nresearch and innovation actions supported by the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking.\r\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their contributions should\r\nalso relate to additional activities to be undertaken by the private members as\r\nspecified in an additional activities plan; in order to get a proper overview\r\nof the leverage effect, those additional activities should represent\r\ncontributions to the broader Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\r\nactions funded by the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking should comply with\r\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026\r\n2013 laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in Horizon\r\n2020 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[13]. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union financial\r\ncontribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound\r\nfinancial management and with the rules on indirect management set out in\r\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Commission delegated Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 966/2012[14].\r\n\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of\r\nUnion funds under this Regulation should be carried out in such a manner that the\r\nadministrative burden is reduced, in compliance with Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\r\n[the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme].\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\r\nthe Union and of the other members of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking should\r\nbe protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle,\r\nincluding the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the\r\nrecovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where\r\nappropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission's internal\r\nauditor should exercise the same powers over the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nas those exercised in respect of the Commission. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n287(1) of the Treaty, the constituent instrument of bodies, offices or agencies\r\nset up by the Union may preclude the examination of the accounts of all revenue\r\nand expenditure of those bodies, offices or agencies by the Court of Auditors. In\r\naccordance with Article 60(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the\r\naccounts of the bodies set up under Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012 are to be examined by an independent audit body which is to give an\r\nopinion inter alia on the reliability of the accounts and the legality\r\nand regularity of the underlying transactions. Avoidance of duplication of the\r\nexamination of the accounts justifies that the accounts of the Clean Sky 2\r\nJoint Undertaking should not be subject to examination by the Court of\r\nAuditors.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To implement the Union\r\nfinancial support for large-scale actions phased over several years, it is\r\nadvisable to provide for the possibility to split multiannual budgetary\r\ncommitments by the Union and the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking into annual\r\ninstalments. Commitments binding on the Union and the Clean Sky 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking over the long term should make it possible to reduce the\r\nuncertainties connected with the completion of such large-scale actions.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty on the European Union, the objectives of the Clean Sky 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking in strengthening industrial research and innovation across the\r\nUnion cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore,\r\nby reason of avoiding duplication, retaining critical mass and ensuring that\r\npublic financing is used in an optimal way, be better achieved by the Union;\r\nthis Regulation confines itself to the minimum required in order to achieve\r\nthose objectives and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Clean Sky Joint Undertaking\r\nwas set up for a period up to 31 December 2017.

The\r\ninitiative will create the proper dynamics for a stable growth in terms of\r\nsocietal benefits and economic growth. It will provide continuity to the Clean\r\nSky 1 programme that should end in 2017. \nThe foreseen Clean Sky 2 (CS2) budget will be complemented by higher\r\nprivate investment in research and will act as the catalyst for substantial\r\ninvestment in new generations of green aircraft, engines and systems. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe monitoring and evaluation of the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nprogress will be carried out both by external and internal bodies. \nThe internal progress monitoring will be first executed by the Joint\r\nUndertaking programme office. As a second layer, technical reviews will be\r\ncarried out by the JU together with independent external experts on an annual\r\nbasis. In addition, the Scientific Committee will analyse the review results\r\nand will give its opinion. \nThe monitoring of the progress will be executed using a well-defined\r\nset of key performance indicators related to technical, managerial and\r\nfinancial matters such as for instance budget execution, number of redress\r\ncases, time-to-pay and time-to-grant etc.\nAs for the current Clean Sky programme, an important instrument for\r\nimpact measurement will be the Technology Evaluator. \nThe external evaluation for the whole programme will be organized by\r\nthe European Commission and carried out by independent experts.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe full commitment of all parties is needed. The private members\r\nbehind the CS2 proposal have already signed a letter of intent. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nTechnological capabilities in aeronautics are highly specialised,\r\ncomplementary and distributed geographically across Europe. Therefore, the\r\nscale and scope of the research agenda for greening of aircraft goes beyond the\r\nborders and the capacity of individual National States, both in terms of\r\nfinancial commitment and of research capacities involved.\nNational programmes are not able to address in full the major\r\ntechnological challenges because of the pan-European nature of the aeronautics\r\nindustry. Only a large scale programme with a well-structured and focused\r\nresearch agenda is able to stimulate the necessary technological breakthroughs.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from similar\r\nexperiences in the past\nThe Clean Sky Joint Undertaking was established by the Council in\r\n2007 in response to the need of curtailing the environmental impact of growing\r\nair traffic. A clear need was identified of cutting aircraft emissions. The\r\nresearch programme of Clean Sky 1 is focusing on these objectives with a\r\ntimeline of 2017. To date, the technological improvements indicate a reduction\r\nof 20 % of CO2 emissions. \nThe Clean Sky Joint Undertaking has been successful in attracting a\r\nhigh level and wide participation from all key stakeholders, including a large\r\nnumber of SMEs. Since its establishment, the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking is\r\nsuccessfully stimulating developments towards the strategic environmental\r\ntargets.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nIn terms of coherence with Member State programmes, Clean Sky 2\r\npermits a stable participation because of its long-term character, strong\r\nindustry commitment and because the Member States are directly involved through\r\nthe States Representative Group that serves as a relay for exchange of\r\ninformation. In addition, the participation of industrial, national and\r\nregional representatives in the definition of the programme assures a maximum\r\nlevel of synergy through the feedback they will provide to their national and\r\nregional authorities. The leverage role which is expected from CS2 should\r\nresult in awareness, if not partial re-orientation of supporting programmes at\r\nnational and EU level.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative\r\nof limited duration \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Proposal/initiative\r\nin effect from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2024 \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Financial\r\nimpact from 2014 to 2020 for commitment appropriations\n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Financial\r\nimpact from 2014 to 2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[30] \n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission through:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States:\n\u2013     \r\nX Indirect management by entrusting budget\r\nimplementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 international organisations and\r\ntheir agencies (please specify);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 the EIB and the European Investment Bank;\n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 bodies\r\nreferred to in Article 209 FR;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to\r\nthe extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\nComments \nNA\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nThe Clean Sky 2 JU will be monitored through intermediary contacts\r\nand as provided in clauses 6 and 20 of the Statutes.\nAs an EU PPP body under Article 209 FR, the Clean Sky 2 JU functions\r\nunder strict monitoring rules. \nMonitoring is performed through:\n- the supervision of the Governing Board;\n- mid-term and final evaluations by external experts (every 3 years\r\nand at the end of the programme, under the supervision of the Commission);\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - JU's Work Plan and its\r\nAnnual Activity Report. Management and control system\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internal control framework \nThe Commission through the Authorising Officer by Delegation will\r\nensure that the rules applicable to the Clean Sky 2 JU fully comply with the\r\nrequirements of Article 60 and Article 61 of the Financial Regulation.\r\nMonitoring arrangements, including membership of the Governing Board, of the\r\nClean Sky 2 JU and reporting arrangements will ensure that the Commission\r\nservices can meet the accountability requirements both to the College and to\r\nthe Budgetary Authority.\nThe internal control framework for the Clean Sky 2 JU is built on:\n-the implementation of the Internal Control Standards offering at\r\nleast equivalent guarantees to those of the Commisson;\n- procedures for selecting the best projects through independent\r\nevaluation, and for translating them into legal instruments;\n- project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every\r\nproject;\n- ex-ante checks on 100% of claims, including receipt of audit\r\ncertificates and ex-ante certification of cost methodologies; \n-ex post audits on a sample of claims as part of the Horizon 2020\r\nex-post audits;\n- scientific evaluation of project results.\nVarious measures have been established to mitigate the inherent risk\r\nof conflict of interest within the Clean Sky 2 JU, especially equal votes for\r\nthe Commission and for industrial partners in the Governing Board, selection of\r\nthe Director by the Governing Board based on a proposal by the Commission,\r\nindependence of staff, evaluations by independent experts based on published\r\nselection criteria together with appeal mechanisms and full declarations of any\r\ninterests. The establishment of ethical and organisational values will be one\r\nof the key roles of the JU, and will be monitored by the Commission.\n2.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\r\ncontrols\nThe Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the same powers\r\nover the Joint Undertaking as those exercised in respect of the Commission.\r\nMoreover, the Governing Board may arrange, as appropriate, for the\r\nestablishment of an internal audit capability of the Joint Undertaking.\nThe Executive Director of the Clean Sky 2 JU, as Authorising\r\nOfficer, will be required to introduce a cost-effective system of internal\r\ncontrol and management. He/she will be required to report to the Commission on\r\nthe internal control framework adopted.\nThe Commission will monitor the risk of non-compliance through the\r\nreporting system that it will develop, as well as by following the results of\r\nex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from the Clean Sky 2 JU, as part\r\nof ex post audits covering the whole of the Horizon 2020. \nThe control system established will need to take account of the\r\nstrong feeling, amongst the recipients of EU funds as well as amongst the\r\nlegislative authority, that the control burden required to attain an error\r\nlimit of 2% has become too great. This runs the risk of lowering the\r\nattractiveness of the Union's Research programme, and so negatively affecting\r\nUnion research and innovation.\nThe European Council of February 4th 2011 concluded that\r\n\u2018it is crucial that EU instruments aimed at fostering R&D&I be\r\nsimplified in order to facilitate their take-up by the best scientists and the\r\nmost innovative companies, in particular by agreeing between the relevant institutions\r\na new balance between trust and control and between risk taking and risk\r\navoidance\u2019 (see EUCO 2/1/11 REV1, Brussels 8 March 2011).\nThe European Parliament, in its Resolution of 11 November 2010\r\n(P7_TA(2010)0401) on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework\r\nProgrammes explicitly supports a higher risk of errors for research funding and\r\n\"expresses its concern that the current system and the practice of FP7\r\nmanagement are excessively control-oriented, thus leading to waste of resources,\r\nlower participation and less attractive research landscapes; notes with concern\r\nthat the current management system of \u2018zero risk tolerance\u2019 seems to avoid,\r\nrather than to manage, risks\". \nThere is therefore an acceptance among stakeholders and Institutions\r\nthat the whole range of objectives and interests, especially the success of the\r\nResearch policy, international competitiveness and scientific excellence,\r\nshould be considered, along with the error rate. At the same time, there is a\r\nclear need to manage the budget in an efficient and effective manner, and to\r\nprevent fraud and waste. \nAs stated above, the Commission will monitor the risk of\r\nnon-compliance through the reporting system that it will establish , as well as\r\nby following the results of ex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from\r\nthe Clean Sky 2 JU, as part of the ex post audits covering the whole of the\r\nHorizon 2020. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected level of risk of\r\nnon-compliance \nAs the Commission reported in the Legislative Financial Statement\r\nfor Horizon 2020, it remains the ultimate objective to achieve a residual error\r\nrate of less than 2% of total expenditure over the lifetime of the programme,\r\nand to that end, it has introduced a number of simplification measures.\r\nHowever, the other objectives set out above as well as the costs of controls\r\nneed to be considered.\nAs the rules of participation in the Clean Sky 2 JU are basically\r\nthe same as those that the Commission will use, and with a population of\r\nbeneficiaries with a similar risk profile to those of the Commission, it can be\r\nexpected that the level of error will be similar to that established by the\r\nCommission for Horizon 2020, i.e. to give reasonable assurance that the risk of\r\nerror over the course of the multiannual expenditure period is, on an annual\r\nbasis, within a range of 2-5 %, with the ultimate aim to achieve a residual\r\nlevel of error as close as possible to 2 % at the closure of the multi-annual\r\nprogrammes, once the financial impact of all audits, correction and recovery\r\nmeasures have been taken into account.\nSee the Legislative Financial Statement for Horizon 2020 for full\r\ndetails of the error rate expected with respect to participants.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities\nThe Commission will ensure that procedures to fight against fraud at\r\nall stages of the management process are applied by the Clean Sky 2 JU. The\r\nproposals for Horizon 2020 have been subject to fraud proofing and an\r\nassessment of their impact. Overall the measures proposed should have a\r\npositive impact on the fight against fraud, especially the greater emphasis on\r\nrisk based audit and reinforced scientific evaluation and control.\nThe Commission will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to\r\nensure that, when actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the\r\nfinancial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive\r\nmeasures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by\r\neffective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the\r\namounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and\r\ndeterrent penalties.\nThe current Clean Sky 2 JU already cooperate with the Commission\r\nservices in matters relating to fraud and irregularity, the Commission will\r\nensure that this will continue and be strengthened. \nThe Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of\r\ndocuments and on-the-spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and\r\nsubcontractors who have received Union funds under the Programme.\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot\r\nchecks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly\r\nby such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation\r\n(Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 with a view to establishing whether there has\r\nbeen fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial\r\ninterests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision\r\nor a contract concerning Union funding.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading of the
