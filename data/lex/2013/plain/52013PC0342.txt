Together with the\nUnion strategy for growth and jobs, the European semester for the coordination\nof economic and budgetary policies, and the Stability and Growth Pact for the\ncorrection of government excessive deficits, there is a need to detect, prevent\nand correct macroeconomic imbalances.\nFor this purpose, Regulation (EU) No\n1176/2011 set out detailed rules for the early detection, prevention and\ncorrection of macroeconomic imbalances which emerge or persist in the euro area\nand the EU (the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure or MIP). \nThe MIP and its scoreboard of indicators\nrequire efficient statistical quality monitoring of the indicators and of the\nunderlying statistical information.\nThe ECOFIN Councils of 8 November 2011 and\n13 November 2012 underlined the importance for the credibility of the MIP of\nhaving timely statistics of the highest quality for inclusion in the scoreboard\nand invited the Commission (Eurostat) to take all necessary initiatives to\nassure a reliable procedure for the compilation of these statistics as well as\na continuous improvement of the underlying statistical information.\nThere is therefore a need to develop a\nrobust statistical monitoring system for the MIP based on a Regulation of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. This Regulation will cover the\nmonitoring of data quality; the compilation and transmission of data and\nmetadata; and the reporting/communication on the data to the different\nstakeholders and to the European Parliament and the Council. \nThe Regulation will introduce new tasks for\nthe Commission (Eurostat) on the following main aspects: validating the quality\nof the MIP relevant data in relation to quality criteria that either exist\nalready or will be further specified in certain areas; structuring, collecting\nand analysing Member States\u2019 compilation sources and methods; developing and\nimplementing an improvement action plan. The work on the MIP relevant data will\nneed to be supported by good website publication and dissemination arrangements,\nas well as release actions.\nThe implementation of the draft Regulation with\na view to providing high quality statistics will require close cooperation with\nMember States\u2019 statistical authorities covering both the scoreboard data and\nthe underlying statistical information.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES\nThe need to have statistics of the highest\nquality for inclusion in the MIP scoreboard, and to develop a reliable quality\nmonitoring procedure for this purpose, has been stressed by the ECOFIN Council.\nExtensive discussions with Member States on\nquality and comparability issues relating to the MIP relevant data have taken\nplace in the Economic Policy Committee. In particular some areas for\nimprovements were identified in the 2012 EPC Report on requirements for\nstructural statistics.\nThere have been contacts with other\nDirectorates General, in particular the Economic and Financial affairs DG.\nSeveral improvement actions relating to\nunderlying statistical information have been undertaken in cooperation with the\nEuropean Central Bank and other international organisations.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe successful implementation of this\nRegulation will mainly require close cooperation from Member States\u2019\nstatistical authorities with a view to improving the quality of the MIP relevant\ndata and the underlying statistical information. No additional data collection\nmechanisms are foreseen. \nIf a robust and legally binding quality\nmonitoring procedure were not adopted, the quality and comparability of the MIP\nrelevant data would not be assured, as required by Commission policy. This\ncould in turn affect the credibility and efficiency of the MIP system. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThis Regulation sets out the rules\ngoverning the way the statistical data that are relevant for the macroeconomic\nimbalances procedure are provided. These rules relate to the compilation,\nquality monitoring and release of the indicators in the macroeconomic\nimbalances procedure scoreboard. The main objective of the Regulation is to\ndevelop a robust quality monitoring procedure in order to ensure the highest\nquality of the MIP relevant data.\nArticle 338 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union provides the legal basis for European\nstatistics. Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council adopt measures for the production of\nstatistics, where necessary, on how the Union conducts its activities. It sets\nout the requirements for European statistics, stating that they must conform to\nstandards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence,\ncost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\nThe proposal complies with both the\nsubsidiarity and the proportionality principles.\nConcerning the subsidiarity principle, the\nobjectives of the proposal do not fall within the exclusive competence of the\nEuropean Union and at the same time cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\nMember States.\nThe Member States cannot satisfy the\ncentral quality concern to the necessary extent without a clear European\nframework, i.e. European legislation laying down a common quality monitoring\nprocedure for the MIP relevant data. \nThe objectives of the proposal can be\nbetter achieved at European Union level on the basis of a European level act,\nbecause only the Commission can develop and apply a harmonised quality\nmonitoring procedure for the MIP relevant data at European Union level. On the\nother hand, successful implementation of this procedure requires close\ncooperation with Member States\u2019 statistical authorities covering both the MIP\nrelevant data and the underlying statistical information. The European Union\nmay therefore take action to this end in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.\nConcerning the proportionality principle,\nthe Regulation confines itself to the minimum required to achieve its objective\nand does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose. It does not specify an\nMIP relevant data collection mechanism for each Member State, nor does it duplicate\nexisting procedures. It merely sets out a quality monitoring system in respect\nof the compilation, transmission and release of the scoreboard statistics and\nother MIP relevant data. \nThe proposed legal instrument is a European\nParliament and Council Regulation. A regulation is preferable because it lays\ndown the same law throughout the European Union, leaving the Member States with\nno leeway to apply it incompletely or selectively. It is directly applicable,\nwhich means that it does not need to be transposed in national law. The use of\na regulation is in line with other European statistical legal acts adopted\nsince 1997.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nIn order to assure the high quality\nrequirements for the MIP-relevant data in line with the Commission standards as\nset out in Communication COM(2011) 211 final \u2018Towards robust quality management\nfor European Statistics\u2019, additional resources are needed. This has meant\nintroducing a staff bid for 21 posts (12 posts and 9 external personnel) to\ncover the tasks required of the Commission (Eurostat).\nIn addition, the Commission will need\nassistance from Member States\u2019 experts in the context of the MIP missions\nmentioned in this proposal, and would share with Member States the related\ncosts. This assistance includes national experts\u2019 specific expertise and\nexperience during missions to other Member States, including for the purpose of\ncomplete transparency of the system. At this stage, it is difficult to indicate\nexactly how the costs to the Commission would be financed and to give a precise\nestimate of these, in particular because all possible synergies will be sought\nwith Eurostat missions in related areas.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe proposed act does not concern an EEA\nmatter.\n2013/0181 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the provision and quality of statistics\nfor the macroeconomic imbalances procedure\nTHE EUROPEAN\nPARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on\nthe prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances[1]\nsets up an alert mechanism to facilitate the early identification and the\nmonitoring of imbalances. Under this mechanism, the Commission is required to\nprepare an annual Alert Mechanism Report (AMR) containing a qualitative\neconomic and financial assessment and identifying Member States that the\nCommission considers may be affected by, or may be at risk of being affected\nby, imbalances.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n1174/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on\nenforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro\narea[2]\nlays down a system of financial sanctions against euro area Member States for\nthe effective correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reliable statistical data\nare the basis for effective surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances. To\nguarantee sound and independent statistics, Member States should ensure the\nprofessional independence of national statistical authorities, consistent with\nthe European statistics code of practice laid down in Regulation (EC) No\n223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on\nEuropean statistics[3].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The AMR, which is based on\na scoreboard with a set of indicators the values of which are compared to their\nindicative thresholds, is an initial screening device whereby the Commission identifies Member States where it considers that\ndevelopments warrant further in-depth analysis to determine whether imbalances exist or risk\nemerging. The AMR should include MIP relevant data. It is however in the following in-depth reviews that the driving\nforces behind the observed developments are analysed in detail with a view to\ndetermining the nature of the imbalances. The scoreboard and the thresholds are\nnot interpreted mechanically, but are subject to economic reading. When carrying\nout in-depth reviews, the Commission will examine a broad range of economic\nvariables and additional information taking due account of country specific\ncircumstances. For these reasons, all the data that may\nbe used for the purpose of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure cannot be\nlisted in advance in an exhaustive manner, but should be defined by reference\nto the procedures set out in Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 for the detection of\nmacroeconomic imbalances as well as the prevention and correction of excessive\nmacroeconomic imbalances within the Union. In\nimplementing the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, the Commission and the\nCouncil should give preference to statistics which are compiled and\ntransmitted, by Member States, to the Commission (Eurostat). Other statistics,\nwhich are not compiled and transmitted this way, should only be used when the\nformer statistics do not provide the required information, and taking due\naccount of the quality of these other statistics.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A reliable procedure should\nbe set up for the compilation, monitoring and release of the data relevant for\nthe macroeconomic imbalances procedure (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMIP\nrelevant data\u201d) as well as a continuous improvement of the underlying\nstatistical information in line with the Commission\u2019s quality management\nframeworks for European statistics[4]. The Group\nof Directors of Macroeconomic Statistics (DMES), established by the Commission,\nis an appropriate expert group to provide the Commission (Eurostat) with the\nrequired assistance for the application of a robust quality monitoring\nprocedure for the MIP relevant data.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential that the\nstatistical production necessary for the performance of the activities of the Union should only be based on reliable data. In the production of MIP relevant data, which\nis an essential input for the detection of macroeconomic imbalances as well as\nthe prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances within the\nUnion, unreliable data can have a significant impact on the interest of the Union. Additional measures to make the enforcement of the production, provision and quality\nmonitoring of MIP relevant data more effective are necessary for the\nperformance of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure. Those measures should enhance\nthe credibility of the underlying statistical information as well as of the\nprovision and quality monitoring of the MIP relevant data. In order to deter\nagainst misrepresentation, whether intentional or due to serious negligence, of\nMIP relevant data, a mechanism of financial sanctions should be established,\nwhich will also serve the purpose of ensuring due diligence in the production\nof MIP relevant data.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nsupplement the rules on calculating the fines for manipulation of statistics as\nwell as the rules on the procedure to be followed by the Commission for the\ninvestigation of such actions, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (\u201cthe Treaty\u201d)\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of detailed criteria for\nestablishing the amount of the fine and for conducting the Commission\u2019s\ninvestigations. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\nlevel. When preparing and drawing up delegated acts, the Commission should\nensure the simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Close cooperation and on-going\ndialogue should be established between the Commission and Member States\u2019 statistical authorities in order to ensure the quality of the MIP relevant data\nreported by Member States and the underlying statistical information. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Close cooperation between\nthe European Statistical System and the European System of Central Banks should\nbe ensured in relation to MIP relevant data, in line with Article 9 of\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009, in order to minimise the reporting burden,\nguarantee coherence, improve the underlying statistics and ensure\ncomparability.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission and exercised in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning\nmechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of\nimplementing powers[5].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nRegulation, namely to set up a reliable common procedure for the provision and\nquality monitoring of MIP relevant data as well as a continuous improvement of\nthe underlying statistical information, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the\nMember States and can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt\nmeasures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurostat, as the\nstatistical authority of the Union, should carry out the statistical tasks\ndevolved to the Commission under this Regulation. These tasks should be\nperformed by Eurostat in conformity with the statistical principles laid down\nin Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 and in accordance with Commission Decision\n2012/504/EU of 17 September 2012 on Eurostat[6],\nHAVE ADOPTED\nTHIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down the\nrules on the provision and quality monitoring of statistical data which are\ncompiled or transmitted for the purpose of the procedures for the detection of macroeconomic\nimbalances as well as the prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic\nimbalances within the Union established under Articles 3 to 11 of Regulation\n(EU) No 1176/2011 (hereinafter referred to as the MIP relevant data).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall apply to\nthe MIP relevant data compiled and transmitted by Member States, irrespective\nof whether the Council or the Commission consider that an imbalance exists and\nwhether an excessive imbalance has been established by the Council pursuant to Article\n7 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011. This Regulation shall apply also to the\nMember States for which the macroeconomic imbalances procedure has been\nsuspended in accordance with Article xxxx of Regulation xxxx (reference will be\nmade to the 2-Pack Regulation when it is adopted).\nCHAPTER II\nTRANSMISSION OF DATA TO THE COMMISSION\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The MIP relevant data to be\ntransmitted by the Member States shall cover the preceding year (n-1) and the\nprevious nine years (n-2 to n-10).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The deadlines for the\ntransmission of the MIP relevant data shall be those laid down pursuant to the\nrelevant basic acts or shall be communicated by the Commission in specific\ncalendars taking into account the needs of the Union. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall indicate to\nthe Member States, each year, the timetable of the annual Alert Mechanism\nReport established by Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011. Based on this\ntimetable and on the deadlines and calendars referred to in paragraph 2, the\nCommission shall also decide on and communicate, to the Member States, a\ncut-off date for their transmission of all the most up-to-date MIP relevant\ndata.\nCHAPTER III\nQUALITY REPORTS\nArticle 3\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When transmitting the MIP\nrelevant data referred to in Article 1, Member States shall send, to the\nCommission (Eurostat), information showing how these data are calculated, including\nany changes in the sources and methods, in the form of a quality report.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quality criteria referred to\nin Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 shall apply to the data to be\ntransmitted.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall adopt\nimplementing acts with a view to defining the modalities, structure and\nperiodicity of the quality reports. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in\naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 14(2).\nArticle\n4\nIn the event of doubt regarding the correct\nimplementation of the rules governing the compilation and transmission of the\nMIP relevant data, the Member State concerned shall request clarification from\nthe Commission (Eurostat). The Commission shall promptly examine the issue and\ncommunicate its clarification to the Member State concerned, to the relevant\nexpert group on macroeconomic statistics established by the Commission, to all\nother Member States and to the public. \nCHAPTER IV\nQUALITY ASSESSMENT\nArticle 5\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission (Eurostat) shall\nregularly assess the quality of the MIP relevant data. The assessments shall\nfocus mainly on areas specified in the inventories referred to in Article 6,\nwhere applicable, and the quality reports of Member States.

The Council has underlined the\nimportance for the credibility of the MIP of having timely statistics of the\nhighest quality for inclusion in the scoreboard and invited the Commission\n(Eurostat) to take all necessary initiatives to assure a reliable procedure for\nthe compilation of these statistics as well as a continuous improvement of the\nunderlying statistical information.\nEurostat will therefore develop a robust statistical monitoring\nsystem for the MIP based on a Regulation. The results should ensure a solid\nstatistical basis for the MIP related decisions, in the form of high quality\nindicators meeting the quality standards set by the Commission. \n1.4.4\u00a0 Indicators of results and impact\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nEurostat will assess Member States\u2019 data, in cooperation with a\ngroup of high level national experts in macroeconomic statistics, to ensure\nthat, for each Member State, the weaknesses detected are properly addressed and\nthe improvement actions identified are implemented. Each year, the results of this\nwork will be discussed in the Economic Policy Committee, and will be presented\nin the Commission\u2019s Alert Mechanism Report in the context of the European\nSemester. Also, there will be regular reporting to the European Parliament and\nthe Council.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe need to have statistics of the highest quality for inclusion in\nthe MIP scoreboard and to develop a reliable quality monitoring procedure for\nthis purpose has been emphasised by the Council.\nExtensive discussions with Member States on quality and\ncomparability issues relating to the MIP relevant data have taken place in the\ncontext of the Economic Policy Committee. In particular some areas for\nimprovements were identified in the 2012 EPC Report on requirements for\nstructural statistics. A robust quality framework needs to be set up in order\nto provide quality assurance for these data.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nEU involvement is necessary to develop and implement a harmonised\nquality monitoring procedure for the MIP relevant data at European level. This\nwill draw on experience and best practices from all Member States and will\nfacilitate the sharing of such experience and practices.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe quality monitoring framework envisaged in this Proposal draws\nextensively on similar procedures that have been developed and applied for many\nyears by Eurostat in the areas of statistics for EU own resource and for the\nexcessive deficit procedure respectively. In this regard, very significant\nimprovements have been achieved in these two areas. \n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThe specific quality monitoring framework envisaged in this Proposal\nwill be introduced in the relevant areas where no such procedure exists. Extra\nresources are needed for implementing and maintaining this enhanced quality\nmonitoring system. Without these extra resources, it will not be possible to\nachieve the required quality level. Naturally, in evaluating the extra resources\nneeded utmost care has been taken to avoid any duplications, and all synergies\nwill be sought systematically with similar existing quality frameworks, e.g. in\nthe areas of gross national income and excessive deficit procedure statistics.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[9] \n\u00fe Centralised direct management by the Commission\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nEach year, the results of this work will be discussed in the\nEconomic Policy Committee, and will be presented in the Commission\u2019s Alert\nMechanism Report in the context of the European Semester.

For the MIP to be effective, it is necessary to ensure efficient statistical monitoring of the MIP relevant data. The Council of 8 November 2011 and of 13 November 2012 underlined the importance for the credibility of the MIP of having timely statistics of the highest quality for inclusion in the scoreboard and invited the Commission (Eurostat) to take all necessary initiatives to assure a reliable procedure for the compilation of these statistics as well as a continuous improvement of the underlying statistical information. Eurostat will therefore develop a robust statistical monitoring system for the MIP based on a Regulation. This will cover mainly the compilation and transmission of data and metadata by Member States; monitoring of data quality by Eurostat; and reporting/communication to the different stakeholders and to the European Parliament and the Council. The Regulation will introduce new tasks for the Commission on the following main aspects: validating the quality of the MIP relevant data in relation to quality criteria that already exist or are to be defined/specified in certain areas (e.g. data of balance of payments statistics and net international investment position, nominal unit labour cost, deflated house prices, private sector credit flow and private sector debt, unemployment, total financial sector liabilities) including regular and more in-depth visits to countries; structuring, collecting and analysing Member States\u2019 compilation sources and methods; developing and implementing an improvement action plan; regular reporting to the Economic Policy Committee on the results of this exercise. \n External personnel ||
