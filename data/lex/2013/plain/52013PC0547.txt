Consumers have already significantly changed\r\ntheir payment habits in recent years. In addition to the ever growing number of\r\ncredit and debit card payments, the rise of e-commerce and the increasing\r\npopularity of smart phones have paved the way for the emergence of new means of\r\npayments. The benefits of better market integration and reduced fragmentation in\r\nthis field at European level are substantial. \nThis initiative will allow consumers and merchants to\r\nbenefit fully from the internal market, particularly in terms of e-commerce.The aim of the proposal is to help develop further\r\nan EU-wide market for electronic payments, which will enable consumers,\r\nretailers and other market players to enjoy the full benefits of the EU\r\ninternal market, in line with Europe 2020 and the Digital Agenda. Such further\r\nintegration is becoming increasingly important as the world moves beyond\r\nbricks-and-mortar trade towards a digital economy. \nTo achieve this and promote more competition,\r\nefficiency and innovation in the field of e-payments, there should be legal\r\nclarity and a level playing field, leading to downward convergence of costs and\r\nprices for payment services users, more choice and transparency of payment\r\nservices, facilitating the provision of innovative payment services, and to\r\nensure secure and transparent payment services. \nThese objectives will be achieved by updating\r\nand complementing the current framework on payments services; providing for\r\nrules that enhance transparency, innovation and security in the field of retail\r\npayments and improving consistency between national rules, with an emphasis on\r\nthe legitimate needs of consumers. The proposed measures seek to do so in a\r\ntechnologically neutral manner that will remain relevant as payment services\r\nevolve further.\nThis proposal also incorporates and repeals\r\nDirective 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the so\r\ncalled \u2018Payment Services Directive\u2019 or \u2018PSD\u2019)[1]\r\nwhich sets the basis for a\r\nharmonised legal framework for the creation of an integrated payments market,\r\nthus improving the level playing field and accessibility of the current\r\npayments framework for all stakeholders. \nAt a time when the distinction between payment\r\ninstitutions (subject to the PSD) and electronic money institutions (subject to\r\nDirective 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[2], the second Electronic Money Directive or \u2018EMD\u2019)\r\nis increasingly blurred as technology and business models converge, a full\r\nmodernisation of the digital payment framework resulting in the merger of both\r\ncategories of actors and respective legislations would be optimal. This would\r\nhowever entail as a pre-requisite to review the EMD to ensure a coherent\r\nregulatory framework. Unfortunately, the late transposition by many Member\r\nStates of the EMD has not allowed gaining sufficient experience with this\r\nDirective to evaluate it together with the Payment Service Directive and\r\nconsider possible synergies in the review. A review of Directive 2009/110/EC is\r\nforeseen to take place in 2014. \nGeneral context\nSignificant progress and integration of retail\r\npayments in the EU have been achieved over the past 12 years, with the current\r\nregulatory and legislative acquis on payments. \nThe legal framework established by the PSD, the\r\ncross-border payments Regulation (EC) No 924/2009[3] and the Second Electronic Money Directive have\r\nalready resulted in significant progress regarding the integration of the\r\nEuropean retail payments markets. The SEPA migration end-date Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 260/2012[4] brought this development a step further by\r\nsetting migration deadlines for pan-European credit transfers and direct\r\ndebits, replacing national schemes for national and cross border euro payments\r\nwithin the EU (1 February 2014 for the Eurozone). This regulatory framework is\r\ncomplemented by ECJ case law and Commission decisions in the context of\r\ncompetition law in the field of retail payments. \nThe retail payments market is very dynamic and has experienced a\r\nsignificant innovation pace in the last few years. At the same time, important areas of the payments market,\r\nespecially card payments and new means of payments, such as internet and mobile\r\npayments, are often still fragmented along national borders making it difficult\r\nfor innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services to develop efficiently\r\nand to provide consumers and retailers with convenient and secure payment\r\nmethods (with the possible exception of credit cards) at pan-European level to\r\npurchase an expanding range of goods and services. The latest developments in\r\nthese markets have also highlighted certain gaps in the current legal framework\r\nfor payments and market failures in the markets for card, internet and mobile payments to be addressed in this initiative.\nThe review of the European framework and notably the Payment\r\nServices Directive and the consultation on the Commission Green Paper \u2018Towards\r\nan integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments\u2019[5] in 2012 have led to the conclusion that further measures and\r\nregulatory updates, including adjustments to the PSD, are required so that the\r\npayments framework can better serve the needs of an effective European payments\r\nmarket, fully contributing to a payments environment which nurtures\r\ncompetition, innovation and security. \nIn the Commission\u2019s 2012 Communication \u201cSingle Market Act II \u2013\r\nTogether for new growth\u201d[6], the modernisation of the legislative framework for retail payments\r\nhas been identified as a key priority in view of its potential for new growth\r\nand innovation. The revision of the PSD and the preparation of a legislative\r\nproposal on multilateral interchange fees for card payments were defined as one\r\nof the key actions of the Commission for 2013.\nExisting provisions in the area of the proposal\nThis initiative is part of a broader package of\r\nlegislative measures on payment services. It will complement and update the\r\nexisting legal framework for payment services within the EU, and notably:\n\u2013                        \r\nDirective 2007/64/EC creating a harmonised legal\r\nframework so that payments could be made more quickly and easily through the\r\nwhole EU, introducing more competition in payment systems and facilitating\r\neconomies of scale. It also facilitated the operational implementation of the\r\nSingle Euro Payments Area (SEPA).\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EC) 924/2009 on cross-border\r\npayments repealing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 and extending the scope of the\r\nRegulation to direct debits. It eliminated the differences in payment charges\r\nfor payment service users between national and cross-border payments in euro\r\nwith in the European Union. It applies to all electronically processed\r\npayments.\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EU) No 260/2012 setting migration\r\ndeadlines for pan-European credit transfers and pan-European direct debits and\r\nreplacing national schemes for national and cross border euro payments within\r\nthe European Union.\n\u2013                        \r\nDirective 2009/110/EC on electronic money providing for the legal framework to issue and redeem e-money and brings the prudential regime for electronic money institutions in\r\nline with the requirements for payment institutions in the PSD.\n\u2013                        \r\nRegulation (EC) No 1781/2006 laying down rules\r\nfor payment service providers to send information on the payer throughout the\r\npayment chain for the purposes of prevention, investigation and detection of\r\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing.\nIn addition to the legislative framework, a\r\nnumber of competition proceedings conducted at European and national level have\r\naddressed anti-competitive practices in the payment market.\nConsistency with other policies and objectives\r\nof the Union\nThe objectives of the proposal are fully\r\ncoherent with the EU policies and objectives pursued by the Union. First, this\r\nproposal will improve the functioning of the internal market for payment\r\nservices and more broadly for all goods and services given the need for\r\ninnovative, efficient and secure means of payments. By facilitating economic\r\ntransactions within the Union, this will also contribute to the attainment of\r\nthe wider objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and the promotion of new growth.\r\nSecond, this initiative supports EU policies in other areas such as data\r\nprotection, administrative sanctions, anti-money laundering and terrorist\r\nfinancing and more in particular:\n\u2013                        \r\nThe Commission's legislative initiatives\r\nregarding the Digital Agenda for Europe[7]\r\nand notably the Commission's proposal for a legal framework on electronic\r\nidentification and trust in services for electronic transactions[8] and its proposal concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and\r\ninformation security across the Union[9]\r\nand the key priorities identified in the Communication\r\non e-Commerce and online Services[10],\r\nwhich aim to achieve a Digital Single Market. \n\u2013                        \r\nThe Commission's efforts to increase competition\r\nthrough establishing equal obligations, rights and opportunities for market\r\nplayers and facilitating cross-border provision of payment services. \n\u2013                        \r\nThe Commission\u2019s legislative proposal on\r\ninterchange fees for card-based payment transactions and on the use of certain\r\nrestrictive business rules and practices which is prepared at the same time and\r\nin close coordination with the present proposal.\n\u2013                        \r\nDirective\r\n2011/83/EC on Consumer Rights[11]\r\nwhich aims at promoting a real business-to-consumer internal market and at\r\nstriking the right balance between a high level of consumer protection and the\r\ncompetitiveness of enterprises, thereby limiting the discretion of merchants to\r\napply charges on the use of payment instruments to the costs at hand.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consultations with\r\ninterested parties and impact assessment \nConsultation of interested parties \nOn 11 January 2012,\r\nthe European Commission published a Green Paper \"Towards an integrated\r\nEuropean market for card, internet and mobile payments\u201d[12] which was followed by an\r\nextensive public consultation. The Commission received more than 300 replies\r\nfrom authorities, civil society, business federations and companies from\r\ndifferent fields, representing a broad variety of stakeholders. An additional\r\nnumber of comments, position papers and contributions were received outside the\r\nconsultation. \nThe comprehensive\r\nfeedback by stakeholders[13]\r\nprovided relevant information on some recent new developments and on possible\r\nrequirements for changes to the existing payments framework. A public hearing\r\nin the same context took place on 4 May 2012 and was attended by some 350\r\ninterested stakeholders. \nOn 20 November 2012, the European Parliament adopted a resolution\r\n\u201cTowards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments[14]. The resolution acknowledges\r\nthe objectives and integration hurdles identified in the Green Paper and calls\r\nfor legislative action in different areas concerning card payments, while\r\nsuggesting more caution regarding internet and mobile payments due to the\r\nlesser maturity of those markets. Furthermore, it calls\r\nfor a reform of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) governance model.\nThe consultation\r\nresults called for important regulatory adjustments to the existing framework, in\r\norder to reinforce the effectiveness of the European payments market and\r\ncontribute to a payment environment nurturing competition, innovation and\r\nsecurity.\nUse of expertise\nRegarding the review of the PSD and of the Regulation on\r\ncross-border payments in the Internal Market, and the potential need for a\r\nrevision of both legal texts, the Commission engaged in additional work to obtain\r\nevidence in the field and to ensure full engagement of the different\r\nstakeholders.\nThe Commission\u2019s review process on the impact of the PSD and the\r\nRegulation on cross-border payments in the Internal Market has been based on\r\ntwo dedicated external studies. These studies have provided the Commission with\r\na comprehensive picture of the economic and legal consequences arising from the\r\nPSD. The first study, carried out by external consultants Tipik in 2011,\r\nprovided a legal conformity assessment regarding the transposition of the PSD\r\nin the 27 Member States[15].\r\nOver the course of 2012, a second study prepared by London Economics and iff in\r\nassociation with PaySys, analysed the impact of the PSD on payment services in\r\nthe internal market and the application of the Regulation on cross-border\r\npayments in the Community. Furthermore, input by Member States and relevant\r\nmarket actors was gathered via the Commission's advisory committees in the\r\nfield of payments policy, i.e. the Payments Committee (composed of representatives\r\nfrom EU countries) and the Payment Systems Market Expert Group (composed of\r\nmarket representatives from both the supply and the demand side). In addition,\r\nthe Commission consulted further relevant stakeholders on particular issues as\r\nappropriate.\nImpact assessment \nThe Commission carried out an Impact Assessment[16], where it analysed the\r\npotential consequences of a lack of an integrated European payments market.\r\nNotably the following problem drivers were examined: \n\u2013                        \r\nInconsistent application of the existing rules\r\nacross Member States due to many options and often very general criteria of\r\napplication. In particular, certain exemptions set out in the PSD appear too\r\ngeneral or outdated with regard to market developments and are being\r\ninterpreted very differently. Gaps in the scope of application also arise for\r\npayments with one leg of the transaction located outside the EEA and payments\r\nin non-EU currencies, leading to continued market fragmentation, regulatory\r\narbitrage, and distortions of competition. \n\u2013                        \r\nLegal vacuum for certain newly emerged internet\r\nservice providers, such as third party service providers offering online\r\nbanking based payment initiation. These services represent a viable and often\r\ncheaper payment alternative to card payments, attractive also for consumers who\r\ndo not dispose of cards. Most of these providers are currently not subject to\r\nthe current legal framework as they do not hold funds at any moment. The legal\r\nvacuum risks impeding innovation and appropriate market access conditions.\n\u2013                        \r\nLack of standardisation and inter-operability\r\nbetween different payment solutions (card, internet and mobile payments), in\r\nvarying aspects and to different degrees especially at cross-border level,\r\nexacerbated by weak governance arrangements for the EU retail payments market.\n\u2013                        \r\nDiverse and inconsistent charging practices (for\r\nthe use of a specific payment instrument applied by merchants) between Member\r\nStates (where around half of EU Member States allow and the other half forbids\r\nsurcharging) leading to confusion for consumers when they shop abroad or on the\r\ninternet and an un-level playing field.\n\u2013                        \r\nIn the area of payment cards, several\r\nrestrictive business rules and practices distorting competition (regardings\r\nMIFs and rules on choice and flexibility of merchants regarding card\r\nacceptance).\nThe identified\r\nproblems described above have resulted in consequences for consumers,\r\nmerchants, new payment services providers and the payment services market as a\r\nwhole. \nThe impact assessment concluded that the\r\nbest policy options to improve the existing situation by (i) facilitating the\r\nemergence of a competitive level playing field between incumbents and new\r\nproviders of card, internet and mobile payments, (ii) increasing the\r\nefficiency, transparency and choice of payment instruments for payment services\r\nusers (consumers and merchants) and (iii) ensuring a high level protection of\r\nthe latter would be, with respect to the PSD:\n\u2013                        \r\nTo reinforce the SEPA project and to empower all\r\nstakeholders to take a more active role in the conception and realisation of\r\nthe retail payments policy (governance);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo facilitate standardisation through adequate\r\ngovernance framework and through the better involvement of the European\r\nStandardisation Organisations (standardisation);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo ensure legal certainty in the field of\r\ninterchange fees for card-based payments and provide clarity on an acceptable\r\nbusiness model for current and future payment initiatives based on cards\r\n(interchange fees);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo abolish restrictive business rules for card\r\npayments which lead to market distortions (interchange fees flanking measures);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo harmonise the Member States policies on\r\nsurcharging in line with the regulatory decisions on interchange fees\r\n(interchange fees flanking measures);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo define conditions of access to the information\r\non the availability of funds for third party providers, including payment\r\ninitiation services (scope of the PSD); \n\u2013                        \r\nTo adjust the scope and improve the consistency\r\nof the legislative framework (scope of the PSD);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo improve the implementation of the existing\r\nPSD (PSD fine-tuning measures);\n\u2013                        \r\nTo reinforce the rights of PSUs and safeguard\r\nthe consumer rights in view of the regulatory changes (scope of the PSD,\r\ninterchange fee flanking measures).\nThe impact assessment received a positive\r\nopinion of the Impact Assessment Board during a hearing of 20 March 2013. In\r\naccordance with the Board recommendations, several changes were made to the\r\ndocument, notably in:\n\u2013                        \r\nsubstantiating the urgency for the revision of\r\nthe Payment Services Directive (PSD) as well as the reasons for regulating MIF\r\nthrough legislation,\n\u2013                        \r\nstreamlining the presentation of impacts by\r\nfocussing on the impacts of the most important options in the main text and\r\nmoving less significant issues to annexes,\n\u2013                        \r\nbetter explaining the interdependencies between\r\ndifferent options and packages.\nMost of the proposed policy measures are\r\naddressed in the current proposal. This applies especially to the areas already\r\ncovered by the current rules in the PSD, e.g. market access for TPPs,\r\nsurcharging and rules for payment institutions. Other measures, in particular\r\nthe regulation of MIFs and ancillary measures, will be addressed by a dedicated\r\nlegislative proposal, submitted in parallel.\nSome measures described above should be addressed\r\nthrough non-legislative means, for example issues relating to the involvement\r\nof European Standardisation Organisations and SEPA governance. \nThe SEPA governance arrangements in place,\r\nincluding the role of the existing SEPA Council, an ad-hoc high level governing\r\nbody, which has been put in place under the co-chairmanship of the Commission\r\nand the European Central bank for an initial period of three years in order to\r\nimprove stakeholders\u2019 involvement in SEPA, need to be strengthened. To this\r\nend, the mandate of the SEPA Council needs to be clarified, its composition\r\nreviewed and a better balance of interest of the supply and the demand side established,\r\nto ensure effective advice to Commission and the European Central Bank as\r\nregards the orientation of the SEPA project in the future and to facilitate the\r\ncreation of an integrated, competitive and innovative market for retail\r\npayments, in particular in the Euro area. The Commission will work with the European\r\nCentral Bank to identify appropriate ways to address the tasks, composition,\r\nchairmanship and functioning of the governance arrangements around SEPA.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis \nThe current proposal is based on Article\r\n114 TFEU.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nAn integrated EU\r\nmarket for electronic retail payments market contributes to the aim of Article\r\n3 of the Treaty on the European Union stipulating an internal market. Market\r\nintegration is necessary to fully unlock a number of benefits for European\r\ncitizens. These benefits include more competition between payment service\r\nproviders and more choice, innovation and security for payment service users,\r\nespecially consumers. An integrated payments market ultimately facilitates the\r\ncross-border provision of goods and services and thereby contributes to a\r\ngenuine Single Market. The depth of revision of the Payment Services Directive\r\nis proportionate to the issues arisen to date. The Directive remains globally\r\nfit for purpose; at the same time, the EU legal framework needs to evolve to\r\ntake due account of the latest technological and business developments in the\r\narea of retail payments. \nBy its nature, an integrated payments market, based on networks that\r\nreach beyond national borders, requires a Union-wide approach as the applicable\r\nprinciples, rules, processes and standards have to be consistent across all\r\nMember States in order to achieve legal certainty and a level playing field for\r\nall relevant market participants. Given the current fragmentation in the\r\nmarket, individual action at the level of Member States would not be able to\r\nachieve the aim of an integrated and efficient payment market for both domestic\r\nand cross-border goods and services. \nThe approach supports the further enhancement of the Single Euro\r\nPayments Area (SEPA) and is consistent with the Digital Agenda, in particular\r\nthe creation of a Digital Single Market. It will promote technological\r\ninnovation and contribute to new growth and jobs, in particular in the areas of\r\ne- and m-commerce.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Directive has a budgetary impact as indicated in the Legislative\r\nFinancial Statement attached to the proposal. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional information \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend\r\nto the European Economic Area.\nExplanatory documents\nThe proposed new Directive contains several adaptations to the existing\r\nDirective and certain new obligations for Member States with a fair margin of\r\ndiscretion with respect to the way these obligations are transposed in national\r\nlaw, such as the new provisions on security. Member States are therefore asked\r\nto provide explanatory documents in relation to the transposition measures to\r\nbe adopted to allow the Commission to better identify the relevant national\r\nmeasures and monitoring the correct transposition of the Directive. \nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nThe following short summary aims to facilitate the decision making\r\nprocess by sketching the main modifications compared to the to be repealed PSD:\nArticle 2 \u2013 Scope: It is proposed to\r\nextend the scope both as regards the geographical scope and currencies being\r\ncovered. \nArticle 2(1): The PSD\u2019s provisions on\r\ntransparency and information requirements will also apply in relation to\r\npayment transactions to third countries, when only one of the payment service\r\nproviders is located within the European Union (so called \u2018one-leg\r\ntransactions\u2019), as regards those parts of the payments transaction which are\r\ncarried out in the European Union. \nArticle 2(2): The PSD\u2019s provisions on\r\ntransparency and information requirements will be extended to apply to all\r\ncurrencies and not, as currently, only to EU currencies.\nArticle 3 \u2013\r\nNegative scope: This provision clarifies and\r\nupdates the \u2018negative scope\u2019 provided for in the current Directive, which\r\nexempts a number of payments (related) activities from the scope of the PSD:\nArticle 3(b): The \u2018commercial agent\u2019 exemption has been amended to only apply to\r\ncommercial agents which act on behalf of either the payer or the payee, and not\r\nto those which act for both payer and the payee. The exemption under the\r\ncurrent PSD has increasingly been used with regard to payment transactions\r\nhandled by e-commerce platforms on behalf of both the seller (payee) and the buyer\r\n(payer). This use goes beyond the purpose of the exemption and should thus be\r\nfurther circumscribed. \nArticle 3(k): The \u2018limited network\u2019 exemption has increasingly been applied to\r\nlarge networks involving high payment volumes and ranges of products and\r\nservices. This clearly goes beyond the original purpose of this exemption,\r\nleaving large volumes of payments outside the regulatory framework and creating\r\na competitive disadvantage for regulated market actors. The new definition,\r\nwhich is in line with the definition of limited networks set out in Directive\r\n2009/110/EC, should contribute to reducing these risks.\nArticle 3(l): The current digital content or \u2018telecom\u2019 exemption is redefined\r\nwith a more restricted focus as it will apply exclusively to ancillary payment\r\nservices carried out by providers of electronic communication networks or services,\r\nas for example telecom operators. The exemption will apply for the provision of\r\ndigital content furnished by a third party, subject to certain thresholds set\r\nout in this directive. The new definition should ensure a level playing field\r\nbetween different providers and address in a more efficient way the consumer\r\nprotection needs in the context of payments.\nDeletion of old\r\nArticle 3(o): The exemption of ATM services offered\r\nby independent ATM deployers from the PSD led to the creation of ATM networks where\r\nconsumers were charged high fees for ATM withdrawals. It appears that this\r\nprovision has provided incentives to the existing bank-owned ATM networks to\r\ncancel their current contractual relation with other payment service providers\r\nin order to be able to charge higher fees directly on consumers. Consequently,\r\nthis exemption should be deleted. \nArticle 9 -\r\nSafeguarding requirements: These requirements will\r\nbe streamlined and the safeguarding requirements for payment institutions\r\nlicensed under the PSD will be harmonised further, in particular reducing\r\ncurrent possibilities for Member States to limit safeguarding requirements and\r\nreduce the number of possible safeguarding methods with a view to an enhanced level\r\nplaying field and improved legal certainty.\nArticle 14 \u2013 European\r\nelectronic access point within EBA: A unique\r\nelectronic access point should provide\r\nfor enhanced transparency of authorised and registered payment institutions by providing\r\nfor the interconnection at Union level of national public registers. \nArticle 27 \u2013\r\nConditions: The possibility to use a \u2018lighter\r\nregime\u2019 for \u2018small payment institutions\u2019 will be expanded to cover a higher\r\nnumber of small institutions, given that some Member States have had negative\r\nexperiences (such as insolvency) with small payment service providers with\r\nactivities beyond the current threshold for the waiver regime. The purpose is\r\nto achieve the right balance and on the one hand, avoid unnecessary regulatory\r\nburden for very small institutions and, on the other hand, making sure that\r\npayment services\u2019 users enjoy an adequate level of protection. \nArticle 29 \u2013\r\nAccess to payment systems: This Article fine-tunes\r\nthe rules around access to payment systems by clarifying the conditions of\r\nnon-direct access of payment institutions to payment systems designated under\r\nDirective 98/26/EC (Settlement Finality Directive) in a way comparable to the\r\naccess used by smaller credit institutions. \nArticle 55(3)\r\nand (4) \u2013 Charges applicable: This rule will harmonise surcharging practices further, taking due account of\r\nDirective 2011/83 on consumer rights and of the Commission proposal for a\r\nRegulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\ninterchange fees for card-based payment transactions, which is being presented\r\nin parallel. The flexibility under the current PSD, allowing merchants to\r\nrequest from the payer a charge, offer him a reduction\r\nor otherwise steer him towards the use of the most\r\nefficient payment means, with the qualifier that Member States may forbid or limit\r\nany such surcharging for its territory, has led to extreme heterogeneity in the\r\nmarket. Thirteen Member States have used this option to prohibit surcharges\r\nunder the current PSD. The different regimes in place in Member States create\r\nproblems and confusion for merchants and consumers alike, notably when selling\r\nor purchasing goods and services cross-border via the internet. The proposed prohibition\r\nof surcharging is directly linked to the capping of interchange fees according\r\nto the abovementioned proposal for a Regulation on\r\ninterchange fees for card-based transactions. Given the\r\nsignificant reduction of the fees that the merchant will have to pay to his\r\nbank, surcharging is no longer justified for the MIF-regulated cards which will\r\nrepresent more than 95% of the consumer card market. The proposed rules will thus\r\ncontribute to a better consumer experience when paying with a card throughout\r\nthe Union and to a greater usage of payment cards instead of use of cash. \nAs regards cards\r\nnot subject to the Regulation of interchange fees as per the abovementioned\r\nproposal on interchange fees for card-based transactions, i.e. corporate cards\r\nand three-party scheme cards, merchants will still be allowed to surcharge, as\r\nlong as the surcharge corresponds to the real cost incurred, taking due account\r\nof Directive 2011/83. Articles 65 and 66 \u2013 Payment service provider\u2019s and\r\npayer\u2019s liability for unauthorised payment transactions: The proposed modifications will streamline\r\nand further harmonise the liability rules in case of unauthorised transactions,\r\n, ensuring enhanced protection of the legitimate interests of payment users. Except\r\nin case of fraud and gross negligence, the maximum amount a payment user could\r\nunder any circumstances be obliged to pay in case of an unauthorised payment transaction\r\nwill be decreased from the current amount of 150 EUR to 50 EUR. It will also\r\nclarify that late payments do not necessarily trigger a refund. \nArticle 67 \u2013\r\nRefunds for payment transactions initiated by or through a payee: This rule clarifies the refund right for direct debit transactions bringing it\r\nin line with the SEPA Core Direct Debit Rulebook, provided that the good or\r\nservice paid for has not yet been consumed. Under the current rules, different\r\nrefund regimes apply regarding direct debits, depending on whether a prior authorisation\r\nhas been given, the amount exceeds the amount expected or whether,\r\nalternatively, a further right had been agreed.\nArticle 85 \u2013\r\nSecurity measures: The proposed rules address security aspects and aspects of authentication in line with\r\nthe Commission proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and Council\r\non Network and Information Security.\nTitle I-V and Annex\r\nI point 7: Coverage of new services and service providers enabling access to\r\npayment accounts - The current PSD does not cover\r\nthese actors insofar as they do not dispose of the payer\u2019s or payee\u2019s fund at\r\nany time. The fact that these TPPs are currently unregulated, at least in\r\ncertain Member States, has raised security, data protection and liability\r\nconcerns, despite the potential benefits brought by these services and service\r\nproviders. The proposal brings third party service providers offering notably online banking based\r\npayment initiation services under the scope of the PSD\r\n(Annex I point 7). This should enhance new low cost e-payment solutions on the\r\ninternet while ensuring appropriate security, data protection and liability\r\nstandards. In order to be allowed to provide payment initiation services, TPPs\r\nwould be required to get licensed or registered and supervised as payment\r\ninstitutions (Title II. Like other payment service providers, they will be\r\nsubject to harmonised rights and obligations, and in particular security\r\nrequirements (Articles 85 and 86). The envisaged rules will in particular address\r\nconditions for access to account information (Article 58)requirements regarding\r\nauthentication (Article 87) and rectification of transactions (Articles 63 and\r\n64) and a balanced liability repartition (Articles 65 and 66). New payment services\r\nproviders will benefit from this new regime, regardless of whether they dispose\r\nof the payer\u2019s or payee\u2019s funds at any time. \nChapter 6 -\r\nOut-of-Court complaint and redress procedures for the settlement of disputes -\r\nshall enhance effective compliance with the\r\nDirective. The new measures update the requirements on out of court complaint\r\nand redress procedures and appropriate penalties. \nArticle 92 \u2013 Sanctions: In line with\r\nother recent proposals in the financial services sector, Member States will be obliged to align administrative sanctions,\r\nensure that appropriate administrative measures and sanctions are available for\r\nbreaches of the Directive and ensure that these sanctions are duly applied.\nEuropean Banking Authority \u2013 The Directive contains several areas where work by EBA in its capacity\r\nof contributing to the consistent and coherent functioning of supervision is\r\nforeseen (as referred to in Regulation (EU) 1093/2010). In particular, EBA will\r\nbe asked to issue guidelines and draft regulatory technical standards in\r\nvarious fields, for example in order to clarify the rules on \u2018passporting\u2019 for\r\npayment institutions operating in several Member States, or to ensure the establishment\r\nof adequate security requirements. \n2013/0264 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non payment services in the internal market\r\nand amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing\r\nDirective 2007/64/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[17],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Central Bank[18]\r\n\nAfter consulting the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years,\r\nsignificant progress has been achieved integrating retail payments in the Union,\r\nin particular in the context of the Union acts on payments, notably Directive\r\n2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[19], Regulation (EC) No 924/2009\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[20],\r\nDirective 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[21], and Regulation (EU) No\r\n260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[22]. Directive 2011/83/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[23]\r\nhas further complemented the legal framework for payment services by setting a\r\nspecific limit on the possibility for retailers to surcharge their customers\r\nfor the use of a certain means of payment. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/64/EC has\r\nbeen adopted in December 2007 on the basis of a Commission proposal of December\r\n2005. Since then, the retail payments market has experienced significant\r\ntechnical innovations with the rapid growth in the number of electronic and mobile\r\npayments and the emergence of new types of payments services in the market\r\nplace. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review of the Union legal\r\nframework on payment services and notably the analysis of the impact of\r\nDirective 2007/64/EC and the consultation on the Commission Green Paper \u201cTowards\r\nan integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments\u201d[24] have shown that developments\r\nhave given rise to important challenges from a regulatory perspective.\r\nImportant areas of the payments market, in particular card payments, internet\r\nand mobile payments are often still fragmented along national borders. Many\r\ninnovative payment products or services do not fall, entirely or in large\r\nparts, under the scope of Directive 2007/64/EC. Furthermore, the scope of\r\nDirective 2007/64/EC and in particular, the elements excluded therefrom, as\r\ncertain payment-related activities from the general rules, proved in a few\r\ncases too ambiguous, too general or simply outdated, taking into account the\r\nmarket developments. This has resulted in legal uncertainty, potential security\r\nrisks in the payment chain and a lack of consumer protection in certain areas.\r\nFor innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services it has proven to be\r\ndifficult to take off and provide consumers and retailers with effective,\r\nconvenient and secure payment methods in the Union. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishing an integrated\r\nsingle market for electronic payments is crucial in order to ensure that\r\nconsumers, merchants and companies enjoy the full benefits of the internal\r\nmarket, given the development of the digital economy. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New rules should be\r\nprovided in order to close the regulatory gaps while at the same time providing\r\nfor more legal clarity and ensuring a consistent application of the legislative\r\nframework across the Union. Equivalent operating conditions should be\r\nguaranteed to both existing and new players on the market, facilitating new\r\nmeans of payment to reach a broader market and ensuring a high level of\r\nconsumer protection in the use of these payment services across the whole of the\r\nUnion. This should lead to a downward trend in costs and prices for payment\r\nservices users and more choice and transparency of payment services. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, the\r\nsecurity risks related electronic payments have increased, which is due to the greater\r\ntechnical complexity of electronic payments, the continuously growing volumes\r\nof electronic payments worldwide and the emerging types of payment services. As\r\nsafe and secure payment services constitute a vital condition for a\r\nwell-functioning payment services market, users of payment services should be\r\nadequately protected against such risks. Payment services are essential for the\r\nmaintenance of vital economic and societal activities and therefore payment\r\nservices providers such as credit institutions have been qualified as market\r\noperators according to Article 3(8) of Directive [pls insert number of NIS\r\nDirective after adoption] of the European Parliament and of the Council[25].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the general\r\nmeasures to be taken at Member States' level in Directive [pls insert number\r\nof NIS Directive after adoption], the security risks related to payment\r\ntransactions should also be addressed at the level of the payment service\r\nproviders. The security measures to be taken by the payment service providers need\r\nto be proportionate to the security risks concerned. A regular reporting\r\nmechanism should be established, so as to ensure payment services should\r\nprovide the competent authorities on an annual basis with updated information\r\non the assessment of their security risks and the (additional) measures that\r\nthey have taken in response to these risks. Furthermore, in order to ensure\r\nthat damages to other payment service providers and payment systems, such as a\r\nsubstantial disruption of a payment system and to users is kept to a minimum,\r\nit is essential that payment service providers have the obligation to report\r\nwithin undue delay major security incidents to the European Banking Authority. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The revised regulatory\r\nframework for payment services is complemented by Regulation (EU) [XX/XX/XX] of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[26].\r\nThat Regulation introduces rules with regard to the charging of multilateral\r\nand bilateral interchange fees for all consumer debit and credit card\r\ntransactions and electronic and mobile payments based on those transactions,\r\nand puts restrictions on the use of certain business rules with regard to card\r\ntransactions. That Regulation aims at further accelerating the achievement of\r\nan effective integrated market for card based payments.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\ndivergent approaches across Member States to the detriment of consumers, the\r\nprovisions on transparency and information requirements for payment service\r\nproviders in this Directive should also apply to transactions where the payer's\r\nor payee's payment service provider is located within the European Economic\r\nArea (hereinafter \u201cEEA\u201d) and the other payment service provider is located\r\noutside the EEA. It is also appropriate to extend the application of\r\ntransparency and information provisions to transactions in all currencies\r\nbetween payment service providers that are located within the EEA.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The definition of payment\r\nservices should be technologically neutral and allow for the further\r\ndevelopment of new types of payment services, while ensuring equivalent\r\noperating conditions for both existing and new payment service providers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exemption of payment\r\ntransactions through a commercial agent on behalf of the payer or the payee, as\r\nestablished in Directive 2007/64/EC is being applied very differently in the Member\r\nStates. Certain Member States allow the use of the exemption by e-commerce\r\nplatforms that act as an intermediary on behalf of both individual buyers and\r\nsellers without a real margin to negotiate or conclude the sale or purchase of\r\ngoods or services. That goes beyond the intended scope of the exemption and may\r\nincrease risks for the consumers, as these providers remain outside the\r\nprotection of the legal framework. Different application practices also distort\r\ncompetition in the payment market. The definition should become more precise\r\nand clearer to address these concerns.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feedback from the market\r\nshows that the payment activities covered by the limited network exception\r\noften comprise massive payment volumes and values and offer to consumers\r\nhundreds or thousands of different products and services, which does not fit the\r\npurpose of the limited network exemption as provided for in Directive\r\n2007/64/EC. That implies greater risks and no legal protection for payment service\r\nusers, in particular for consumers and clear disadvantages for regulated market\r\nactors. A more precise description of a limited network, in line with Directive\r\n2009/110/EC, is necessary in order to limit those risks. A payment instrument\r\nshould thus be considered to be used within such a limited network if it can be\r\nused only either for the purchase of goods and services in a specific store or\r\nchain of stores, or for a limited range of goods or services, regardless of the\r\ngeographical location of the point of sale. Such instruments could include\r\nstore cards, petrol cards, membership cards, public transport cards, meal\r\nvouchers or vouchers for specific services, which are sometimes subject to a\r\nspecific tax or labour legal framework designed to promote the use of such\r\ninstruments to meet the objectives laid down in social legislation. Where such\r\na specific-purpose instrument develops into a general purpose instrument, the\r\nexemption from the scope of this Directive should no longer apply. Instruments\r\nwhich can be used for purchases in stores of listed merchants should not be\r\nexempted from the scope of this Directive as such instruments are typically\r\ndesigned for a network of service providers which is continuously growing. The\r\nexemption should apply in combination with the obligation of potential payment\r\nservice providers to notify activities falling within the scope of the\r\ndefinition of a limited network.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/64/EC exempts\r\nfrom its scope certain payment transactions by means of telecom or information\r\ntechnology devices where the network operator not only acts as an intermediary for\r\nthe delivery of digital goods and services through the device in question, but also\r\nadds value to these goods or services. In particular, this exemption allows for\r\nso called operator billing or direct to phone-bill purchases which, starting\r\nwith ringing tones and premium SMS-services, contributes to the development of\r\nnew business models based on low-value sale of digital content. Feedback from\r\nthe market shows no evidence that this payment method, trusted by consumers as\r\nconvenient for low threshold payments, has developed into a general payment\r\nintermediation service. However, due to the ambiguous wording of the current\r\nexemption, this rule has been implemented differently in Member States. This\r\ntranslates into lack of legal certainty for operators and consumers and has occasionally\r\nallowed other payment intermediation services to claim eligibility for the\r\nexemption of the application of Directive 2007/64/EC. It is therefore appropriate\r\nto narrow down the scope of that Directive. The exemption should focus\r\nspecifically on micro-payments for digital content, such as ringtones,\r\nwallpapers, music, games, videos, or applications. The exemption should only\r\napply to payment services when provided as ancillary services to electronic\r\ncommunications services (i.e. the core business of the operator concerned). \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, Directive\r\n2007/64/EC exempted from its scope payment services offered by deployers of automated\r\nteller machines (hereinafter \u201cATMs\u201d) independent from banks or other payment\r\nservice providers. Originally devised as incentive to install stand-alone ATMs\r\nin remote and poorly populated areas by allowing them to charge extra fees on\r\ntop of fees paid to the payment service providers that issued the card, the\r\nprovision was not intended to be used by ATM providers with networks comprising\r\nhundreds or even thousands of ATMs, covering one or more Member States. It\r\nleads to non-application of that Directive to a growing part of the ATM market,\r\nwith negative effects on the consumer protection. It also incentivises the\r\nexisting ATM providers to redesign their business model and cancel the usual\r\ncontractual relation with the payment service providers in order to charge higher\r\nfees directly on the consumers. Consequently, the exemption should be deleted. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Service providers seeking\r\nto benefit from an exemption under Directive 2007/64/EC often do not consult\r\nauthorities on whether their activities are covered or exempted under that Directive\r\nbut rely on their own assessments. It appears that some exemptions may have\r\nbeen used by payment service providers to redesign business models so that the\r\npayment activities offered would be outside the scope of that Directive. This\r\nmay result in increased risks for payment service users and diverging\r\nconditions for payment service providers in the internal market. Service\r\nproviders should therefore be obliged to notify certain activities to the\r\ncompetent authorities, to ensure a homogenous interpretation of the rules\r\nthroughout the internal market. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to include\r\na requirement for potential payment service providers to notify their intention\r\nto provide activities in the framework of a limited network if the volume of payment\r\ntransactions is above a certain threshold. Competent authorities should examine\r\nand take a motivated decision on the basis of the criteria set out in Article\r\n3(k) whether those activities can be considered activities provided in the\r\nframework of a limited network.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new rules should follow\r\nthe approach taken in Directive 2007/64/EC, covering all types of electronic\r\npayment services. It is therefore still not appropriate that the new rules\r\napply to services where the transfer of funds from the payer to the payee or\r\ntheir transport is executed solely in bank notes and coins or where the\r\ntransfer is based on a paper cheque, paper-based bill of exchange, promissory\r\nnote or other instrument, paper-based vouchers or cards drawn upon a payment\r\nservice provider or other party with a view to placing funds at the disposal of\r\nthe payee. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the adoption of\r\nDirective 2007/64/EC new types of payment services have emerged, especially in\r\nthe area of internet payments. In particular, third party providers (hereinafter\r\n\u201cTPPs\u201d) have evolved, offering so-called payment initiation services to\r\nconsumers and merchants, often without entering into the possession of the\r\nfunds to be transferred. Those services facilitate the e-commerce payments by\r\nestablishing a software bridge between the website of the merchant and the\r\nonline banking platform of the consumer in order to initiate internet payments\r\non the basis of credit transfers or direct debits. The TPPs offer a low-cost\r\nalternative to card payments for both merchants and consumers and provide\r\nconsumers a possibility to shop online even if they do not possess credit\r\ncards. However, as TPPs are currently not subject to Directive 2007/64/EC, they\r\nare not necessarily supervised by a competent authority and do not follow the\r\nrequirements of Directive 2007/64/EC. This raises a series of legal issues, such\r\nas consumer protection, security and liability as well as competition and data\r\nprotection issues. The new rules should therefore respond to those issues. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money remittance is a\r\nsimple payment service that is usually based on cash provided by a payer to a\r\npayment service provider, which remits the corresponding amount, for example\r\nvia communication network, to a payee or to another payment service provider\r\nacting on behalf of the payee. In some Member States supermarkets, merchants\r\nand other retailers provide to the public a corresponding service enabling the\r\npayment of utility and other regular household bills. Those bill-paying\r\nservices should be treated as money remittance, unless the competent\r\nauthorities consider the activity to fall under another payment service.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to specify\r\nthe categories of payment service providers which may legitimately provide\r\npayment services throughout the Union, namely, credit institutions which take\r\ndeposits from users that can be used to fund payment transactions and which\r\nshould continue to be subject to the prudential requirements under Directive 2013/36/EC\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[27],\r\nelectronic money institutions which issue electronic money that can be used to\r\nfund payment transactions and which should continue to be subject to the\r\nprudential requirements under Directive 2009/110/EC, payment institutions and\r\npost office giro institutions which are so entitled under national law.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should lay\r\ndown rules on the execution of payment transactions where the funds are\r\nelectronic money as provided for in Directive 2009/110/EC. This Directive\r\nshould, however, neither regulate issuance of electronic money nor amend the\r\nprudential regulation of electronic money institutions as provided for in that Directive.\r\nTherefore, payment institutions should not be allowed to issue electronic\r\nmoney.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/64/EC has\r\nestablished a prudential regime, introducing a single license for all providers\r\nof payment services which are not connected to taking deposits or issuing\r\nelectronic money. To that end, Directive 2007/64/EC introduced a new category\r\nof payment service providers, \"payment institutions\", by providing\r\nfor the authorisation, subject to a set of strict and comprehensive conditions,\r\nof legal persons outside the existing categories to provide payment services\r\nthroughout the Union. Thus, the same conditions should apply Union-wide to such\r\nservices.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conditions for granting\r\nand maintaining authorisation as payment institutions have not substantially\r\nchanged. As in Directive 2007/64/EC, the conditions include prudential\r\nrequirements proportionate to the operational and financial risks faced by such\r\nbodies in the course of their business. In this connection, there is a need for\r\na sound regime of initial capital combined with on-going capital which could be\r\nelaborated in a more sophisticated way in due course depending on the needs of\r\nthe market. Due to the range of variety in the payments services area, this\r\nDirective should allow various methods combined with a certain range of\r\nsupervisory discretion to ensure that the same risks are treated the same way\r\nfor all payment service providers. The requirements for the payment\r\ninstitutions should reflect the fact that payment institutions engage in more\r\nspecialised and limited activities, thus generating risks that are narrower and\r\neasier to monitor and control than those that arise across the broader spectrum\r\nof activities of credit institutions. In particular, payment institutions\r\nshould be prohibited from accepting deposits from users and permitted to use\r\nfunds received from users only for rendering payment services. The required\r\nprudential rules including the initial capital should be appropriate to the\r\nrisk related to the respective payment service provided by the payment\r\ninstitution. Services solely enabling access to payment accounts, but without\r\noffering any accounts, should be considered of a medium risk with regard to the\r\ninitial capital. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor client funds to be kept separate from the payment institution's funds for\r\nother business activities. However, safeguarding requirements seem only\r\nnecessary when a payment institution is in possession of the clients\u2019 funds.\r\nPayment institutions should also be subject to effective anti-money laundering\r\nand anti-terrorist financing requirements.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\r\nintroduce changes in the obligations of payment institutions with regard to\r\ntheir account reporting and the account audits on their annual and consolidated\r\naccounts. Payment institutions should draw up their annual and consolidated\r\naccounts in accordance with Council Directive 78/660/EEC[28] and, where applicable, Council\r\nDirective 83/349/EEC[29]\r\nand Council Directive 86/635/EEC[30].\r\nThe annual accounts and consolidated accounts should be audited, unless the\r\npayment institution is exempted from this obligation under Directive 78/660/EEC\r\nand, where applicable, Directives 83/349/EEC and 86/635/EEC.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With technological\r\ndevelopments a range of complementary services have also emerged in recent\r\nyears, such as account information and account aggregation services. These\r\nservices should also be covered by this Directive in order to provide consumers\r\nwith adequate protection and legal certainty about their status. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Payment service providers when\r\nengaging in the provision of one or more of the payment services covered by\r\nthis Directive should always hold payment accounts used exclusively for payment\r\ntransactions. For payment institutions to be able to provide payment services,\r\nit is indispensable that they have access to payment accounts. Member States should\r\nensure that such access is provided in a way proportionate to the legitimate\r\naim it intends to serve. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\r\nregulate the granting of credit by payment institutions, i.e. the granting of\r\ncredit lines and the issuance of credit cards, only where it is closely linked\r\nto payment services. Only if credit is granted in order to facilitate payment\r\nservices and such credit is of a short-term nature and is granted for a period\r\nnot exceeding 12 months, including on a revolving basis, it is appropriate to\r\nallow payment institutions to grant such credit with regard to their\r\ncross-border activities, on condition that it is refinanced using mainly the\r\npayment institution's own funds, as well as other funds from the capital\r\nmarkets, but not the funds held on behalf of clients for payment services. Such\r\nrules should be without prejudice to Council Directive 2008/48/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[31]\r\nor other relevant Union or national legislation regarding conditions for\r\ngranting credit to consumers not harmonised by this Directive.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the functioning of\r\nthe cooperation between the competent national authorities responsible for\r\ngranting authorisations to payment institutions, carrying out controls and\r\ndeciding on the withdrawal of those authorisations, has proven to work satisfactorily.\r\nHowever, the cooperation between the competent authorities should be enhanced,\r\nboth with regard to the information exchanged as well as a coherent application\r\nand interpretation of the Directive, in cases where the authorised payment\r\ninstitution would like to provide payment services also in a Member State other\r\nthan its home Member State, in exercise of the right of establishment or the\r\nfreedom to provide services (\u201cpassporting\u201d). The European Banking Authority\r\n(EBA) should be asked to prepare a set of guidelines on the cooperation and\r\ndata exchange. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enhance transparency on\r\nthe payment institutions authorised by or registered with competent\r\nauthorities, including their agents and branches, a web portal serving as\r\nEuropean electronic access point should be established with EBA,\r\ninterconnecting the national registers. These measures should aim at contributing\r\nto the enhancement of the cooperation between the competent authorities. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The availability of\r\naccurate, updated information should be enhanced by requiring payment\r\ninstitutions to inform the competent authority of their home state without\r\nundue delay of any changes affecting the accuracy of the information and\r\nevidence provided with regard to the authorisation, including additional agents,\r\nbranches or entities to which activities are outsourced. The competent authorities should also verify, in case of doubts,\r\nthat the information received is correct. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While this Directive\r\nspecifies the minimum set of powers competent authorities should have when\r\nsupervising the compliance of payment institutions, these powers are to be\r\nexercised with respect to fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.\r\nFor the exercise of those powers which may amount to serious interferences with\r\nthe right to respect private and family life, home and communications, Member\r\nStates should have in place adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse\r\nor arbitrariness, for instance, where appropriate through prior authorisation\r\nfrom the judicial authority of the Member State concerned.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to ensure\r\nthat all persons providing remittance services are brought within the ambit of\r\ncertain minimum legal and regulatory requirements. Thus, it is desirable to\r\nrequire the registration of the identity and whereabouts of all persons\r\nproviding remittance services, including of persons which are unable to meet\r\nthe full range of conditions for authorisation as payment institutions. This\r\napproach is in line with the rationale of Special Recommendation VI of the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which foresees the provision of\r\na mechanism whereby payment service providers unable to meet all conditions set\r\nout in that Recommendation may nevertheless be treated as payment institutions.\r\nFor those purposes, Member States should enter such persons in the register of\r\npayment institutions while not applying all or part of the conditions for\r\nauthorisation. However, it is essential to make the possibility of waiver\r\nsubject to strict requirements relating to the volume of payment transactions.\r\nPayment institutions benefiting from a waiver should have neither the right of\r\nestablishment nor the freedom to provide services, nor should they indirectly\r\nexercise those rights when being a member of a payment system.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential for any\r\npayment service provider to be able to access the services of technical\r\ninfrastructures of payment systems. Such access should, however, be subject to\r\nappropriate requirements in order to ensure integrity and stability of those\r\nsystems. Each payment service provider applying for a participation in a\r\npayment system should furnish proof to the participants of the payment system\r\nthat its internal arrangements are sufficiently robust against all kinds of\r\nrisk. These payment systems typically include e.g. the four-party card schemes\r\nas well as major systems processing credit transfers and direct debits. In\r\norder to ensure equality of treatment throughout the Union as between the\r\ndifferent categories of authorised payment service providers, according to the\r\nterms of their licence, it is necessary to clarify the rules concerning access\r\nto the provision of payment services and access to payment systems. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision should be made\r\nfor the non-discriminatory treatment of authorised payment institutions and\r\ncredit institutions so that any payment service provider competing in the\r\ninternal market is able to use the services of the technical infrastructures of\r\nthese payment systems under the same conditions. It is appropriate to provide\r\nfor different treatment for authorised payment service providers and for those\r\nbenefiting from a waiver under this Directive as well as from the waiver under\r\nthe Article 3 of Directive 2009/110/EC, due to the differences in their respective\r\nprudential framework. In any case, differences in price conditions should be\r\nallowed only where this is motivated by differences in costs incurred by the\r\npayment service providers. This should be without prejudice to Member States'\r\nright to limit access to systemically important systems in accordance with\r\nDirective 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[32] and without prejudice to the\r\ncompetence of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central\r\nBanks (ESCB) concerning access to payment systems. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases, Member\r\nStates have granted indirect access to specific payment service providers to\r\ndesignated payment systems, in analogy to the provisions of Directive 98/26/EC.\r\nThis decision is at the discretion of the Member State concerned. However, to\r\nensure fair competition between payment service providers, this Directive should\r\nprovide that where a Member State has granted a payment service provider\r\nindirect access to such systems, other payment service providers which are in\r\nthe same situation should be benefit from the same, non-discriminatory\r\ntreatment. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, certain three\r\nparty payment systems in which the system acts as the sole payment service\r\nprovider for both the payer and the payee, have become respectable players in\r\nthe market for processing payments. It is therefore no longer justified to\r\nallow these systems to benefit from an exemption with regard to providing\r\naccess to other payment service providers, where other payment systems cannot\r\nbenefit from such exemption.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A set of rules should be\r\nestablished in order to ensure transparency of conditions and information\r\nrequirements for payment services.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should apply\r\nneither to payment transactions made in cash since a single payments market for\r\ncash already exists nor to payment transactions based on paper cheques since,\r\nby their nature, these cannot be processed as efficiently as other means of\r\npayment. Good practice in this area should, however, be based on the principles\r\nset out in this Directive.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As consumers and\r\nenterprises are not in the same position, they do not need the same level of\r\nprotection. While it is important to guarantee consumers' rights by provisions\r\nwhich cannot be derogated from by contract, it is reasonable to let enterprises\r\nand organisations agree otherwise when they are not dealing with consumers. However,\r\nMember States should have the possibility to provide that micro-enterprises, as\r\ndefined by Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[33], should be treated in the same\r\nway as consumers. In any case, certain core provisions of this Directive should\r\nalways be applicable irrespective of the status of the user.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\r\nspecify the obligations on payment service providers as regards the provision\r\nof information to the payment service users who should receive the same high\r\nlevel of clear information about payment services in order to make\r\nwell-informed choices and be able to choose freely within the Union. In the\r\ninterest of transparency this Directive should lay down the harmonised\r\nrequirements needed to ensure that necessary and sufficient information is\r\ngiven to the payment service users with regard to the payment service contract\r\nand the payment transactions. In order to promote smooth functioning of the single\r\nmarket in payment services, Member States should be able to adopt only those\r\ninformation provisions laid down in this Directive.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should be\r\nprotected against unfair and misleading practices in line with Directive\r\n2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and the Council[34] as well as Directive\r\n2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and the Council[35] and Directive 2002/65/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council[36].\r\nThe additional provisions in those Directives continue to be applicable. However,\r\nthe relationship of the pre-contractual information requirements between this\r\nDirective and Directive 2002/65/EC should, in particular, be clarified.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information required\r\nshould be proportionate to the needs of users and communicated in a standard format.\r\nHowever, the information requirements for a single payment transaction should\r\nbe different from those of a framework contract which provides for the series\r\nof payment transactions.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In practice, framework\r\ncontracts and the payment transactions covered by them are far more common and\r\neconomically important than single payment transactions. If there is a payment\r\naccount or a specific payment instrument, a framework contract is required.\r\nTherefore, the requirements for prior information on framework contracts should\r\nbe quite comprehensive and information should always be provided on paper or on\r\nanother durable medium, such as printouts by account printers, CD-ROMs, DVDs\r\nand hard drives of personal computers on which electronic mail can be stored,\r\nand Internet sites, as long as such sites are accessible for future reference\r\nfor a period of time adequate for the purposes of information and allow the\r\nunchanged reproduction of the information stored. However, it should be\r\npossible for the payment service provider and the payment service user to agree\r\nin the framework contract on the manner in which subsequent information on\r\nexecuted payment transactions is given, for instance, that in Internet banking\r\nall information on the payment account is made available online.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In single payment\r\ntransactions only the essential information should always be given on the\r\npayment service provider's own initiative. As the payer is usually present when\r\nhe gives the payment order, it is not necessary to require that information\r\nshould in every case be provided on paper or on another durable medium. The\r\npayment service provider may give information orally over the counter or make\r\nit otherwise easily accessible, for example by keeping the conditions on a\r\nnotice board on the premises. Information should also be given on where other\r\nmore detailed information is available (e.g. the address of the website).\r\nHowever, if the consumer so requests, the essential information should be given\r\non paper or on another durable medium.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\r\nprovide for the consumer's right to receive relevant information free of charge\r\nbefore being bound by any payment service contract. The consumer should also be\r\nable to request prior information as well as the framework contract, on paper,\r\nfree of charge at any time during the contractual relationship, so as to enable\r\nthem to compare payment service providers' services and their conditions and in\r\ncase of any dispute verify their contractual rights and obligations. Those\r\nprovisions should be compatible with Directive 2002/65/EC. The explicit\r\nprovisions on free information in this Directive should not have the effect of\r\nallowing charges to be imposed for the provision of information to consumers\r\nunder other applicable Directives.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way in which the\r\nrequired information is to be given by the payment service provider to the\r\npayment service user should take into account the needs of the latter as well\r\nas practical technical aspects and cost-efficiency depending on the situation\r\nwith regard to the agreement in the respective payment service contract. Thus,\r\nthis Directive should distinguish between two ways in which information is to\r\nbe given by the payment service provider: either the information should be\r\nprovided, i.e. actively communicated by the payment service provider at the\r\nappropriate time as required by this Directive without further prompting by the\r\npayment service user, or the information should be made available to the\r\npayment service user, taking into account any request he may have for further\r\ninformation. In the latter case, the payment service user should take some\r\nactive steps in order to obtain the information, such as requesting it\r\nexplicitly from the payment service provider, logging into bank account mail\r\nbox or inserting a bank card into printer for account statements. For such\r\npurposes the payment service provider should ensure that access to the\r\ninformation is possible and that the information is available to the payment\r\nservice user.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consumer should receive\r\nbasic information on executed payment transactions for no additional charge. In\r\nthe case of a single payment transaction the payment service provider should\r\nnot charge separately for this information. Similarly, the subsequent monthly\r\ninformation on payment transactions under a framework contract should be given\r\nfree of charge. However, taking into account the importance of transparency in\r\npricing and differing customer needs, the parties should be able to agree on\r\ncharges for more frequent or additional information. In order to take into\r\naccount different national practices, Member States should be allowed to set\r\nrules requiring that monthly paper-based statements of payment accounts are\r\nalways to be given free of charge.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate customer\r\nmobility, it should be possible for consumers to terminate a framework contract\r\nafter a year without incurring charges. For consumers, the period of notice\r\nagreed should be no longer than a month, and for payment service providers no\r\nshorter than two months. This Directive should be without prejudice to the\r\npayment service provider's obligation to terminate the payment service contract\r\nin exceptional circumstances under other relevant Union or national\r\nlegislation, such as legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing,\r\nany action targeting the freezing of funds, or any specific measure linked to\r\nthe prevention and investigation of crimes.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low value payment\r\ninstruments should be a cheap and easy-to-use alternative in the case of\r\nlow-priced goods and services and should not be overburdened by excessive\r\nrequirements. The relevant information requirements and rules on their\r\nexecution should therefore be limited to essential information, taking also\r\ninto account technical capabilities that can justifiably be expected from\r\ninstruments dedicated to low value payments. Despite the lighter regime payment\r\nservice users should benefit from adequate protection considering the limited\r\nrisks posed by those payment instruments, especially with regard to prepaid\r\npayment instruments.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to set up\r\nthe criteria under which TPPs are allowed to access and use the information on\r\nthe availability of funds on the payment service user account held with another\r\npayment service provider. In particular, necessary data protection and security\r\nrequirements set or referred to in this Directive or included in the EBA\r\nguidelines should be fulfilled by both the TPP and the payment service provider\r\nservicing the account of the payment service user. The payers should give an\r\nexplicit consent to the TPP to access their payment account and be properly\r\ninformed about the extent of this access. To allow the development of other\r\npayment services providers which cannot receive deposits, it is necessary that\r\ncredit institutions provide them with the information on the availability of\r\nfunds if the payer has given consent for this information to be communicated to\r\nthe payment service provider issuer of the payment instrument.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rights and obligations of\r\nthe payment service users and payment service providers should be appropriately\r\nadjusted to take account of the TPP involvement in the transaction whenever the\r\npayment initiation service is used. Specifically, a balanced liability\r\nrepartition between the payment service provider servicing the account and the\r\nTPP involved in the transaction should compel them to take responsibility for\r\nthe respective parts of the transaction that are under their control and\r\nclearly point to the responsible party in case of incidents. In case of fraud\r\nor dispute, the TPP should be under a specific obligation to provide the payer\r\nand the account servicing payment service provider with the reference of the\r\ntransactions and the information of the authorisation relating to the\r\ntransaction concerned.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce the\r\nrisks and consequences of unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment\r\ntransactions the payment service user should inform the payment service\r\nprovider as soon as possible about any contestations concerning allegedly unauthorised\r\nor incorrectly executed payment transactions provided that the payment service\r\nprovider has fulfilled its information obligations under this Directive. If the\r\nnotification deadline is met by the payment service user, it should be able to\r\npursue those claims within the prescription periods pursuant to national law.\r\nThis Directive should not affect other claims between payment service users and\r\npayment service providers.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of unauthorized\r\npayment transactions the payer should be refunded immediately the amount of the\r\nrespective transaction. In order to prevent the payer from any disadvantages,\r\nthe credit value date of the refund should not be later than the date when the\r\nrespective amount has been debited. In order to provide an incentive for the\r\npayment service user to notify, without undue delay, the provider of any theft\r\nor loss of a payment instrument and thus to reduce the risk of unauthorised\r\npayment transactions, the user should be liable only for a very limited amount,\r\nunless the payment service user has acted fraudulently or with gross\r\nnegligence. In this context an amount of EUR 50 seems to be adequate in order\r\nto ensure a harmonized and a high level user protection within the Union.\r\nMoreover, once users have notified a payment service provider that their payment\r\ninstrument may have been compromised, the users should not be required to cover\r\nany further losses stemming from unauthorised use of that instrument. This\r\nDirective should be without prejudice to the payment service providers'\r\nresponsibility for technical security of their own products.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to assess possible\r\nnegligence by the payment service user, account should be taken of all the\r\ncircumstances. The evidence and degree of alleged negligence should generally be\r\nevaluated according to national law. Contractual terms and conditions relating\r\nto the provision and use of a payment instrument, the effect of which would be\r\nto increase the burden of proof on the consumer or to reduce the burden of\r\nproof on the issuer should be considered null and void. Moreover, in specific\r\nsituations and notably where the payment instrument is not present at the point\r\nof sale, such as in the case of online payments over the internet, it is\r\nappropriate that the payment service provider is required to provide evidence\r\nof alleged negligence since the payer\u2019s means are very limited to do so in such\r\ncases.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions should be made\r\nfor the allocation of losses in the case of unauthorised payment transactions. Except\r\nfor cases of fraud and gross negligence, a consumer should never be obliged to\r\npay more than a maximum of 50 EUR in case of an unauthorised transaction from\r\nhis account. Different provisions may apply to payment service users who are\r\nnot consumers, since such users are normally in a better position to assess the\r\nrisk of fraud and take countervailing measures.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should lay\r\ndown rules for a refund to protect the consumer when the executed payment\r\ntransaction exceeds the amount which could reasonably have been expected. In\r\norder to prevent a financial disadvantage for the payer, it needs to be ensured\r\nthat the credit value date of any refund is no later than the date when the\r\nrespective amount has been debited. In the case of direct debits payment\r\nservice providers should be able to provide even more favourable terms to their\r\ncustomers, who should have an unconditional right to a refund of any disputed\r\npayment transactions. However, this unconditional refund right which ensures the\r\nhighest level of consumer protection is not justified in cases where the\r\nmerchant has already fulfilled the contract and the corresponding good or\r\nservice has already been consumed. In cases where the user makes a claim for\r\nthe refund of a payment transaction refund rights should affect neither the\r\nliability of the payer vis-\u00e0-vis the payee from the underlying relationship,\r\ne.g. for goods or services ordered, consumed or legitimately charged, nor the\r\nusers rights with regard to revocation of a payment order.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For financial planning and\r\nthe fulfilment of payment obligations in due time, consumers and enterprises\r\nneed to have certainty on the length of time that the execution of a payment\r\norder takes. Therefore, this Directive should introduce a point in time at\r\nwhich rights and obligations take effect, namely, when the payment service\r\nprovider receives the payment order, including when he has had the opportunity\r\nto receive it through the means of communication agreed in the payment service\r\ncontract, notwithstanding any prior involvement in the process leading up to\r\nthe creation and transmission of the payment order, e.g. security and\r\navailability of funds checks, information on the use of the personal identity\r\nnumber or issuance of a payment promise. Furthermore, the receipt of a payment order\r\nshould occur when the payer's payment service provider receives the payment\r\norder to be debited from the payer's account. The day or moment in time when a\r\npayee transmits to the service provider payment orders for the collection e.g.\r\nof card payment or of direct debits or when the payee is granted a\r\npre-financing on the related amounts by the payment service provider (by way of\r\na contingent credit to the account) should have no relevance in this respect.\r\nUsers should be able to rely on the proper execution of a complete and valid\r\npayment order if the payment service provider has no contractual or statutory\r\nground for refusal. If the payment service provider refuses a payment order,\r\nthe refusal and the reason therefore should be communicated to the payment\r\nservice user at the earliest opportunity subject to the requirements of Union and\r\nnational law.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the speed with\r\nwhich modern fully automated payment systems process payment transactions,\r\nwhich means that after a certain point in time payment orders cannot be revoked\r\nwithout high manual intervention costs, it is necessary to specify a clear\r\ndeadline for payment revocations. However, depending on the type of the payment\r\nservice and the payment order, the point in time may be varied by agreement\r\nbetween the parties. Revocation, in this context, should be applicable only to\r\nthe relationship between a payment service user and payment service provider,\r\nthus being without prejudice to the irrevocability and finality of payment\r\ntransactions in payment systems.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such irrevocability should\r\nnot affect a payment service provider's right or obligation under the laws of\r\nsome Member States, based on the payer's framework contract or national laws,\r\nregulations, administrative provisions or guidelines, to reimburse the payer\r\nwith the amount of the executed payment transaction in the event of a dispute\r\nbetween the payer and the payee. Such reimbursement should be considered to be\r\na new payment order. Except for those cases, legal disputes arising within the\r\nrelationship underlying the payment order should be settled only between the\r\npayer and the payee.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential, for the\r\nfully integrated straight-through processing of payments and for legal\r\ncertainty with respect to the fulfilment of any underlying obligation between\r\npayment service users, that the full amount transferred by the payer should be\r\ncredited to the account of the payee. Accordingly, it should not be possible\r\nfor any of the intermediaries involved in the execution of payment transactions\r\nto make deductions from the amount transferred. However, it should be possible\r\nfor payees to enter into an agreement with their payment service provider under\r\nwhich the latter may deduct own charges. Nevertheless, in order to enable the\r\npayee to verify that the amount due is correctly paid, subsequent information\r\nprovided on the payment transaction should indicate not only the full amount of\r\nfunds transferred but also the amount of any charges.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to charges,\r\nexperience has shown that the sharing of charges between a payer and a payee is\r\nthe most efficient system since it facilitates the straight-through processing\r\nof payments. Provision should therefore be made for charges to be levied, in\r\nthe normal course, directly on the payer and the payee by their respective\r\npayment service providers. However, that should apply only where the payment\r\ntransaction does not require currency exchange. The amount of any charges\r\nlevied may also be zero as the provisions of this Directive should not affect\r\nthe practice whereby the payment service provider does not charge consumers for\r\ncrediting their accounts. Similarly, depending on the contract terms, a payment\r\nservice provider may charge only the payee (merchant) for the use of the\r\npayment service, which has the effect that no charges are imposed on the payer.\r\nThe charging by the payment systems may be in the form of a subscription fee.\r\nThe provisions on the amount transferred or any charges levied have no direct\r\nimpact on pricing between payment service providers or any intermediaries.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Different national\r\npractices concerning charging for the use of a given payment instrument (hereinafter\r\n\u201csurcharging\u201d) have led to extreme heterogeneity of the Union\u2019s payments market\r\nand become a source of confusion for consumers, in particular in the e-commerce\r\nand cross-border context. Merchants located in Member States where surcharging\r\nis allowed offer products and services in Member States where it is prohibited\r\nand in this case still surcharge the consumer. Moreover, a strong rationale for\r\nrevision of surcharging practices is supported by the fact that Regulation (EU)\r\nNo xxx/yyyy establishes rules for multilateral interchange fees for card-based\r\npayments. As interchange fees are the main element making most card payments\r\nexpensive and surcharging is in practice limited to card-based payments, the rules\r\non interchange fees should be accompanied by a revision of surcharging rules.\r\nIn order to promote cost transparency and the use of the most efficient payment\r\ninstruments, Member States and payment service providers should not prevent the\r\npayee from requesting a charge from the payer for using a specific payment\r\ninstrument, duly taking into account the provisions set out in Directive\r\n2011/83/EU. However, the right of the payee to request a surcharge should only\r\napply to those payment instruments for which interchange fees are not regulated.\r\nThis should act as a steering mechanism towards the cheapest means of payments.\r\n\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to improve the\r\nefficiency of payments throughout the Union, all payment orders initiated by\r\nthe payer and denominated in euro or the currency of a Member State outside the\r\neuro area, including credit transfers and money remittances, should be subject\r\nto a maximum one-day execution time. For all other payments, such as payments\r\ninitiated by or through a payee, including direct debits and card payments, in\r\nthe absence of an explicit agreement between the payment service provider and\r\nthe payer setting a longer execution time, the same one-day execution time\r\nshould apply. It should be possible to extend those periods by an additional\r\nbusiness day, if a payment order is given on paper. This allows the continued\r\nprovision of payment services for those consumers who are used to paper\r\ndocuments only. When a direct debit scheme is used the payee's payment service\r\nprovider should transmit the collection order within the time limits agreed\r\nbetween the payee and the payment service provider, enabling settlement at the\r\nagreed due date. In view of the fact that payment infrastructures are often\r\nhighly efficient and in order to prevent any deterioration in current service\r\nlevels, Member States should be allowed to maintain or set rules specifying an\r\nexecution time shorter than one business day, where appropriate. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions on execution\r\nfor the full amount and execution time should constitute good practice where\r\none of the service providers is not located in the Union.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential for payment\r\nservice users to know the real costs and charges of payment services in order\r\nto make their choice. Accordingly, the use of non-transparent pricing methods\r\nshould not be allowed, since it is commonly accepted that those methods make it\r\nextremely difficult for users to establish the real price of the payment service.\r\nSpecifically, the use of value dating to the disadvantage of the user should\r\nnot be permitted.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The smooth and efficient\r\nfunctioning of the payment system depends on the user being able to rely on the\r\npayment service provider executing the payment transaction correctly and within\r\nthe agreed time. Usually, the provider is in the position to assess the risks\r\ninvolved in the payment transaction. It is the provider that provides the\r\npayments system, makes arrangements to recall misplaced or wrongly allocated\r\nfunds and decides in most cases on the intermediaries involved in the execution\r\nof a payment transaction. In view of all those considerations, it is entirely\r\nappropriate, except under abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances, to impose\r\nliability on the payment service provider in respect of execution of a payment\r\ntransaction accepted from the user, except for the payee's payment service\r\nprovider's acts and omissions for whose selection solely the payee is\r\nresponsible. However, in order not to leave the payer unprotected in unlikely\r\nconstellations where it may remain open (non liquet) whether the payment\r\namount was duly received by the payee's payment service provider or not, the\r\ncorresponding burden of proof should lie upon the payer's payment service\r\nprovider. As a rule, it can be expected that the intermediary institution,\r\nusually a \"neutral\" body like a central bank or a clearing house,\r\ntransferring the payment amount from the sending to the receiving payment\r\nservice provider will store the account data and be able to furnish the latter\r\nwhenever this may be necessary. Whenever the payment amount has been credited\r\nto the receiving payment service provider's account, the payee should\r\nimmediately have a claim against the payment service provider for credit to the\r\naccount.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The payer's payment service\r\nprovider should assume liability for correct payment execution, including, in\r\nparticular the full amount of the payment transaction and execution time, and\r\nfull responsibility for any failure by other parties in the payment chain up to\r\nthe account of the payee. As a result of that liability the payment service\r\nprovider of the payer should, where the full amount is not or only late\r\ncredited to the payee's payment service provider, correct the payment transaction\r\nor without undue delay refund to the payer the relevant amount of that\r\ntransaction, without prejudice to any other claims which may be made in\r\naccordance with national law. Due to the payment service provider\u2019s liability,\r\nthe payer or payee should not be burdened with any costs related to the\r\nincorrect payment. In case of non-execution, defective or late execution of\r\npayment transactions, Member States should ensure that the value date of\r\ncorrective payments of payment service providers is always the same as the\r\nvalue date in case of correct execution. \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\r\nconcern only contractual obligations and responsibilities between the payment\r\nservice user and the payment service provider. However, the proper functioning\r\nof credit transfers and other payment services requires that payment service\r\nproviders and their intermediaries, such as processors, have contracts where\r\ntheir mutual rights and obligations are agreed upon. Questions related to\r\nliabilities form an essential part of these uniform contracts. To ensure the\r\nreliability among payment service providers and intermediaries taking part in a\r\npayment transaction, legal certainty is necessary to the effect that a\r\nnon-responsible payment service provider is compensated for losses incurred or\r\nsums paid under the provisions of this Directive relating to liability. Further\r\nrights and details of content of recourse and how to handle claims towards the\r\npayment service provider or intermediary attributable to a defective payment\r\ntransaction should be left to be defined by contractual arrangements.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be possible for\r\nthe payment service provider to specify unambiguously the information required\r\nto execute a payment order correctly. On the other hand, however, in order to\r\navoid fragmentation and jeopardising the setting-up of integrated payment\r\nsystems in the Union, Member States should not be allowed to require a\r\nparticular identifier to be used for payment transactions. However, this should\r\nnot prevent Member States from requiring the payment service provider of the\r\npayer to act in due diligence and verify, where technically possible and\r\nwithout requiring manual intervention, the coherence of the unique identifier,\r\nand where the unique identifier is found to be incoherent, to refuse the\r\npayment order and inform the payer thereof. The liability of the payment\r\nservice provider should be limited to the correct execution of the payment\r\ntransaction in accordance with the payment order of the payment service user.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate\r\neffective fraud prevention and combat payment fraud across the Union, provision\r\nshould be made for the efficient exchange of data between payment service\r\nproviders who should be allowed to collect, process and exchange personal data\r\nrelating to persons involved in payment fraud. Directive 95/46/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[37],\r\nthe national rules which transpose Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No\r\n45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council[38] are applicable to the processing\r\nof personal data for the purposes of this Directive.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nDirective respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles\r\nrecognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\r\nincluding the right to respect for private and family life, the right to\r\nprotection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an\r\neffective remedy and the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal\r\nproceedings for the same offence. This Directive has to be implemented in\r\naccordance with these rights and principles.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthe effective enforcement of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to\r\nthis Directive. Appropriate procedures should therefore be established by means\r\nof which it will be possible to pursue complaints against payment service\r\nproviders which do not comply with those provisions and to ensure that, where\r\nappropriate, effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are imposed. In\r\nview of ensuring an effective compliance with this Directive, Member States should\r\ndesignate competent authorities which comply with the conditions under\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council [39] and which act independently\r\nfrom the payment service providers. For transparency reasons, Member States should\r\nnotify the Commission which authorities have been designated, with a clear\r\ndescription of their duties under this Directive. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to the\r\nright of customers to bring action in the courts, Member States should ensure\r\nan easily accessible and cost-sensitive out-of-court resolution of conflicts\r\nbetween payment service providers and consumers arising from the rights and\r\nobligations set out in this Directive. Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[40]\r\nprovides that the protection afforded to consumers by the mandatory rules of\r\nthe law of the country in which they have their habitual residence may not be\r\nundermined by any contractual terms on law applicable. With regard to establishing\r\nan efficient and effective dispute resolution procedure, Member States should\r\nensure that payment service providers put in place an effective consumer\r\ncomplaint procedure that can be followed by their consumers before the dispute\r\nis referred to be resolved in an out-of-court procedure or before court. The\r\ncomplaints procedure should contain short and clearly defined timeframes within\r\nwhich the payment service provider should reply to a complaint.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\r\ndetermine whether the competent authorities designated for granting\r\nauthorisation to payment institutions might also be the competent authorities\r\nwith regard to out-of-court complaint and redress procedures.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should be\r\nwithout prejudice to provisions of national law relating to the consequences as\r\nregards liability of inaccuracy in the expression or transmission of a\r\nstatement.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should be without\r\nprejudice to the provisions relating to the VAT treatment of payment services\r\nin Directive 2006/112/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council[41].\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interests of legal\r\ncertainty, it is appropriate to make transitional arrangements allowing persons\r\nwho have commenced the activities of payment institutions in accordance with\r\nthe national law transposing Directive 2007/64/EC before the entry into force\r\nof this Directive to continue those activities within the Member State\r\nconcerned for a specified period. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power to adopt acts in\r\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adapting the\r\nreference to Recommendation 2003/361/EC where that Recommendation is amended\r\nand in respect of updating, in case of inflation or significant market\r\ndevelopments, the average amount of payment transactions executed by the\r\npayment service provider used as a threshold for Member States that apply the\r\noption to waive (parts) of the licencing requirements for smaller payment\r\ninstitutions. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out\r\nappropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\r\nlevel. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\r\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents\r\nto the European Parliament and to the Council. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\nconsistent application of this Directive, the Commission should be able to rely\r\non the expertise and support of EBA, which should have the task to elaborate\r\nguidelines and prepare regulatory technical standards on security aspects regarding\r\npayment services, and on the cooperation between Member States in the context\r\nof the provision of services and establishment of authorised payment\r\ninstitutions in other Member States. The Commission should be empowered to\r\nadopt those regulatory technical standards. These specific tasks are fully in\r\nline with the role and responsibilities of EBA defined in Regulation (EU) No\r\n1093/2010, under which the EBA has been set up. \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, namely, the further integration of a single market in payment\r\nservices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because it\r\nrequires the harmonisation of a multitude of different rules currently existing\r\nin the legal systems of the various Member States and can therefore be better\r\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\r\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\r\nachieve that objective.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\r\n2011 on explanatory documents[42],\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a Directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition\r\ninstruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the\r\ntransmission of such documents to be justified.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the number of changes\r\nthat need to be made to Directive 2007/64/EC it is appropriate to repeal and\r\nreplace it\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nTITLE I\r\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive lays down\r\nthe rules in accordance with which Member States shall distinguish the\r\nfollowing six categories of payment service provider:\n(a)         \r\n credit institutions within the meaning of\r\nArticle 4(1)(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council[43] , including branches within the meaning of\r\nArticle 4(1)(17) of that Regulation located in the Union of credit institutions\r\nhaving their head offices inside or, in accordance with Article 47of Directive\r\n2013/36/EU , outside the Union;\n(b)         \r\n electronic money institutions within the\r\nmeaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/110/EC;\n(c)         \r\n post office giro institutions which are entitled\r\nunder national law to provide payment services;\n(d)         \r\n payment institutions within the meaning of Article\r\n4(4) of this Directive;\n(e)         \r\n the European Central Bank and national central\r\nbanks when not acting in their capacity as monetary authority or other public authorities;\n(f)           \r\n Member States or their regional or local\r\nauthorities when not acting in their capacity as public authorities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive also lays\r\ndown rules concerning transparency of conditions and information requirements\r\nfor payment services, and the respective rights and obligations of payment\r\nservice users and payment service providers in relation to the provision of\r\npayment services as a regular occupation or business activity. \nArticle 2\r\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall apply\r\nto payment services provided within the Union, where both the payer's payment\r\nservice provider and the payee's payment service provider are, or the sole\r\npayment service provider in the payment transaction is, located therein.\r\nArticle 78 and Title III shall also apply to payment transactions where only\r\none of the payment service providers is located within the Union, in respect to\r\nthose parts of the payments transaction which are carried out in the Union. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title III shall apply\r\nto payment services in any currency.

payment services across Member States.\nEnsure adequate and consistent protection of\r\nconsumer interests in the context of payment transactions, including extending\r\nregulatory protection to new channels and innovative payment services.\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s)\r\nand impact\nSpecify the\r\neffects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups\r\ntargeted.\nThe\r\nproposed amendments will bring more legal clarity and a level playing field,\r\nleading to downward convergence of costs and prices for payment services users,\r\nmore choice and transparency of payment services, facilitating the provision of\r\ninnovative payment services, and to ensure secure and transparent payment\r\nservices. The proposed measures seek to do so in a technologically neutral\r\nmanner that will remain relevant as payment services evolve further. These\r\nobjectives will be achieved by updating and complementing the existing\r\nframework on payments services; providing for rules that enhance transparency,\r\ninnovation and security in the field of retail payments and improving\r\nconsistency between national rules, with a particular emphasis on the\r\nlegitimate needs of consumers. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators\r\nof results and impact\nOnce the\r\nDirective has been implemented by at least a large majority of Member States,\r\nthe Commission shall assess the implementation and impact of this Directive, on\r\nthe basis of a conformity assessment of the national implementing measures and\r\na study on the impact of the Directive on the market. It shall report to the European\r\nParliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the\r\nEuropean Central Bank on the results and the proposed follow up.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\r\nfor the proposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s)\r\nto be met in the short or long term\nThe Directive will improve the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket for payment services and more broadly for all goods and services given\r\nthe need for innovative, efficient and secure means of payments to exist. In\r\nparticular it aims to: \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensure\r\na competitive level playing field between all categories of payment service\r\nproviders, including new emerging providers, which in turn increases the\r\nchoice, efficiency, transparency and security of retail payments. \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Facilitate\r\nthe provision of innovative card, internet and mobile payment services across\r\nborders by ensuring a Single Market for all retail payments\nFurthermore, it will strike the right\r\nbalance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of\r\nenterprises, thereby limiting the discretion of merchants to apply charges on\r\nthe use of payment instruments to the costs at hand.\nIt will also facilitate the economic transactions within\r\nthe Union and this will contribute to the attainment of the wider objectives of\r\nthe EU 2020 strategy and the promotion of new growth.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nIn\r\naccordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out\r\nin Article 5 of the TEU, the objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently\r\nachieved by Member States and can therefore be better achieved at the Union\r\nlevel. An integrated EU market for electronic retail payments market\r\ncontributes to the aim of Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union\r\nstipulating an internal market. The benefits of market integration include more\r\ncompetition between PSPs and more choice, innovation and security for payment\r\nservice users, especially consumers. By its nature an integrated payments\r\nmarket, based on networks that reach beyond national borders, requires an EU-wide\r\napproach as the applicable principles, rules, processes and standards have to\r\nbe consistent across all Member States in order to achieve legal certainty and\r\na level playing field for all market participants. The alternative to a\r\nCommunity-wide approach would be a system of multilateral or bilateral\r\nagreements the complexity and costs of which would be prohibitive as compared\r\nto legislation at European level. A possible intervention at EU level therefore\r\ncomplies with the subsidiarity principle.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons\r\nlearned from similar experiences in the past\nThe\r\nanalysis of the current regulatory framework and of the Payment Service\r\nDirective, in particular, has highlighted the following issues:\n-\r\nInconsistent application of the existing rules across Member States due to a\r\nhigh number of options and often very general criteria of application. Notably\r\ncertain exemptions set out in the PSD appear too general or outdated in respect\r\nto market developments and are being interpreted very differently. Gaps in the\r\nscope of application also arise for payments with one leg of the transaction\r\nlocated outside the EEA and payments in non-EU currencies, leading to continued\r\nmarket fragmentation, regulatory arbitrage, and distortions of competition. \n- Legal\r\nvacuum for certain newly emerged internet service providers, such as third\r\nparty providers offering online banking based payment initiation. These\r\nservices represent a viable and often cheaper payment alternative to card\r\npayments, attractive also for consumers who do not dispose of cards. However,\r\nthe current business models create some concerns amongst banks and certain\r\nMember States as the providers are currently not subject to the current legal\r\nframework. The legal vacuum risks impeding innovation and appropriate market\r\naccess conditions.\n- Lack of\r\nstandardisation and inter-operability between different payments solutions\r\n(card, internet and mobile payments) in varying aspects and to different\r\ndegrees especially at cross-border level, exacerbated by weak governance\r\narrangements for the EU retail payments market.\n- Diverse\r\nand inconsistent charging practices (for the use of a specific payment\r\ninstrument applied by merchants) between Member States (where around half of EU\r\nMember States allow and the other half forbids surcharging) leading to considerable\r\nconfusion for consumers when they shop abroad or on the internet and an\r\nun-level playing field.\n- In the\r\narea of payment cards, several restrictive business rules and practices\r\ndistorting competition (regarding MIFs and rules on choice and flexibility of\r\nmerchants regarding card acceptance).\nThe review\r\nof the European framework and notably of the PSD and the consultation on the\r\nCommission Green Paper on card, internet and mobile payments in 2012 have thus\r\nled to the conclusion that further measures and regulatory updates, including\r\nadjustments to the PSD are required so that the payments framework can better\r\nserve the needs of an effective European payments market, fully contributing to\r\na payments environment which nurtures competition, innovation and security.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility\r\nand possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe legal\r\nframework established by the PSD, the cross-border payments Regulation (EC) No\r\n924/2009 and the Second Electronic Money Directive 2009/110/EC have already resulted\r\nin significant progress regarding the overall integration of the European\r\nretail payments market. The SEPA migration end-date Regulation (EU) No 260/2012\r\nsets migration deadlines for pan-European credit transfers and pan-European\r\ndirect debits, fully replacing national schemes for national and cross border\r\neuro payments within the EU as of 2014. The regulatory framework is\r\ncomplemented by a number of investigations and decisions under EU competition\r\nlaw by the Commission over the past years in the field of retail payments. \nHowever,\r\nthe retail payments market is very dynamic and experienced a significant\r\ninnovation pace in the last few years. Important areas of the payments market,\r\nespecially card payments and new means of payments, such as internet and mobile\r\npayments, are often still fragmented along national borders making it difficult\r\nfor innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services to develop efficiently\r\nand to provide consumers and retailers with effective, convenient and secure\r\npayment methods (with the possible exception of credit cards) at pan-European\r\nlevel to purchase an expanding variety of goods and services. The latest\r\ndevelopments in these markets have also highlighted certain regulatory gaps in\r\nthe current legal framework for payments and market failures in the markets for\r\ncard, internet and mobile payments which this initiative aims to address.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and\r\nfinancial impact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nplanned [52]\r\n\nFor the 2015 budget\n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to :\n\u00a8 executive agencies \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States\n\u00a8 Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation\r\ntasks to:\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209;\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\r\nmeasures \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and\r\nreporting rules \nSpecify frequency and\r\nconditions\nArticle 81 of the Regulation\r\nestablishing the European Banking Authority (EBA) requires the Commission by 2\r\nJanuary 2014, and every 3 years thereafter, to publish a general report on the\r\nexperience acquired as a result of the operation of EBA.\r\nTo this end, the Commission will publish a general report that will be\r\nforwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council.
