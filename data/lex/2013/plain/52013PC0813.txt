Sub-optimal business investment in R&D\r\nadversely impacts on the introduction of new products, processes, services and\r\nknown-how.\nIt is therefore desirable to improve the\r\nconditions for innovative business activity. As part of its wider Europe 2020\r\nstrategy, the Commission has undertaken to create an Innovation Union,\r\nprotecting investments in the knowledge base, reducing costly fragmentation,\r\nand making Europe a more rewarding place for innovation. An environment\r\nconducive to innovation should in particular encourage higher levels of\r\ninvestment in R&D by the private sector, through more extensive, including\r\ncross-border, collaboration in R&D and technological developments between\r\nuniversities and industry, open innovation and allowing for improved valuation\r\nof intellectual property (IP) such that access to venture capital and financing\r\nis enhanced for research-oriented and innovative economic agents. Attaining\r\nsuch goals exclusively on a national level is not sufficient and would lead to\r\ninefficient duplication of effort in the Union.\nThe drastically reduced transaction costs\r\nin the digital economy have led to new forms of cooperation with open science\r\nand open innovation, often leading to new business models for using co-created\r\nknowledge. Nevertheless, intellectual property rights (IPRs) are an essential part\r\nof an innovation policy. IPRs provide innovators and creators with means of\r\nappropriation of the outputs of their efforts, which are intangible in nature,\r\nthus providing the necessary incentives for investment in new solutions,\r\ninventions and know-how. IPRs tend to protect the results of creative or\r\ninventive efforts, but they have a limited scope of application.\nDuring the process of research and creation\r\nsignificant information is compiled and developed, progressively building\r\nknowledge of a substantial economic value that often does not qualify for IPR\r\nprotection, but which is equally important for innovation and for the\r\ncompetitiveness of businesses in general. When securing such assets and attracting\r\nfinancing and investment requires IP to be kept secret, companies,\r\nlaboratories, universities, as well as the individual inventors and creators,\r\nuse the most relied upon and long-standing form of appropriation over valuable\r\ninformation: confidentiality.\nAs research builds on prior work, sharing\r\nof knowledge and new findings represent important leverage for further\r\ninnovation. Depending on the business model of the innovator there are cases\r\nwhen confidentiality may be the requisite basis upon which IP can be nurtured\r\nin order for it to be exploited into innovation and increased competitiveness.\r\nEvery IPR starts with a secret. Writers do not disclose the plot they are\r\nworking on (a future copyright), car makers do not circulate the first sketches\r\nof a new model (a future design), companies do not reveal the preliminary\r\nresults of their technological experiments (a future patent), companies hold on\r\nto the information relating to the launch of a new branded product (a future\r\ntrade mark), etc.\nIn legal terminology, information that is\r\nkept confidential in order to preserve competitive gains is referred to as\r\n\u201ctrade secrets\u201d, \u201cundisclosed information\u201d, \u201cbusiness confidential information\u201d\r\nor \u201csecret know-how\u201d. Business and academia sometimes use other name tags for\r\nit such as \u201cproprietary know-how\u201d or \u201cproprietary technology\u201d.\nTrade secrets are also just as important in\r\nprotecting non-technological innovation. The services sectors, representing\r\nsome 70% of EU GDP, are very dynamic, and that dynamism depends on innovative\r\nknowledge creation. However, the services sector does not rely as much as\r\nmanufacturing industry on technological process and product innovation (as\r\nprotected by patents). Confidentiality in this key part of the EU economy is\r\nused to build and exploit so-called \"soft\" innovation for\r\ncompetitiveness, covering the use and application of a diversified range of\r\nstrategic commercial information, which extends beyond technological knowledge,\r\nsuch as information on customers and suppliers, business processes, business\r\nplans, market research, etc.\nEconomists agree that companies,\r\nirrespective of their size, value trade secrets at least as much as all other\r\nforms of IP. Trade secrets are particularly important to small and medium-sized\r\nenterprises (SMEs) and start-ups as these often lack specialised human\r\nresources and financial strength to pursue, manage, enforce and defend IPRs.\nAlthough not protected as a classical IPR,\r\ntrade secrets are nevertheless a key complementary instrument for the required\r\nappropriation of intellectual assets that are the drivers of the knowledge\r\neconomy of the 21st century. The holder of a trade secret does not have\r\nexclusive rights over the information covered by the trade secret. However, in\r\norder to promote an economically efficient and competitive process,\r\nrestrictions to the use of a the trade secret are justified in cases where the\r\nrelevant know-how or information has been obtained from the trade secret holder\r\nagainst its will by a third party through dishonest means. The assessment of\r\nwhether and to what extent such restrictions are necessary is subject, on a\r\ncase-by-case basis, to judicial control.\nThis means that competitors are free, and\r\nshould be encouraged, to develop and use the same, similar or alternative\r\nsolutions, thus competing in innovation, but are not allowed to cheat, steal or\r\ndeceive in order to obtain confidential information developed by others.\nWhile the development and management of\r\nknowledge and information have become ever more central to the performance of\r\nthe EU economy, the exposure of valuable undisclosed know-how and information\r\n(trade secrets) to theft, espionage or other misappropriation techniques has\r\nand continues to increase (globalisation, outsourcing, longer supply chains,\r\nincreased use of ICT, etc.). The risk also increases that stolen trade secrets\r\nare used in third countries to produce infringing goods which subsequently\r\ncompete within the EU with those of the victim of the misappropriation. However,\r\nthe current diversity and fragmentation of the legal framework on the\r\nprotection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure is impairing cross-border R&D and the circulation of innovative\r\nknowledge by undermining the capacity of European companies to respond to\r\ndishonest attacks on their know-how.\nOptimisation of the IP infrastructure is\r\none important pillar of the Innovation Union and, in that context, the\r\nCommission adopted in May 2011 a comprehensive IP strategy, undertaking to\r\nexamine the protection of trade secrets[1].\r\nThis proposal is one further deliverable on the commitment of creating a single\r\nmarket for intellectual property.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public Consultation\nThis initiative is based on an evaluation\r\nof the importance of trade secrets for innovation and for the competitiveness\r\nof companies, the extent to which they are used, their role, and relationship\r\nwith IPRs, in the generation and economic exploitation of knowledge and\r\nintangibles assets, and the relevant legal framework. These assessments were\r\ncarried out with the help of two external studies and with extensive\r\nconsultations of stakeholders.\nA first study (published in January 2012)\r\nprovides a comparative law assessment of the protection against\r\nmisappropriation of trade secrets in the different EU Member States. A second\r\nstudy, published in May 2013, assessed the economic foundations of trade\r\nsecrets and protection against their misappropriation and further analysed the\r\nlegal protection of trade secrets throughout the EU. It confirmed the\r\nfragmented and diversified nature of the existing protection against\r\nmisappropriation of trade secrets throughout the Union, considering it to be,\r\nin general opaque and imposing unnecessary costs and risks. The study\r\nconsidered that an efficient system to secure the results of R&D is a\r\nprecondition for businesses to innovate and that the flexibility offered by\r\nefficient reliance on trade secrets fits well with the way in which innovation\r\ntakes place in today's business environment. It concluded that harmonisation of\r\ntrade secret law in the EU would improve conditions for firms to develop,\r\nexchange and use innovative knowledge.\nThe views of stakeholders were collected in\r\n3 steps. First, civil society, industry, academia and public authorities\r\ndiscussed this issue in a conference organised by the Commission that took\r\nplace in June 2012.\nSecond, a survey on trade secret use,\r\nassociated risks and legal protection was subsequently launched, in the context\r\nof the 2nd study, in November 2012. The survey was directed to a\r\nrepresentative sample of businesses across the EU, including SMEs which\r\naccounted for 60% of the sample. A total of 537 responses to the survey were\r\nreceived. Overall, 75% of respondents ranked trade secrets as strategically\r\nimportant to their company\u2019s growth, competitiveness and innovative\r\nperformance. The survey revealed that over the last 10 years, about one in five\r\nrespondents had suffered at least one attempt at misappropriation within the\r\nEU, whereas nearly two in five respondents stated that the risk of trade secret\r\nmisappropriation had increased during the same period. Two in three of the\r\nrespondents indicated support for an EU legislative proposal.\nThird, from 11 December 2012 until 8 March\r\n2013 the services of the Commission carried out an open public consultation, focusing\r\non the possible policy options and their impacts. 386 replies were received,\r\nmostly from individual citizens (primarily from one Member State) and businesses. 202 respondents found that the legal protection against the\r\nmisappropriation of trade secrets should be addressed by the EU. However, the\r\nviews expressed by the two main groups of respondents (citizens and companies)\r\nwere polarised. Three in four citizens regard trade secrets as having low\r\nimportance for R&D and find existing legal protection of trade secrets\r\nexcessive and 75% do not see a need for an EU action. Responding companies, on\r\nthe other hand, consider trade secrets as highly important for R&D and for\r\ntheir competitiveness. A significant majority regard existing protection as weak,\r\nin particular at the cross-border level, and see differences between national\r\nlegal frameworks as having negative impacts such as higher business risk in the\r\nMember States with weaker protection, less incentive to undertake cross-border\r\nR&D and increased expenditure in preventive measures to protect information.\r\n\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nThe impact assessment showed the national\r\ndivergences in the protection of trade secrets: few Member States' laws either\r\ndefine trade secrets or specify when they should be protected; cease and desist\r\norders against infringers are not available in all cases; traditional rules on\r\nthe calculation of damages are often inadequate for trade secret\r\nmisappropriation cases and alternative methods (e.g. amount of royalties that would\r\nhave been due under a licence agreement) are not available in all Member States;\r\nand criminal rules do not address trade secret theft in all Member States. In\r\naddition, many Member States do not have rules aimed at safeguarding trade\r\nsecrets during litigation, thus deterring victims of trade secret\r\nmisappropriation from seeking redress in court.\nTwo main problems resulted:\n\u00b7                        \r\nSub-optimal incentives for cross-border\r\ninnovation activities. When trade secrets are under a risk of misappropriation\r\nwith ineffective legal protection, incentives to undertake innovation\r\nactivities (including at cross-border scale) are affected because of (i) the\r\nlower expected value of innovation relying on trade secrets and the higher\r\ncosts for protecting it; and (ii) the higher business risk when sharing trade\r\nsecrets. For instance, 40% of EU companies would refrain from sharing trade\r\nsecrets with other parties because of fear of losing the confidentiality of the\r\ninformation through misuse or release without their authorisation. This\r\ninhibits innovation and in particular collaborative research and open\r\ninnovation which requires sharing of valuable information by multiple business\r\nand research partners.\n\u00b7                        \r\nTrade secret-based competitive advantages are at\r\nrisk (reduced competitiveness): the fragmented legal protection within the EU\r\ndoes not guarantee a comparable scope of protection and level of redress within\r\nthe Internal Market, thus putting trade-secret based competitive advantages,\r\nwhether innovation-related or not, at risk and undermining trade secret owners\u2019\r\ncompetitiveness. For instance, the European chemical industry, which strongly\r\nrelies on process innovation secured by trade secrets, estimates that\r\nmisappropriation of a trade secret could often entail a turnover reduction of up\r\nto 30%. \nThe objective of the initiative is to ensure\r\nthat the competitiveness of European businesses and research bodies which is\r\nbased on undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) is\r\nadequately protected and improve the conditions/framework for the development\r\nand exploitation of innovation and for knowledge transfer within the Internal\r\nMarket. Specifically, it aims at improving the effectiveness of the legal\r\nprotection of trade secrets against misappropriation throughout the Internal\r\nMarket.\nThe following possible options for\r\nresolving the problem were considered:\n\u2013                        \r\nStatus quo.\n\u2013                        \r\nProvide information on and raise awareness of the\r\nnational measures, procedures and remedies available against trade secret\r\nmisappropriation.\n\u2013                        \r\nConvergence of national civil law as regards the\r\nunlawfulness of acts of misappropriation of trade secrets (but rules on\r\nremedies and preservation on confidentiality of trade secrets during legal\r\nproceedings to be decided at national level).\n\u2013                        \r\nConvergence of national civil law remedies\r\nagainst the misappropriation of trade secrets and rules on preservation of\r\nconfidentiality of trade secrets during and after legal proceedings (in\r\naddition to option 3).\n\u2013                        \r\nConvergence of national criminal law in addition\r\nto civil law convergence (option 4), including rules on minimum criminal penalties.\nThe impact assessment concluded that\r\noptions 4 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives\r\npursued.\nIn terms of impacts, the convergence of\r\ncivil law remedies would allow innovative businesses to defend their rightful\r\ntrade secrets more effectively across the EU. Also, if trade secrets\u2019 owners\r\ncould rely on confidentiality during proceedings, they would be more inclined\r\nto seek legal protection against potential damages through misappropriation of\r\ntrade secrets. Increased legal certainty and convergence of laws would\r\ncontribute to increasing the value of innovations companies try to protect as\r\ntrade secrets, as the risk of misappropriation would be reduced. Positive\r\nimpacts on the functioning of the Internal Market result as companies, in\r\nparticular SMEs, and researchers will be able to make better use of their\r\ninnovative ideas by cooperating with the best partners across the EU, thus\r\nhelping to increase private sector investment in R&D within the Internal\r\nMarket. At the same time, competition should not be restricted as no exclusive\r\nrights are being granted and any competitor is free to independently acquire\r\nthe knowledge protected by the trade secret (including by reverse engineering).\r\nSimilarly, the hiring and mobility of highly skilled labour (those who have\r\naccess to trade secrets) within the Internal Market should not be negatively\r\nimpacted. This should have, over time, positive effects on the competitiveness\r\nand growth of the EU economy. This initiative does not negatively affect\r\nfundamental rights. In particular, the initiative will promote the right to\r\nproperty and the right to conduct a business. In terms of access to documents\r\nin judicial proceedings safeguards have been put in place in order to safeguard\r\nthe right of defence. The initiative also contains safeguards to ensure that\r\nthe right to freedom of expression and information is guaranteed.\nThis initiative is consistent with\r\ninternational obligations (i.e. the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of\r\nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement)). Major trading partners have\r\nsimilar legislation on this issue.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 114 of the Treaty of the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for the adoption of EU rules\r\nharmonising national legislation, whenever necessary for the smooth functioning\r\nof the Internal Market. The objective of the proposal is to establish a\r\nsufficient and comparable level of redress across the Internal Market in case\r\nof trade secret misappropriation (while providing sufficient safeguards to\r\nprevent abusive behaviour). The existing national rules offer an uneven level\r\nof protection across the EU of trade secrets against misappropriation, which\r\njeopardises the smooth functioning of the Internal Market for information and\r\nknow-how. Indeed, in order to fulfil all its potential as an economic asset,\r\nvaluable information (such as manufacturing processes, new substances and\r\nmaterials, non-patented technology, business solutions) must be transferable,\r\nin confidence, as it may have different uses for different players in different\r\ngeographic regions, thus generating income for creators and allowing for an\r\nefficient allocation of resources. The scattered legal framework also reduces\r\nthe incentives to undertake any innovative-related cross-border activity which\r\nwould depend on the use of information protected as a trade secret, such as establishment\r\nin a different Member States for the purposes of manufacturing or marketing\r\ngoods/services based on trade secrets, supplying goods/services to a company in\r\nother Member State or outsourcing the manufacturing to another company in a\r\nMember State. In those situations, if the trade secret is misappropriated in\r\nanother country with lower level of protection, infringing goods may spread\r\nacross the market. Existing national rules thus render cross-border network\r\nR&D and innovation less attractive and more difficult. They also create a\r\nhigher business risk in Member States with lower levels of protection, with\r\nadverse effects on the whole of the EU economy as, on the one hand, incentives\r\nto cross-border trade diminish, and on the other hand, \u201cinfringing goods\u201d\r\noriginating from those Member States (or imported through them) may spread across\r\nthe Internal Market. The proposal should facilitate cross-border R&D\r\ncooperation: a clear, sound and levelled protection of trade secrets against\r\nmisappropriation promotes cross-border sharing and transfer of confidential\r\nbusiness information and know-how by diminishing perceived risks and\r\ntransactions costs associated with multiple legislation handling. It should\r\nalso improve incentives to cross-border trade, thanks to the reduction of\r\nunfair competition from free-riders in the cross-border market space.\nIn terms of subsidiarity, the problems\r\nidentified in the impact assessment are driven by the diversity and\r\ninconsistency of the existing regulatory framework that does not ensure a level\r\nplaying field for EU companies with adverse consequences for their competitiveness\r\nand that of the EU as a whole. Achieving greater consistency in redress\r\nmeasures across Member States is central to addressing those problems. Yet such\r\nconsistency cannot be achieved by action taken solely on the Member State level: experience in this field shows that even when Member States are coordinated\r\nto a certain extent, e.g. by the TRIPS Agreement, a sufficient degree of\r\nsubstantive harmonisation of national rules is not achieved. Hence, the necessary\r\nscale and effects of the proposed action are at EU level.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no impact on the European\r\nUnion budget. All actions proposed to be taken up by the Commission in this\r\nproposal are consistent and compatible with the new Multiannual Financial\r\nFramework 2014-2020.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXPLANATION OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General provisions\nChapter I\r\ndefines the subject matter (Article 1): the Directive applies to unlawful acquisition, disclosure and use of\r\ntrade secrets and the measures, procedures and remedies\r\nthat should be made available for the purpose of civil law redress.\nAlso in Chapter I, Article 2 defines key\r\nconcepts. The definition of \u2018trade secret\u2019 contains three elements: (i) the\r\ninformation must be confidential; (ii) it should have commercial value because\r\nof its confidentiality; and (iii) the trade secret holder should have made\r\nreasonable efforts to keep it confidential. This definition follows the\r\ndefinition of \u2018undisclosed information\u2019 in the TRIPS Agreement.\nThe definition of \u2018trade secret holder\u2019\r\nincorporates, also following the TRIPS Agreement, the concept of lawfulness of\r\ncontrol of the trade secret as a key element. It therefore ensures that not\r\nonly the original owner of the trade secret but also licensees can defend the\r\ntrade secret.\nThe definition of \u2018infringing good\u2019\r\nintegrates a proportionality assessment. The goods which are designed,\r\nmanufactured or marketed carrying out an unlawful conduct must benefit to a\r\nsignificant degree from the trade secret in question to be considered as\r\ninfringing goods. The test should be used when considering any measures\r\ndirectly affecting goods manufactured or put in the market by an infringer.\nChapter II sets\r\nthe circumstances under which the acquisition, use and disclosure of a trade\r\nsecret is unlawful (Article 3), thus entitling the trade secret holder to seek the application of the measures and\r\nremedies foreseen in the Directive. The key element for\r\nthose acts to be unlawful is the absence of consent of the trade secret holder.\r\nArticle 3 also determines that the use of a trade secret by a third party not\r\ndirectly involved in the original unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure is\r\nalso unlawful, whenever that third party was aware, should have been aware, or\r\nwas given notice, of the original unlawful act. Article 4 expressly clarifies\r\nthat independent discovery and reverse engineering are legitimate means of\r\nacquiring information. \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures, procedures and\r\nremedies\nChapter III\r\nestablishes the measures, procedures and remedies that should be made available\r\nto the holder of a trade secret in case of unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure of that trade secret by a third party.\nSection 1 sets the general principles\r\napplicable to the civil enforcement instruments in order to prevent and repress\r\nacts of trade secret misappropriation, notably effectiveness, fairness and\r\nproportionality (Article 5) and safeguards to prevent abusive litigation\r\n(Article 6). Article 7 establishes a period of limitation. Article 8 requires\r\nthat Member States provide judicial authorities with mechanisms to preserve the\r\nconfidentiality of trade secrets disclosed in court for the purpose of\r\nlitigation. The possible measures must include: restricting access to documents\r\nsubmitted by the parties or third parties, in whole or in part; restricting\r\naccess to hearings and hearing records; ordering the parties or third parties\r\nto prepare non-confidential versions of documents containing trade secrets and\r\nalso preparing non-confidential versions of judicial decisions. These measures\r\nshould be applied in a proportionate manner so that the rights of the parties\r\nto a fair hearing are not undermined. The confidentiality measures must apply\r\nduring litigation, but also after litigation in case of requests of public\r\naccess to documents for as long as the information in question remains a trade\r\nsecret.\nSection 2 provides for provisional and\r\nprecautionary measures in the form of interlocutory injunctions or\r\nprecautionary seizure of infringing goods (Article 9). It also establishes\r\nsafeguards to ensure the equity and proportionality of those provisional and\r\nprecautionary measures (Article 10).\nSection 3 provides for measures that may be\r\nordered with the decision of the merits of the case. Article 11 provides for\r\nthe prohibition of use or disclosure of the trade secret, the prohibition to\r\nmake, offer, place on the market or use infringing goods (or import or store\r\ninfringing goods for those purposes) and corrective measures. The corrective\r\nmeasures request, inter alia, the infringer to destroy or deliver to the\r\noriginal trade secret holder all the information he or she holds with regard to\r\nthe unlawfully acquired, used or disclosed trade secret. Article 12 establishes\r\nsafeguards to ensure equity and proportionality of the measures provided for in\r\nArticle 11.\nThe awarding of damages for the prejudice\r\nsuffered by the trade secret holder as a consequence of the unlawful\r\nacquisition, use or disclosure of his/her trade secret is enshrined in Article\r\n13, which calls for the taking into consideration of all the relevant factors,\r\nincluding the unfair profits obtained by the defendant. The possibility of\r\ncalculating the damages on the basis of hypothetical royalties is also made\r\navailable, in line of what is foreseen in the case of infringements of\r\nintellectual property rights.\nArticle 14 empowers the competent judicial\r\nauthorities to adopt publicity measures at the request of the plaintiff,\r\nincluding the publication of the decision on the merits of the case \u2013 provided\r\nthat the trade secret is not disclosed and after considering the proportionality\r\nof the measure.\nThe Directive does not integrate rules on\r\nthe cross-border enforcement of judicial decisions as general EU rules on this\r\nmatter apply, allowing the enforcement in all Member States of a court judgment\r\nprohibiting the imports into the EU of infringing goods.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanctions, reporting and\r\nfinal provisions\nIn order to ensure an effective application\r\nof the Directive and the fulfilment of the pursued objectives, Chapter IV\r\nforesees the application of sanctions in case of non-compliance with the\r\nmeasures provided for in Chapter III and comprises provisions on monitoring and\r\nreporting.\nThe Commission considers that, in line with\r\nthe joint declarations concerning explanatory documents[2], there are not\r\nsufficient arguments to formally request explanatory documents from Member\r\nStates to explain the relationship between the content of the Directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. From a technical\r\nperspective, the Directive is not particularly complex, contains only a limited\r\nnumber of legal obligations that require transposition into national law and\r\ndeals with a well delimited issue that has already been regulated at national\r\nlevel as regards the neighbouring area of IPRs. Therefore, the transposition at\r\nnational level is not expected to be complicated and this should ease the\r\nmonitoring of such transposition.\n2013/0402 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the protection of undisclosed know-how\r\nand business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition,\r\nuse and disclosure\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\nAfter consulting the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor[4],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Businesses and non- commercial\r\nresearch institutions invest in acquiring, developing and applying know-how and\r\ninformation, which is the currency of the knowledge economy. This investment in\r\ngenerating and applying intellectual capital determines their competitiveness\r\nin the market and therefore their returns to investment, which is the\r\nunderlying motivation for business research and development. Businesses have\r\nrecourse to different means to appropriate the results of their innovative\r\nactivities when openness does not allow for the full exploitation of their\r\nresearch and innovation investments. Use of formal intellectual property rights\r\nsuch as patents, design rights or copyright is one of them. Another is to\r\nprotect access and exploit the knowledge that is valuable to the entity and not\r\nwidely known. Such know-how and business information, that is undisclosed and\r\nintended to remain confidential is referred to as a trade secret. Businesses,\r\nirrespective of their size, value trade secrets as much as patents and other\r\nforms of intellectual property right and use confidentiality as a business and\r\nresearch innovation management tool, covering a diversified range of\r\ninformation, which extends beyond technological knowledge to commercial data\r\nsuch as information on customers and suppliers, business plans or market\r\nresearch and strategies. By protecting such a wide range of know-how and\r\ncommercial information, whether as a complement or as an alternative to\r\nintellectual property rights, trade secrets allow the creator to derive profit\r\nfrom his/her creation and innovations and therefore are particularly important\r\nfor research and development and innovative performance.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Open innovation is an\r\nimportant lever for the creation of new knowledge and underpins the emergence\r\nof new and innovative business models based on the use of co-created knowledge.\r\nTrade secrets have an important role in protecting the exchange of knowledge\r\nbetween businesses within and across the borders of the internal market in the\r\ncontext of research and development and innovation. Collaborative research,\r\nincluding cross-border cooperation, is particularly important to increase the\r\nlevels of business research and development within the internal market. Open\r\ninnovation is a catalyst for new ideas to find their way to the market meeting\r\nthe needs of consumers and tackling societal challenges. In an internal market\r\nwhere barriers to such cross-border collaboration are minimised and where cooperation\r\nis not distorted, intellectual creation and innovation should encourage\r\ninvestment in innovative processes, services and products. Such an environment conducive\r\nto intellectual creation and innovation is also important for employment growth\r\nand improving competitiveness of the Union economy. Trade secrets are amongst the\r\nmost used form of protection of intellectual creation and innovative know-how by\r\nbusinesses, yet they are at the same time the least protected by the existing Union\r\nlegal framework against their unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure by third\r\nparties.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innovative businesses are\r\nincreasingly exposed to dishonest practices aiming at misappropriating trade\r\nsecrets, such as theft, unauthorised copying, economic espionage, breach of\r\nconfidentiality requirements, whether from within or from outside of the Union.\r\nRecent developments, such as globalisation, increased outsourcing, longer\r\nsupply chains, increased use of information and communication technology.\r\ncontribute to increasing the risk of those practices. The unlawful acquisition,\r\nuse or disclosure of a trade secret compromises the legitimate trade secret\r\nholder\u2019s ability to obtain first mover returns using the outputs of its\r\ninnovative efforts. Without effective and comparable legal means for defending trade\r\nsecrets across the Union, incentives to engage in innovative cross-border activity\r\nwithin the internal market are undermined and trade secrets are unable to\r\nfulfil their potential as drivers of economic growth and jobs. Thus, innovation\r\nand creativity are discouraged and investment diminishes, affecting the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the internal market and undermining its growth enhancing\r\npotential.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International efforts taken\r\nin the framework of the World Trade Organisation to address this problem led to\r\nthe conclusion of the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual\r\nproperty (the TRIPS Agreement). It contains, inter alia, provisions on the\r\nprotection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure by third parties, which are common international standards. All Member States, as well as the Union itself, are bound by this Agreement which was approved by\r\nCouncil Decision 94/800/EC[5].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the TRIPS\r\nAgreement, there are important differences in the Member States legislation as\r\nregards the protection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, use\r\nor disclosure by other persons. Thus, for example, not all Member States have\r\nadopted national definitions of trade secrets and/or unlawful acquisition, use\r\nor disclosure of a trade secret, so that the scope of protection is not readily\r\naccessible and differs throughout Member States. Furthermore, there is no\r\nconsistency as regards the civil law remedies available in case of unlawful\r\nacquisition, use or disclosure of trade secrets as cease and desist orders are\r\nnot always available in all Member States against third parties who are not\r\ncompetitors of the legitimate trade secret holder. Divergences also exist\r\nacross the Member States with respect to the treatment of third parties who\r\nacquired the trade secret in good faith but subsequently come to learn, at the\r\ntime of use, that their acquisition derived from a previous unlawful\r\nacquisition by another party. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National rules also differ\r\nas to whether legitimate trade secret holders may seek the destruction of goods\r\nmanufactured by third parties who use trade secrets unlawfully or the return or\r\ndestruction of any documents, files or materials containing or implementing the\r\nunlawfully acquired or used trade secret. Also, applicable national rules on\r\nthe calculation of damages do not always take account of the intangible nature\r\nof trade secrets, which makes it difficult to demonstrate the actual profits lost\r\nor the unjust enrichment of the infringer where no market value can be\r\nestablished for the information in question. Only a few Member States allow for\r\nthe application of abstract rules on the calculation of damages based on the\r\nreasonable royalty or fee which could have been due had a licence for the use\r\nof the trade secret existed. Additionally, many Member States rules do not\r\nguarantee the preservation of the confidentiality of a trade secret if the\r\ntrade secret holder introduces a claim for alleged unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure of the trade secret by a third party, thus reducing the\r\nattractiveness of the existing measures and remedies and weakening the\r\nprotection offered. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The differences in the legal\r\nprotection of trade secrets provided for by the Member States imply that trade\r\nsecrets do not enjoy an equivalent level of protection throughout the Union, thus leading to fragmentation of the internal market in this area and weakening the\r\noverall deterrent effect of the rules. The internal market is affected in so\r\nfar as such differences lower businesses\u2019 incentives to undertake\r\ninnovative-related cross-border economic activity, including research or\r\nmanufacturing cooperation with partners, outsourcing or investment in other\r\nMember States, which would depend on the use of the information protected as\r\ntrade secrets. Cross-border network research and development as well as innovation-related\r\nactivities, including related manufacturing and subsequent cross-border trade, are\r\nrendered less attractive and more difficult within the Union, thus also\r\nresulting in innovation-related inefficiencies at Union scale. In addition, higher\r\nbusiness risk appears in Member States with comparatively lower levels of\r\nprotection, where trade secrets may be stolen or otherwise unlawfully acquired\r\nmore easily. This leads to inefficient allocation of capital to\r\ngrowth-enhancing innovation within the internal market because of the higher\r\nexpenditure on protective measures to compensate for the insufficient legal protection\r\nin some Member States. It also favours the activity of unfair competitors who\r\nfollowing the unlawful acquisition of trade secrets could spread resulting\r\ngoods across the internal market. Legislative regime differences also\r\nfacilitate the importation of goods from third countries into the Union through entry points with weaker protection, when the design, manufacturing or\r\nmarketing of those goods rely on stolen or otherwise unlawfully acquired trade\r\nsecrets. On the whole, such differences create a prejudice to the proper\r\nfunctioning of the internal market. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nprovide for rules at Union level to approximate the national legislative\r\nsystems so as to ensure a sufficient and consistent level of redress across the\r\ninternal market in case of unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade\r\nsecret. For this purpose, it is important to establish a homogenous definition\r\nof a trade secret without restricting the subject matter to be protected\r\nagainst misappropriation. Such definition should therefore be constructed as to\r\ncover business information, technological information and know-how where there\r\nis both a legitimate interest in keeping confidential and a legitimate\r\nexpectation in the preservation of such confidentiality. By nature, such\r\ndefinition should exclude trivial information and should not extend to the\r\nknowledge and skills gained by employees in the normal course of their\r\nemployment and which are known among or accessible to persons within the\r\ncircles that normally deal with the kind of information in question. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also important to identify\r\nthe circumstances under which legal protection is justified. For this reason,\r\nit is necessary to establish the conduct and practices which are to be regarded\r\nas unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret. Disclosure by Union\u2019s\r\ninstitutions and bodies or national public authorities of business-related\r\ninformation they hold pursuant to the obligations of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6] or to other rules on\r\nthe access to documents should not be considered unlawful disclosure of a trade\r\nsecret. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of\r\ninnovation and to foster competition, the provisions of this Directive should\r\nnot create any exclusive right on the know-how or information protected as\r\ntrade secrets. Thus, independent discovery of the same know-how and information\r\nremains possible and competitors of the trade secret holder are also free to\r\nreverse engineer any lawfully acquired product. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the principle\r\nof proportionality the measures and remedies intended to protect trade secrets should\r\nbe tailored to meet the objective of a smooth functioning internal market for\r\nresearch and innovation without jeopardising other objectives and principles of\r\npublic interest. In this respect, the measures and remedies ensure that\r\ncompetent judicial authorities account for the value of a trade secret, the\r\nseriousness of the conduct resulting in the unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure of the trade secret as well as the impact of such conduct. It should\r\nalso be ensured that the competent judicial authorities are provided with the\r\ndiscretion to weigh up the interests of the parties to the litigation, as well\r\nas the interests of third parties including, where appropriate, consumers.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The smooth functioning of\r\nthe internal market would be undermined if the measures and remedies provided\r\nfor were used to pursue illegitimate intents incompatible with the objectives\r\nof this Directive. Therefore, it is important to ensure that judicial\r\nauthorities are empowered to sanction abusive behaviour by claimants who act in\r\nbad faith and submit manifestly unfounded applications. It is also important\r\nthat measures and remedies provided for should not restrict the freedom of expression\r\nand information (which encompasses media freedom and pluralism as reflected in\r\nArticle 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) or whistleblowing\r\nactivity. Therefore the protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases\r\nin which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest in so far as\r\nrelevant misconduct or wrongdoing is revealed. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of legal\r\ncertainty and considering that legitimate trade secret holders are expected to\r\nexercise a duty of care as regards the preservation of the confidentiality of\r\ntheir valuable trade secrets and the monitoring of their use, it appears\r\nappropriate to restrict the possibility to initiate actions for the protection\r\nof trade secrets to a limited period following the date on which the trade\r\nsecret holders became aware, or had reason to become aware, of the unlawful\r\nacquisition, use or disclosure of their trade secret by a third party.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prospect of losing the\r\nconfidentiality of a trade secret during litigation procedures often deters\r\nlegitimate trade secret holders from instituting proceedings to defend their\r\ntrade secrets, thus jeopardising the effectiveness of the measures and remedies\r\nprovided for. For this reason, it is necessary to establish, subject to\r\nappropriate safeguards ensuring the right to a fair trial, specific\r\nrequirements aimed at protecting the confidentiality of the litigated trade\r\nsecret in the course of legal proceedings instituted for its defence. These\r\nshould include the possibility to restrict access to evidence or hearings, or\r\nto publish only the non-confidential elements of judicial decisions. Such protection\r\nshould remain in force after the legal proceedings have ended for as long as\r\nthe information covered by the trade secret is not in the public domain.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unlawful acquisition of a\r\ntrade secret by a third party could have devastating effects on its legitimate\r\nholder since once publicly disclosed it would be impossible for that holder to\r\nrevert to the situation prior to the loss of the trade secret. As a result, it\r\nis essential to provide for fast and accessible interim measures for the\r\nimmediate termination of the unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade\r\nsecret. Such relief must be available without having to await a decision on the\r\nsubstance of the case, with due respect for the rights of defence and the principle\r\nof proportionality having regard to the characteristics of the case in question.\r\nGuarantees of a level sufficient to cover the costs and the injury caused to\r\nthe respondent by an unjustified request may also be required, particularly\r\nwhere any delay would cause irreparable harm to the legitimate holder of a\r\ntrade secret.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the same reason, it is\r\nalso important to provide for measures to prevent further unlawful use or\r\ndisclosure of a trade secret. For prohibitory measures to be effective, their\r\nduration, when circumstances require a limitation in time, should be sufficient\r\nto eliminate any commercial advantage which the third party could have derived\r\nfrom the unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of the trade secret. In any\r\nevent, no measure of this type should be enforceable if the information\r\noriginally covered by the trade secret is in the public domain for reasons that\r\ncannot be attributed to the respondent. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A trade secret may be\r\nunlawfully used to design, manufacture or market goods, or components thereof,\r\nwhich may spread across the internal market, thus affecting the commercial\r\ninterests of the trade secret holder and the functioning of the internal market.\r\nIn those cases and when the trade secret in question has a significant impact on\r\nthe quality, value or price of the resulting good or on reducing the cost, facilitating\r\nor speeding up its manufacturing or marketing processes, it is important to\r\nempower judicial authorities to order appropriate measures with a view to\r\nensure that those goods are not put on the market or are removed from it. Considering\r\nthe global nature of trade, it is also necessary that these measures include\r\nthe prohibition of importing those goods into the Union or storing them for the\r\npurposes of offering or placing them on the market. Having regard to the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, corrective measures should not necessarily entail\r\nthe destruction of the goods when other viable options are present, such as\r\ndepriving the good of its infringing quality or the disposal of the goods outside\r\nthe market, for example, by means of donations to by charitable organisations. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A person may have\r\noriginally acquired a trade secret in good faith but only become aware at a\r\nlater stage, including upon notice served by the original trade secret holder,\r\nthat his or her knowledge of the trade secret in question derived from sources\r\nusing or disclosing the relevant trade secret in an unlawful manner. In order\r\nto avoid that under those circumstances the corrective measures or injunctions provided\r\nfor could cause disproportionate harm to that person, Member States should provide\r\nfor the possibility, in appropriate cases, of pecuniary compensation being\r\nawarded to the injured party as an alternative measure, provided that such\r\ncompensation does not exceed the amount of royalties or fees which would have\r\nbeen due had that person obtained authorisation to use the trade secret in\r\nquestion, for the period of time for which use of the trade secret could have\r\nbeen prevented by the original trade secret holder. Nevertheless, where the\r\nunlawful use of the trade secret would constitute an infringement of law other\r\nthan that foreseen in this Directive or would be likely to harm consumers, such\r\nunlawful use should not be allowed.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid that a\r\nperson who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds for knowing, unlawfully\r\nacquires, uses or discloses a trade secret benefit from such conduct and to\r\nensure that the injured trade secret holder, to the extent possible, is placed\r\nin the position in which he or she would have been had that conduct not taken\r\nplace, it is necessary to provide for adequate compensation of the prejudice\r\nsuffered as a result of the unlawful conduct. The amount of damages awarded to\r\nthe injured holder of the trade secret should take account of all appropriate factors,\r\nsuch as loss of earnings incurred by the trade secret holder or unfair profits\r\nmade by the infringer and, where appropriate, any moral prejudice caused to the\r\ntrade secret holder. As an alternative, for example where, considering the\r\nintangible nature of trade secrets, it would be difficult to determine the\r\namount of the actual prejudice suffered, the amount of the damages might be\r\nderived from elements such as the royalties or fees which would have been due\r\nhad the infringer requested authorisation to use the trade secret in question. The\r\naim is not to introduce an obligation to provide for punitive damages, but to ensure\r\ncompensation based on an objective criterion while taking account of the\r\nexpenses incurred by the holder of the trade secret, such as the costs of\r\nidentification and research.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To act as a supplementary\r\ndeterrent to future infringers and to contribute to the awareness of the public\r\nat large, it is useful to publicise decisions, including where appropriate through\r\nprominent advertising, in cases concerning the unlawful acquisition, use or\r\ndisclosure of trade secrets, as long as such publication does not result in the\r\ndisclosure of the trade secret nor disproportionally affect the privacy and\r\nreputation of natural persons.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effectiveness of the\r\nmeasures and remedies available to trade secret holders could be undermined in\r\ncase of non-compliance with the relevant decisions adopted by the competent\r\njudicial authorities. For this reason, it is necessary to ensure that those\r\nauthorities enjoy the appropriate powers of sanction.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\nuniform application of the measures for the protection of trade secrets, it is\r\nappropriate to provide for systems of cooperation and the exchange of\r\ninformation as between Member States, on the one hand, and between the Member\r\nStates and the Commission on the other, in particular by creating a network of\r\ncorrespondents designated by Member States. In addition, in order to review\r\nwhether these measures fulfil their intended objective, the Commission,\r\nassisted, as appropriate, by the European Observatory on the Infringements of\r\nIntellectual Property Rights, should examine the application of this Directive\r\nand the effectiveness of the national measures taken. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to\r\nrespect private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data,\r\nthe freedom of expression and information, the freedom to choose an occupation\r\nand right to engage in work, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to\r\nproperty, the right to good administration, access to file and preservation of\r\nsecrecy of business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and\r\nright of defence.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important that the\r\nrights to privacy and personal data protection of any person involved in\r\nlitigation concerning the unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of trade\r\nsecrets and whose personal data are processed are respected. Directive 95/46/EC\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[7]\r\ngoverns the processing of personal data carried out in the Member States in the\r\ncontext of this Directive and under the supervision of the Member States\r\ncompetent authorities, in particular the public independent authorities\r\ndesignated by the Member States.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nDirective, to achieve a smooth functioning internal market through the\r\nestablishment of a sufficient and comparable level of redress across the internal\r\nmarket in case of unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret,\r\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason\r\nof its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may\r\nadopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that same Article, this Directive does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\r\naim to establish harmonised rules for judicial cooperation, jurisdiction, the\r\nrecognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, or\r\ndeal with applicable law. Other Union instruments which govern such matters in\r\ngeneral terms should, in principle, remain equally applicable to the field\r\ncovered by this Directive.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\r\naffect the application of competition law rules, in particular Articles 101 and\r\n102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The measures\r\nprovided for in this Directive should not be used to restrict competition\r\nunduly in a manner contrary to that Treaty.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures adopted to\r\nprotect trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, disclosure and use\r\nshould not affect the application of any other relevant law in other areas\r\nincluding intellectual property rights, privacy, access to documents and the\r\nlaw of contract. However, where the scope of application of Directive\r\n2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] and the scope of this Directive\r\noverlap, this Directive takes precedence as lex specialis. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nChapter I\nSubject matter and scope\nArticle 1\r\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules on the\r\nprotection against the unlawful acquisition,
