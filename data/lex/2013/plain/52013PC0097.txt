As the first response to this call, the Commission\npublished a Communication on 25 of October 2011[3],\non the implementation options for an Entry Exit System and the RTP.\nThis proposal is presented together with a\nproposal to establish an Entry Exit System and a proposal to amend the Community Code on the rules governing checks\nat external border crossing points and surveillance at the external border\n(Schengen Borders Code; SBC)[4] for the purpose of\nthe functioning of the two new systems. Impact assessments are presented for\neach system.\nThis proposal does not affect Customs\ncontrols i.e. control of goods.\n\u00b7      General context\nFor the purpose of laying down the\nconditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at external border\ncrossing points and surveillance at the external border, the SBC was adopted on\n15 March 2006. In accordance with Article 7, all persons shall be subject to\nchecks at the external borders. \nThorough checks are normally carried out on\nthird-country nationals, and minimum checks on EU citizens and persons enjoying\nthe right of free movement.[5]\nHowever, current rules for third-country nationals could be described as\n\"one-size-fits-all\" as the same checks apply regardless of any\ndifferences in risk between different travellers or their frequency of travel.\nThis is because current legislation does not allow for exceptions to the\nprinciple of thorough border checks except for those categories of\nthird-country nationals that are specifically mentioned in the SBC or in the\nLocal Border Traffic Regulation[6]\nsuch as Heads of States, cross-border workers and border residents.\nOnly a very small minority of persons\ncrossing the external border are able to benefit from the above-mentioned\nexceptions: approximately two million equivalent to 0,2 % of total passenger\nflows. This number can be expected to remain largely constant, with a marginal\nincrease due to an increased take up of local border traffic regimes. By the\nend of 2010, 110 000 local border traffic permits were issued by Member States.\nIn order to fulfil the requirements of the\nSBC, a border guard shall establish that the third-country national fulfils all\nEU entry requirements on each entry (purpose of stay in the EU, whether he or\nshe possesses sufficient means of subsistence and intention to return the country\nof origin). This is done by interviewing a traveller and checking necessary\ndocuments such as booking confirmation for an accomodation and for a return\nflight/ferry/train. The border guard shall also monitor the authorised stay in\nthe Schengen area which is currently done by calculating stamps in the travel\ndocument.\nTaking into account the foreseen increase\nin passenger flows at the external borders, an alternative border check\nprocedure should be offered for frequent third-country travellers moving\ngradually away from a \"country-centric\" approach towards a\n\"person-centric\" approach. \nIn practice the RTP would work at the\nborder the following way: A registered traveller would be issued a token in the\nform of a machine-readable card containing only a unique identifier (i.e.\napplication number), which is swiped on arrival and departure at the border\nusing an automated gate. The gate would read the token and the travel document\n(and visa sticker number, if applicable) and the fingerprints of the\ntravellers, which would be compared to the ones stored in the Central\nRepository and other databases, including the Visa Information system (VIS) for\nvisa holders. If all checks are successful, the traveller is able to pass\nthrough the automated gate. In case of any issue, the traveller would be\nassisted by a border guard.\nFacilitation of border crossings would take\nplace also during the manual border checks as border guards would not need to\nask the \"additional\" questions from the registered traveller such as\nthe destination of travel and existence of sufficient means of subsistence.\nThe establishment of an Entry/Exit System\n(EES) with or without biometrics which would record entries and exits of third-country\nnationals for short stays at the external borders would be the precondition for\nallowing full automation of the border checks for registered travellers as\ndescribed above. The EES would allow the elimination of the obligation to stamp\nthe travel document foreseen under the Schengen Borders Code as the manual stamping\nwould be replaced by automatic recording and calculation of stay. Once the\nstamping obligation has disappeared, consultation of the EES would become mandatory\nat the external border to ensure that the third-country national has not\nexceeded his/her legal entitlement of stay in the Schengen area. This\nconsultation could be done automatically using the Machine Readable Zone of the\ntravel document or fingerprints.\nThe RTP together with the EES will improve management and control of travel flows at the border substantially\nby reinforcing checks while speeding up border crossings for frequent,\npre-vetted non EU travellers.\nThe legislative financial statement annexed\nto this proposal is based on the study on the costs of an EES and an RTP\ncarried out by an external contractor.\nBased on the considerations above, the\nobjective of the present proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\nand the Council is: \n\u2013     \nto establish the procedures and conditions for\naccess to the RTP, \n\u2013     \nto define the purpose, the functionalities and\nresponsibilities for a token[7]-Central\nRepository as a system for the storage of data on registered travellers and \n\u2013     \nto confer on the Agency for the operational\nmanagement of large-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security\nand justice[8]\n(the Agency), the development and operational management of the Central\nRepository and the definition of technical specifications for a token. \nThis Regulation shall constitute the core\ninstrument for the legal framework for the RTP. In order to complement this\nlegal framework, an amendment of the SBC is\nalso necessary as regards facilitated border crossings for\nthird-country nationals, and is presented in parallel with this proposal.\nFurthermore, a proposal for an Entry/Exit System which records the entries and\nexists of third-country nationals is presesented simultaneously.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 562/2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules\ngoverning the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code).\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 1931/2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at\nthe external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of\nthe Schengen Convention.\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 767/2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS)\nand the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS\nRegulation).\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas.\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a\nEuropean Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the\narea of freedom, security and justice.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT\nASSESSMENT\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nThe consultation of interested parties is\ndescribed in the accompanying impact assessment.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe first impact assessment[9] was carried out in 2008 when\npreparing the Commission Communication on this subject and the second one was finalised\nin 2013[10].\nThe former analysed the policy options and their most likely impacts and\nconcluded that an RTP for third-country nationals should be established. \nFollowing a consultation and pre-screening\nprocess the latter impact assessment analysed key implementation options.\nAfter the analysis of the options and their\nsub-options, a fee based RTP for pre-vetted and pre-screened frequent\nthird-country travellers with the data (biometrics, alphanumeric data and\nunique identifier number) stored in a Central Repository and the unique\nidentifier (application number) stored in a token was found to be the most\nfeasible option to guarantee smooth passenger flows at the external borders\nwithout decreasing the level of security at the EU. This option minimises the\nuse of personal data in an EU IT-system as no personal data is retrieved by the\nborder guards at the first line control and it avoids the main security\ndrawbacks of the pure token-based system. The application of the same data\nprotection provisions as for the VIS and the status quo including the retention\nof information for a maximum of five years would be necessary to ensure\nadequate data protection provisions for the preferred option. The personal data\nstored in the central repository (biometrics and alphanumeric data from\napplications) should be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of\nthe RTP. It is appropriate to keep the data for a maximum period\nof five years, in order to enable data on previous applications to be taken\ninto account for the assessment of the subsequent RTP applications, renewal of\nthe access to the RTP and also taking into account the re-use of fingerprints\nstored in the repository (59 months). Furthermore, a five year retention period\nwould allow granting access to the RTP for five years without a new\napplication. An initial access to the RTP should be\ngranted for one year. Access may be extended for two years, followed by a\nfurther two years without a new application. A new application would need to be\nsubmitted to renew the access once the period of five years validity has\nexpired.This would be in line with the issuance of a multiple-entry visa\nfor travellers (maximum period five years) whose data is kept in the VIS for five\nyears. \nFour fingerprints should be stored in the\ncentral repository to ensure accurate verification of a registered traveller at\nthe external border crossing point. The storage of fingerprints data for four\nfingers guarantees that sufficient data is available in every circumstances,\nwhile keeping the amount of data to a reasonable level. Storing only one or two\nfingerprints may cause problems for the travellers and for border authorities\nat the external borders as fingerprints may be smudged, distorted or fragmented.\nThis is especially relevant with the RTP as the access can be granted for five\nyears and the same fingerprints may be re-used (59 months) if a new application\nis lodged by the registered traveller. \nThe data stored in the Central Repository\nwould be available for border guards only when assessing an application,\nrevoking/extending access to the RTP, a token is lost or stolen or any problems\noccur with facilitating registered travellers' border crossings. During the\nborder check a border guard would receive only hit/no hit information from the Central\nRepository. Therefore, the preferred option provides for a proportionate\nbalance between security, facilitation and data protection. \nIn order to guarantee easy access to the\nRTP, third-country nationals should be able to lodge an application for the RTP\nat the consulate of any Member State or at any external border crossing point. This\nwould guarantee a larger number of participants in the programme, thus helping\nMember States to manage their passenger flows at the external border crossing\npoints. Applications should be examined on the basis of the same criteria as\nfor issuing multiple-entry visa. However, examination\nof applications lodged by family members of citizens of the Union shall be done\nby using the same criteria as used when examining their entry visa\napplications. Member States may decide whether to use and install Automated Border\nControl systems at their external border crossing points. It is clear that the\ntotal impact of combining the same vetting criteria as for multiple-entry visas\nwith fully automated border control has the highest impact on facilitating registered\ntravellers' border crossings. Furthermore, it maintains a high level of\nsecurity while respecting fundamental rights. It is also the least expensive\napproach taking into account the costs associated with stricter vetting\nprocedure and semi-automated border control. Full automation would be a\ncost-effective tool especially at the busiest border crossing points where\ncapacity problem and queues exist already nowadays. However, each Member State\nwould have to assess for each individual border crossing point, whether Automated\nBorder Control system would bring added value to the throughput capacity of the\nborder crossing point and thus decrease travellers\u2019 border crossing time,\nrelease human resources and give a tool for a Member State to manage its\nincreasing passenger flows. Whether or not Automated Border Control facilities\nare used, the facilitation of border crossing should apply at all external\nborder crossing points for third-country nationals granted access to the RTP.\nIn order to ensure reliable verification of applicants, it will be necessary to\nprocess biometric data (fingerprints) in the Central Repository and to verify\nbiometrics at the external border crossing points.[11]\nThe Impact Assessment Board (IAB) reviewed\nthe draft impact assessment and delivered its opinion on 14 March 2012. The\nrecommendations for improvement were accommodated in the final version of the\nreport. In particular, the following changes were made: baseline scenario was\nsharpened and clarified; problem definition was widened including lessons\nlearnt from the development of other large scale IT-systems and lessons learnt\nfrom Automated Border Control systems and national RTPs implemented in Member\nStates and non-EU states; links to the Annexes and to the 2008 impact\nassessment were improved; stakeholders views were reported as widely as\npossible taking into account that views expressed by the stakeholders were\nquite general; the explanation of method used for calculating the costs was\nexpanded and the expected costs and benefits for different stakeholders were\nmore rigorously reported; re-affectation of border guards taking into account\nthe expected increase in travel flows was clarified; and finally a clear\noverview on the European Data Protection Supervisor's views was added.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed actions\nThe purpose and functionalities of the RTP\nincluding a token-Central Repository and the responsibilities for these must be\ndefined. Furthermore, a mandate needs to be given to the Agency for the\noperational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom,\nsecurity and justice to develop, establish and operationally manage the Central\nRepository and to define technical specifications for a token on the basis of\nprior definition of business requirements. The procedures and conditions for\nexamining an RTP application and the storage of data on registered travellers shall\nbe established. A detailed explanation of the proposal by article can be found\nin a separate Commission Staff Working paper.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticles 74, 77(2)(b) and 77(2)(d) of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union are the legal basis for this Regulation. Article 77(2)(b) and (d)\nprovides the appropriate legal basis for further specifying the measures on the\ncrossing of the external borders of the Member States and develop standards and\nprocedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at\nsuch borders. Article 74 provides the appropriate legal basis for setting-up\nand maintaining the RTP and for procedures for the exchange of information\nbetween Member States, ensuring cooperation between the relevant authorities of\nthe Member States\u2019 as well as between those authorities and the Commission in\nthe areas covered by Title V of the Treaty.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nUnder Articles 74, 77(2)(b) and 77(2)(d) of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has the power to\nadopt measures relating to the checks on persons and efficient monitoring of\nthe crossing of external borders of the Member States. The current EU provisions on the crossing of the external borders of\nthe Member States need to be modified to take into account the increasing\npassenger flows and possibilities offered by the new technology. A common\nregime is needed in order to establish harmonised rules\non facilitated border crossings for registered travellers so that the\nfacilitation applies at all Schengen border crossing points without separate\nvetting and without decreasing security. \nTherefore, the objective of the proposal\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. \n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European\nUnion states that action by the Union shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. The form\nchosen for this EU action must enable the proposal to achieve its objective and\nbe implemented as effectively as possible. The proposed initiative constitutes\na further development of the Schengen acquis in order to ensure that common\nrules at external borders are applied in the same way in all the Member States.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle.\n\u00b7      Choice of instrument \nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the following\nreason(s):\nThe present proposal will lay down rules on\nborder checks at the external borders which are uniform for all Member States.\nAs a consequence, only a Regulation can be chosen as a legal instrument.\n\u00b7      Fundamental rights\nThe proposed regulation may have an impact\non fundamental rights, notably on the protection of personal data (Article 8 of\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU) and right to an effective remedy\n(Article 47 of the Charter). \nThe proposal contains safeguards, in\nparticular under Articles 15 and 16 in cases the access granted to the RTP is\nrefused or revoked, which provide for the right to an effective remedy, and\nunder Articles 48 and 49 concerning the right of information, access,\ncorrection and deletion concerning the data used for the purpose of the Regulation\nwhich also include the right to an effective remedy as provided for under\nArticle 51.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Commission's proposal for the next\nmulti-annual financial framework (MFF) includes a proposal of 4,6 billion EUR\nfor the Internal Security Fund (ISF) for the period 2014-2020. In the proposal,\n1,1 billion EUR is set aside as an indicative amount for the development of an\nEES and an RTP assuming development costs would only start from 2015.[12] \nThis financial support would cover not only\nthe costs of central components for the entire MFF period (EU level, both\ndevelopment and operational cost) but also the development costs for the\nnational, Member States, components of these two systems, within the resources\navailable. Providing financial support for national development costs would\nensure that difficult economic circumstances at national level do not\njeopardise or delay the projects. This includes an amount of 145 million EUR\nfor costs at national level related to hosting the IT systems, the space for\nhosting the end-user equipment, and the space for operators' offices. It also\nincludes an amount of 341 million EUR for costs at national level related to\nmaintenance such as for hardware and software licenses.\nOnce the new systems would be operational,\nfuture operational costs in the Member States could be supported by their\nnational programmes. It is proposed that Member States may use 50% of the\nallocations under the national programmes to support operating costs of IT\nsystems used for the management of migration flows\nacross the external borders of the Union. These costs may include the cost for\nthe management of VIS, SIS and new systems set up in the period, staff costs,\nservice costs, rental of secure premises etc. Thus, the future instrument would\nensure continuity of funding, where appropriate.\nThe costs on automation would greatly vary\ndepending on the number of automated gates that would be implemented. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b7      Participation\nThis proposal builds upon the Schengen acquis\nin that it concerns the crossing of external borders. Therefore the following\nconsequences in relation to the various Protocols and Agreements with\nassociated countries have to be considered:\nDenmark: \nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the\nProtocol (no 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European\nUnion (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\nDenmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures pursuant\nto Title V of part Three of the TFEU. \nGiven that this Regulation builds upon the\nSchengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that\nProtocol decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this\nRegulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland: \nIn accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the\nProtocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the\nEuropean Union and Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the\nrequest of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and\nCouncil Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request\nto take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland do not take part in the adoption of the Registered\nTraveller Programme Regulation and are not bound by them or subject to its\napplication.\nIceland and Norway: \nThe procedures laid down in the Association\nAgreement concluded by the Council and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom\nof Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation,\napplication and development of the Schengen acquis are applicable, since the\npresent proposal builds on the Schengen acquis as defined in Annex A of\nthis Agreement[13].\nSwitzerland:\nThis Regulation constitutes a development\nof the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Agreement between the\nEuropean Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter's\nassociation with the implementation, application and development of the\nSchengen acquis[14].\nLiechtenstein: \nThis Regulation constitutes\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community,\nthe Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession\nof the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European\nUnion, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss\nConfederation's association with the implementation, application and development\nof the Schengen acquis[15].\nCyprus:\nThis Regulation\nconstitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related\nto it, as provided for by Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.\nBulgaria and Romania:\nThis Regulation\nconstitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related\nto it, as provided for by Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.\n2013/0059 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a Registered Traveller\nProgramme \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty of the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 74 and 77(2)(b)\nand (d) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission[16],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[17],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[18],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)              \nBorder checks must ensure a high level of\nsecurity while limiting waiting times to the greatest extent possible. Increasing\ntravel flows at the external borders contributes to the need for finding new\nsolutions to meet these objectives. A greater differentiation of border checks\nwill allow Member States to use simplified checks for third-country nationals\nwho are assesed as low risk.\n(2)              \nAutomated border control\nsystems can be used by EU citizens and have proven their efficiency in speeding\nup border checks. Their use should be made possible for third-country nationals\nalso, to contribute to limiting waiting time while ensuring a high level of\nsecurity.\n(3)              \nThe Communication of the Commission\nof 13 February 2008 entitled 'preparing the next steps in border management in\nthe European Union'[19]\noutlined the need for the setting-up of a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP)\nfor frequent third-country national travellers and the introduction of\nAutomated Border Control facilities in order to facilitate the crossing of the\nexternal border as part of the European integrated border management strategy.\n(4)              \nThe European Council of 19\nand 20 June 2008 underlined the importance of continuing to work on the\ndevelopment of the EU's integrated border management strategy, including better use of modern technologies to improve the\nmanagement of external borders.\n(5)              \nThe Communication of the\nCommission of 10 June 2009 entitled 'an area of freedom, security and justice\nserving the citizens'[20]\nhighlighted the need for the establishment of a RTP to ensure smooth entry into\nthe Union. \n(6)              \nThe European Council of 23\nand 24 of June 2011 called at its meeting for work on \"smart borders\"\nto be pushed forward rapidly. As a first response to this call, the Commission\npublished a Communication \"Smart borders \u2013 options and the way ahead\"\non 25 of October 2011.\n(7)              \nThe RTP should have the\npurpose of facilitating the crossing of the external borders of the Union by\nfrequent, pre-screened and pre-vetted third-country travellers.\n(8)              \nThe provisions on the RTP\nshould be common to all Member States, in order to allow a registered traveller\nto benefit from facilitated border checks at all Member States' external border\ncrossing points without the need for separate pre-screening and pre-vetting by\neach individual Member State.\n(9)              \nIt is necessary to specify the objectives of the\nRTP and its technical architecture, to lay down rules concerning its operation\nand use and to define responsibilities for the system, the categories of data\nto be entered into the system, the purposes for which the data are to be\nentered, the criteria for their entry, the authorities authorised to access the\ndata and further rules on data processing and the protection of personal data. \n(10)          \nThe Agency for the\noperational management of large-scale information systems in the area of\nfreedom, security and justice established by Regulation EU No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n25 October 2011 establishing a European Agency for the operational management\nof large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice[21] (hereinafter\nthe Agency) should be responsible for the development and operational\nmanagement of a centralised system consisting of a Central Repository, a Backup\nCentral Repository, the Uniform interfaces in each Member States, the Network\nEntry Points and the communication infrastructure between the Central\nRepository and the Network Entry Points. Furthermore, the Agency should be\nresponsible for the definition of technical specifications for a token to\nguarantee interoperability of the RTP across the Union. Member States should be\nresponsible for the development and operational management of their own\nnational systems.\n(11)          \nThe Central Repository\nshould be connected to the national systems of the Member States, in order to\nenable competent Member States' authorities to process data related to RTP\napplications.\n(12)          \nIn order to ensure reliable\nverification of a registered traveller, it is necessary to store the unique\nidentifier (application number), biometric data (fingerprints) and alphanumeric\ndata taken from the application in a Central Repository and the unique\nidentifier in a token and verify biometrics at the external borders. The\nalphanumeric data and fingerprints should be stored in separate sections in a Central\nRepository and they should not be linked. The link between the alphanumeric\ndata and fingerprints should be established only by the unique identifier. \n(13)          \nThird-country nationals\nwishing to particiapte in the RTP should prove the need or justify the\nintention to travel frequently or regularly, in particular due to their\noccupational or family status, such as business person, civil servant engaged\nin regular official contacts with Member States and the Union institutions,\nrepresentative of civil society organisations travelling for the purpose of\neducational training, seminars and conferences, researcher, participating in\neconomic activities, family member of a citizen of the Union, family member of a\nthird-country national legally residing in a Member State. \n(14)          \nThird-country nationals\nholding a multiple-entry visa or D-visa valid for at least one year or holders\nof a residence permit issued by a Member State should, as a general rule, be\ngranted access to the RTP, if they so request. \n(15)          \nWhere a third-country\nnational applies for a multiple-entry visa and for access to the RTP, the\ncompetent authorities may decide to examine and decide on both applications at\nthe same time, on the basis of the same interview and the same supporting\ndocuments.\n(16)          \nFamily members of citizens\nof the Union should, as a general rule, be granted access to the RTP. Family members of citizens of the Union should also able to benefit from\nthe RTP even if they are not residing within the Union territory but travel\nfrequently to a Member State in order to accompany or to join the Union citizen\nconcerned. Checks on family members of citizens of the Union crossing the\nexternal borders should be carried out in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of\ncitizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within\nthe territory of the Member States[22].\n\n(17)          \nThe criteria used for the examination of applications\nlodged by family members of citizens of the Union should be the same as those\nused for the examination of visa applications lodged by family members of\ncitizens of the Union. This would be in line with the existing border\nmanagement policy.\n(18)          \nIt is necessary to define\nthe competent Member States\u2019 authorities, the duly authorised staff of which\nhave access to enter, amend, delete, consult or search data for the specific\npurposes of the RTP in accordance with this Regulation to the extent necessary\nfor the performance of their tasks.\n(19)          \nAny processing of RTP data\nstored in the Central Repository should be proportionate to the objectives\npursued and necessary for the performance of tasks of the competent\nauthorities. When using the RTP, the competent authorities should ensure that\nthe human dignity and integrity of the persons whose data are requested are\nrespected and should not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial\nor ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.\n(20)          \nContingency plans should be\nin place and those plans should be made clear to travellers, airlines/carriers\nand all authorities working at the border crossing point. If a registered\ntraveller, for example, is unable, for any reason, to use the Automated Border Control\nsystem, and is redirected towards a manual border check, due attention should\nbe made that the ensuing procedures are in full compliance with fundamental\nrights.\n(21)          \nThe personal data stored in\nthe Central Repository (biometrics and alphanumeric) should be kept for no\nlonger than is necessary for the purposes of the RTP. It is appropriate to keep\nthe data for a maximum period of five years, in order to enable alphanumeric\ndata on previous applications to be taken into account for the assessment of subsequent\nRTP applications and also taking into account the\nre-use of fingerprints stored in the repository (59 months). A shorter period would not be sufficient for those\npurposes. The data should be deleted after the period of five years, unless\nthere are grounds to delete it earlier. The maximum period of validity for\naccess to the RTP should be five years. \n(22)          \nIn order to facilitate the\nprocedure for any subsequent application, it should be possible to copy\nfingerprints from the first entry into the Central Repository within a period\nof 59 months. Once this period of time has elapsed, the fingerprints should be\ncollected again.\n(23)          \nIn order to facilitate the\napplication procedure, it should be possible for an applicant to lodge an\napplication for access to the RTP at the consulate of any Member State or at any\nexternal border crossing point. Any Member State should be able to examine and\ndecide on the application based on the common application form and common\neligibility rules and criteria. As a general rule, an interview should be\nconducted.\n(24)          \nDue to the registration of\nbiometric data in the Central Repository, the personal appearance of the\napplicant - at least for the first application - should be a basic requirement\nfor the examination of requests for access to the RTP and decisions related\nthereto.\n(25)          \nDuring the automated border\ncheck procedure verification of identity at the external borders should be done\nagainst the biometrics stored in the Central Repository. Verification should\nonly be possible by physically producing the token and fingerprints at the same\ntime. During the automated and manual border check procedure verification of\naccess granted should be done against the alphanumeric data stored in the Central\nRepository by physically producing the token at the borders. Verification of\nidentity and access granted should produce only a hit/no hit result for border\nguards carrying out first line border checks.\n(26)          \nAppropriate measures for the\nmonitoring and evaluation of this Regulation should be established. The effective\nmonitoring of the application of this Regulation requires evaluation at regular\nintervals.\n(27)          \nStatistical data is an\nimportant means for monitoring border check procedures and can serve as an\nefficient management tool. Such data should therefore be compiled regularly in\na common format.\n(28)          \nDirective 95/46/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data[23]\napplies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application\nof this Regulation. However, certain points should be set out in more detail in\nrespect to the legitimacy of processing of personal data, the responsibility\nfor the processing of data, safeguarding the rights of the data subjects and\nthe supervision on data protection.\n(29)          \nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001\nof 18 December 2000 of the European Parliament and the Council on the\nprotection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the\nCommunity institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[24] applies to the\nactivities of the Union institutions or bodies when carrying out their tasks as\nresponsible for the operational management of the token-repository. However,\ncertain points should be set out in more detail in respect to the legitimacy of\nprocessing of personal data, the responsibility for the processing of data and\nthe supervision on data protection.\n(30)          \nThe supervisory authorities\nestablished in accordance with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC should monitor\nthe lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst\nthe European Data Protection Supervisor as established by Regulation (EC) No\n45/2001 should monitor the activities of the Union institutions and bodies in\nrelation to the processing of personal data, taking into account the limited\ntasks of the Union institutions and bodies with regard to the data themselves.\n(31)          \nThe European Data Protection\nSupervisor and the supervisory authorities should actively cooperate with each\nother to ensure coordinated supervision of the RTP.\n(32)          \nThe Member States should lay\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this\nRegulation and ensure that they are implemented.\n(33)          \nIn order to ensure uniform conditions\nfor the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred\nto the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning\nmechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of\nimplementing powers[25].\n(34)          \nIn order to adopt technical\namendments of the annexes, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of the adoption of technical amendments to the\nannexes in accordance with Article 58. It is of particular importance that the\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(35)          \nThis Regulation respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the protection of personal data (Article 8) and the right to an effective remedy (Article 51), and has to be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(36)          \nSince the establishment of a\ncommon RTP and the creation of common obligations, conditions and procedures\nfor the storage of data on registered travellers cannot be sufficiently\nachieved by the Member States alone and can therefore, by virtue of the scale\nand impact of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may\nadopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, the Regulation does not go beyond\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n(37)          \nIn accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\nTreaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not\nbound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds\nupon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that\nProtocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on\nthis Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(38)          \nThis Regulation constitutes\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the\nUnited Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\n2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of\nthe Schengen acquis[26],\nthe United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not\nbound by it or subject to its application.\n(39)          \nThis Regulation constitutes\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland\ndoes not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28\nFebruary 2002 concerning Ireland\u2019s request to take part in some of the\nprovisions of the Schengen acquis[27];\nIreland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or\nsubject to its application.\n(40)          \nAs regards Iceland and\nNorway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the\nSchengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the\nCouncil of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of\nNorway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application\nand development of the Schengen acquis[28],\nwhich fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council\nDecision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application\nof that Agreement[29].\n(41)          \nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis withing\nthe meaning of the Agreement between\nthe European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss\nConfederation's association with the implementation, application and\ndevelopment of the Schengen acquis[30] which\nfall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 read\nin conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC[31].\n(42)          \nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of\nthe Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Protocol between\nthe European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of\nLiechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European\nCommunity and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association\nwith the

within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of\nAccession.\n(44)          \nThis Regulation constitutes\nan act building upon, or otherwise related to, the Schengen acquis within\nthe meaning of Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.\n(45)          \nAs the registered travellers have been subjected\nto all necessary controls and pre-screening by those Member States fully implementing\nthe Schengen acquis and do not represent any risk for Bulgaria, Romania and\nCyprus, the latter Member States may recognise unilaterally the RTP membership\nof the registered traveller to benefit from facilitation of border checks at\ntheir external borders.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER\nI\nGeneral\nprovisions\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter \nThis Regulation establishes the

The\nproposal/initiative relates to a new action \n\u00a8 The\nproposal/initiative relates to a new action following a pilot\nproject/preparatory action[45]\n\n\u00a8 The proposal/initiative relates to the\nextension of an existing action \n\u00a8 The\nproposal/initiative relates to an action redirected towards a new action \n\n1.4.                \nObjectives\n1.4.1.          \nThe Commission's multiannual strategic\nobjective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\nThe Stockholm Programme agreed by the European Council in December\n2009 reaffirmed the potential for a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP) with\nthe aim to facilitate legal access to the territory of Member States. The\nproposal to set up an RTP was therefore included in the Action Plan\nimplementing the Stockholm programme. The financing of the development of the\nSmart Borders package is one of the priorities of the Internal Security Fund\n(ISF)[46].\n\n1.4.2.          \nSpecific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \n\nSpecific objectives No. 1 \"System Development\" and No. 2\n\"System Operations\"\nThe objective of the RTP and the token-Central Repository system is\nto facilitate the crossing of the European Union external borders by frequent,\npre-vetted third-country travellers.\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nActivities: Solidarity \u2013 External borders, return, visa policy and\nfree movement of people (chapter 18.02)\n\n1.4.3.          \nExpected result(s) and impact\n\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nBy exploiting new technologies the RTP will decrease the time and\ncosts of border crossings for Registered Travellers and will increase the\nthroughput capacity of border crossing points thus giving Member States a new\ntool to manage their passenger flows efficiently and cost-effectively. Border\nchecks of Registered Travellers should not take more than 20-40 seconds on\naverage.\nFurthermore, the RTP will free up border control resources by 25%\nfrom checking cross border movements of frequent and pre-vetted travellers and\nwill enable better focus on checking higher risk travellers.\n\n1.4.4.          \nIndicators of results and impact \n\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nDuring the development\nAfter the approval of the draft proposal and the adoption of the\ntechnical specifications the technical system will be developed by an external\ncontractor. The development of the systems will take place at central and\nnational level under the overall coordination of the IT Agency. The IT Agency\nwill define an overall governance framework in cooperation with all the\nstakeholders. As usual in the development of such systems an overall Project\nManagement Plan, together with a Quality Assurance Plan will be defined at the\nbeginning of the project. They should include dashboards that will include\nspecific indicators related in particular to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overall project status\nthe timely development according to the agreed\nschedule (milestones),\nthe risk management,\nthe management of resources ( human and\nfinancial) according to the agreed allocations\nthe organisational readiness\n\u2026\nOnce the system is operational\nNumber of persons in the programme by category (visa required/visa\nexempt) and by grounds of access requested (business persons/students/workers\netc);\nNumber of persons whose access to the RTP is revoked or refused;\nAverage time of enrolment at the border crossing point and at the\nconsulate;\nTime needed for RTs to cross an external border;\nSystem availability;\nError rates e.g. false hits, Failure to Enrol Rate (FTE) and False\nAcceptance Rate (FAR);\nNumber of complaints by individuals to the national Supervisory\nAuthority (data protection authority);\nNumber of complaints lodged against the authorities on wrong decisions\nand/or discrimination;\nThe throughput capacity of border crossing point increased by XX per\ncent;\nBorder guard resources replaced/made available by the RTP to focus\non checking higher risk travellers and/or carrying out other relevant tasks.\n\n1.5.                \nGrounds for the proposal/initiative\n1.5.1.          \nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or long\nterm \n\nThere are some 700 millions border crossings every year at the\nexternal border crossing points (land, sea, air). Taking into account that\nborder crossing at the largest and busiest border crossing points have been\nincreasing and will continue to do so in the future, doing nothing at the EU\nlevel would mean that third-country nationals' border crossings could not be\nfacilitated except those specifically mentioned in the Schengen Borders Code\nand the Local Border Traffic Regulation meaning that thorough checks would be\napplicable for third-country nationals and no access to Automated Border\nControl systems could be given for them. Several Member States already face\nissues in managing queues. These Member States would have no other solution\nthan hiring more staff and rebuilding infrastructure; any future increase in\ntravel flows would lead to more problems of this kind. \nTherefore, the RTP is needed for facilitating Registered Travellers\nborder crossings, for releasing border guard resources and for introducing\nperson centric approach to border checks. \n\n1.5.2.          \nAdded value of EU involvement\n\nThe need for intervention at European level is clear. No Member\nState alone is able to build up an RTP providing facilitated border checks\nacross the Member States. The RTP needs to be implemented at all EU external\nborder crossing points and will have positive implications on the border guard\nresources of all Member States, allowing for an efficient use of these\nresources.\nThe RTP proposal ensures that the EU has a common approach to the\nRTP based on common legislation and thus it guarantees that rules continue to\nbe the same at all Schengen borders. For third-country national travellers,\nthis means that the RTP is available to them at all Schengen border crossing\npoints without separate vetting. In other words, a person vetted by one Member\nState may benefit from facilitation when crossing the external borders of any\nother Member State. Without common rules this would not be possible, i.e.\nwithout EU involvement the RTP would not meet its objectives. \n\n1.5.3.          \nLessons learned from similar experiences in the\npast\n\nThe experience with the development of the second generation\nSchengen Information System (SIS II) and of the Visa Information System (VIS)\nshowed the following lessons:\n1) As a possible safeguard against cost overruns and delays\nresulting from changing requirements, any new information system in the area of\nfreedom, security and justice, particularly if it involves a large-scale IT\nsystem, will not be developed before the underlying legal instruments setting\nout its purpose, scope, functions and technical details have been definitely\nadopted.\n2) It proved difficult to fund the national developments\nfor Member States that have not foreseen the respective activities in their\nmulti-annual programming or lack precision in their programming in the\nframework of the External Border Fund (EBF). Therefore, it is now proposed to\ninclude these development costs in the proposal.\n\n1.5.4.          \nCoherence and possible synergy with other\nrelevant instruments\n\nThis proposal should be seen as part of the continuous development\nof the Integrated Border Management Strategy of the European Union, and in\nparticular the Smart Borders Communication[47],\nas well as in conjunction with the ISF borders proposal[48], as part of the MFF. The\nlegislative financial statement attached to the amended Commission proposal for\nthe Agency[49]\ncovers the costs for the existing IT systems EURODAC, SIS II, VIS but not for\nthe future border management systems that are not yet entrusted to the Agency\nvia a legal framework. Therefore, in the annex to the proposal for a Council\nRegulation laying down the multi-annual financial framework for the years\n2014-2020[50],\nunder heading 3 \"Security and Citizenship\" it is foreseen to cover\nthe existing IT systems in the rubrique 'IT systems' (822 mio \u20ac) and the future\nborder management systems in the rubrique 'Internal Security' (1.1 mio \u20ac out of\n4.648 mio \u20ac). Within the Commission DG HOME is the Directorate General\nresponsible for the establishment of an area of free\nmovement in which persons can cross internal borders without being submitted to\nborder checks and external borders are controlled and managed coherently at the\nEU level. The RTP is fully coherent with EU border policy: security and\nprevention of irregular immigration is not diminished during the border\ncrossing, while the EU's openness to the world and its capacity to facilitate\ncross-border people-to-eople contacts, trade and cultural exchange is boosted.\nFurthermore, it is coherent with the Community Code on Visas (810/2009) and the\nVIS Regulation (767/2008). Amendment of the Schengen Borders Code is needed to\ngive access for third-country nationals to fully automated border control systems.\nTechnical synergies can be found with the Visa Information System.\nThere will also be synergies with the EES, as the EES will register the entry\nand exit of the registered travellers and monitor the permitted duration of\nstay within the Schengen area.

This will cover the development part of all\nstrands of the project, i.e. Central system, Member States systems, networks\nand infrastructure in Member States.\nIn 2017, at\nthe time of the mid term review, it is envisaged to transfer remaining credits\nfrom the 587.000 Mio \u20ac to the IT Agency line for operation and maintenance\ncosts of the central system and of the network and to national programmes for\noperation and maintenance costs of national systems including infrastructure\ncosts (see table below). The Legislative Financial Statement will be revised\naccordingly by the end of 2016.\n Blocks || Management mode || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 \n Development Central System || Indirect centralised || X || X || X ||   ||   ||   \n Development Member States || Indirect centralised || X || X || X ||   ||   ||   \n Maintenance Central System || Indirect centralised ||   ||   || X || X || X || X \n Maintenance National Systems || Indirect centralised ||   ||   || X || X || X || X \n Network (1) || Indirect centralised || X || X || X || X || X || X \n Infrastructure Member States || Indirect centralised || X || X || X || X || X || X \n(1) network development in 2015-2017,\nnetwork operations in 2017-2020\n\n2.                      \nMANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.                \nMonitoring and reporting rules \n\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nThe rules on monitoring and evaluation of the RTP are foreseen in\nArticle 63 of the RTP proposal.\nArticle 63\nMonitoring and evaluation\n1. The Agency shall ensure that procedures are in place to monitor\nthe functioning of the central repository against objectives relating to\noutput, cost-effectiveness, security and quality of service.\n2. For the purposes of technical maintenance, the Agency shall have\naccess to the necessary information relating to the processing operations\nperformed in the Central Repository.\n3. Two years after the RTP is brought into operation and every two\nyears thereafter, the Agency shall submit to the European Parliament, the\nCouncil and the Commission, a report on the technical functioning of the RTP\nincluding the security thereof.\n4. Three years after the RTP is brought into operation and every\nfour years thereafter, the Commission shall produce an overall evaluation of\nthe RTP. This overall evaluation shall include an examination of results\nachieved against objectives and an assessment of the continuing validity of the\nunderlying rationale, the application of this Regulation in respect of the RTP,\nthe security of the RTP, the implementation of the collection and use of\nbiometric data, compliance with data protection rules and the organisation of\nthe procedures related to applications and issuance of tokens. .The Commission\nshall transmit the evaluation to the European Parliament and the Council. The\nreport shall be accompanied, where necessary, by appropriate proposals to amend\nthis Regulation.\n5. Member States shall provide the Agency and the Commission with\nthe information necessary to draft the reports referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4\naccording to the quantitative parameters predefined by the Agency and the\nCommission respectively.\n6. The Agency shall provide the Commission with the information\nnecessary to produce the overall evaluations referred to in paragraph 4.\n\n2.2.                \nManagement and control system \n2.2.1.          \nRisk(s) identified \n\n1) Difficulties with the technical development of the system\nMember States have technically different national IT systems.\nFurthermore, border control processes may differ according to the local\ncircumstances (available space at the border crossing point, travel flows,\netc.). The RTP needs to be integrated into national IT architecture and the\nnational border control processes. Additionally, the development of the\nnational components of the system needs to be fully aligned with central\nrequirements. There are two main risks identified in this area:\na) The risk that technical and legal aspects of the RTP may be\nimplemented in different ways by different Member States, due to insufficient\ncoordination between the central and national sides.\nb) The risk of inconsistency in how this future system is used\ndepending on how Member States implement the RTP into the existing border\ncontrol processes.\n2) Difficulties with the timely development of the system\nFrom the experience gained during the development of the VIS and the\nSIS II, it can be anticipated that a crucial factor for a successful\nimplementation of the RTP will be the timely development of the system by an\nexternal contractor. As a center of excellence in the field of development and\nmanagement of large-scale IT systems, the IT Agency will also be responsible\nfor the award and management of contracts, in particular for sub-contracting\nthe development of the system. There are several risks related to the use of an\nexternal contractor for this development work:\na) in particular, the risk that the contractor fails to allocate\nsufficient resources to the project or that it designs and develops a system\nthat is not state-of-the-art;\nb) the risk that administrative techniques and methods to handle\nlarge-scale IT projects are not fully respected as a way of reducing costs by\nthe contractor;\nc) finally, in the current economic crisis, the risk of the\ncontractor facing financial difficulties for reasons external to this project\ncannot be entirely excluded.\n\n2.2.2.          \nControl method(s) envisaged \n\n1) The Agency is meant to become a center of excellence in the field\nof development and management of large-scale IT systems. It shall be entrusted\nwith the development and the operations of the central part of the system\nincluding uniform interfaces in the Member States. This solution should allow\nto avoid most of the drawbacks that the Commission met when developing the SIS\nII and the VIS. \nDuring the development phase (2015-2017), the Commission will keep\nthe overall responsibility, as the project will be developed via indirect\ncentral management. The Agency will be responsible for the technical and\nfinancial management, notably the award and management of contracts. The\ndelegation agreement will cover the central part via procurements and the\nnational part via grants. According to Article 40 of the Implementing Rules,\nthe Commission will conclude an Agreement laying down the detailed arrangements\nfor the management and control of funds and the protection of the financial\ninterests of the Commission. Such agreement will include the provisions set out\nin paragraph 2 of Article 40. It will thus enable the Commission to manage the\nrisks described in 2.2.1.\nIn the context of the mid-term review (foreseen in 2017 in the\nframework of the Internal Security Fund, Article 15 of the Horizontal\nRegulation) the management mode will be re-examined.\n2) In order to avoid delays at national level, an efficient\ngovernance between all stakeholders is foreseen. The Commission has proposed in\nthe draft Regulation that an Advisory Group composed of Member States national\nexperts shall provide the Agency with the expertise related to the RTP/EES.\nThis advisory group shall meet on a regular basis on the system implementation\nand to share gathered experience and provide advice to the Management Board of\nthe Agency. Furthermore, the Commission intends to recommend to Member States\nto set up a national project infrastructure / project group for both the\ntechnical and the operational development including a reliable communication\ninfrastructure with single points of contact.\n\n2.3.                \nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nThe measures foreseen to combat fraud are laid down in Article 35 of\nRegulation (EU) No 1077/2011 which provides as follows: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to combat fraud, corruption and other\nunlawful activities, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 shall apply.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency shall accede to the\nInterinstitutional Agreement concerning internal investigations by the European\nAnti\u2011fraud Office (OLAF) and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate\nprovisions applicable to all the employees of the Agency.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decisions concerning funding and the\nimplementing agreements and instruments resulting from them shall explicitly\nstipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may carry out, if necessary, on\u2011the\u2011spot\nchecks among the recipients of the Agency's funding and the agents responsible\nfor allocating it.\nIn accordance with this provision, the decision of the Management\nBoard of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT\nsystems in the area of freedom, security and justice concerning the terms and\nconditions for internal investigations in relation to the prevention of fraud,\ncorruption and any illegal activity detrimental to the Union's interests was\nadopted on 28 June 2012.\nMoreover, DG HOME is currently drafting its fraud prevention and\ndetection strategy.\n\n3.                      \nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n3.1.                \nHeading(s) of the multiannual financial\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\nVia the delegation agreement the Agency will be\nentrusted with the task to set up the appropriate tools at the level of its\nlocal financial systems in order to guarantee an efficient monitoring,\nfollow-up and reporting of the costs linked to the implementation of the RTP in\ncompliance with Article 60 of the new Financial Regulation.
