Following an expiry review, the Council by Regulation (EC) No\n192/2007, imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty for a further period of five\nyears. The anti-dumping measures were subsequently amended by Council\nRegulation 1286/2008 pursuant to Article 19 of the Council Regulation (EC) No\n597/2009 on protection against subsidised import from countries not members of\nthe European Community ('the basic anti-subsidy Regulation'). A later interim\nreview pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation amended the measures\nin force by Council Implementing Regulation No 906/2011. \nBy Decision 2000/745/EC, as amended from time\nto time, the Commission accepted undertakings setting a minimum import price\noffered by three exporting producers in India.\nIn parallel to the measures against the\ncountries concerned, anti-dumping duties exist against imports of PET from\nChina (extended in November 2010) and countervailing measures are in force\nsince September 2010 against imports of PET originating in Iran, Pakistan and\nthe United Arab Emirates. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations against\nOman and Saudi Arabia were closed in 2011 following a withdrawal of the\ncomplaint. \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nInterested parties concerned by the proceeding\nhave had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in\nline with the provisions of the basic Regulation.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is the result of the\nimplementation of the basic Regulation.\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for a\ngeneral impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that\nhave to be assessed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nOn 24 February 2012, the Commission announced\nby a notice, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the\ninitiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to\nimports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Taiwan and Thailand.\nThe review was initiated following a request\nlodged by the Committee of Polyethylene Terephthalate Manufacturers in Europe\n(CPME) on behalf of Union producers representing around 95 %, of the Union\nproduction of certain polyethylene terephthalate.\nWith respect to India, Taiwan and Thailand, the\nreview investigation found continued dumping of the product concerned which\nwould result in the recurrence of injury to the Union industry in case\nanti-dumping measures were lifted. It was further established that the\ncontinuation of measures was not against the interest of the Union.\nAs for Indonesia and Malaysia, it was concluded\nthat it was not likely that imports to the Union from those countries would\nresume at dumped prices in injurious quantities to the Union market in the\nshort to medium term should measures be allowed to lapse.\nTherefore it is suggested that the Council\nadopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to extend the existing\nmeasures for India, Taiwan and Thailand and to terminate the measures for\nIndonesia and Malaysia.\nLegal basis\nThis proposal concerns the application of\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against\ndumped imports from countries not members of the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n2013/0122 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and\nThailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation\n(EC) No 1225/2009, and terminating the expiry review proceeding concerning\nimports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Indonesia and\nMalaysia\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community [1] ('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Articles 9(2), 9(4) and\n11(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission'), after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA.

Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000 was subsequently\namended by Council Regulation (EC) No 496/2002[3],\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 823/2004[4],\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 83/2005[5] and\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1646/2005[6]. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an expiry review\nand partial interim review, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 192/2007[7] ('the measures in force'), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty\non imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in, inter alia,\nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand for a further period of five\nyears. Regulation (EC) No 192/2007 was subsequently amended by Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1286/2008[8], Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 906/2011[9] and by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 295/2013[10] .\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2000/745/EC[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and subsequent amendments, the Commission accepted\nundertakings setting a minimum import price offered by exporting producers in\nIndia and Indonesia.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Countervailing measures in\nforce\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n2603/2000[12], the Council imposed a definitive countervailing\nduty on imports of PET originating in India, Malaysia and Thailand. Following an expiry review, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No\n193/2007[13], imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports originating in\nIndia for a further period of five years (\u2018the countervailing measures in\nforce\u2019).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for an expiry\nreview\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication\nof a notice of impending expiry[14] of the\nanti-dumping measures in force, the Commission received on 25 November 2011 a request for the initiation of an expiry\nreview of these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. The\nrequest was lodged by the Committee of Polyethylene Terephthalate Manufacturers\nin Europe ('the applicant'), on behalf of producers representing around 95% of\nthe Union production of certain polyethylene terephthalate. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was based on\nthe grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a\ncontinuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the Union industry.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry\nreview\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the\ninitiation of an expiry review, the Commission announced on 24 February 2012,\nby a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[15] ('the notice of initiation'), the initiation of an expiry review\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel investigation\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n24 February 2012, the Commission also announced, by a notice published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union[16], the initiation of an expiry review\npursuant to Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009[17] ('the basic anti-subsidy Regulation') of the countervailing\nmeasures in force on imports of certain PET originating in India.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\nand period considered\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping covered the period from 1\nJanuary 2011 to 31 December 2011 ('the review investigation period' or 'RIP').\nThe examination of the trends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of\na continuation or recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2008\nto the end of the RIP ('the period considered'). \n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicant and other known Union producers, exporting producers in\nthe countries concerned,\nunrelated importers, users known to be concerned and the representatives of the\ncountries concerned of the initiation of the expiry review.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a\nhearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. All interested parties, who so requested and\nshowed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were\ngranted a hearing.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nlarge number of exporting producers in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and\nThailand, as well as unrelated importers it was considered appropriate to\nexamine whether sampling should be used in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable the\nCommission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select\na sample, the above parties were requested to make themselves known within 15\ndays of the initiation of the review and to provide the Commission with the\ninformation requested in the notice of initiation. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the selection of\nthe samples of exporting producers, seven known exporting producers in India\nwere contacted. Seven exporting producers replied and indicated a willingness\nto be included in the sample. Based on their volume of exports to the Union, a sample of three Indian\nexporting producers was selected. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five known exporting producers\nin Indonesia were contacted. However, no exporting producer in Indonesia\nexpressed a willingness to cooperate with the investigation. Accordingly, all\nknown exporting producers and the authorities of Indonesia were informed that\nfindings in relation to Indonesia would be made on the basis of the facts\navailable in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two known exporting\nproducers in Malaysia were contacted. Only one exporting producer replied and\nindicated a willingness to be included in the sample. Therefore, it was decided\nthat sampling was not necessary with regards to exporting producers in\nMalaysia. All other known exporting producers and the authorities of Malaysia\nwere informed that findings in relation to the non-cooperating exporting producers\nwould be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18\nof the basic Regulation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Six known exporting\nproducers in Taiwan and one exporting producers\u2019 association were contacted. No\nexporting producer in Taiwan expressed a willingness to be included in the\nsample. All known producers, including their representative association, as well as the authorities of Taiwan, were informed\nthat findings in relation to Taiwan would be made on the basis of facts available\nin accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nine known exporting\nproducers in Thailand were contacted. Only one exporting producer replied and\nindicated a willingness to be included in the sample. Therefore, it was decided\nthat sampling was not necessary with regards to exporting producers in\nThailand. All other known exporting producers and the authorities of Thailand\nwere informed that findings in relation to non-cooperating exporting producers\nwould be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18\nof the basic Regulation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission announced in the notice of initiation that it had\nprovisionally selected a sample of Union producers. This sample consisted of\nfour companies, out of the thirteen Union producers that were known prior to\nthe initiation of the investigation, selected on the basis of the largest\nrepresentative volume of production and sales that could reasonably be\ninvestigated within the time available. The sample represented over 50% of the\ntotal estimated Union production and sales during the RIP. Interested parties\nwere invited to consult the file and to comment on the appropriateness of this\nchoice within 15 days of the date of publication of the notice of initiation. All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were\nparticular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain\ninterested parties raised objections concerning the sampling of Union\nproducers. They claimed that: (i) the Commission should not resort to sampling,\nin particular, since no sampling was used in the previous investigation; (ii)\nthe method used for the selection of the sample was contested on the grounds\nthat it 'confuses three different steps', namely, the\nsupport for the initiation of the expiry review,\ndefinition of the Union industry and sampling; (iii) the provisional sample was\nset up on the basis of incorrect and incomplete information; (iv) the selected\nprovisional sample was not representative because it included entities rather\nthan groups; it was also claimed that including one company that went through a\nrecent divestment or another company that had related sales diminished the\nrepresentativity of the sample. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arguments raised by the parties were addressed as follows: \n\u2013              \nThe decision to use a sample is made for each\ninvestigation independently depending on the particular circumstances of each case and Article 11(9)\nof the basic Regulation does not govern the use of such a sample for the\ndetermination of injury in the context of an expiry review. Unlike the previous\ninvestigations, where the investigation of all companies that came forward and\ncooperated was feasible, the Commission considered in the current review that,\nin view of their large number, not all Union producers could be reasonably\ninvestigated in the time available and that the conditions of Article 17 were\ntherefore met. \n\u2013              \nThe Commission did not 'confuse' the\ndetermination of the support for the initiation of the expiry review, the\ndetermination of the Union industry and the selection of the provisional sample\nas these steps remained independent from each other and were decided upon\nseparately. It was not demonstrated to what extent the use of the production\nand sales data provided by the Union producers in the context of the\nexamination of the support for the initiation of the expiry review had affected\nthe representativity of the sample. \n\u2013              \nThe sample was set up on the basis of the\ninformation available at the time of selection in accordance with Article 17 of\nthe basic Regulation. The representativity of the sample was reviewed following\nthe comments of the parties concerning specific company data. None of the\ncomments made were considered to be founded. \n\u2013              \nAs required by Article 17 of the basic\nRegulation the sample was established on the basis of the largest representative volume of production and sales that\ncould be reasonably investigated within the time available. The entities\nbelonging to larger groups that were found to operate independently from other\nsubsidiaries of the same group were considered representative of the Union\nindustry and there was therefore no need to investigate the entire group on a\nconsolidated basis. At the same time, the companies were sampled as economic\nentities, ensuring that all relevant data could be verified. Moreover, the\ndivestments and existence of related sales were part of the characteristics of\nthe sector in the period considered and therefore none of these elements was\nconsidered to diminish the representativity of the sample.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure of\nthe essential facts and considerations (\u2018disclosure\u2019) the parties reiterated\nthe above-mentioned arguments which have already been addressed. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three Indian sampled exporting producers,\nthe sole Malaysian exporting producer and the sole Thai exporting producer that\nexpressed a willingness to be included in the sample submitted questionnaire\nreplies. However the questionnaire reply of one Indian sampled producer\nrevealed that it only exported insignificant volumes of the product concerned\nduring the RIP and therefore verification visits were eventually completed in\nthe two remaining exporting producers which together represented 99% of total\nimports from India to the Union during the RIP. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one\nIndian cooperating producer requested a calculation of its dumping margin. In this\nrespect it was reconfirmed that the exports from this company were\ninsignificant and consequently had no impact on the determination of the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping in the present expiry\nreview. Therefore, this request was rejected. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling for unrelated importers was\nforeseen in the notice of initiation. None of the twenty four contacted\nunrelated importers cooperated in the present investigation.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All five known suppliers of\nraw material were contacted upon the initiation and received relevant\nquestionnaire. Two suppliers replied to the questionnaire. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All known users and users'\nassociations were contacted upon the initiation. Seventeen users submitted a\nquestionnaire reply. Twenty associations of users from 16 Member States made\nthemselves known and made submissions.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification of information\nreceived\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for a determination of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and of the Union interest.\nVerification visits were carried out at the premises of the following\ninterested parties:\n(a)         \nUnion producers \n\u2013              \nIndorama Polymers Europe, UAB, Netherlands\n\u2013              \nEquipolymers, Italy, Germany\n\u2013              \nNeo Group, UAB, Lithuania\n\u2013              \nNovapet SA, Spain\n(b)         \nExporting producers in India:\n\u2013              \nDhunseri Petrochem & Tea Ltd, Kolkata;\n\u2013              \nReliance Industries Ltd, Navi Mumbai; \n(c)         \nProducer in Malaysia:\n\u2013              \nMPI Polyester Industries Sdn Bhd, Shah\nAlam, Selangor;\n(d)         \nProducer in Thailand:\n\u2013              \nIndorama Polymers Pcl, Bangkok;\n(e)         \nUsers in the Union \n\u2013              \nCoca-Cola Europe, Belgium;\n\u2013              \nNestle Waters France, France.\nB.

They were therefore considered to be like products\nwithin the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. \nC. LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OR\nRECURRENCE OF DUMPING\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the existing measures would be likely to lead to a\ncontinuation or recurrence of dumping.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case of non-cooperation,\nsuch as in the case of the Indonesia and Taiwan, use had to be made of facts\navailable in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. As far as Malaysia and Thailand are concerned, information made\navailable by the cooperating companies as well as facts available were used.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, the total\nimport volume of the product concerned originating from the countries concerned\naccording to Eurostat amounted to 126,500 tonnes, representing 4.5% of the\nUnion market share.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the development\nof production capacity and domestic consumption in the countries concerned, a\nproprietary market intelligence report included in the request was used as well\nas publicly available information\nsuch as public company web profiles and verified questionnaire replies of the\ncooperating companies. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 India\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above, seven\nIndian exporting producers cooperated and three of them were selected for the\nsample. Since one of the sampled companies was found to only export\ninsignificant volumes of the product concerned during the RIP, verification\nvisits were eventually completed in the two remaining exporting producers which\ntogether represented 99% of total imports from India to the Union during the\nRIP. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP total Indian\nimports amounted to 97,000 tonnes representing 76% of total imports from the countries concerned by the current review and 3.4%\nof the Union market share. The two sampled Indian exporting producers were\nsubject to an undertaking and were found to respect the minimum import price\n(MIP) during the RIP. As these represented almost the total export from India,\ntheir market share corresponded almost exactly to the market share of all India.\n\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP\n4.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(2) of the basic Regulation, it was first established for each sampled Indian\nexporting producer whether its total domestic sales of the like product to independent\ncustomers were representative, i.e. whether the total volume of such sales was\nequal to at least 5% of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to\nthe Union.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, those types\nof the like product sold domestically by the exporting producers having overall representative domestic sales, and that\nwere identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the\nUnion, were identified.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was further examined\nwhether the domestic sales of each cooperating exporting producer were representative for each\nproduct type, i.e. whether domestic sales of each product type constituted at\nleast 5% of the sales volume of the same product type to the Union. For the\nproduct types sold in representative quantities it was then examined whether\nsuch sales were made in the ordinary course of trade (\u2018OCOT\u2019), in accordance\nwith Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing the\nproportion of domestic sales to independent customers on the domestic market\nwhich were profitable for each exported type of the product concerned during\nthe RIP.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As it was found that the\ndomestic sales of all product types were made in sufficient quantities and in the OCOT, normal value was\nbased on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of all the\ndomestic sales of that type made during the RIP.\n4.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since all export sales of\nthe product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Union,\nthe export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the\nprices actually paid or payable. \n4.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison between the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price was made on an ex-works basis and at the same level of\ntrade. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a fair\ncomparison between normal value and the export price, in accordance with\nArticle 2(10) of the basic Regulation, account was taken of differences in\nfactors affecting prices and price comparability. For this purpose, due allowance in the form of adjustments was\nmade for differences in transport, insurance, handling, financial costs,\npacking costs, commissions and rebates where demonstrated to affect price\ncomparability. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer claimed\nan adjustment pursuant to Article 2(10)(b) of the basic Regulation, on the\ngrounds that import charges were allegedly borne by the like product when\nintended for consumption in the exporting country but were refunded by means of a duty drawback scheme ('DDS')\nwhen the product was sold for export to the Union. The investigation showed,\nhowever, that no correlation existed between the duty drawback amount,\ncalculated as a fixed percentage of the FOB value of products exported, and the\nactual duties paid on imported inputs contained in the exported product. In\nfact, it has been found that even exporters which procure all their inputs\nlocally and therefore do not import any of their inputs, are still entitled to\nbenefit from the DDS. Therefore, the claim was rejected. \n4.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under\nArticle 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average normal\nvalue by type was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product\nconcerned. This comparison showed the existence of dumping which amounted to\n4.8% and 6.6% respectively for the two sampled exporting producers which\nexported to the EU during the RIP, despite the fact both companies were subject\nto price undertakings. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, an\nexporting producer claimed that the calculation of the dumping margin on the\nbasis of the domestic sales of four months instead of all months of the RIP was\nnot justified and argued that it artificially inflated its dumping margin. It\nmust be noted that, in the context of an expiry review the measures are either\nmaintained or repealed but cannot be amended. In addition, the four months\nconcerned, i.e. one month per each quarter and the normal value and export\nprices of the same months were compared. It follows that a fair comparison was\nguaranteed. Therefore the claim was rejected.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the\ndetermination of the existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of continuation of dumping should\nmeasures be repealed was also investigated.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect the\nfollowing elements were analysed: the volume and prices of dumped imports from\nIndia, attractiveness of the Union market and other third markets, production\ncapacity and excess capacity available for exports of the Indian producers.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis below was\nmainly based on verified questionnaire replies and the market intelligence\nstudy cross-checked with publicly available information.\n4.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and prices of dumped\nimports from India \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from India into the\nUnion doubled over the period considered and reached around 97,000 tonnes\nduring the RIP representing 3.5% of the total EU consumption during the RIP.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period\nconsidered, imports prices were fluctuating and followed the same trends as the\nsales prices of the Union industry on the Union market. Overall, imports prices\nincreased from 2008 to the RIP by 29%. No undercutting was found during the\nRIP. \n4.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe RIP, Indian export prices to third countries were generally lower than its\ndomestic prices. This price difference amounted to up to 7.5% of the export\nprice level. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indian\nexport prices to third countries were generally below the price of Indian\nexports to the Union which supports the conclusion that the Union market is\nattractive as the Union market may generate higher profits. However, due to\nthis difference in pricing policy, it cannot be excluded that prices to the\nUnion may decrease even further should measures be repealed. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, an\nexporting producer contended that the assessment of the attractiveness of the\nUnion market was influenced by the existence of an undertaking, which meant\nthat it could only export when prices where high. However a comparison of the\nminimum import price (MIP) imposed by the undertaking with the ex-works price\nof exports to the Union during the eight months where the producer was found\nexporting to the Union reveals that the export price to the Union was on\naverage significantly higher than the MIP, indicating that the pricing policy\nwas only marginally influenced by the undertaking, if at all. It follows that\nthe existence of an undertaking in itself did not change the conclusion reached\nregarding the attractiveness of the Union market. Therefore, this argument was\nrejected. \n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nexcess capacity available for exports of the Indian producers\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, India had a\nproduction capacity of 700,000-900,000 tonnes and the excess of production\ncapacity available for exports was of a 200,000-300,000 tonnes. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the information collected during the\ninvestigation, Indian capacity is projected to increase further and reach some\n1,600,000 \u2013 1,800,000 tonnes by 2014. That increase is expected to be much\nsteeper than the increase in domestic consumption. As a result, the excess of\ncapacity over domestic demand is estimated to reach about 600,000-700,000\ntonnes in 2014, which would represent around 21-25% of the total Union\nconsumption during the RIP. It is also noted that\ntrade defence measures are in place against India in Turkey and South Africa,\nthus potentially reducing the markets that could be available for Indian exports.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a likelihood that\nexports to the Union would increase should the measures be repealed, given in\nparticular the higher price levels in the Union market and the market size with\nthe high consumption. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that the\nexporting producers would decrease their export prices to the Union even\nfurther and that the dumping observed during the RIP would therefore be\nexacerbated.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An exporting producer\nsubmitted that the production capacity available for exports in India would\ndecrease after 2014 and therefore the current situation would only be\ntemporary. It is noted that the alleged decrease of capacity available for\nexports after 2014 was found in line with the projections of the market\nintelligence report. Therefore it was concluded that this submission was not of\na nature to modify the analysis with regard to the development of capacity\navailable for exports. After disclosure, an exporting producer claimed that\nimportant temporary excess in capacities available for export were inevitable\ndue to the fact that generally production capacity increases can be done only\nin large increments due to the minimum size of modern PET plants. In reply to\nthis, it should be noted that during between the RIP and the following year,\nproduction capacity extensions in the range of at least 150,000 to 200,000\ntonnes were made. It follows that the invoked reasoning alone cannot justify\nthe excess in capacity available for exports quoted in recital (55) above. In\nany event, in this context the cause of the excess capacity available for\nexports is irrelevant. Therefore the claim was rejected. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\nparties claimed that the excess capacity available for exports developing in\nIndia could be absorbed also by other third countries and that therefore the\nexcess capacity available for exports as calculated by the Commission was not\nproperly assessed. It was not assumed in any way that the entirety of any\nexcess capacity available for exports would be directed to the Union. Therefore\nthe claim was rejected. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An exporting producer\nstated that Turkey and South Africa were rather unimportant export markets and\nobjected to the existence of trade defence measures against India in these\ncountries being interpreted by the Commission as an indication that India would\ndump the product concerned on the Union market. The Commission\u2019s assessment is\nthat the trade defence measures in place in Turkey and South Africa against\nimports from India potentially reduce the markets that could be available for\nIndian exports. Moreover, should the claim that Turkey and South Africa are\nunimportant export markets be true, the increasing excess capacity in India\nimplies a likelihood of increased exports to the Union even in the absence of\nthe trade defence measures imposed by Turkey and South Africa. Therefore, the\nclaim was rejected. \n4.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the above, and in particular in view of the continued dumping and\nthe high excess capacity available, it can be concluded that significant\nvolumes of imports from\nIndia are likely to be directed to the Union market at dumped prices should\nmeasures be allowed to lapse and therefore there is a likelihood of\ncontinuation of dumping.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of the five known\nIndonesian exporting producers cooperated in the investigation and therefore the analysis of the likelihood of\ncontinuation of dumping was based on facts available in accordance with Article\n18 of the basic Regulation. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Eurostat, import volumes from Indonesia during the RIP amounted to 253\ntonnes representing close to 0% of total imports from the countries concerned\nby the current review and close to 0% in terms of Union market share.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the lack of\ncooperation, based on the elements in the request for review, imports from\nIndonesia were made at dumped prices with a dumping margin of 10.8%.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the\ndetermination of the existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of continuation of dumping should\nmeasures be repealed was also investigated.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect the\nfollowing elements were analysed: the volume and prices of dumped imports from\nIndonesia, attractiveness of the Union market and other third markets, and\nproduction capacity and excess capacity available for exports of the Indonesian\nproducers.\n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume and prices of\ndumped imports from Indonesia\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Indonesia into\nthe Union remained at a very low level during the entire period considered. No\nimports were made in 2008. In 2009, imports amounted to approximately 400\ntonnes, increased in 2010 to about 1000 tonnes and decreased again to 253\ntonnes during the RIP. The corresponding market share of the total Union\nconsumption of these imports was close to 0% throughout the whole period\nconsidered.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2009 and 2010 Indonesian\nimport prices were on average higher than those of the Union industry on the\nUnion market. During the RIP, although the average Indonesian import price was\nslightly lower than the one of the Union industry on the Union market, those\nprice levels could be considered similar. No undercutting was found during the\nRIP. \n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the information\nprovided in the review request and official Indonesian trade statistics website\ncovered a broader product scope than the product concerned. Therefore prices to\nthird country export markets could not be reliably established. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the absence of\ncooperation it was also not possible to establish a domestic price.\n5.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nexcess capacity available for exports\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that there was no cooperation\nforthcoming from Indonesia, the evolution of production capacity and domestic\ndemand was established on the basis of data contained in the request for review\namended following a submission of the applicant received during the\ninvestigation stating that the only capacity extension plan forecast in the\nrequest for review would not materialise. The amended data was cross-checked\nwith publicly available information such as public company web profiles. On the\nbasis of the above, production capacity in Indonesia appears to remain at the\nsame level during the entire period considered at 400,000-600,000 tonnes. The\nexcess capacity available for export during the period considered continuously\ndecreased and reached 65-70% of the total country capacity during the RIP\nrepresenting 9-11% of the total EU consumption. There is no increase in\ncapacity forecast until at least 2014. At the same time, consumption in\nIndonesia is expected to increase. As a result, the portion of the production\ncapacity available for exports is expected to decrease and to represent only a\nvery minor part of the total Union consumption during the RIP.\n5.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, in\nparticular the findings concerning the expected evolution of capacity, it was\nconsidered that there is no likelihood that Indonesian exporting producers will\nresume exporting injurious quantities at dumped prices to the Union market in\nthe short to medium term should measures be repealed. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malaysia\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only one of the two known\nexporting producers cooperated in the investigation but was found not to export\nto the Union during the RIP. This producer represented around 20% of the total\nproduction capacity in Malaysia during the RIP. The information provided by the\ncooperating producer in Malaysia was used with regard to the analysis of the\nprice behaviour on the Malaysian domestic market as well as to other third\ncountry markets.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings were also based on\nfacts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, i.e. on\nthe request for review and publicly available information such as public web\ncompany profiles.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe RIP, imports into the Union from Malaysia amounted to 17,000 tonnes\nrepresenting 13% of total imports from the countries concerned by the current\nreview and close to 0.6% of the Union market share.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the request\nfor review, imports from Malaysia were made at dumped prices with a dumping\nmargin of 6.7%. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the cooperating\nproducer did not export to the Union during the RIP, it was not possible to\ncalculate a dumping margin for that company. However a normal value was\ncalculated on the basis of its domestic sales and a comparison of this normal\nvalue with the price of imports from Malaysia to the Union as reported by\nEurostat gives a figure that is consistent with the dumping margin referred to\nin recital (75). \n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the\ndetermination of the existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of\ncontinuation of dumping should measures be repealed was also investigated.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect the\nfollowing elements were analysed: the volume and prices of dumped imports from\nMalaysia, attractiveness of the Union market and other third markets, and\nproduction capacity and excess capacity available for exports of the Malaysian\nproducers.\n6.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume and prices of\ndumped imports from Malaysia\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Malaysia into\nthe Union increased during the period considered from around 8,000 tonnes to\n17,000 tonnes, after a steep decrease in 2009 and 2010. Despite the overall\nincrease of imports from Malaysia, market shares remained close to 0% except\nfor the RIP where it reached 0.6%. \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period\nconsidered, import prices were fluctuating and followed the same trends as the\nsales prices of the Union industry on the Union market. Overall, imports prices\nincreased from 2008 to the RIP by 25%. No undercutting was found during the\nRIP.\n6.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, the\ncooperating exporting producer exported 300-500 tonnes of the like product to\nother third countries. The analysis of those sales shows that during the RIP\nMalaysian export prices to third countries were generally higher than its\ndomestic prices. This price difference amounted to 5-10%.\n6.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nexcess capacity available for exports\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total production capacity\nin Malaysia was around 100,000-300,000 tonnes during the RIP on the basis of\nthe review for request cross-checked with publicly available information such\nas public company web profiles. The excess capacity available for exports\nduring the period considered continuously decreased and reached around 52-55%\nof the total country capacity during the RIP representing 3-4% of the total EU\nconsumption. According to the same sources, production capacity is forecast to\nremain at this level at least until 2014 while domestic consumption is expected\nto increase. Consequently, the portion of the production capacity available for\nexports is expected to decrease and to represent 2-3% of the total Union\nconsumption during the RIP. It is therefore not expected that the import\nvolumes from Malaysia would significantly increase should the measures be\nrepealed.\n6.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, in\nparticular the findings concerning the expected evolution of capacity, it was\nconsidered that there is no likelihood that Malaysian exporting producers will\nresume exporting injurious quantities at dumped prices to the Union market in\nthe short to medium term should measures be repealed. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taiwan\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None\nof the four Taiwanese exporting producers cooperated in the investigation and\ntherefore the analysis of the likelihood of continuation of dumping was based\non facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. \n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe RIP import volumes in the Union from Taiwan amounted to 12,000 tonnes,\nrepresenting 9.7% of total imports from the countries concerned by the current\nreview, and around 0.4% of Union market share.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the lack of\ncooperation, based on the elements in the request for review, imports from\nTaiwan were made at dumped prices with a dumping margin of 12%. \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, some\nparties claimed that for the purpose of calculating a dumping margin, the Commission\nshould have used the domestic and export prices of a Taiwanese PET producer\nwhich was the applicant of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review pursuant Article 11(4) of\nthe basic Regulation[18] for which the investigation period was overlapping with the RIP of\nthe current proceeding. It must be noted, however, that the PET producer in\nquestion did not cooperate in this expiry review. Information submitted in the\ncontext of an investigation can only be used for the purpose for which it was\nrequested. Therefore, the information obtained in the said \u2018new exporter\u2019\nreview cannot be used in the context of the current expiry review. In addition,\nit is the smallest PET producer in Taiwan and its export sales to the Union\nrepresented only an insignificant share of the total Taiwanese exports during\nthe RIP. Therefore, the claim was rejected. It was claimed that overall,\nimports from Taiwan during the RIP were not dumped. However, it is recalled\nthat none of the Taiwanese exporting producers cooperated and therefore dumping\ncould not be determined on the basis of data submitted by these exporting\nproducers. The claim that dumping did not exist was therefore not substantiated\nby any evidence and was rejected. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further\nto the determination of the existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping should measures be repealed was also investigated.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect the following elements were analysed: the volume and prices of\ndumped imports from Taiwan, attractiveness of the Union market and other third\nmarkets, and production capacity and excess capacity available for export of\nthe Taiwanese producers.\n7.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume and prices of\ndumped imports from Taiwan\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Taiwan into the\nUnion increased during the period considered from around 10,000 tonnes to\n12,000 tonnes, after a decrease in 2009 and 2010. Despite the overall increase\nof imports from Taiwan, market shares remained close to 0% and, during the RIP,\nreached 0.4% of the total Union consumption during the RIP. \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period\nconsidered, imports prices were fluctuating and followed the same trends as the\nsales prices of the Union industry on the Union market.

No undercutting was found during the\nRIP. \n7.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistics\nfrom the Taiwanese Bureau of Foreign Trade indicate that sales to third\ncountries were made in large volumes, accounting for around 60% of the\ncountry's total production capacity during the RIP.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comparison of the average\nexport price available from the same source with the normal value contained in\nthe request for review indicated that the export prices to third countries were\ngenerally lower than its domestic prices. This price difference amounted to up\nto around 12% of the export price level. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistics\nfrom the Taiwanese Bureau of Foreign Trade showed that the average export price\nto third countries was below the price of the Union industry in the Union. The\nprice difference amounted to around 7% of the export prices. During the RIP,\nthe average price of exports to the Union was also found to be higher than the\naverage price of exports to other third countries. The difference amounted to\nup to 5.5% of the price of exports to other third countries. There is therefore\nan incentive to export to the Union where the prevailing price level of the\nUnion industry is higher. This suggests that if measures were repealed, and in\nconnection with the large excess capacities available for exports (see recitals\n(97) to (98) below), Taiwanese exporters are likely to export PET at dumped\nprices and at quantities above levels likely to cause injury to the Union. \n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one\ninterested party contested the Commission's use of statistics of the Taiwanese\nBureau of Foreign Trade on the basis that the product code allegedly did not\ncoincide with the product concerned. It is true that Taiwan and the Union use\ndifferent scales to measure viscosity, namely the 'intrinsic viscosity' in\nTaiwan and the 'viscosity number' in the Union. However, using the mathematical\nrelationship between both scales, it can be concluded that the Taiwanese\nproduct code used corresponds to the product concerned. Therefore the\nallegation was rejected.\n7.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nexcess capacity available for exports\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given\nthat there was no cooperation forthcoming from Taiwan, the evolution of\ncapacity and domestic demand was established on the basis of data contained in\nthe review request cross-checked with publicly available information such as\npublic company web profiles. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntotal production capacity in Taiwan was around 1,000,000-1,200,000 tonnes\nduring the RIP. The excess capacity available for exports remained stable\nduring the three first years of the period considered and increased during the\nRIP where it represented around 80% of the total country capacity during the\nRIP and 28-33% of the total Union consumption during the RIP. According to the\nsame sources, production capacity is forecast to increase significantly at\nleast until 2014 while domestic consumption is expected to increase only\nslightly. Consequently, the portion of the production capacity available for\nexports is expected to increase to 1,200,000-1,300,000 tonnes representing\n42-47% of the total Union consumption during the RIP. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 This\ndemonstrates that Taiwanese exporting producers of the product concerned are\nheavily dependent on export sales and that there is a likelihood that exports\nto the Union will increase should the measures be repealed. In particular, the\nprice level of the Union industry on the Union market is higher than the export\nprice of Taiwan on third country export markets, which makes the Union market\nmore attractive than other third country markets. On the other hand, it cannot\nbe excluded that in order to gain market share, some exporters may decrease\ntheir export prices to the Union. In addition,\ntrade defence measures are in place against Taiwan in Turkey and South Africa.\nThis reduces the free access to potential other markets available for Taiwanese\nexports.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Some\ninterested parties argued that there is no spare capacity in Taiwan that would\nallow for a substantial increase of exports to the Union. In addition, it was\nargued that the main export markets of Taiwan's PET production are the\nAsia-Pacific region and the Americas. The CIF prices of imports of PET from\nTaiwan are higher than those of all other main sources of imports into the\nUnion and the measures in force on imports of PET originating in Taiwan are\nvery low and their expiry would not result in a significant price difference. \n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis to be noted that none of the Taiwanese exporting producers cooperated in the\npresent review. Moreover, the findings described in recitals (97) to (98) above\npoint to the contrary. On these grounds the allegations made by the parties in\nquestion have to be rejected. \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, these\nparties reiterated the importance of the Asia-Pacific and South America regions\nas export markets and claimed that these markets would attract a significant\nproportion of the projected Taiwanese increase in the excess capacity available\nfor exports. In support of their claim, the parties provided the relative\nvalues of production capacity and domestic demand in 2012 and 2020 for both\nregions. It should be noted that the situation in 2020 is irrelevant to the\ncurrent expiry review and that using 2012 as one term of the comparison amounts\nto disregarding the important capacity extensions made during the RIP up to\n2012. Therefore the claim was rejected.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\nsome parties claimed that the excess capacity available for exports developing\nin Taiwan should take into account the increasing demand on other third markets.\nAs a result they claimed that the excess capacity available for exports was not\nproperly assessed. As already mentioned in recital (58) above, the\ninvestigation did not conclude that all capacity available for exports would be\ndirected to the Union. It was not considered in any way that the entirety of\nany excess capacity available for exports would be directed to the Union. Based\non the available data it is reasonable to consider that given the\nattractiveness of the Union market in terms of price and size and the large\nvolumes of extra capacity available for exports, the quantities likely to be\ndirected to the Union market are expected to be above levels likely to cause\ninjury. In addition, it is recalled that none of the Taiwanese PET producers\ncooperated in the investigation and precise figures on actual production and\ncapacity as well as domestic and export sales were not available. Therefore,\nconclusions with regard to continuation of dumping had to be based on the facts\navailable as indicated in recital (84) above. In this regard, in view of the\nsignificant quantities available for exports and given the analysis of the\nexport price levels to other third countries as well as the price level in the\nUnion in recitals (93) to (95) above, it is reasonable to consider that exports\nfrom Taiwan will be re-directed to the Union at dumped prices and at quantities\nabove levels likely to cause injury should the measures be repealed. Therefore\nthe claim was rejected.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 Another\nparty claimed that the ad-valorem duty applicable to Taiwan during the RIP is\nat very low levels and therefore it cannot be concluded that imports from\nTaiwan will be made at dumped levels should the measures be repealed. The\ncurrent dumping margin in force is a minimum price based on an ad valorem duty\nof 12.4%. The fact the prices were higher during the RIP and that therefore the\nhypothetical ad valorem duty would be at a lower level, is irrelevant because\nit does not take into consideration likely price developments after the RIP\nshould measures be repealed as shown above in recitals (94) and (98) above.\nThis argument was therefore rejected.\n7.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the large and increasing capacity, the attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and the measures in force in other third countries, it was concluded\nthat it is likely that exports from Taiwan would be re-directed to the Union at\ndumped prices in quantities likely to cause injury should the measures be allowed\nto lapse. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one\nparty claimed that the alleged low level of dumping duty during the RIP should\nhave been taken into consideration in the analysis of the likelihood of\nrecurrence or continuation of dumping. However, it should be noted that none of\nthe exporting producers in Taiwan cooperated and that therefore the claim that\ndumping margins during the RIP were at low levels was not substantiated and\nrejected. It is recalled that the dumping margins found during the RIP were 12%\nbased on facts available. As mentioned above in recital (104), the analysis of\nthe likely price development of Taiwanese exports should measures be allowed to\nlapse has shown that continuation of dumping was likely. Therefore the claim\nwas rejected.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thailand\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Cooperation was only\nforthcoming from one exporting producer which did not export PET to the Union\nduring the RIP. The cooperating producer represented around 25% of the total\nproduction capacity of Thailand during the RIP. Three other producers are\npresent in Thailand which did not cooperate. Findings were therefore also based\non facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe RIP, exports to the Union amounted to 727 tonnes representing 0.6% of the\ntotal imports from the countries concerned by the current review and close to\n0% of the Union market share.\n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the review request, the imports in the Union\nwere made at dumped prices with a dumping margin of 14.1%. \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the cooperating\ncompany did not export to the Union during the RIP, it was not possible to\ncalculate a dumping margin for that company. However a normal value was\ncalculated on the basis of its domestic sales and a comparison of this normal\nvalue with the price of imports from Thailand to the Union as reported by\nEurostat gives a figure that is consistent with the dumping margin referred to in\nrecital (108) above.\n8.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the determination\nof the existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of continuation of\ndumping should measures be repealed was also investigated.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect the\nfollowing elements were analysed: the volume and prices of dumped imports from\nThailand, attractiveness of the Union market and other third markets, and\nproduction capacity and excess capacity available for exports of the Thai\nproducers.\n8.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume and prices of\ndumped imports from Thailand\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Thailand into\nthe Union remained at a negligible level during the entire period considered\nwith no imports in 2009 and 2010. During the RIP, imports increased from around\n500 tonnes in 2008 to around 700 tonnes which represented close to 0% of the\ntotal Union consumption during the RIP.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 During the period\nconsidered, the import prices increased from around 980 EUR/tonne in 2008 to\naround 1300 EUR/tonne during the RIP, i.e. by 32%. No undercutting was found\nduring the RIP.\n8.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket and other third markets\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, the average\ndomestic price of the sole cooperating exporting producer was found to be lower\nthan the average price charged by the Union Industry in the Union. The price\ndifference amounted to 9%. \n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 The cooperating exporting\nproducer was found to export to third country markets other than the Union. Its\naverage export price to those markets on an ex-works basis was lower than the\nnormal value. The price difference amounted to 10.8% of the average export\nprice. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 Exports from the cooperating\nexporting producer to other third countries were made at prices below the Union\nindustry price level in the Union. The price difference amounted to 6.6% of the\nexport prices to the third country markets. \n8.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\nexcess capacity available for exports\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Production\ncapacity in Thailand was established on the basis of the information in the\nrequest for review, publicly available information such as public web company profiles,\nand the questionnaire reply of the cooperating company. \n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 The production capacity in\nThailand increased significantly during the period considered and represented\nmore than three times the domestic consumption in Thailand during the RIP. The total\nproduction capacity in Thailand was between 700,000-900,000 tonnes during the\nRIP. The excess production capacity available for exports during the period\nconsidered continuously decreased and reached 70-75% of the total country\ncapacity during the RIP, representing 17-22% of the total EU consumption. This\nshows that Thailand is an export oriented country and that Thai producers of\nthe product concerned are heavily dependent on export sales. The investigation\nhas shown capacity will further increase by 2014 to up to 800,000-1,000,000\ntonnes. At the same time, according to the same sources, the domestic demand\nwill not increase in the same rhythm and will remain at a relatively low level.\nAs a consequence, the excess of capacity over domestic demand is expected to\nincrease significantly to around 700,000-800,000 tonnes in the near future,\nrepresenting 25-30% of the total Union consumption during the RIP. In addition, trade defence measures are\nin place against Thailand in Turkey and Malaysia thus reducing the free access\nto potential other third country markets available for exports. In view of the significant quantities available for exports and\ngiven the analysis of the export price levels to other third countries as well\nas the price level in the Union in recitals (114) to (116) above, it is\nreasonable to consider that exports from Thailand will be re-directed to the\nUnion at dumped prices and at quantities above levels likely to cause injury\nshould the measures be repealed.\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the\nThai Department of Foreign Trade argued that the comparison of production\ncapacity and domestic demand should have been considered at the level of the\nASEAN region. It is noted that the Thai government does not substantiate its\nclaim, and therefore there is no justification to alter the conclusions reached\non the basis the excess capacity available for exports in Thailand.\n8.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the large and\nincreasing capacity, the attractiveness of the Union market and the measures in\nforce in other third countries, it was concluded that it is likely that exports\nfrom Thailand would be re-directed to the Union at dumped prices in quantities\nlikely to cause injury should the measures be allowed to lapse. \nD. DEFINITION OF THE UNION INDUSTRY\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production and Union\nindustry\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 The like product is\nmanufactured by 13 known producers in the Union. They represent the Union\nindustry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) of the basic Regulation and will\nthereafter be referred as 'the Union industry'.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 Twelve known Union\nproducers, represented by the complainant in the present case, cooperated and\nsupported the investigation. One more known Union producer did not cooperate in\nthe present review. \n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 All available information\nconcerning Union industry, such as questionnaire replies, Eurostat and request\nfor review, was used in order to establish the total Union production for the\nRIP.\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion market for PET is characterised by a relatively high number of producers,\nbelonging usually to bigger groups with headquarters outside the Union. Between\n2000 and 2012 the Union PET industry has undergone through several transitions.\nThe market is in a process of consolidation with a number of recent takeovers\nand closures. New products, such as recycled PET and bio PET continue to be\ndeveloped together with a relatively recent spinoff of a recycling industry.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties argued that the description of the situation of the Union industry\nwas inaccurate as five producers were in fact belonging to one large transnational\ngroup and another three producers were related to PET packaging companies. None\nof these facts contradict the description provided in recital (124) explicitly\nstating that the Union producers are usually belonging to bigger groups as\ndisclosed. The impact of this concentration is addressed in recital (209) below.\nThe assessment of the impact of captive market is analysed in recitals (203) to\n(205) below.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above, given\nthe relatively high number of cooperating Union producers a sample of four\nUnion producers was selected, representing over 50% of the production and sales\nof the total Union production of the like product in the RIP. \nE. SITUATION ON THE UNION MARKET\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union Consumption\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption was\nestablished on the basis of the sales volumes of the Union industry on the\nUnion market, the import volumes data obtained from Eurostat and, concerning\nthe non-cooperating Union producer, from estimations based on the request for\nreview.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 After an initial increase in\n2009 and 2010, the consumption showed a slight decrease of 2% in the RIP as\ncompared to 2008, totalling to 2.802 million tonnes in the RIP.\n Table 1 \n Consumption   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume (tonnes) ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Consumption || 2,868,775 || 2,934,283 || 2,919,404 || 2,802,066 \n Index || 100 || 102 || 102 || 98 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, Eurostat, review request ||   \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from countries\nconcerned \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cumulation\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 In the expiry review\nconcluded in 2007, imports of PET originating in India, Taiwan, Thailand,\nMalaysia and Indonesia were assessed cumulatively in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation. It was\nexamined whether a cumulative assessment was also appropriate in the current\ninvestigation. \n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it was found that the dumping margins established for imports\nfrom India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia were above the de\nminimis level. As regards the import volumes to the Union market, these\nwere above negligible levels only for India. In the case of Taiwan, Thailand,\nIndonesia and Malaysia the imports volumes were below de minimis levels.\nA prospective analysis of the likely export volumes by each country, should the\nmeasures be repealed, was therefore performed. It revealed that imports from\nTaiwan and Thailand, unlike Indonesia and Malaysia, would likely increase to\nlevels above those reached in the RIP and likely exceed the negligibility\nthreshold, if measures were repealed (see recitals (102) and (118)). As to\nIndonesia and Malaysia, it was found that imports into the Union were\nnegligible in the period considered and the prospective excess capacity available\nfor exports was found to be very low. It is thus not very likely that this\nsituation will change in the short term. \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the fact that the\nvolume of dumped imports from Indonesia and Malaysia during the RIP was\nnegligible and that it is not likely to increase as explained in recital (130)\nabove, it was considered that the criteria set out in Article 3(4) of the basic\nRegulation were not met with regard to imports from Malaysia and Indonesia. \n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding imports from\nIndia, Taiwan and Thailand, it is to be noted that PET is a commodity based\nproduct with similar chemical and technical characteristics regardless of the\norigin. In that light, it is considered that the imported PET was\ninterchangeable with the types of PET produced in the Union. In addition, they\nwere marketed in the Union during the same period. Therefore, it is considered\nthat the imported PET originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand competed with\nPET produced in the Union. \n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nit is considered that the criteria set out in Article 3(4) of the basic\nRegulation were met with regard to India, Taiwan and Thailand. Imports from\nthese three countries were therefore examined cumulatively. Since the criteria\nset in Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation were not met with regard to\nMalaysia and Indonesia, imports originating in these two countries were\nexamined individually. \n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one\nparty objected the cumulation of imports from Thailand with imports from India\nand Taiwan while the imports from Malaysia and Indonesia were decumulated. It\nwas argued that Thailand was in a similar position to Malaysia and Indonesia\nand thus should have been treated in a similar way. It is recalled that given\nthe excess capacities available for exports found in Thailand (see recital (118)\nabove) the criteria of Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation were fulfilled. No\nparallel could have been drawn between Thailand and Malaysia and Indonesia\nsince the last two countries did not have excess capacities available for\nexports similar to those found in Thailand. The comment of the party was\ntherefore dismissed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from India, Taiwan\nand Thailand\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume, market share and\nprices of imports\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the measures in\nplace, the imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand have nearly doubled over the\nperiod considered. This is mainly due to the increase of imports from India\nwhich increased from 46,313 tonnes in 2008 to 96,678 tonnes in the RIP out of a\ntotal of 109,633 for the three countries in question. \n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of imports\nfrom India, Taiwan and Thailand rose accordingly from 2% in 2008 to 3.9% in the\nRIP. Imports from India reached a market share of 3.5% in the RIP,\nsignificantly above the market share established in the last expiry review\n(0.3%)\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 The average price stood at\n1,290 EUR/tonne in the RIP. This reflects an increase of 23% over the period\nconsidered, which was acquired after an initial decline of 20% in 2009. \n Table 2 \n Imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand   \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Volume of imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand (tonnes) || 57,178 || 54,173 || 90,154 || 109,633 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 95 || 158 || 192 \n Market share of imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand || 2.0% || 1.8% || 3.1% || 3.9% \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 93 || 155 || 196 \n Price of imports (EUR/tonne) || 1,049 || 838 || 1,031 || 1,290 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 80 || 98 || 123 \n Source: Eurostat. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the absence of\ncooperation by the Taiwanese exporting producers, price undercutting regarding\nimports from Taiwan had to be established on the basis of import statistics\n(Eurostat). Given that the cooperating Thai exporter did not export to the\nUnion during the RIP, in this case also, the price undercutting regarding\nimports from Thailand had to be established on the basis of import statistics\n(Eurostat). For India, the calculation was based on the data collected and\nverified on spot. The relevant sales prices of the Union industry were those to\nindependent customers, adjusted where needed to ex-works level. In the RIP, no\nundercutting was found for any of the countries concerned. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Malaysia and\nIndonesia \n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume, market share and\nprices of imports\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The import volumes from\nMalaysia doubled over the period considered despite a decline of 70% until\n2010. The imports from Indonesia remained negligible. The import volumes for both\ncountries remained below de minimis level.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of Malaysia\nincreased accordingly from 0.3% to 0.6%. The market share of Indonesia remained\nclose to 0% over the period considered.\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 The average unit price for\nMalaysia stood at 1,299 EUR/tonne in the RIP.

It is recalled that the measures against\nSouth Korea expired in 2012. Before expiration of the duties, over 99% of\nimports from this country were entering with 0% duty rate. For these reasons\nthe imports from South Korea are included in the analysis together with the\nimports from other countries without any measures (recitals (202) and (212)\nbelow). The claim was rejected as unsubstantiated. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry \n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 3(5) of\nthe basic Regulation, all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the\nstate of the Union industry during the period considered have been examined.\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of the\ninjury analysis, the injury indicators have been established at the following\ntwo levels: \n\u2013              \nthe macroeconomic indicators (production,\nproduction capacity, capacity utilisation, sales volume, market share, growth,\nemployment, productivity, magnitude of dumping margins and recovery from the\neffects of past dumping) were assessed at the level of the whole Union\nproduction for all Union producers, on the basis of the information collected\nfrom the Union industry, the review request as well as publicly-available\nstatistics; \n\u2013              \nthe microeconomic indicators (stocks, average\nunit prices, wages, profitability, return on investments, cash flow, ability to\nraise capital and investments) were assessed at the level of the sampled Union\nproducers on the basis of the information they submitted. \n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 One sampled Union producer\ndivested one of its production facilities in June 2010. The latter was acquired\nby another Union producer. Since the analysis of macro-economic indicators is\nbased on data collected from all Union producers the divestment had no impact\non the scope or individual indicators of the injury analysis. \n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 As a\npreliminary point to the analysis it should be explained that certain global\neconomic events in late 2010 and early 2011 had an impact on the situation on\nthe Union market, in particular on the prices and sales volumes of the like product. In this period the cotton supply fell\nresulting in an increased demand for polyester fibre on the Asian market. PET\nand polyester fibre are largely dependent upstream on the same raw material,\ni.e. purified terephthalic acid (PTA). The increased demand for polyester fibre\nresulted in insufficient supply of PTA, pushing the prices of PET up. Since the\nproducers of PET in the Middle East also depend on PTA from Asia, this caused\nsudden fall in imports of PET in the Union. At the same time, the main PTA\nsuppliers in the Union declared a 'force majeure' resulting in\nadditional restrictions of the domestic PET production.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the parties\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties challenged the\nvalidity of the injury analysis on the grounds that it was based on deficient\ninformation, which in turn also affected the rights of defence of interested\nparties. In particular, the below-mentioned arguments were raised.\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nthe information collected from Union producers did not comply with the\ninstructions for completion of the questionnaire, which requested data from\ndifferent companies not to be aggregated. It was therefore claimed that the\ncollected information was inaccurate and incomplete given that the reported\nfigures were aggregated per sampled entity. It is to be noted that the information\nwas duly collected and verified on-spot. The information collected was found to\nprovide sufficiently accurate picture of the Union industry and therefore the\nabove-mentioned claim had to be rejected. Following disclosure the parties\nreiterated their claim. No new arguments or evidence were presented. Same\nparties reiterated their claim that the data provided by one sampled company\nwere incomplete as they did not relate to the entire group but selected entity\nwithin the group. This comment was addressed at the sampling stage as explained\nin recital (20) above.\n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 The same parties argued that\nthe Commission attempted to fix the claimed insufficiencies of the collected\ninformation by sending additional questionnaires. In this respect it should be\nclarified that the Commission indeed sent additional questionnaires, but\naddressed them only to the non-sampled Union producers in order to collect\ninformation on macro-economic indicators relevant to the injury assessment\ntherefore this was done to supplement the information provided by the sampled\nUnion producers. Following disclosure some parties reiterated the claim without\nbringing any new arguments or presenting new evidence. The claim of the parties\nwas therefore dismissed. \n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the same\nparties also claimed that the information provided by the sampled producers was\nalso contrary to obligations in Article 19 of the basic Regulation because\ninformation which was not confidential in nature had been provided as\nconfidential information and thus excluded from the open file. In this respect\nit is to be noted that the information was classified as limited in line with\nthe request of the submitting party. Upon the request of interested parties the\nconfidentiality status of the submitted information was reconsidered and where\nappropriate, the information was reclassified as open for inspection by\ninterested parties after consultation and approval of the companies concerned.\nAlso this claim was therefore dismissed.\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\nmethodology used to assess injury was in violation of Article 11(9) of the\nbasic Regulation because while the injury determination carried out in the\noriginal investigation concluded in 1999 was based on cumulative assessment of\nimports from six countries, the current assessment does not include imports\nfrom South Korea which was claimed to be the largest supplier to the Union and\nthe country with largest export capacity and lowest export prices as compared\nto other countries concerned by the present review.\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 In this context it is to be\nnoted that under the expiry review concluded in 2007 the non-dumped imports\nfrom South Korea were already decumulated given that it was found that not all\nconditions of Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation were met in respect of these\nimports. Moreover, it is noted that the current review does not cover the\nimports from Korea as the measures against South Korea has expired. Finally, it\nis considered that there is no change in methodology since the cumulative\nassessment is used under the current review for the imports from all the\ncountries that meet criteria for such assessment in accordance with Article\n3(4) of the basic Regulation. The argument of the parties has to be therefore\ndismissed. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macroeconomic indicators\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nline with the loss of market share by the Union industry (discussed in recital (164)\nbelow) the Union production decreased by 11% between 2008 and the RIP.

Overall, the market share of the Union industry\ndeclined by 3% during the period considered. \n Table 10 \n Union industry market share \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Union industry market share || 80% || 70% || 74% || 77% \n Index || 100 || 87 || 93 || 97 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request and Eurostat \n8.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growth\n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 The market stagnated over\nthe period considered. There was no growth for the Union industry to benefit\nfrom, on the contrary, despite the restructuring efforts, the Union industry\nlost further market share to the growing imports, in particular, from the\ncountries without any measures. The slight decline of the consumption in the\nRIP is to be seen against the background of temporary shortage of the raw\nmaterial (PTA) in the Union as well as in the global market.\n8.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employment and productivity\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 The employment level of the\nUnion industry showed a decrease of 41% between 2008 and the RIP. The decline\nwas constant over the period concerned, including in 2010 when the production\nincreased (see recital (161) above). In the light of the growing productivity,\nthis drop is a reflection of the restructuring efforts by a number of Union\nproducers.\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 Productivity\nof the Union industry\u2019s workforce, measured as output (tonnes) per person\nemployed per year, increased by 50 % in the period considered. This reflects\nthe fact that production decreased at a slower pace than the employment level\nand is an indication of increased efficiency by the Union industry. This is\nparticularly obvious in 2010 when production increased while the employment\nlevel decreased and the productivity was 37 % higher than in 2008.\n Table 11 \n Employment and productivity \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Number of employees || 2,060 || 1,629 || 1,449 || 1,218 \n Index || 100 || 79 || 70 || 59 \n Productivity(tonne/employee) || 1,130 || 1,294 || 1,545 || 1,698 \n Index || 100 || 115 || 137 || 150 \n Source: Questionnaire replies, review request ||   ||   \n8.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magnitude of the actual\ndumping margin \n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the impact on\nthe Union industry of the magnitude of the actual dumping margin of imports\nfrom the countries concerned, given the price sensitivity of the market for\nthis product, this impact cannot be considered to be negligible. It should be\nnoted that this indicator is more relevant in the context of the likelihood of\nrecurrence of injury analysis. Should measures lapse, it is likely that the\ndumped imports would come back at such volumes and prices that the impact of\nthe magnitude of the dumping margin would be significant.\n8.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery from the effects\nof past dumping\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 While the indicators\nexamined above show some improvement in some economic indicators of the Union\nindustry, further to the imposition of definitive antidumping measures in 2000,\nthey also provide evidence that the Union industry is still vulnerable.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microeconomic elements\n9.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stocks\n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of stocks was 24%\nhigher in the RIP in relation with their levels in 2008.

As mentioned above (recital (153) above), the record\ncotton prices caused a switch to polyester fibre that competes for the same raw\nmaterial as PET. The increased demand for the raw material, in particular, PTA,\npushed up the prices of PET in Asia and Middle East with a spill over effect on\nthe prices of PET in the Union. The price increase in the Union at that time\nwas further amplified by the short term scarcity of PTA in the Union due to the\ndeclared force majeure of one of the PTA producers in the Union. \n Table 13 \n Unit Sales Price in the Union \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Unit Sales Price in the EU (EUR/tonne) || 1,066 || 891 || 1,045 || 1,330 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 84 || 98 || 125 \n Source: Questionnaire replies ||   ||   ||   ||   \n9.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Factors affecting sales\nprices\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsales prices of PET normally follow the price trends of its main raw materials\n(mainly PTA and monoethylene glycol \u2014 MEG) as they constitute up to 90 % of the\ntotal cost of PET. PTA is an oil derivative, the price of which fluctuates on\nthe basis of prices of crude oil. This causes high volatility of the prices of\nPET.\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, PET competes\nfor the same raw material as polyester fibre, the production of which relies to\nthe same extent as PET on the availability of PTA. Since polyester fibre is an\nalternative to cotton for the textile industry, the price of PET is therefore\nalso sensitive to the developments on the cotton market.\n9.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wages\n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 The average wages decline by 7% over the period considered.

The profit on sales in the Union market increased from -7.9% in 2008 to\n5.3% in RIP while return on investment improved from -9.6% to 10.6%. 2008 was\naffected by the particularly poor performance of one Union producer.\nNevertheless, the improvement of the financial situation of the Union industry\nin 2009 and 2010, when prices were below their 2008 levels, evidences the loose\nrelationship between prices and profitability. On the contrary, the improvement\nof profitability appears closely correlated to the improvements in capacity\nutilisation and to the productivity gains observed above. \n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks to the global market\ndevelopments at the break of 2010/2011, coupled with the restructuring efforts\nand efficiency gains described above, the Union industry was able to improve\nits profitability in 2010 and to reach the level of 5.3% in the RIP. \n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat this development was unexpected and extraordinary, not to be considered\nrepresentative of the overall situation of the Union industry. \n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect it is to be noted that the Union industry was able to benefit from\nthe PET price increase at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012 as it had fixed\nthe PTA price before the described market events occurred. Based on the\nstatistical sources concerning the post-RIP development, submitted by the parties,\nthe profit margins of PET producers went substantially down in 2012. This\nconfirms that the profitability in 2011 (RIP) was indeed largely influenced by\nunexpected and temporary global economic events (recital (153) that are\nunlikely to recur and cannot be considered permanent and representative of the\nsituation of the Union industry.\n Table 15 \n Profitability and Return on Investments \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Profitability Union sales || -7.9% || 1.6% || 4.8% || 5.3% \n Index || 100 || 221 || 261 || 267 \n Return on investment || -9.6% || 2.3% || 8.9% || 10.6% \n Index || 100 || 224 || 292 || 310 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n9.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cash flow and ability to\nraise capital\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 The cash flows improved\nsignificantly over the period reflecting the recent improvement of the profitability of the Union Industry. \n Table 16 \n Cash flow \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Cash flow (EUR) || - 59,419,394 || 40,940,883 || 96,614,649 || 103,761,169 \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 269 || 363 || 375 \n In % of turnover || -5.9% || 4.5% || 8.3% || 7.5% \n Index (2008 = 100) || 100 || 176 || 242 || 229 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 There were no particular\nindications that the Union industry would have encountered difficulties in\nraising capital, mainly as the Union producers are incorporated in larger groups.\n9.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investments\n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of investments was\noverall reduced by 35% over the period considered. The initial investments made\nin 2008 were cut sharply in 2009 and have not fully recovered since. \n Table 17 \n Investments \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || RIP \n Investments (EUR '000) || 72,341,598 || 5,404,705 || 15,994,659 || 47,217,003 \n Index || 100 || 7 || 22 || 65 \n Source: Questionnaire replies \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the situation\nof the Union industry\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of the\nmacro-economic data showed that the Union industry decreased its production and\nsales volumes during the period considered. The Union industry's market share\nhas not fully recovered since the initial drop in 2009 and it showed an overall\ndecrease of 3 percentage points over the period considered (to 77% in RIP). The\ndecline in employment and capacity is a result of the on-going restructuring\nand is to be seen in the context of increasing capacity utilisation and\nproductivity.\n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time most of the\nrelevant micro-economic indicators showed signs of improvements. The\nprofitability, return on investment and cash flow rose significantly, in\nparticular in 2010 and in the RIP. The investments, on the other hand,\nplummeted in 2009 and have not recovered since.\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the economic situation of the\nindustry has improved. However, these improvements are\nrelatively recent and to some extent based on\nunforeseen and temporary market\ndevelopments at the break of 2010/2011 (see recital (153) above). This appears\nto be supported by the information available on the\ndevelopments of the margin of the Union industry in 2012 (see recital (179) to above)\nthat show a decline as compared to RIP.\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above\nanalysis, the situation of the Union industry has improved and no material\ninjury appears to be taking place. Nevertheless, despite apparent positive trends\nand the significant restructuring efforts, the Union industry is still fragile.\n\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure some parties contested the conclusion\nthat the Union industry was still fragile claiming that the Union industry was\nin a healthy state and has substantially transformed since 1999. It is noted\nthat as explained above (recital (185)), despite the overall improvement and\nconsolidation, not all economic indicators developed positively over the period\nconsidered. For example, production and sales volumes as well as market share decreased.\nMoreover, the improvements were relatively recent and with a fall of\nprofitability in 2012 appeared short-lived. On this basis it was considered\nthat while no material injury proved to exist in RIP, the Union industry was\nstill in a fragile state. The argument was therefore rejected.\n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties contested the use of data referring to period beyond RIP for the\nanalysis of the economic situation of the Union industry. In response to this\nclaim it is confirmed that the situation of the Union industry was assessed for\nthe period considered and on this basis no material injury was established.\nHowever, the development of profitability of the Union industry beyond RIP is\nin this case relevant mainly in the context of the extraordinary nature of the\nglobal market developments at the break of 2010/2011. It also illustrates the\nvolatility of the profit levels typical for this sector (see recital (260)\nbelow). The argument is therefore rejected.\nF. LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF\nINJURY \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of the projected\nvolume of imports and price effects in case of repeal of measures\n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has shown that the imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand\ncontinued to be dumped and there are no indications that the dumping would be\nreduced or discontinued in the future. \n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 A prospective analysis of\nthe likely export volumes from these three countries revealed that, given the\nexcess capacity available for exports (see recitals (55), (97) and (118)\nabove), the domestic prices as well as price levels on the third countries\nmarkets and in the Union together with the attractiveness of the Union market\nthe imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand are likely to increase to the\nlevels likely to cause injury above those reached in RIP if the measures were\nlifted. With the planned capacity expansions in these three countries, the\ncombined excess capacity available for exports is estimated to reach between\n2.3-2.8 million tonnes, i.e. over 83-87% of the Union consumption (in RIP) in\nthe near future. \n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the expected\nprice development of the imports from the three countries, the imports from these countries are expected to\nenter at dumped prices, should the measures against India, Taiwan and Thailand\nbe lifted. Also, as the exporters from these countries will have to compete\nagainst low priced imports from other third countries, it cannot be excluded\nthey would have to lower their prices further in order to increase their market\nshare on the Union market. \n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the Union\nindustry is likely to be exposed to substantial volumes of imports from India,\nTaiwan and Thailand at dumped prices below its average prices, undermining its\nrecently improved economic situation. As a result, the material injury is likely to recur should the\nmeasures against India, Taiwan and Thailand be lifted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and excess\ncapacity available for exports of countries concerned\n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above, the\nexporting producers in India, Taiwan and Thailand have the potential to\nincrease their export volumes to the Union market. All three countries had a\nsignificant growth in their production capacity over the period considered.\nAccording to market forecasts, it is expected that the gap between domestic\nconsumption and production capacity will grow to between 2.3 to 2.8 million\ntonnes in the near future. Such excess capacity available for exports in the\nnear future has to be considered as significant as it represents over 83-87% of\nthe Union consumption (in RIP). \n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, although the\nimports from the three countries to the Union were relatively low, a risk exists that significant export volumes could be\ndiverted to the Union market should the measures be lifted. \n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties claimed that the likelihood of recurrence of injury based on\nexcess capacity available for exports has to include the assessment of the\ngrowth in demand in the export markets of India and Taiwan. The same parties\nstated that Thailand was irrelevant because it is controlled by one group\npresent on the Union market. The claim regarding the assessment of excess\ncapacity available for exports is dismissed for the reasons explained in\nrecitals (58) to (59) and (101) to (102) above. The relevance of the statement\nmade regarding the situation on the Thai market was not substantiated. For this\nreason the claims were dismissed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loss of export markets \n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 The trade defence measures\nagainst imports of PET from India, Taiwan and Thailand are currently in place\nin Turkey. Furthermore, measures against the imports from India and Taiwan exist in South Africa and measures against\nThailand exist in Malaysia. \n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties contested the conclusions regarding the loss of export markets for\nIndia and Taiwan. It was claimed that both markets were marginal export market,\ntherefore no significant export volumes from these markets could be redirected\nto the Union if the measures were lifted. It is noted that mere existence of the\ntrade defence on some markets excludes any meaningful comparison of the\nrelative importance of the markets with and without measures for a given\ncountry. In addition, contrary to the claim, it was not considered that the\nexport volumes from these markets would be redirected to the Union market.\nInstead, The Commission\u2019s assessment is that the trade defence measures in\nplace in Turkey and South Africa against imports from India and Taiwan potentially\nreduce the markets that could be available for Indian and Taiwanese exports.\nMoreover, should the claim that Turkey and South Africa are unimportant export\nmarkets be true, the increasing excess capacity available for export in India\nand Taiwan implies a likelihood of increased exports to the Union even in the absence\nof the trade defence measures imposed by Turkey and South Africa. (see recital\n(59) above). This argument was therefore rejected. \n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of trade\ndefence measures in other third countries is also an indication that the\npricing behaviour of India, Taiwan and Thailand is likely to replicate on the Union market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the\nUnion market\n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union market is\nattractive in terms of its size and price, being the third largest market in\nthe world, with a structural\nneed for imports and higher prices as compared to other markets. In case of India, Taiwan and Thailand, the import\nprices to the Union tend to be higher than the prices to other third countries,\nwhich points to the attractiveness of the Union market for the exports from\nthese three countries. \n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nattractiveness of the Union market is also confirmed by the fact that the Union\nindustry lost market share to the rising imports from the countries without measures. This is in particular true\nin case of South Korea that significantly increased its exports to the Union\nmarket in 2012 after the measures against the country have expired.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of imports from other third countries with measures, on the\nsituation of the Union industry was considered low, due to the low import\nvolumes and substantial decrease of their market share in the RIP. \n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nvolume of imports from\nother third countries without any measures increased during the period considered, however, the respective average\nimport price remained close to the Union industry average price. Therefore, the\nimpact of the imports from these countries on the situation of the Union\nindustry is considered limited. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Captive market \n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some parties claimed that due\nto the vertical integration between PET producers and converters, a\nconsiderable part of PET was sold for captive use that did not compete with\nimports. It was also claimed that share of captive market was significant,\naffecting the results of the analysis.\n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the information\ncollected at the level of sampled Union producers the proportion of captive\nsales was found not to be significant (below 10%). It has to be underlined that\nthe parties in question expressed the presence of PET producers in the\npackaging business in terms of the installed production capacity of PET and not\nin terms of their market share in packaging. Therefore, the claim on\nsignificant proportion of captive use was found unsubstantiated. As regards the\nprice levels, the prices of related and unrelated sales were found to be within\nthe same range. \n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthese grounds it was concluded that the distinctive analysis of the impact of\ncaptive sales was not necessary and the claims of the parties were rejected. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the parties\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\ninjury due to imports from India did not exist during the RIP as evidenced by\nthe relative economic health and profits of the Union industry. It has to be\nnote that, indeed, no continuation of injury has been established in the\npresent case, and therefore the claim of the parties corresponds to the\ninvestigation findings. \n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties claimed that\nother factors, such as structural inefficiencies of the Union industry and lack of investment as well as seasonal and\nconjunctural factors (e.g. bad weather, economic crises) could have an impact\non the situation of the Union industry. Concerning the first point raised, it\nis to be noted that the restructuring of the Union industry is already taking place and the efficiency gains\nobtained suggest that the claim of the parties is unfounded. As to the\nconjunctural factors, although the economic crises did have an impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry in 2009, as mentioned above, the relevant\neffects do not appear to be currently present anymore; concerning the effect of\nbad weather, this could partly explain the shrinking consumption in the RIP,\nhowever, on the one hand, its alleged impact on the situation of the Union\nindustry has not been substantiated and, on the other hand, the slight drop in\n2011 appears to be rather linked to temporary scarcity of raw materials due to\nthe global market developments in 2011. Therefore, none of these claims is\njustified in view of the findings of the investigation.\n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nsome parties argued that the recurrence of injury in this case is unlikely if\nthe measures were to expire, given that thanks to its structure (concentration\nand vertical integration) the Union industry is shielded from the effects of\nthe imports. Moreover, it has been argued that a shift to imported PET is neither desired nor possible in the\nnear future, in particular as purchasing contracts and policies as well as\nhomologation process of large brand owners (downstream users) makes changes of\nPET suppliers cumbersome. It is to be noted that based on the findings of the\ninvestigation the Union industry continued to lose market share to the benefit\nof imports during the period considered; this shows, on the one hand, that the\nUnion industry is not shielded from the effects of the imports and, on the\nother hand, that the switch to imports is not hypothetical but is actually\nalready taking place. The arguments had to be therefore dismissed. \n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some parties reiterated the claim\nthat the Union industry was shielded from the potential competition of imports\ndue to its structure. Firstly, as regards the claim on dominant position of one\nof the producing groups in the Union market controlling five producers, it is\nnoted that the Union market is an open market with other eight producers\noperating outside this group and growing competition of imports from third countries\n\u2013 with and without any measures in place. Secondly,\nconcentration is typical for this type of business based on commodity product\nthat relies on economies of scale for its competitiveness. Thirdly, no price\nleader was found to exist on the Union market. Finally, parties reiterated that\nthe impact of the imports from the three countries concerned in the light of the\nvertical integration of some Union producers with the packaging industry or\nwith producers of PTA was not analysed. As established in recital (207) above these\naspects were indeed analysed and found unsubstantiated. Moreover, the\nverification of companies concerned by vertical integration with producers of\nraw materials confirmed there was no comparative advantage as the transfers were\nmade at market price. Based on the above, the claim that the Union industry\nwould be shielded from the competition was rejected. \n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 Next, some parties argued\nthat no elements support a conclusion that the Indian, Taiwanese and Thai\nexport capacity may target the Union market at \u2018cheap prices\u2019 given that (i)\nthe domestic demand in India, Taiwan and Thailand is growing and is expected to\ncontinue to grow; (ii) PET in excess of domestic consumption exists, yet\ncompetition in export markets has not resulted in exports at dump or otherwise\nabnormally low prices; (iii) increases in production capacity in Asia responds\nto the increase in demand expected worldwide. It is to be noted that the\nfindings in the present investigation demonstrate that the projected growth of\ncapacity shows a growing excess of the production capacity over domestic\ndemand. In addition, the prices of India, Taiwan and Thailand on third markets\nwere lower as compared to their import imports prices to the Union. Based on\nthe findings described in recitals (60), (104) and (120), above it is likely\nthat the dumped imports from the countries concerned will target the Union\nmarket at volumes likely to cause injury and below the average price of the\nUnion industry should the anti-dumping measures be allowed to lapse. On these\ngrounds the arguments of the parties are dismissed.\n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, some Taiwanese\nproducers argued that for the reasons spelt out in recitals (101) to (103) above,\nthere was no likelihood of recurrence of injury due to the imports of PET\noriginating in Taiwan. As noted in the respective recitals, for reasons of\nnon-cooperation, none of the\nclaims made in this respect could be verified. Moreover, the findings described\nin recitals (86) to (98) above point to the contrary. On these grounds the\nallegations made by the parties in question have to be rejected. \n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one\nparty claimed that the Commission failed to include the imports from South\nKorea in the injury assessment. Contrary to this claim, the imports from South\nKorea were included in the injury analyses (see recital (202) above) and were\nanalysed together with the imports from other third countries without any measures\n(see recital (148) above). Contrary to the claim, South Korea was not the main\nexporting country to the Union (RIP). In addition, it is noted that although\nSouth Korea represented substantial part of imports, its import volumes\ndeclined significantly over the period considered. The claim of the party was\ntherefore rejected. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\nrecurrence of injury\n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the foregoing it is concluded that in respect of India, Taiwan and\nThailand substantial volumes of dumped imports likely to cause injury from would\nbe redirected to the Union should anti-dumping measures be repealed. Thanks to continued dumping, the prices of\nthese imports would most likely undercut the Union industry prices. Also, it\ncannot be excluded that the prices of imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand would\ndecrease even further should the exporting producers from the countries\nconcerned try to increase their market shares. Such price behaviour, coupled\nwith the ability of the exporting producers in India, Taiwan and Thailand to sell significant\nquantities of PET on the Union market, would in all likelihood have the effect\nof reinforcing the price pressure, with an expected negative impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry.\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 During the period considered\nthe situation of the Union industry improved, in particular in terms of\nproductivity and capacity utilisation and profit margins reached in the RIP at\nthe level close to the target profit established in the original investigation.\nIt can therefore be concluded that the Union industry, albeit still in a\nfragile situation, did not suffer material injury during the RIP. However,\ngiven the likely substantial increase of dumped imports from India, Taiwan and\nThailand which are likely to undercut the Union industry\u2019s sales prices, it was\nconcluded that the situation would very likely deteriorate and the material\ninjury would recur, should measures be allowed to lapse.\n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 As far as imports from\nMalaysia and Indonesia are concerned, given, in particular, the lack of\nsignificant excess capacities in the near future, no likelihood of continuation of dumping was established.\nTherefore, it is concluded that lifting the measures against Malaysia and\nIndonesia would in all likelihood not result in the recurrence of injury to the\nUnion industry.\n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure one\nparty invoked that the extension of the duties against Thailand was\ndiscriminatory in comparison with Malaysia and Indonesia given that all three\ncountries were in a similar situation. This argument was rejected considering\nthat while excessive capacity was found in case of Thailand and thus likelihood\nof recurrence of dumping was found, no such findings were established in case\nof Malaysia and Indonesia. \nG. UNION INTEREST\n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the maintenance of the\nexisting anti-dumping measures would be clearly against the interest of the\nUnion as a whole. The determination of the Union interest was based on an\nappreciation of all the various interests involved. All interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known pursuant to Article 21(2) of\nthe basic Regulation. \n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be recalled that\nthe adoption of measures was considered not to be clearly against the interest\nof the Union neither in the original investigation nor in the last expiry\nreview. Furthermore, the analysis in the last expiry review was carried out in\nthe situation where the measures had been already in place and thus the\nassessment took into account any undue negative impact on the parties concerned\nby the measures in question. \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\nexamined whether despite the conclusions on the continuation of dumping and\nlikelihood of recurrence of injury, any compelling reasons existed which would\nlead to the conclusion that it is clearly not in the Union interest to maintain\nmeasures in this particular case.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 The continuation of the anti-dumping\nmeasures on imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand would help the Union\nindustry to continue the on-going restructuring and enhance its only recently\nimproved economic situation, as it would help avoiding that the Union industry\nis exposed to the substantial volumes of dumped imports from India, Taiwan and\nThailand which the Union industry could not withstand. The Union industry would\ntherefore continue to benefit from the maintenance of the current anti-dumping\nmeasures. \n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is concluded\nthat the maintenance of anti-dumping measures against India, Taiwan and\nThailand would be in the interest of the Union industry. \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters in the Union\n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the unrelated\nimporters cooperated in the present review. \n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the measures in\nforce the imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand continued and nearly doubled\nover the period considered. The imports from other third countries without any\nmeasures were also available and reached significant market share during the\nRIP (see recital (147) above). Therefore, even with the measures in place,\nimporters had access to alternative sources of supply. \n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind that there\nis no evidence suggesting that the measures in force considerably affected importers,\nit is concluded that the continuation of measures will not be against the\ninterest of the Union importers. \n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the suppliers\nof the raw materials in the Union\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 The raw material for the\nmanufacturing of the product concerned is PTA/MEG. Two out of five known\nsuppliers of raw material (one supplier of PTA and one of MEG) cooperated with\nthe investigation by submitting the questionnaire reply. Both suppliers of the\nraw material expressed their support for the continuation of the measures. \n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the cooperating PTA producer represented a substantial part of the PTA\npurchases of the sampled Union producers in the RIP. Given that PTA has no\nother use in the Union than the production of PET, it is reasonable to assume\nthat PTA producers are largely dependent on the PET industry. \n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 As to the cooperating MEG\nsupplier, MEG represented relatively small part of its total turnover in the\nRIP. With regard to MEG, PET is not its only or major possible application and\nMEG producers are less dependent on the situation of the PET industry.\nConsequently, it is considered that the continuation of measures against dumped\nimports of PET from India, Taiwan and Thailand would have a positive, although\nlikely limited, impact on the suppliers of MEG. \n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 It was alleged that the\nsuppliers of raw material do not depend on the Union producers of PET; in\nparticular, as it was argued that two out of four sampled Union producers were\nin fact importing the raw materials.\n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to this claim\nthe investigation has shown that the imported material was predominantly MEG\nthat can also be used for other than PET applications. No indications were\ngathered showing more than negligible imports of PTA to the Union. Therefore, this\nclaim does not affect the conclusions taken as regards the dependency of PTA\nproducers on PET production in the Union. \n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, it is\nconsidered that the continuation of measures against dumped imports of PET from\nIndia, Taiwan and Thailand would benefit the PTA producers and also, although\nto a lesser extent, the MEG suppliers. As a consequence the continuation of\nmeasures against imports from India, Taiwan and Thailand would not be against\nthe interest of the raw material suppliers.\n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome parties claimed that PTA was exported and therefore the PTA producers were\nclaimed not to be dependent on Union industry. No evidence supporting this\nclaim was presented. Therefore the argument of the parties was dismissed as\nunsubstantiated.\n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same parties\nclaimed that lifting the measures will not have any impact on the PTA producers\nas the cooperating users will allegedly not switch to imports and will continue\nto source PET from the Union industry. Therefore, the level of PTA consumption\nin the Union will remain the same. Based on the findings of the investigation\nthe Union industry continued to lose market share to the benefit of imports\nduring the period considered. This shows that the switch to imports is not\nhypothetical (see recital (164) above). The argument of the parties was\ntherefore dismissed.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of PET recycling\nindustry\n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry argued\nthat the situation of the recycling industry depends on the sustainable price\nof virgin PET (non-recycled PET) on the Union market. Their claim was\nsubstantiated by a press release of an association of plastic recyclers in\nEurope, according to which a potential lifting of the measures on virgin PET\ncould further worsen the situation of the recycling industry.\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\ncontested that the situation of the recycling industry depends on the\nsustainable price of virgin PET on the Union market arguing that the prices of\nvirgin PET and recycled PET were unrelated. It was claimed that recycled PET is\nmainly used for the production of polyester fibre and therefore cannot be\nlinked to the price developments of virgin PET. In addition, it was noted that\nthe recycled PET is entirely supported by bottle-fillers and thus the industry does\nnot depend on PET producers. Finally, it was also noted that recycling industry\ndid not come forward as an interested party in the present investigation.\n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 Since the recycling industry\ndid not come forward in this investigation, none of the above-mentioned\nallegations could have been verified against the actual figures. Therefore, it\nis considered that in overall the measures in force would not be against the\ninterest of the recycling industry in the Union.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the users\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is\npredominantly used to produce bottles for water and other soft drinks. Its use\nfor the production of other packages (foodstuff, sheets, etc.) remains\nrelatively limited. Bottles of PET are produced in two stages: (i) first a\npre-form is made by mould injection of PET, and (ii) later the pre-form is\nheated and blown into a bottle. Bottle making can be an integrated process\n(i.e. the same company buys PET, produces a pre-form and blows it into the\nbottle) or limited to the second stage (blowing the pre-form into a bottle).\nPre-forms can be relatively easily transported as they are small and dense,\nwhile empty bottles are unstable and due to their size very expensive to\ntransport.\n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, two main\ngroups of downstream users have been established for studying of the impact of\nthe measures in force: (i) converters and/or bottle makers, converting PET\nchips into pre-forms (or bottles) and selling them for downstream processing;\nand (ii) bottlers, filling (and blowing) the bottles out of pre-form; this\ngroup represents mostly the producers of mineral water and soft drinks. The\nbottlers are often involved in the PET business either via integrated bottle\nmaking operations or via tolling agreements with subcontracted converters\nand/or bottle makers for whom they negotiate the PET price with the producer\n(soft tolling) or even buy the PET for their own bottles (hard tolling). \n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 Seventeen\n(five converters and twelve bottlers) cooperated in the investigation and provided\ninformation collected by the questionnaire. The cooperating converters\nrepresented 22.7% and bottlers 13% of the total consumption of PET in the\nUnion. The replies of bottlers came from various branches of the multinational\ncompanies (known as brand-owners). \n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 In total, all independent\nusers that came forward expressed their opposition against the measures.\nHowever, one user, vertically integrated with a PET producer, came forward\nexpressing its support for the continuation of the measures on the grounds that\nthe measures in force help to ensure stability of supply of PET on the Union\nmarket and to establish a fair competition. \n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been established that\nthe cooperating users sourced PET predominantly from the Union producers and\nonly a small proportion was sourced from imports. The imports from India,\nTaiwan and Thailand represented roughly half of these imports and thus a\nminimal proportion of the sourced PET. Nevertheless, the imports from other\nthird countries without any measures were also available and reached\nsignificant market share during the RIP (recital (147). Therefore, even with\nthe measures in place, the users had access to alternative sources of supply. \n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arguments of the users'\nindustry\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 Users claimed to be\nsignificantly affected by substantial increases in the price of PET in recent\nyears which cannot be transferred to retailers and consumers in the current\neconomic environment. It is claimed that these price increases have resulted\nfrom accumulation of many years of application of trade defence measures, which\nhave protected the Union producers from the competition of imports at the time\nwhen the Union PET industry became more concentrated and integrated. As a\nresult, the users claimed that the measures in place, through their alleged\nimpact on the price of PET, are responsible for the deterioration of the\ndownstream industry's employment, R&D and competitiveness on export\nmarkets, with a more acute impact on SMEs. It was also claimed that the job\nlosses due to the measures in force exceeded the number of people currently\nemployed by the Union PET industry.\n14.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price sensitivity and cost\nstructure of the users\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the PET price sensitivity of converters, PET was found to represent\naround 80% of the total costs. PET is therefore considered a critical cost\ncomponent for this type of activity. In addition, the converters' industry was\nfound to be rather fragmented with a relatively weak negotiating position\nagainst large bottlers and inherent structural problems typical for the commodity\nbased industry. As a result, this sector showed an increasing tendency to\nvertical integration with bottlers and the use of tolling agreements on the\nbasis of which the conversion fees are guaranteed and the PET price is\nultimately negotiated and paid by the bottlers. It is estimated that\nsubstantial part of PET purchases on the Union market is controlled directly by\nthe large bottlers. Since the contracts for pre-forms often include a mechanism\nfor reflecting the variation of PET prices, the convertors are increasingly\nneutral towards the developments of PET prices. \n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users contested the conclusion on the increased use of tolling and price\nformulas. The information in the file confirmed existence of such trend. The claim\nwas therefore dismissed.\n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that the\nmeasures in place would not cause damage to the converters, if similar measures\nwere applied on imports of preforms into the Union. It was argued that in the\nareas close to the Union border with third countries, in which there are no\nmeasures against imports of PET from India, Taiwan and Thailand there are\nincentives to delocalise the production of preforms and import them free of\nanti-dumping measures on PET into the Union. It is acknowledged that to some\nextent there is an economic rationale for this process to be happening.\nHowever, given the transportation cost, the delocalisation is likely to occur\nonly within limited distances. In overall, the claimed negative impact of the\nmeasures in question on some converters is therefore considered to be marginal.\n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the PET price\nimpact on bottlers, based on the reported figures, the PET is estimated to\nrepresent on a weighted average basis 9% of total costs of bottled soft drinks\nand 12% of the total costs of bottled mineral water. This shows that PET is not\nthe main cost component for the bottling industry. \n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the\ninvestigation has established that PET was the preferred although not the\nexclusive packaging material of bottlers. PET products represented 75% of the\nturnover of water bottlers and 50% of the turnover of producers of soft drinks.\nFurthermore, the investigation showed that contracts between many large\nbottlers (brand owners) and PET producers were based on a formula whereby the\nprice was adjusted to reflect fluctuation of prices of raw materials for PET.\nThis confirms the existing negotiating power of the large and thus the most\nrepresentative bottlers over the conversion margin of the PET producers. \n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users reiterated their argument that PET is a basic cost component for\nconverters, soft drink and bottled water industries and the findings in this\nrespect were inaccurate and not based on the reported data. It is noted that\nthe situation of converters was analysed separately and this comment is in\ntheir case unfounded (see recital (244) above). As regards the assessment of\nthe situation of the bottlers it is confirmed that the cost ratios established in\nthe investigation are based on the figures reported by the cooperating bottlers\nfollowing a methodology available to all parties. The established cost ratios were\nin line with the findings of previous investigations concerning the same\nproduct concerned[19]. The claims of the parties were therefore considered\nunsubstantiated.\n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users claimed that the essence of the company specific data and\ninformation provided by them was not reflected in the analysis of the Union\ninterest. It is confirmed that the data was used as reported by the users in\ntheir questionnaire replies. The calculation methodology was made available to\nall parties concerned. On this ground the claim was rejected.\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has also\nestablished that based on the expected and/or desired decrease of PET prices\nestimated by the verified bottlers themselves, lifting the measures would\nresult in negligible cost reduction for the bottlers. Based on these estimates\nof PET price decrease and the established cost ratios, the respective cost\nreduction was calculated to be within the range of 0.3-0.7% of the total costs\nof the bottlers for their PET-related activities. \n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users disputed this conclusion arguing that any saving in costs would be\nsignificant. Some users put forward new estimates in their submissions without providing\nany new evidence. It is emphasised that the prospective savings are\nhypothetical, as was also admitted by some users themselves. As regards the\nconverters, no quantification of prospective saving was put forward for this\nsegment. As regards the bottlers, it was considered that should the alleged PET\nprice decrease materialise, in the light of the costs structure of the\nbottlers, saving within 0.3%-0.7% of total costs cannot be considered\n'significant'. Since no new evidence was provided, the claim was dismissed as\nunsubstantiated. \n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that some\nbottled-water producers have inherent vulnerabilities stemming from legal\nrequirements imposed for the source water to be bottled at the source and\nlimited extraction volumes. The sector is being dominated by SMEs, which has an\nimpact on the cost structure of the companies in questions. Also, variations\nhave been observed in the price levels of final products across Member States\ndepending on the purchasing power of the local population. On these grounds it\nis considered that the impact of an eventual decrease of PET prices, if the\nmeasures were lifted, would be more pronounced for this part of the bottling\nindustry.\n14.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alleged premium prices and\nprofits of Union industry\n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties alleged the\nexistence of premium prices and premium margins practised by PET producers in\nthe Union, claiming that these would be at the origin of the price increases in\n2011. This claim was also supported by the comparison made between PET prices\nand spread over the raw material in the Union to the situation on Asian market\nand in the USA. It was claimed that this situation results from the\naccumulation of trade remedies. \n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis to be noted that the increase of the prices of PET in 2011, as well as its\ndecline in 2009, was a worldwide phenomenon driven by the evolution of the cost\nof raw materials (see recital (153) above). Data submitted by the parties\nsystematically showed a very close correlation between the evolution of PET\nprices in Europe, Asia and the USA. Nevertheless, there are indeed differences\nin the prices of PET across the world which are related to various reasons, in\nparticular the specific cost structure in each region. As regards the argument\non existing premium margin in the Union, it is noted that even under\nexceptional circumstances in late 2010 and beginning of 2011 the Union industry\nhas merely reached the profitability considered reasonable for this type of\nindustry. No evidence of premium profit was found. Therefore, the argument on\nexisting 'premium' prices and 'premium' margins on the PET in the Union that\nare due to the existence of the measures in question has to be rejected. \n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some\nparties reiterated their argument that the prices in the Union were unjustifiably\nhigh reflecting the impact of accumulation of anti-dumping measures operating\nin a market with concentration among Union producers, vertical integration and limited\nproduction unable to satisfy the consumption. It was also claimed that the\nprice data also showed that the higher prices in the Union are not reflecting\nthe higher costs of raw materials. It is noted that the arguments on\nconcentration, vertical integration and production capacity of Union industry\nwere addressed in recitals (204) and (265) respectively. As regards the claimed\nimpact of these factors on the PET price in the Union it is recalled that the\nPET price development is driven by the price of raw materials that account for\nup to 90% of cost of PET (see recital (173 above). Also, the increase in PET\nprices in 2010/2011 was a worldwide phenomenon (see recital (153) above). The\nclaims of the parties were therefore found unsubstantiated.\n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the argument concerning\nthe gap between the Union PET price and prices in Asia and US, and in addition\nto findings already stated in recital (255) above, it was found that the\ndifference in prices between US and Union market was volatile, yet moderate. Union\nprices were not systematically higher as claimed. Union and Asian market were\nfound to be very different in terms of cost structures linked in particular to\nthe size of the market and economies of scale, access to the raw materials and\ncapacity. Therefore, comparing the average prices between these two markets was\nnot meaningful. The argument of the parties was therefore found\nunsubstantiated.\n(258)\u00a0\u00a0 Also, some parties claimed\nthat the prices in the Union reflect a higher spread over the cost of raw\nmaterials as compared to US or Asia. The comparison of spreads follows the same\nlogic as comparison on prices on various regional markets with the difference\nthat the variations of prices of raw materials between various regional markets\nare accounted for. Nevertheless, the existing structural differences between\nthe markets can justify the difference in conversion fees. The extraordinary\nprofits made by Union industry at the break of 2010/2011 were explained in\nrecital (179) above. In none of the situations the measures were found to play\na role. Therefore the argument of the parties was rejected.\n(259)\u00a0\u00a0 The same parties also\nclaimed that the largest producer in the Union charged higher prices in the\nUnion than on other markets and recorder higher revenues in 2010 in the Union\nthan elsewhere. In this context, it is considered that it is economically\njustifiable that a transnational company would have different cost structures\nand thus different prices on different regional markets. The exceptional\nprofitability levels at the break of 2010/2011 were explained in recital (179)\nabove. On these grounds the argument was rejected.\n14.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of users\nand claimed impact of the measures\n(260)\u00a0\u00a0 Further claims were made as\nregards the worsening economic situation of the user's industry, such as\nclosing facilities and reducing employment. It was alleged that this was the\nresult of the PET price increase. In addition, it was claimed that the\ncompetitiveness of European leading brands has been eroded as their exports in third\ncountries were in direct competition with bottled-products that benefit from\nPET at international prices. \n(261)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted, that\nbased on the information submitted by the cooperating users, the users segment\nwas not found to be loss-making even though there was a decline in the overall\nprofitability level in RIP. The profit margin of the users' industry\nestablished on the basis of the questionnaire replies according to the\nmethodology made available to all parties was found to be at similar level as\nthe profitability established for the Union industry in RIP. The two verified\ncompanies (bottlers) reported further expansions in production volumes and\nincreased profitability over the period considered. Some converters were found\noperating on tight margins, in some cases facing structural and financial\ndifficulties. However, no direct link with the measures in place could have\nbeen established in this respect. Similarly, certain decline in the economic\nsituation of the bottlers was linked to the squeeze caused in 2011 by the\nsudden increase of PET price that could have not been passed on to retailers\nunder the current economic downturn. However, while it has been established\nthat the situation of the users industry deteriorated to certain extent in\n2011, the link between the decline and the existence of the measures was not demonstrated,\nespecially given that the measures were in places since 2000. \n(262)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some\nparties disagreed with the conclusion that the users' industry was not loss\nmaking. The parties also claimed that the profit margins of users were lower\nthan those of the Union industry. As regards the assessment of profitability of\nthe users' industry, the information collected from the cooperating users\ncontradicted this claim. Although some cooperating users could have been loss\nmaking, the user's industry was overall found to be profitable. In any event, if\nthe increase of PET prices was found to be one element affecting the\nprofitability of the users, no link between the measures and the profitability\nof the companies in question was demonstrated. As regards the comparison of\nprofit margins of users and the Union industry, this claim was not\nsubstantiated. Due to the volatility of the profitability of the Union industry\n(see recitals (176) to (179) above) the comparison between the two segments was\nnot considered conclusive. In any event, the both segments showed similar\nprofitability levels during the RIP (see recital (259). In this light, the\ncomments of the parties were rejected as unsubstantiated. \n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged\nerosion of the competitiveness of the exports of the Union producers of bottled\nmineral water/soft drinks, this claim was neither substantiated, nor has a link\nto the existence of the measures in place been in this context demonstrated. \n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure the parties reiterated that the rising\nPET prices have a negative impact on the competitiveness of exports of bottled\nwater. It is recognised that the PET price increase,\namong other things, can have a negative impact on the competitiveness of\nexports of bottled water. Nevertheless, since no link between the PET price\nincrease and the measures in question was found as the PET prices primarily\nderive from the prices of raw materials, the claimed impact of the measures on\nthe eroded competitiveness was rejected. \n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nas to the claimed effect of the measures on the employment, the investigation\nrevealed that the verified job losses of the users industry were predominantly\nlinked to the productivity and efficiency gains and a part concerned the\nreduction of the temporary staff. \n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure some\nparties disputed this finding on the grounds that it did not reflect the\nsituation of the entire sector. In addition to the findings described in\nrecital (265) above, it is noted that total jobs reported by the converters\nsignificantly increased and none of them reported job losses. Bottlers claimed\njob losses as a result of increased PET price. However, the increase in PET\nprice being a worldwide phenomenon, no link between job losses and the measures\nwas established. Furthermore, 90% of the job losses reported by the users\u2019\nquestionnaires replies were concentrated on three companies. One of them, a\nverified user representing substantial part of the reported job losses,\nincreased substantially its volumes over the period considered and such losses\nare therefore associated to productivity gains. As for the remaining two\ncompanies, they were found to have the profitability margins among the highest of\nthe cooperating parties in their segment and above the target profit of the Union\nindustry in this case. The claims were therefore dismissed.\n14.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe disclosure some parties argued that the Union producers do not have\nsufficient capacities to meet the existing demand. It is noted that the Union\nindustry operated at 86% of its production capacity in RIP and has sufficient\nspare capacity to cover total domestic consumption of PET. In addition, imports\nfrom other countries with and without measures continue to exist and have an\nincreasing tendency. Also, the current measures expired in case of South Korea\nand are lifted for imports of the product concerned from Malaysia and Indonesia.\nIn addition, PET recycling industry may constitute further source of PET to\ncover the PET demand in the Union. For these reasons, the alleged problems\nfaced by users due to the claimed insufficient production in the Union were not\nconsidered substantiated. \n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\nsome users claimed the analysis did not address the claimed adverse impact of\nthe accumulation of anti-dumping measures on the product concerned under the\npresent review. In response to this argument it is noted that the anti-dumping measures\nmerely remedy the injurious effect of established dumping. The existence of the\nclaimed 'accumulated' effect was not demonstrated. On the contrary, despite the\nmeasures in place, the imports from countries with ant-dumping measures\ncontinue and their volumes even increased during the period considered. Also, imports\nfrom countries without any measures are available with a growing trend and at\nsubstantial volumes. Finally, the termination of the measures against Malaysia\nand Indonesia, as well as expiry of the measures against South Korea,\ncontribute to the openness of the Union Market. The argument of the parties was\ntherefore dismissed. \n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the Union\ninterest\n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 To conclude, it is expected\nthat the extension of the anti-dumping measures on imports from India, Taiwan\nand Thailand would provide an opportunity for the Union industry to improve and\nto stabilise its economic situation following the the investments and consolidation\nmade in the recent years. \n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also considered that\nan improved economic situation of the Union industry may be in the interest of\nPTA producers and, to a lesser extent, MEG producers in the Union. \n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 The economic situation of some\nusers has worsened since the last review and in particular smaller bottle-water\nproducers were found, among other reasons, to be negatively affected especially\nit seems by the recent PET price increase since they were unable to pass it on\nto retailers under the current economic climate. However, the exceptional price\nand margin developments of 2011 of Union industry were found to be a global phenomenon primarily driven by the increase in the prices\nof raw materials. Therefore, the allegations on\nexisting 'premium' prices and 'premium' margins linked to existence of the measures\nin question were found unjustified. At the same time, Union market continues to\nbe an open market with existing alternative sources of supply from other third\ncountries without any measures. \n(272)\u00a0\u00a0 Against this background, no\nlink between the PET price increase and the existing measures was demonstrated.\nEconomic situation of converters was found to be stable despite the measures in\nforce. The weight of PET in the total cost of the bottlers was found to be\nlimited. Furthermore, no link between the PET price variations and the measures\nwas demonstrated. On these grounds, the measures were found not have\ndisproportionate effect on the users.\n(273)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account all of\nthe factors outlined above, it cannot be clearly concluded that it is not in\nthe Union interest to maintain the current anti-dumping measures.\nH. RELATION BETWEEN ANTI-DUMPING\nAND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES\n(274)\u00a0\u00a0 For one exporting country,\nnamely India, a parallel investigation on the expiry of countervailing measures\nhas been carried out (see recital (8) above). That investigation confirmed the\nnecessity to continue the application of such measures at unchanged levels. The\npresent investigation also concluded that anti-dumping measures on exports from\nIndia should be kept in force at unchanged levels. In that respect, reference\nis made to recital (125) of Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000. As the measures\ncurrently proposed for exports of PET from India remain unchanged, it follows\nthat Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation and Article 24(1) of the basic\nanti-subsidy Regulation are complied with.\nJ. ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(275)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to\nrecommend that the existing measures be maintained on imports of the product\nconcerned originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand and be terminated with\nregard to imports originating in Indonesia and Malaysia. They were also granted\na period to make representations subsequent to this disclosure.\n(276)\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\nthat, as provided for by Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of PET originating in India, Taiwan\nand Thailand should be maintained.
