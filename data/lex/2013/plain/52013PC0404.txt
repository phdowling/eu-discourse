The Commission can impose\nfines on undertakings that have infringed these provisions[3]. The powers of the NCAs are set\nout in Article 5 of Regulation No 1/2003. The application of the EU competition\nrules by the Commission and NCAs is commonly referred to as the public\nenforcement of EU competition law.\nIn addition to public enforcement, the\ndirect effect of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty means that these provisions\ncreate rights and obligations for individuals, which can be enforced by the\nnational courts of the Member States[4].\nThis is referred to as the private enforcement of the EU competition rules.\nDamages claims for breaches of Articles 101\nor 102 of the Treaty constitute an important area of private enforcement of EU\ncompetition law. It follows from the direct effect of the prohibitions laid\ndown in Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty that any individual can claim\ncompensation for the harm suffered, where there is a causal relationship\nbetween that harm and an infringement of the EU competition rules[5].\nInjured parties must be able to seek compensation not only for the actual loss\nsuffered (damnum emergens) but also for the gain of which they have been\ndeprived (loss of profit or lucrum cessans) plus interest[6]. Compensation for harm caused\nby infringements of EU competition rules cannot be achieved through public\nenforcement. Awarding compensation is outside the field of competence of the\nCommission and the NCAs and within the domain of national courts and of civil\nlaw and procedure.\nCompliance with the EU competition rules is\nthus ensured through the strong public enforcement of these rules by the\nCommission and the NCAs, in combination with private enforcement by national\ncourts.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for and objectives\nof the proposal\nThe present proposal seeks to ensure the\neffective enforcement of the EU competition rules by\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 optimising the interaction\nbetween the public and private enforcement of competition law; and\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring that victims of\ninfringements of the EU competition rules can obtain full compensation for the\nharm they suffered.\nOptimising the interaction between the\npublic and private enforcement of competition law\nThe overall enforcement of the EU\ncompetition rules is best guaranteed through complementary public and private\nenforcement. However, the existing legal framework does not properly regulate\nthe interaction between the two strands of EU competition law enforcement.\nAn undertaking that considers cooperating\nwith a competition authority under its leniency programme (whereby the undertaking\nconfesses its participation in a cartel in return for immunity from or a\nreduction of the fine), cannot know at the time of its cooperation whether\nvictims of the competition law infringement will have access to the information\nit has voluntarily supplied to the competition authority. In particular, in its\n2011 Pfleiderer judgment, the European Court of Justice (hereinafter: \u2018the\nCourt\u2019)[7],\nheld that, in the absence of EU law, it is for the national court to decide on\nthe basis of national law and on a case-by-case basis whether to allow the\ndisclosure of documents, including leniency documents. When taking such a\ndecision, the national court should balance both the interest of protecting\neffective public enforcement of the EU competition rules and of ensuring that\nthe right to full compensation can be effectively exercised. This could lead to\ndiscrepancies between and even within Member States\nregarding the disclosure of evidence from the files of competition authorities.\nMoreover, the resulting uncertainty as to the\ndisclosability of leniency-related information is likely to influence an\nundertaking\u2019s choice whether or not to cooperate with the competition\nauthorities under their leniency programme. In the absence of legally binding\naction at the EU level, the effectiveness of the leniency programmes \u2014 which\nconstitute a very important instrument in the public enforcement of the EU\ncompetition rules \u2014 could thus be seriously undermined by the risk of\ndisclosure of certain documents in damages actions before national courts.\nThe need to regulate the interaction of\nprivate and public enforcement was confirmed in the stakeholders\u2019 responses to\nthe public consultation on the 2008 White Paper on damages actions for breach\nof the EU antitrust rules (\u2018White Paper\u2019)[8]\nand the 2011 consultation on a coherent European approach to collective redress[9].\nThe May 2012 resolution of the Heads of the European Competition Authorities\nalso stressed the importance of the protection of leniency material in the\ncontext of civil damages actions[10].\nThe European Parliament repeatedly emphasised that public enforcement in the\ncompetition field is essential, and called on the Commission to ensure that\nprivate enforcement does not compromise the effectiveness of either the\nleniency programmes or settlement procedures[11].\nThe first main objective of the present\nproposal is thus to optimise the interaction between public and private\nenforcement of the EU competition rules, ensuring that the Commission and the\nNCAs can maintain a policy of strong public enforcement, while victims of an\ninfringement of competition law can obtain compensation for the harm suffered.\nEnsuring the effective exercise of the\nvictims\u2019 right to full compensation\nThe second main objective is to ensure that\nvictims of infringements of EU competition rules can effectively obtain\ncompensation for the harm they have suffered.\nWhile the right to full compensation is\nguaranteed by the Treaty itself and is part of the acquis communautaire,\nthe practical exercise of this right is often rendered difficult or almost\nimpossible because of the applicable rules and procedures. Despite some recent\nsigns of improvement in a few Member States, to date most victims of\ninfringements of the EU competition rules in practice do not obtain\ncompensation for the harm suffered.\nAs long ago as 2005, the Commission\nidentified, in its Green Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC\nantitrust rules[12]\n(\u2018the Green Paper\u2019), the main obstacles to a more effective system of antitrust\ndamages actions. Today, those same obstacles continue to exist in a large\nmajority of the Member States. They relate to\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 obtaining the evidence needed to\nprove a case;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the lack of effective collective\nredress mechanisms, especially for consumers and SMEs;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the absence of clear rules on\nthe passing-on defence;\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the absence of a clear probative\nvalue of NCA decisions;\n(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the possibility to bring an\naction for damages after a competition authority has found an infringement; and\n(vi)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how to quantify antitrust harm.\nBesides these specific substantive\nobstacles to effective compensation, there is wide diversity as regards the\nnational legal rules governing antitrust damages actions and that the diversity\nhas actually grown over recent years. This diversity may cause legal\nuncertainty for all parties involved in actions for antitrust damages, which in\nturn leads to ineffective private enforcement of the competition rules,\nespecially in cross-border cases.\nTo remedy this situation, the second main\nobjective of the present proposal is to ensure that throughout Europe, victims of infringements of the EU competition rules have access to effective mechanisms\nfor obtaining full compensation for the harm they suffered. This will lead to a\nmore level playing field for undertakings in the internal market. In addition,\nif the likelihood increases that infringers of Articles 101 or 102 of the\nTreaty have to bear the costs of their infringement, this will not only shift\nthe costs away from the victims of the illegal behaviour, but will also be an incentive\nfor better compliance with the EU competition rules.\nTo achieve that objective, the Commission\nput forward concrete policy proposals in its 2008 White Paper. In the ensuing public\nconsultation, civil society and institutional stakeholders such as the European\nParliament[13]\nand the European Economic and Social Committee[14]\nlargely welcomed these policy measures and called for specific EU legislation\non antitrust damages actions[15].\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\narea of the proposal\n\u2013                        \nCouncil Regulation No 1/2003 on the\nimplementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles [101] and\n[102] of the Treaty\n\u00b7              \nPursuant to Article 2, the burden of proving an\ninfringement of Article 101(1) or of Article 102 of the Treaty shall rest on\nthe party alleging the infringement. Should the defending party claim the\nbenefit of Article 101(3) of the Treaty, it shall bear the burden of proving\nthat the conditions of that paragraph are fulfilled. These rules apply both to\npublic enforcement and to actions for compensation for the harm caused by an\ninfringement of Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty.\n\u00b7              \nArticle 15(1) provides that, in proceedings for\nthe application of Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty, national courts may ask\nthe Commission to transmit to them information in its possession. The\nCommission Notice on the cooperation between the Commission and the courts of\nthe EU Member States in the application of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty[16] elaborates on the\ninterpretation and practical application of this provision.\n\u00b7              \nArticle 16(1) provides that when national courts\nrule on agreements, decisions or practices under Article 101 or Article 102 of\nthe Treaty which are already the subject of a Commission decision, they cannot\ntake decisions running counter to the decision adopted by the Commission.\nNational courts must also avoid giving decisions which would conflict with a\ndecision contemplated by the Commission in proceedings it has initiated. To\nthat effect, the national court may assess whether it is necessary to stay the\nproceedings pending before it.\n\u2013                        \nCouncil Regulation No 44/2001 contains rules on\njurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and\ncommercial matters[17].\nUnder the conditions set out in that Regulation, courts of the Member States\nhave jurisdiction to hear antitrust damages actions, and judgments in such\nactions are recognised and enforced in other Member States.\n\u2013                        \nCouncil Regulation No 1206/2001 regulates the\ncooperation between the courts of different Member States in the taking of\nevidence in civil or commercial matters, thus including antitrust damages\nactions[18].\n\u2013                        \nArticle 6(3) of Regulation No 864/2007 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council contains rules on the law applicable in\nantitrust damages actions[19].\n\u2013                        \nRegulation 861/2007 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council[20]\nestablishes a European procedure for small claims, intended to simplify and\nspeed up litigation concerning small claims in cross-border cases, and to\nreduce costs.\n\u2013                        \nDirective 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council requires Member States to provide for a possibility to\nmediate in all civil and commercial matters, thus including antitrust damages\nactions[21].\n\u2013                        \nArticle 15(4) of Commission Regulation No 773/2004[22] determines that documents\nobtained through access to the file of the Commission shall only be used for\nthe purposes of judicial or administrative proceedings for the application of\nArticles 101 and 102 of the Treaty. The Commission Notice on access to the file[23] provides for more detailed\nrules as regards access to the Commission file and the use of those documents.\n\u2013                        \nThe Commission Notice on immunity from fines and\nreduction of fines in cartel cases (the \u2018Leniency Notice\u2019)[24] contains rules on the\nconditions under which undertakings can cooperate with the Commission in the\nframework of its leniency programme in order to obtain immunity from or a\nreduction of its fine in a cartel case. In paragraph 33 it determines that\naccess to corporate statements is only granted to the addressees of a statement\nof objections, provided that \u2014 together with the legal counsels obtaining access\non their behalf \u2014 they do not make any copy by mechanical or electronic means\nof any information in the corporate statement and that the information from the\ncorporate statement is solely used for the purposes mentioned in the Leniency\nNotice. Other parties such as complainants are not granted access to corporate\nstatements. This specific protection of a corporate statement is no longer\njustified when the applicant discloses its content to a third party.\nFurthermore, the Commission Notice on the conduct of\nsettlement procedures in view of the adoption of Decisions pursuant to Article\n7 and Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in cartel cases (the \u2018Settlement\nNotice\u2019)[25]\nsets out the framework for rewarding cooperation with the Commission in the\nconduct of proceedings commenced in view of the application of Article 101 of\nthe Treaty in cartel cases ('settlement procedure'). Its paragraph 39 contains\nrules on the disclosure of settlement submissions to national courts.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH\nTHE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nBoth the 2005 Green Paper and the 2008\nWhite Paper triggered a broad debate among stakeholders, and a large number of\ncomments were submitted[26].\nThe public consultations showed broad support for the Commission\u2019s general\napproach to enabling antitrust damages actions. Respondents welcomed the\nguiding principle of compensation and the consequential choice not to suggest\nmeasures such as US-style class actions, wide pre-trial discovery or multiple\ndamages, which would pursue primarily an objective of deterrence. There was broad\nacknowledgement of the obstacles that prevent effective redress for victims of\ninfringements of the competition rules. However, different opinions were voiced\nas to the substantive measures suggested with a view to remedying the problems.\nIn 2011, the Commission held a public\nconsultation on a coherent European approach to collective redress[27]. In the wake of stakeholders' responses\nand the position of the European Parliament[28],\nthe Commission opted for a horizontal approach on this matter rather than the\ninclusion of competition-specific provisions on collective redress in the\ncurrent proposal. Adopting a horizontal approach allows for common rules on\ncollective redress for all policy fields in which scattered harm frequently\noccurs and in which it is difficult for consumers and SMEs to obtain damages.\nAs the first step of an horizontal approach on collective redress, the\nCommission adopted the Communication 'Towards a European Framework for Collective\nRedress'[29]\nand a Commission Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and\ncompensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations\nof rights granted under Union Law.[30]\nThe Commission also held a public consultation\nin 2011 on a draft Guidance Paper on the quantification of antitrust harm[31]. This sets out insights into a\nrange of methods used to quantify harm in damages actions and explains the\nstrengths and weaknesses of these methods. Institutional and other stakeholders\ngenerally welcomed the idea of issuing non-binding guidance on quantifying harm\ncaused by antitrust infringements[32].\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Collection and use of\nexternal expertise\nThe Commission commissioned external\nstudies for the preparation of the 2005 Green Paper[33], for the 2008 White Paper[34] and for the 2011 draft\nGuidance Paper on the quantification of antitrust harm[35].\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe proposed Directive was preceded by an\nImpact Assessment, which built largely on the findings of the Impact Assessment\non the White Paper. In particular, measures that had been excluded in the White\nPaper because of their likely ineffectiveness or excessive costs were not\nreconsidered.\nThe impact assessment report[36] focused on four options for a\nfollow-up initiative aimed at optimising the interaction between public and\nprivate enforcement of the EU competition rules and ensuring a more effective\nlegal framework for damages actions for infringements of the EU competition\nrules across Europe. They ranged from no action at the EU level, through a soft-law\napproach, to two options for legally binding EU action.\nThe preferred option \u2014 which is the basis\nof this proposal for a Directive \u2014 is considered to be the most cost-efficient\nway of achieving the set objectives. It takes due account both of the main\ncomments received during the public consultations over the past eight years and\nof more recent legislative and judicial developments at EU and national level.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis of the\nproposal\nThe choice of a legal basis for a European\nmeasure must be based on objective factors which are amenable to judicial\nreview. Those include the aim and content of the measure. The current proposal\nis based on both Articles 103 and 114 of the Treaty, because it pursues two\nequally important goals which are inextricably linked, namely (a) to give\neffect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty and (b) to\nensure a more level playing field for undertakings operating in the internal\nmarket, and to make it easier for citizens and businesses to make use of the\nrights they derive from the internal market.\nRegarding the first objective, the Court\nhas clarified that the full effectiveness of the EU competition rules and, in\nparticular, the practical effect of the prohibitions they contain would be put\nat risk if it were not open to any person to claim damages for loss caused to\nhim/her by a contract or conduct liable to restrict or distort competition. It\nconsidered that damages actions strengthen the working of the EU competition\nrules and can thus make a significant contribution to maintaining effective\ncompetition in the EU[37].\nIn seeking to improve the conditions under which injured parties can claim\ndamages and to optimise the interaction between the public and private\nenforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the present proposal clearly gives\neffect to these provisions. This means that the proposed Directive must be\nbased on Article 103 of the Treaty.\nHowever, that legal basis in itself does\nnot suffice, because both the aim and the content of the proposed Directive\ntranscend this legal basis. Indeed, the aim of the proposed Directive is wider\nthan giving effect to Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. The current divergence of\nnational rules governing damages actions for infringements of the EU\ncompetition rules, including the interaction of such actions with the public\nenforcement of those rules, has created a markedly uneven playing field in the\ninternal market. These marked differences were already described in a 2004 comparative\nstudy[38]\nand in the 2008 White Paper and its accompanying Impact Assessment. Since then,\nthese differences have increased due to diverging legislative and judicial\ndevelopments in only a limited number of Member States.\nOne example of divergence is given by the\ndifferent national rules applying to access to evidence. With the exception of\na few Member States, the lack of adequate rules on the disclosure of documents\nin proceedings before a national court means that victims of a competition law\ninfringement, who are seeking compensation for the harm suffered, have no\neffective access to evidence. Other examples concern national rules on\npassing-on (where existing differences have major implications for the ability\nof direct/indirect purchasers to effectively claim damages and, in turn, for\nthe defendant\u2019s chances of avoiding compensation for harm caused), the\nprobative value of NCA decisions in subsequent damages actions, and national\nrules that are relevant to the quantification of antitrust harm (e.g. the\nexistence of a presumption of harm).\nBecause of this marked diversity of\nnational legislations, the rules applicable in some Member States are\nconsidered by claimants to be much more suitable for bringing an antitrust\ndamages action in those Member States rather than in others. These differences\nlead to inequalities and uncertainty concerning the conditions under which\ninjured parties, both citizens and businesses, can exercise the right to\ncompensation they derive from the Treaty, and affect the effectiveness of such\nright. Indeed, where the jurisdictional rules allow a claimant to bring its\naction in one of those \u2018favourable\u2019 Member States and where that claimant has\nthe necessary resources and incentives to do so, it is thus far more likely to\neffectively exercise its EU right to compensation than when it cannot do so. As\ninjured parties with smaller claims and/or fewer resources tend to choose the\nforum of their Member State of establishment to claim damages (one reason being\nthat consumers and smaller businesses in particular cannot afford to choose a\nmore favourable jurisdiction), the result of the discrepancies between national\nrules may be an uneven playing field as regards actions for damages and may\naffect competition on the markets in which these injured parties operate.\nSimilarly, these marked differences mean\nthat undertakings established and operating in different Member States are\nexposed to significantly different levels of risk of being held liable for\ninfringements of competition law. This uneven enforcement of the EU right of\ncompensation may result in a competitive advantage for undertakings that have breached\nArticles 101 or 102 of the Treaty, but which do not have their headquarters or\nare not active in one of the \u2018favourable\u2019 Member States. Conversely, uneven\nenforcement is a disincentive to the exercise of the rights of establishment\nand provision of goods or services in those Member States where the right to\ncompensation is more effectively enforced. The differences in the liability\nregimes may thus negatively affect competition and run a risk of appreciably distorting\nthe proper functioning of the internal market.\nTo ensure a more level playing field for\nundertakings operating in the internal market and to improve the conditions for\ninjured parties to exercise the rights they derive from the internal market, it\nis therefore appropriate to increase legal certainty and to reduce the\ndifferences between the Member States as to the national rules governing\nactions for antitrust damages.\nThe extent to which the approximation of\nnational rules is pursued is not limited to damages actions for breaches of the\nEU competition rules, but also of national competition rules when they are\napplied in parallel. In particular, when an infringement that has an effect on\ntrade between Member States also breaches national competition law, actions for\ndamages based on it must comply with the same standards established for\nbreaches of EU competition law. \nApproximating national substantive and\nprocedural rules with the aim of pursuing undistorted competition in the\ninternal market and enabling citizens and undertakings the full exercise of the\nrights and freedoms they derive therefrom is not merely ancillary to the\nobjective of ensuring effective enforcement of the EU competition rules. This\nconclusion results not only from the aims, but also from the specific provisions\nof the proposed Directive. The content of the proposed Directive cannot be\nfully covered by Article 103 of the Treaty because it also modifies the\napplicable national rules concerning the right to claim damages for\ninfringements of national competition law, even if that is only in respect to\nanticompetitive behaviour that has an effect on trade between Member States and\nto which EU competition law thus equally applies[39]. It follows that the scope of\nthe proposed Directive, arising not only from the aims but also from the\ncontents of the instrument, goes beyond giving effect to Articles 101 and 102\nof the Treaty and means that the proposed Directive also has to be based on\nArticle 114 TFEU.\nThese interdependent, though distinct, aims\nof the proposed Directive cannot be pursued separately, through the adoption of\ntwo different instruments. For instance, it is not feasible to split the\nproposed Directive into a first instrument, based on Article 103 TFEU, that\napproximates national rules in damages actions for breaches of Articles 101 and\n102 TFEU, and a second one, based on Article 114 TFEU, that requires Member\nStates to apply the same substantive and procedural rules to damages actions\nfor breaches of national competition law. This choice cannot be made for\nsubstantive and procedural reasons.\nFrom a substantive point of view, the indissociable\nlink between the two independent objectives underpins the concrete measures\nthat pursue them. For instance, the exceptions to disclosure and limitations of\nliability give full effect to Articles 101 and 102, even in claims based on\nbreaches of national competition law, when this has been applied in parallel to\nthe Treaty provisions. Moreover, because of the need for legal certainty and a\nlevel playing field in the internal market, the same rules must apply to\nbreaches of EU competition rules and of national competition law (where these\nare applied in parallel to the EU rules). From a procedural point of view, and\nto avoid impairing the institutional balance within the EU legislature, the\nonly way of achieving uniform rules for the two situations is to adopt a single\nlegal instrument in the same procedure.\nFor these reasons, the contents of the\ninitiative are not split among separate instruments but are addressed jointly in\nthe proposed Directive, which should thus be based on both Articles 103 and 114\nof the Treaty.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle (Article\n5(3) of the Treaty on European Union)\nThe proposed Directive is in line with the\nsubsidiarity principle since its objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by\nthe Member States, and there is a clear need for, and value in, EU action. A\nlegally binding act at EU level will be better capable of ensuring that full\neffect is given to Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty through common standards\nallowing for effective damages actions across the EU, and that a more level\nplaying field is established in the internal market.\nMore specifically, the proposed Directive\ncan be deemed to comply with the principle of subsidiarity for the following\nreasons:\n\u00b7                        \nThere is a significant risk that effective\npublic enforcement by the Commission and NCAs would be jeopardised in the\nabsence of EU-wide regulation of the interaction between public and private\nenforcement, and in particular of a common European rule on information from\nthe file of a competition authority being available for the purposes of a\ndamages action. The point can be illustrated most clearly with regard to\ninformation that undertakings have voluntarily given to competition authorities\nunder their leniency programme. The unpredictability that follows from the fact\nthat each national court has to decide on an ad hoc basis and according\nto the applicable national rules whether or not to grant access to this\nleniency-related information cannot be adequately addressed by \u2014 potentially\ndiverging \u2014 national legislation. Indeed, since the Commission and the NCAs can\nexchange information within the ECN, potential leniency applicants are likely\nto take into account the national legislation which offers the lowest level of\nprotection (for fear that their case may eventually be decided by that NCA).\nThe perceived level of protection of leniency-related information will thus be\ndetermined by whichever national legislation offers the lowest level of\nprotection, to the detriment of the applicable rules in other Member States. It\nis therefore necessary to establish a standard common to all Member States for the\ninteraction between public and private enforcement. This can only be done at\nthe EU level.\n\u00b7                        \nExperience shows that, in the absence of EU\nlegislation, most Member States do not provide, on their own initiative, for an\neffective framework for compensation for victims of infringements of Articles\n101 and 102 of the Treaty, as repeatedly required by the Court. Since the\npublication of the Commission\u2019s Green and White Papers, only a small number of\nMember States have enacted legislation aimed at enabling antitrust damages\nactions, and even this is usually limited to specific issues and does not cover\nthe whole range of measures envisaged by the current proposal. Despite the few\nsteps taken by some Member States, there is thus still a lack of effective\ncompensation for victims of infringements of the EU antitrust rules. Only\nfurther incentives at European level can create a legal framework that gives\neffective redress and guarantees the right of effective judicial protection as\nlaid down in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion.\n\u00b7                        \nThere is currently a marked inequality between\nMember States in the level of judicial protection of individual rights\nguaranteed by the Treaty; this may cause distortions of competition and of the\nproper functioning of the internal market. The result is an evident disparity\nin even the content of the entitlement to damages guaranteed by EU law. More\nspecifically, a claim under the law of one Member State may lead to full\nrecovery of the claimant\u2019s loss, while a claim for an identical infringement in\nanother Member State may lead to a significantly lower award or even no award\nat all. This inequality increases if \u2014 as is the case at present \u2014 only some\nMember States improve the conditions under which victims of a competition law\ninfringement can claim compensation for the harm suffered. The trans-national\ndimension of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty and their intrinsic link to the\nfunctioning of the internal market warrants measures at the EU level.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\n(Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union)\nIn terms of proportionality, the proposed\nDirective does not go beyond what is necessary to effectively achieve its\nobjectives, namely to guarantee effective protection of public enforcement of\ncompetition law across the EU, and to guarantee access for victims of\ncompetition law infringements to a truly effective mechanism for obtaining full\ncompensation for the harm they have suffered, while protecting the legitimate\ninterests of defendants and third parties.\nUnder the proposed Directive, those objectives\nare also achieved at the lowest possible cost. The potential costs for citizens\nand businesses are proportionate to the stated objectives. A first step in this\ndirection was taken with the White Paper by excluding more radical measures (e.g.\nmultiple damages, opt-out class actions and wide-ranging discovery rules). The\nefforts to strike this balance were broadly welcomed during the public\nconsultations. The safeguards built into the proposed Directive strengthen this\nbalance further by reducing potential costs (especially litigation costs)\nwithout jeopardising the right to compensation. Furthermore, certain measures\nsuggested in the White Paper, such as collective redress and rules on the fault\nrequirement, have since been discarded for the purposes of this proposal.\nFinally, the choice of a Directive as the appropriate instrument is in line\nwith the principle that there should be as little intervention as possible, so\nlong as the objectives are achieved.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Directive as the most\nappropriate legally binding instrument\nThe objectives of the present proposal can\nbest be pursued through a Directive. This is the most appropriate legal\ninstrument to make the measures work effectively and to facilitate smooth\nadaptation into the legal systems of the Member States:\n\u2013                        \nA Directive requires Member States to achieve\nthe objectives and implement the measures into their national substantive and\nprocedural law systems. This approach gives the Member States more freedom when\nimplementing an EU measure than does a Regulation, in that Member States are\nleft the choice of the most appropriate means of implementing the measures in\nthe Directive. This allows Member States to ensure that these new rules are\nconsistent with their existing substantive and procedural legal framework.\n\u2013                        \nFurthermore, a Directive is a flexible tool for\nintroducing common rules in areas of national law that are crucial for the\nfunctioning of the internal market and the effectiveness of damages actions, and\nfor ensuring adequate guarantees throughout the EU, while leaving room for\nindividual Member States to go further, should they so wish.\n\u2013                        \nFinally, a Directive avoids unnecessary action\nwherever the domestic provisions in the Member States are already in line with\nthe proposed measures.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scope\nand definitions (Chapter I: Articles 1 \u2013 4)\nThe proposed Directive seeks to improve the\nconditions under which compensation can be obtained for harm caused by (a) infringements\nof the EU competition rules, and (b) infringements of national competition law\nprovisions, where the latter are applied by a national competition authority or\na national court in the same case in parallel to the EU competition rules. Such\nparallel application has its basis in the way in which Regulation No 1/2003\nregulates the relationship between Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty and\nnational competition laws. Regulation No 1/2003 provides that where national\ncompetition authorities or national courts apply national competition law to\nagreements within the meaning of Article 101 which may affect trade between\nMember States, they must also apply Article 101. Similarly, where they apply\nnational competition law to any abuse prohibited by Article 102, they must also\napply Article 102[40].\nIn cases where compensation is sought for a violation of both EU and national\ncompetition law, it is appropriate for the same substantive and procedural\nrules to apply to those damages actions. Applying diverging rules on civil\nliability for a single specific instance of anticompetitive behaviour would not\nonly make it unworkable for judges to handle the case, it would also imply\nlegal uncertainty for all parties involved, and it could lead to conflicting\nresults depending on whether the national court considers the case as an\ninfringement of EU or of national competition law, thus hampering the effective\napplication of those rules. The proposed Directive therefore refers to damages\nactions for \u2018infringements of national or EU competition law\u2019 or jointly \u2018infringements\nof competition law\u2019, whereby \u2018national competition law\u2019 is defined narrowly so\nas to cover only cases where it is applied in parallel to EU competition law.\nThe proposed Directive sets out rules (i)\nensuring that any natural or legal persons harmed by infringements of the\ncompetition rules are granted equivalent protection throughout the Union and\ncan effectively enforce their EU right to full compensation through damages\nactions before national courts; and (ii) optimising the interaction between\nsuch damages actions and the public enforcement of the competition rules.\nArticle 2 recalls the acquis\ncommunautaire on the EU right to full compensation. The proposed Directive\nthus embraces a compensatory approach: its aim is to allow those who have\nsuffered harm caused by an infringement of the competition rules to obtain\ncompensation for that harm from the undertaking(s) that infringed the law.\nArticle 2 also recalls the acquis\ncommunautaire on standing and on the definition of damage to be compensated.\nThe notion of actual loss referred to in this provision is taken from the\ncase-law of the Court of Justice, and does not exclude any type of damage\n(material or immaterial) that might have been caused by an infringement of the\ncompetition rules.\nArticle 3 recalls the principles of\neffectiveness and equivalence which must be complied with by national rules and\nprocedures relating to actions for damages.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disclosure of evidence\n(Chapter II: Articles 5 \u2013 8)\nEstablishing an infringement of the\ncompetition rules, quantifying antitrust damages, and establishing causality\nbetween the infringement and the harm suffered typically require a complex\nfactual and economic analysis. Much of the relevant evidence a claimant will\nneed to prove his case is in the possession of the defendant or of third\npersons and is often not sufficiently known or accessible to the claimants (\u2018information\nasymmetry\u2019). It is widely recognised that the difficulty a claimant encounters\nin obtaining all necessary evidence constitutes in many Member States one of\nthe key obstacles to damages actions in competition cases. In so far as the\nburden of proof falls on the (allegedly) infringing undertaking[41], it too may need to have\naccess to evidence in the hands of the claimant and/or of a third party. The opportunity\nto ask the judge to order disclosure of information is therefore available to\nboth parties to the proceedings.\nThe disclosure regime in the proposed\nDirective builds on the approach adopted in Directive 2004/48/EC on the\nenforcement of intellectual property rights[42].\nIts aim is to ensure that in all Member States there is a minimum level of\neffective access to the evidence needed by claimants and/or defendants to prove\ntheir antitrust damages claim and/or a related defence. At the same time, the proposed\nDirective avoids overly broad and costly disclosure obligations that could\ncreate undue burdens for the parties involved and risks of abuses. The\nCommission has also paid particular attention to ensuring that the proposal is\ncompatible with the different legal orders of the Member States. To this end,\nthe proposal follows the tradition of the great majority of Member States and\nrelies on the central function of the court seized with an action for damages:\ndisclosure of evidence held by the opposing party or a third party can only be\nordered by judges and is subject to strict and active judicial control as to\nits necessity, scope and proportionality.\nNational courts\nshould have at their disposal effective measures to protect any business\nsecrets or otherwise confidential information disclosed during the proceedings.\nFurthermore, disclosure should not be allowed where it\nwould be contrary to certain rights and obligations such as the obligation of\nprofessional secrecy. Courts must also be able to impose sanctions which are sufficiently deterrent to prevent\ndestruction of relevant evidence or refusal to comply with a disclosure order.\nTo prevent that the disclosure of evidence\njeopardises the public enforcement of the competition rules by a competition\nauthority, the proposed Directive also establishes common EU-wide limits to\ndisclosure of evidence held in the file of a competition authority:\n(a)                   \nFirst, it provides for absolute protection for two\ntypes of documents which are considered to be crucial for the effectiveness of\npublic enforcement tools. The documents referred to are the leniency corporate\nstatements and settlement submissions. The disclosure of these documents risks\nseriously affecting the effectiveness of the leniency programme and of\nsettlements procedures. Under the proposed Directive, a national court can\nnever order disclosure of such documents in an action for damages.\n(b)                   \nSecond, it provides for temporary protection for\ndocuments that the parties have specifically prepared for the purpose of public\nenforcement proceedings (e.g. the party\u2019s replies to the authority\u2019s request\nfor information) or that the competition authority has drawn up in the course\nof its proceedings (e.g. a statement of objections). Those documents can be\ndisclosed for the purpose of an antitrust damages action only after the\ncompetition authority has closed its proceedings.\n(c)                   \nApart from limiting the national court\u2019s ability\nto order disclosure, the above protective measures should also come into play\nif and when the protected documents have been obtained in the context of public\nenforcement proceedings (e.g. in the exercise of one of the parties\u2019 right of\ndefence). Therefore, where one of the parties in the action for damages had\nobtained those documents from the file of a competition authority, such\ndocuments are not admissible as evidence in an action for damages (documents of\ncategory (a) above) or are admissible only when the authority has closed its\nproceedings (documents of category (b) above).\n(d)                   \nDocuments which fall outside the above\ncategories can be disclosed by court order at any moment in time. However, when\ndoing so, national courts should refrain from ordering the disclosure of evidence\nby reference to information supplied to a competition authority for the purpose\nof its proceedings[43]. While the investigation is on-going, such disclosure could hinder\npublic enforcement proceedings, since it would reveal what information is in\nthe file of a competition authority and could thus be used to unravel the\nauthority\u2019s investigation strategy. However, the selection of pre-existing\ndocuments that are submitted to a competition authority for the purposes of the\nproceedings is in itself relevant, as undertakings are invited to supply\ntargeted evidence in view of their cooperation. The willingness of undertakings\nto supply such evidence exhaustively or selectively when cooperating with\ncompetition authorities may be hindered by disclosure requests that identify a\ncategory of documents by reference to their presence in the file of a\ncompetition authority rather than their type, nature or object (e.g. requests\nfor all documents in the file of a competition authority or all documents\nsubmitted thereto by a party). Therefore, such global disclosure requests for\ndocuments should normally be deemed by the court as disproportionate and not\ncomplying with the requesting party's duty to specify categories of evidence as\nprecisely and narrowly as possible.\n(e)                   \nFinally, to prevent documents obtained through\naccess to a competition authority\u2019s file becoming an object of trade, only the person\nwho obtained access to the file (or his legal successor in the rights related\nto the claim) should be able to use those documents as evidence in an action\nfor damages.\nTo achieve coherence regarding the rules on\ndisclosure and the use of certain documents from the file of a competition\nauthority, it is necessary to also amend existing rules on the conduct of\nCommission's proceedings laid down in Commission Regulation 773/2004[44], notably as regards access to\nthe Commission's file and use of documents obtained therefrom, and the\nexplanatory Notices published by the Commission[45]. The Commission intends doing\nso once the present Directive is adopted by the European Parliament and\nCouncil.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of national\ndecisions, limitation periods and joint and several liability (Chapter III:\nArticles 9 \u2013 11)\n4.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Probative effect of\nnational decisions\nPursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation No 1/2003,\na Commission decision relating to proceedings under Article 101 or 102 of the\nTreaty has a probative effect in subsequent actions for damages, as a national\ncourt cannot take a decision running counter to such Commission decision[46]. It is appropriate to give\nfinal infringement decisions by national competition authorities (or by a\nnational review court) similar effect. If an infringement decision has already\nbeen taken and has become final, the possibility for the infringing undertaking\nto re-litigate the same issues in subsequent damages actions would be\ninefficient, cause legal uncertainty and lead to unnecessary costs for all\nparties involved and for the judiciary.\nThe proposed probative effect of final\ninfringement decisions of national competition authorities does not entail any\nlessening of judicial protection for the undertakings concerned, as\ninfringement decisions by national competition authorities are still subject to\njudicial review. Moreover, throughout the EU, undertakings enjoy a comparable\nlevel of protection of their rights of defence, as enshrined in Article 48(2)\nof the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. Finally, the rights and obligations of\nnational courts under Article 267 of the Treaty remain unaffected by this rule.\n4.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limitation periods\nTo give victims of a competition law\ninfringement a reasonable opportunity to bring a damages action, while ensuring\nan appropriate level of legal certainty for all parties involved, the\nCommission proposes that the national rules on limitation periods for a damages\naction:\n\u2013                        \nallow victims sufficient time (at least five\nyears) to bring an action after they became aware of the infringement, the harm\nit caused and the identity of the infringer;\n\u2013                        \nprevent a limitation period from starting to run\nbefore the day on which a continuous or repeated infringement ceases; and\n\u2013                        \nin case a competition authority opens\nproceedings into a suspected infringement, the limitation period to bring an\naction for damages relating to such infringement is suspended until at least one\nyear after a decision is final or proceedings are otherwise terminated.\n4.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joint and several liability\nWhere\nseveral undertakings infringe the competition rules jointly \u2014 typically in the\ncase of a cartel \u2014 it is appropriate that they be jointly and severally liable\nfor the entire harm caused by the infringement. While the proposed Directive\nbuilds on this general rule, it introduces certain modifications with regard to\nthe liability regime of immunity recipients. The objective of these modifications\nis to safeguard the attractiveness of the leniency programmes of the Commission\nand of the NCAs, which are key instruments in detecting cartels and thus of\ncrucial importance for the effective public enforcement of the competition\nrules.\nIndeed, as\nleniency recipients are less likely to appeal an infringement decision, this\ndecision often becomes final for them earlier than for other members of the\nsame cartel. This may make leniency recipients the primary targets of damages\nactions. To limit the disadvantageous consequences of such exposure, while not\nunduly limiting the possibilities for injured parties to obtain full\ncompensation for the loss suffered, it is proposed to limit the immunity\nrecipient\u2019s liability, as well as his contribution owed to co-infringers under\njoint and several liability, to the harm he caused to his own direct or indirect\npurchasers or, in the case of a buying cartel, his direct or indirect\nproviders. Where a cartel has caused harm only to others than the\ncustomers/providers of the infringing undertakings, the immunity recipient\nwould be responsible only for his share of the harm caused by the cartel. How\nthat share is determined (e.g. turnover, market share, role in the cartel, etc.),\nis left to the discretion of the Member States, as long as the principles of\neffectiveness and equivalence are respected.\nThe\nprotection of immunity recipients cannot, however, interfere with the victims\u2019\nEU right to full compensation. The proposed limitation on the immunity\nrecipient\u2019s liability cannot therefore be absolute: the immunity recipient\nremains fully liable as a last-resort debtor if the injured parties are unable\nto obtain full compensation from the other infringers. To guarantee the effet\nutile of this exception, Member States have to make sure that injured\nparties can still claim compensation from the immunity recipient at the time they\nhave become aware that they cannot obtain full compensation from the\nco-cartelists. \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passing-on\nof overcharges (Chapter IV: Articles 12 \u2013 15)\nPersons who have\nsuffered harm caused by an infringement of the competition rules are entitled\nto compensation, regardless of whether they are direct or indirect purchasers. Injured\nparties are entitled to compensation for actual loss (overcharge harm) and for\nloss of profit. When an injured party has reduced his actual loss by passing it\non, partly or entirely, to his own purchasers, the loss thus passed on no\nlonger constitutes harm for which the party that passed it on has to be\ncompensated. However, where a loss is passed on, the price increase by the\ndirect purchaser is likely to lead to a reduction in the volume sold. That loss\nof profit, as well as the actual loss that was not passed on (in the case of\npartial passing-on) remains antitrust harm for which the injured party can\nclaim compensation.\nIf the harm is\nsuffered as a result of an infringement relating to a supply to the infringing\nundertaking, passing-on could also take place in an upwards direction on the\nsupply chain. This would, for example, be the case when, as a result of a\nbuying cartel, the suppliers of the cartelists charge lower prices, and those\nsuppliers then in turn require lower prices from their own suppliers.\nTo ensure that only the direct and indirect\npurchasers that actually suffered overcharge harm can effectively claim\ncompensation, the proposed Directive explicitly recognises the possibility for\nthe infringing undertaking to invoke the passing-on defence.\nHowever, in\nsituations where the overcharge was passed on to natural or legal persons at\nthe next level of the supply chain for whom it is legally impossible to claim\ncompensation, the passing-on defence cannot be invoked. Indirect purchasers may\nbe faced with the legal impossibility of claiming compensation because of national\nrules on causality (including rules on foreseeability and remoteness). Allowing\nthe passing-on defence when it is legally impossible for the party to whom the\novercharge was allegedly passed on to claim compensation would be unjustified,\nsince it would mean that the infringing undertaking is unduly freed from\nliability for the harm he caused. The burden of proving the passing-on always\nlies with the infringing undertaking. In the case of an action for damages\nbrought by an indirect purchaser, this implies a rebuttable presumption\npursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, a passing-on to that indirect\npurchaser occurred. As regards the quantification of the\npassing-on, the national court should have the power to estimate which share of\nthe overcharge has been passed on to the level of indirect purchasers in the\ndispute pending before it. Where injured parties from different levels of the\nsupply chain bring separate actions for damages that are related to the same\ncompetition law infringement, national courts should take due account, as far\nas allowed under applicable national or EU law, of parallel or preceding\nactions (or judgments resulting from such actions) in order to avoid under- and\nover-compensation of the harm caused by that infringement and to foster\nconsistency between judgments resulting from such linked proceedings. Actions that\nare pending before the courts of different Member States may be considered as\nrelated within the meaning of Article 30 of Regulation No 1215/2012[47], meaning that they are so\nclosely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to\navoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\nAs a consequence, any court other than the court first seized may stay its\nproceedings or decline jurisdiction if the court first seized has jurisdiction\nover the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation of the\nactions.\nBoth Regulation\nNo 1215/2012 and this proposed Directive thus seek to encourage consistency\nbetween judgments resulting from related actions. To achieve that, the proposed\nDirective has an even wider scope than Regulation No 1215/2012, as it also\ncovers the situation of subsequent actions for damages relating to the same\ncompetition law infringement, brought by injured parties at different levels of\nthe supply chain. These actions can be brought in the same court, in different\ncourts in the same Member State or in different courts of different Member\nStates. In all instances, the proposed Directive encourages the consistency of\nlinked proceedings and judgments.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quantification of harm\n(Chapter V: Article 16)\nProving and\nquantifying antitrust harm is generally very fact-intensive and costly, as it\nmay require the application of complex economic models. To assist victims of a\ncartel in quantifying the harm caused by the competition law infringement, this\nproposed Directive provides for a rebuttable presumption with regard to the\nexistence of harm resulting from a cartel. Based on the finding that more than\n9 out of 10 cartels indeed cause an illegal overcharge[48], this alleviates the injured\nparty\u2019s difficulties and costs related to proving that the cartel caused higher\nprices to be charged than if the cartel had not existed.\nThe infringing\nundertaking could rebut this presumption and use the evidence at its disposal\nto prove that the cartel did not cause harm. The burden of proof is thus placed\non the party which already has in its possession the necessary evidence to meet\nthis burden of proof. The costs of disclosure, which would most likely be\nnecessary for the injured parties to prove the existence of harm, are thus\navoided.\nApart from the\nabove presumption, antitrust harm is quantified on the basis of national rules\nand procedures. These must, however, be in line with the principles of\nequivalence and of effectiveness. The latter, in particular, dictates that the\nburden and the level of proof may not render the injured party\u2019s right to\ndamages practically impossible or excessively difficult. In terms of quantifying\nantitrust harm, where the actual situation needs to be compared with a hypothetical\none, this means that judges must be able to estimate the amount of harm. This\nincreases the likelihood that victims will actually obtain an adequate amount\nof compensation for the harm they have suffered.\nTo make it\neasier for national courts to quantify harm, the Commission is also providing\nnon-binding guidance on this topic in its Communication on quantifying harm in\nactions for damages based on breaches of Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union[49].\nThe Communication is accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Paper taking the\nform of a Practical Guide on quantifying harm in actions for damages based on\nbreaches of EU competition law. This Practical Guide explains the strengths and\nweaknesses of various methods and techniques available to quantify antitrust\nharm. It also presents and discusses a range of practical examples, which\nillustrate the typical effects that infringements of the EU competition rules\ntend to have and how the available methods and techniques can be applied in\npractice.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consensual\nDispute Resolution (Chapter VI: Articles 17-18)\nOne of the primary objectives of the\nproposed Directive is to enable victims of a competition law infringement to\nobtain full compensation for the harm suffered. That objective can be achieved\neither through a damages action in court or through a consensual out-of-court\nsettlement between the parties. To incentivise parties to settle their dispute\nconsensually, the proposed Directive aims at optimising the balance between\nout-of-court settlements and actions for damages.\nIt therefore contains the following\nprovisions:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suspension of limitation periods\nfor bringing actions for damages as long as the infringing undertaking and the\ninjured party are engaged in consensual dispute resolution;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suspension of pending\nproceedings for the duration of consensual dispute resolution;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 reduction of the settling\ninjured party\u2019s claim by the settling infringer\u2019s share of harm. For the\nremainder of the claim, the settling infringer could only be required to pay\ndamages if the non-settling co-infringers were unable to fully compensate the\ninjured party; and\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 damages paid through consensual\nsettlements to be taken into account when determining the contribution that a\nsettling infringer needs to pay following a subsequent order to pay damages. In\nthis context, \u2018contribution\u2019 refers to the situation where the settling\ninfringer was not a defendant in the action for damages, but is asked by\nco-infringers who were ordered to pay damages to contribute under the rules of\njoint and several liability.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposed Directive does not have any\nbudgetary implications.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeal of existing\nlegislation\nNo previous legislative act is repealed\nthrough this present proposal.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review\nArticle 21 of the proposed Directive\nrequires the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council on\nits effects at the latest five years after the deadline for transposition into\nnational law.\nOnce the proposed Directive has been\nadopted, the Commission will continue to monitor the legal framework for\nantitrust damages actions in the Member States, focusing primarily on the\nachievement of the two main objectives of the proposed Directive, i.e.\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 optimising the interaction between\nthe public and private enforcement of competition law; and\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring that victims of\ninfringements of the EU competition rules can obtain full compensation for the\nharm they have suffered.\nThe Commission will assess whether the\nDirective is successful in removing inefficiencies and obstacles preventing\nfull compensation of victims of antitrust infringements and whether the\ninteraction between public and private enforcement of competition law is\nfunctioning smoothly, to guarantee the optimal overall enforcement of EU\ncompetition law. As part of this monitoring process, the Commission will\ncontinue its dialogue with all relevant stakeholders.\nFinally, an ex-post evaluation as regards\nthe need for further modifications will be made once the measures put forward\nby the Directive are being fully implemented in the Member States, i.e. at\nleast five years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanatory documents\nThe proposed Directive sets out specific\nmeasures to approximate substantive and procedural national rules governing\nactions for damages for infringements of the competition law provisions of the\nMember States and of the European Union. There are several legal obligations\nstemming from the proposed Directive. Its effective transposition will\ntherefore require that specific and targeted amendments are made to the\nrelevant national rules. In order for the Commission to monitor the correct\nimplementation, it is thus not sufficient for Member States to transmit the\ntext of the implementing provisions, as an overall assessment of the resulting\nregime under national law may be necessary. For these reasons, Member States\nshould also transmit to the Commission explanatory documents showing which\nexisting or new provisions under national law are meant to implement the\nindividual measures set out in the proposed Directive.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed Directive relates to the\neffective enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty, by optimising the\ninteraction between the public and private enforcement of these provisions as\nwell as by improving the conditions under which victims of competition law\ninfringements can claim damages. The proposed Directive contributes to the\nproper functioning of the internal market as it creates a more level playing\nfield both for the undertakings that infringe the competition rules and for the\nvictims of this illegal behaviour. Due to these objectives in the fields of\ncompetition and the internal market, which form part of the EEA legal rules, the\nproposal is relevant for the EEA.\n2013/0185 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non certain rules governing actions for\ndamages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions\nof the Member States and of the European Union\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 103 and 114\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[50],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[51],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 101 and 102 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as\nthe Treaty) are a matter of public policy and must be applied effectively\nthroughout the Union to ensure that competition in the internal market is not\ndistorted.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The public enforcement of\nthose Treaty provisions is carried out by the Commission using the powers provided\nby Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation\nof the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty\nestablishing the European Community[52]\n(hereinafter: Regulation No 1/2003). Public enforcement is also carried out by\nnational competition authorities, which may take the decisions listed in\nArticle 5 of Regulation No 1/2003.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Articles 101 and 102 of\nthe Treaty produce direct effects in relations between individuals and create,\nfor the individuals concerned, rights and obligations which national courts\nmust enforce. National courts thus have an equally essential part to play in\napplying the competition rules (private enforcement). When ruling on disputes\nbetween private individuals, they protect subjective rights under Union law,\nfor example by awarding damages to the victims of infringements. The full\neffectiveness of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty, and in particular the\npractical effect of the prohibitions laid down therein, requires that anyone \u2014\nbe they an individual, including consumers and undertakings, or a public\nauthority \u2014 can claim compensation before national courts for the harm caused\nto them by an infringement of those provisions. This Union right to\ncompensation applies equally to breaches of Articles 101 and 102 by public\nundertakings or undertakings entrusted with special or exclusive rights by\nMember States within the meaning of Article 106 of the Treaty.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union right to\ncompensation for antitrust harm requires each Member State to have procedural rules\nensuring the effective exercise of that right. The need for effective\nprocedural remedies also follows from the right to effective judicial\nprotection as laid down in Article 47, first paragraph, of the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union[53]\nand in Article 19(1), second subparagraph of the Treaty on European Union.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure effective public\nand private enforcement of the competition rules, it is necessary to regulate\nthe way the two forms of enforcement are coordinated, for instance the arrangements\nfor access to documents held by competition authorities. Such coordination at Union\nlevel will also avoid divergence of applicable rules, which could jeopardise the\nproper functioning of the internal market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n26(2) of the Treaty, the internal market comprises an area without internal\nfrontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is\nensured. There exist marked differences between the rules in the Member States\ngoverning actions for damages for infringements of national or Union competition\nlaw. Those differences lead to uncertainty concerning the conditions under\nwhich injured parties can exercise the right to compensation they derive from\nthe Treaty, and affect the substantive effectiveness of such right. As injured\nparties often choose the forum of their Member State of establishment to claim\ndamages, the discrepancies between the national rules lead to an uneven playing\nfield as regards actions for damages and may affect competition on the markets\non which these injured parties, as well as the infringing undertakings,\noperate. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undertakings established\nand operating in different Member States are subject to procedural rules that\nsignificantly affect the extent to which they can be held liable for\ninfringements of competition law. This uneven enforcement of the Union right to\ncompensation may result in a competitive advantage for some undertakings which\nhave breached Articles 101 or 102 of the Treaty, and a disincentive to the\nexercise of the rights of establishment and provision of goods or services in\nthose Member States where the right to compensation is more effectively\nenforced. As such, the differences in the liability regimes applicable in the\nMember States may negatively affect both competition and the proper functioning\nof the internal market.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary\nto ensure a more level playing field for undertakings operating in the internal\nmarket and to improve the conditions for consumers to exercise the rights they\nderive from the internal market. It is also appropriate to increase legal\ncertainty and to reduce the differences between the Member States as to the\nnational rules governing actions for damages for infringements of European\ncompetition law and, when applied in parallel to the latter, national\ncompetition law. An approximation of these rules will also help to prevent the\nemergence of wider differences between the Member States\u2019 rules governing\nactions for damages in competition cases.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3(1) of Regulation\n(EC) No 1/2003 provides that \u2018where the competition authorities of the Member\nStates or national courts apply national competition law to agreements,\ndecisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices within the\nmeaning of Article [101(1)] of the Treaty which may affect trade between Member\nStates within the meaning of that provision, they shall also apply Article\n[101] of the Treaty to such agreements, decisions or concerted practices. Where\nthe competition authorities of the Member States or national courts apply\nnational competition law to any abuse prohibited by Article [102] of the\nTreaty, they shall also apply Article [102] of the Treaty.\u2019 In the interest of\nthe proper functioning of the internal market and with a view to greater legal\ncertainty and a more level playing field for undertakings and consumers, it is\nappropriate that the scope of this Directive should extend to actions for\ndamages based on the infringement of national competition law where it is\napplied pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003. Applying diverging\nrules on civil liability for infringements of Articles 101 and 102 of the\nTreaty and for infringements of rules of national competition law which must be\napplied in the same case and in parallel to Union competition law would\notherwise adversely affect the position of claimants in the same case and the\nscope of their claims, and constitute an obstacle to the proper functioning of\nthe internal market.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of Union\nlaw, actions for damages are governed by the national rules and procedures of\nthe Member States. All national rules governing the exercise of the right to\ncompensation for harm resulting from an infringement of Article 101 or 102 of\nthe Treaty, including those concerning aspects not dealt with in this Directive\nsuch as the notion of causal relationship between the infringement and the harm,\nmust observe the principles of effectiveness and equivalence. This means that\nthey may not be formulated or applied in a way that makes it excessively\ndifficult or practically impossible to exercise the right to compensation\nguaranteed by the Treaty, and they may not be formulated or applied less\nfavourably than those applicable to similar domestic actions. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive reaffirms\nthe acquis communautaire on the Union right to compensation for harm\ncaused by infringements of Union competition law, particularly regarding\nstanding and the definition of damage, as it has been stated in the case-law of\nthe Court of Justice of the European Union, and does not pre-empt any further\ndevelopment thereof. Anyone who has suffered harm caused by an infringement can\nclaim compensation for the actual loss (damnum emergens), for the gain\nof which he has been deprived (loss of profit or lucrum cessans) and\npayment of interest accruing from the time the harm occurred until compensation\nis paid. This right is recognised for any natural or legal person \u2014 consumers,\nundertakings and public authorities alike \u2014 irrespective of the existence of a\ndirect contractual relationship with the infringing undertaking, and regardless\nof whether or not there has been a prior finding of an infringement by a\ncompetition authority. This Directive should not require Member States to\nintroduce collective redress mechanisms for the enforcement of Articles 101 and\n102 of the Treaty.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Actions for damages for\ninfringements of national or Union competition law typically require a complex\nfactual and economic analysis. The evidence necessary to prove a claim for\ndamages is often held exclusively by the opposing party or by third parties,\nand is not sufficiently known by and accessible to the claimant. In such\ncircumstances, strict legal requirements for claimants to assert in detail all\nthe facts of their case at the beginning of an action and to proffer precisely specified\npieces of supporting evidence can unduly impede the effective exercise of the\nright to compensation guaranteed by the Treaty.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence is an important\nelement for bringing actions for damages for infringement of national or Union\ncompetition law. However, as antitrust litigation is characterised by an\ninformation asymmetry, it is appropriate to ensure that injured parties are\nafforded the right to obtain the disclosure of evidence relevant to their claim,\nwithout it being necessary for them to specify individual items of evidence. In\norder to ensure equality of arms, those means should also be available to\ndefendants in actions for damages, so that they can request the disclosure of\nevidence by those injured parties. National courts can also order evidence to\nbe disclosed by third parties. Where the national court wishes to order\ndisclosure of evidence by the Commission, the principle of sincere cooperation\nbetween the European Union and the Member States (Article 4(3) TEU) and Article\n15(1) of Regulation No 1/2003 as regards requests for information are\napplicable.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relevant evidence should be\ndisclosed upon decision of the court and under its strict control, especially as\nregards the necessity and proportionality of the disclosure measure. It follows\nfrom the requirement of proportionality that disclosure requests can only be\ntriggered once an injured party has made it plausible, on the basis of facts\nwhich are reasonably available to him, that the party has suffered harm that\nwas caused by the defendant. The request for disclosure should refer to categories of evidence which are as precise\nand narrow as possible on the basis of reasonably\navailable facts. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirement of\nproportionality should also be carefully assessed when disclosure risks\nunravelling the investigation strategy of a competition authority by revealing\nwhich documents are part of the file or causing a negative bearing on the way\nin which companies cooperate with the competition authority. The disclosure\nrequest should therefore not be deemed proportionate when it refers to the\ngeneric disclosure of documents in the file of a competition authority relating\nto a certain case, or of documents submitted by a party in the context of a\ncertain case. Such wide disclosure requests would also not be compatible with\nthe requesting party's duty to specify categories of evidence as precisely and\nnarrowly as possible.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the court requests a competent court of another Member State to take evidence\nor requests evidence to be taken directly in another Member State, the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation\nbetween the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or\ncommercial matters[54]\napply.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While\nrelevant evidence containing business secrets or otherwise confidential information should in\nprinciple be available in actions for damages, such confidential information\nneeds to be appropriately protected. National courts should therefore have at\ntheir disposal a range of measures to protect such confidential information\nfrom being disclosed during the proceedings. These may include the possibility\nof hearings in private, restricting the circle of persons entitled to see the\nevidence, and instruction of experts to produce\nsummaries of the information in an aggregated or otherwise non-confidential\nform. Measures protecting business secrets and other confidential\ninformation should not practically impede the exercise of the right to\ncompensation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\neffectiveness and consistency of the application of Articles 101 and 102 of the\nTreaty by the Commission and the national competition authorities require a\ncommon approach across the Union regarding the interaction of rules on disclosure of evidence and\nthe way these Articles are enforced by a competition authority. Disclosure of\nevidence should not unduly detract from the effectiveness of enforcement of\ncompetition law by a competition authority. The limitations on the disclosure\nof evidence should not prevent competition authorities from publishing their\ndecisions in accordance with applicable Union or national rules.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leniency programmes and settlement procedures are important\ntools for the public enforcement of Union competition law as they contribute to\nthe detection, efficient prosecution and sanctioning of the most serious\ncompetition law infringements. Undertakings may be deterred from co-operating\nin this context if disclosure of documents they solely produce to this end were\nto expose them to civil liability under worse conditions than the co-infringers\nthat do not co-operate with competition authorities. To ensure that\nundertakings are willing to produce voluntary statements acknowledging their\nparticipation in an infringement of Union or national competition law to a competition authority under a\nleniency programme or a settlement procedure, such statements should be\nexcepted from disclosure of evidence. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, an exception to disclosure should apply to any disclosure measure\nthat would unduly interfere with an ongoing investigation by a competition\nauthority concerning an infringement of national or Union competition law. Information\nthat was prepared by a competition authority in the course of its proceedings\nfor the enforcement of national or Union competition law (such as a Statement\nof Objections) or by a party to those proceedings (such as replies to requests\nfor information of the competition authority) should therefore be disclosable\nin actions for damages only after the competition authority has found an\ninfringement of the national or Union competition rules or has otherwise closed\nits proceedings.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the evidence\nreferred to in recitals (19) and(20), national courts should be able to order,\nin the context of an action for damages, disclosure of evidence that exists irrespective\nof the proceedings of a competition authority (\u2018pre-existing information\u2019). \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any natural or legal person\nwho obtains evidence through access to the file of a competition authority in\nexercising his rights of defence in relation to investigations by a competition\nauthority can use that evidence for the purposes of an action for damages to\nwhich he is a party. Such use should also be allowed for the natural or legal\nperson that succeeded in his rights and obligations, including through the\nacquisition of his claim. In case the evidence was obtained by a legal person\nforming part of a corporate group constituting one undertaking for the\napplication of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty, the use of such evidence is\nalso allowed for other legal entities belonging to the same undertaking. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the use referred\nto in the previous recital may not unduly detract from the effective enforcement\nof competition law by a competition authority. Limitations to disclosure\nreferred to in recitals (19) and (20) should thus equally apply to the use of\nevidence which is obtained solely through access to the file of a competition\nauthority. Moreover, evidence obtained from a competition authority in the\ncontext of exercise of the rights of defence should not become an object of\ntrade. The possibility of using evidence that was obtained solely through\naccess to the file of a competition authority should therefore be limited to\nthe natural or legal person that exercised his rights of defence and his legal\nsuccessors, as mentioned in the previous recital. This limitation does not,\nhowever, prevent a national court from ordering the disclosure of that evidence\nunder the conditions provided for in this Directive.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Making a claim for damages,\nor the start of an investigation by a competition authority, entails a risk\nthat the undertakings concerned may destroy or hide evidence that would be\nuseful in substantiating an injured party\u2019s claim for damages. To prevent the\ndestruction of relevant evidence and to ensure that court orders requesting\ndisclosure are complied with, courts should be able to impose sufficiently\ndeterrent sanctions. Insofar as parties to the proceedings are concerned, the risk\nof adverse inferences being drawn in the proceedings for damages can be a particularly\neffective sanction and can avoid delays. Sanctions should also be available for\nnon-compliance with obligations to protect confidential information and for\nabusive use of information obtained through disclosure. Similarly, sanctions\nshould be available if information obtained through access to the file of a\ncompetition authority in the exercise of one\u2019s rights of defence in relation to\ninvestigations of that competition authority is used abusively in actions for\ndamages. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 16(1) of Regulation\n(EC) No 1/2003 provides that where national courts rule on agreements,\ndecisions or practices under Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty which are already\nthe subject of a Commission decision, they cannot take decisions which run counter\nto the decision adopted by the Commission. To enhance legal certainty, to avoid\ninconsistency in the application of those Treaty provisions, to increase the\neffectiveness and procedural efficiency of actions for damages and to foster\nthe functioning of the internal market for undertakings and consumers, it\nshould similarly not be possible to call into question a final decision by a\nnational competition authority or a review court finding an\ninfringement of Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty in actions for damages\nrelating to the same infringement, regardless of whether or not the action is\nbrought in the Member State of the authority or review court. The same should\napply to a decision in which it has been concluded that provisions of national\ncompetition law are infringed in cases where national and Union competition law\nare applied in the same case and in parallel. This effect of decisions by\nnational competition authorities and review courts finding an infringement of\nthe competition rules should apply to the operative part of the decision and\nits supporting recitals. This is without prejudice to the rights and\nobligations of national courts under Article 267 of the Treaty.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National rules on the\nbeginning, duration, suspension or interruption of limitation periods should\nnot unduly hamper the bringing of actions for damages. This is particularly\nimportant in respect of actions that build upon the competition authority's or\na review court\u2019s finding of an infringement. To that end, injured parties\nshould still be able to bring an action for damages after proceedings by a\ncompetition authority, with a view to enforcing national and Union competition\nlaw.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where\nseveral undertakings infringe the competition rules jointly (as in the case of\na cartel) it is appropriate to make provision for these joint infringers to be held\njointly and severally liable for the entire harm caused by the infringement.\nAmongst themselves, the joint infringers should have the right to obtain\ncontribution if one of the infringing undertakings has paid more than its\nshare. The determination of that share as the relative responsibility of a\ngiven infringer and the relevant criteria, such as turnover, market share, or\nrole in the cartel, is a matter for the applicable national law, while\nrespecting the principles of effectiveness and equivalence.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undertakings which\ncooperate with competition authorities under a leniency programme play a key\nrole in detecting secret cartel infringements and in bringing these\ninfringements to an end, thereby often mitigating the harm which could have\nbeen caused had the infringement continued. It is therefore appropriate to make\nprovision for undertakings which have received immunity from fines from a\ncompetition authority under a leniency programme to be protected from undue\nexposure to damages claims, bearing in mind that the decision of the\ncompetition authority finding the infringement may become final for the\nimmunity recipient before it becomes final for other undertakings which have\nnot received immunity. It is therefore appropriate that the immunity recipient is\nrelieved in principle from joint and several liability for the entire harm and that\nits contribution does not exceed the amount of harm caused to his own direct or\nindirect purchasers or, in case of a buying cartel, his direct or indirect\nproviders. To the extent a cartel has caused harm to others than the\ncustomers/providers of the infringing undertakings, the contribution of the\nimmunity recipient should not exceed his relative responsibility for the harm\ncaused by the cartel. This share should be determined in accordance with the\nsame rules used to determine the contributions among infringing undertakings\n(recital (27) above). The immunity recipient should remain fully liable to the\ninjured parties other than his direct or indirect purchasers or providers only\nwhere they are unable to obtain full compensation from the other infringing\nundertakings. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers and undertakings which\nhave been harmed by an infringement of national or Union competition law are\nentitled to compensation for the actual loss and for loss of profit. The actual\nloss can result from the price difference between what was actually paid and\nwhat would have been paid in the absence of the infringement. When an injured\nparty has reduced his actual loss by passing it on, entirely or in part, to his\nown purchasers, the loss which has been passed on no longer constitutes harm\nfor which the party that passed it on has to be compensated. It is therefore in\nprinciple appropriate to allow an infringing undertaking to invoke the\npassing-on of actual loss as a defence against a claim for damages. It is\nappropriate to provide that the infringing undertaking, insofar as it invokes the\npassing-on defence, must prove the existence and extent of pass-on of the\novercharge.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in a situation\nwhere the overcharge was passed on to persons who are legally unable to claim\ncompensation, it is not appropriate to allow the infringing undertaking to invoke\nthe passing-on defence, as this would render it free of liability for the harm\nwhich it has caused. The court seized of the action should therefore assess, when\nthe passing-on defence is invoked in a specific case, whether the persons to\nwhom the overcharge was allegedly passed on are legally able to claim\ncompensation. While indirect purchasers are entitled to claim compensation,\nnational rules of causality (including rules on foreseeability and remoteness),\napplied in accordance with principles of Union law, may entail that certain\npersons (for instance at a level of the supply chain which is remote from the\ninfringement) are legally unable to claim compensation in a given case. Only\nwhen the court finds that the person to whom the overcharge was allegedly\npassed on is legally able to claim compensation will it assess the merits of\nthe passing-on defence.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers or undertakings\nto whom actual loss has been passed on have suffered harm that has been caused\nby an infringement of national or Union competition law. While such harm should\nbe compensated by the infringing undertaking, it may be particularly difficult\nfor consumers or undertakings that did not themselves make any purchase from\nthe infringing undertaking to prove the scope of that harm. It is therefore\nappropriate to provide that, where the existence of a claim for damages or the\namount to be awarded depends on whether or to what degree an overcharge paid by\nthe direct purchaser of the infringing undertaking has been passed on to the\nindirect purchaser, the latter is regarded as having brought the proof that an\novercharge paid by that direct purchaser has been passed on to his level, where\nhe is able to show prima facie that such passing-on has occurred. It is\nfurthermore appropriate to define under what conditions the indirect purchaser is\nto be regarded as having established such prima facie proof. As regards\nthe quantification of passing-on, the national court should have the power to\nestimate which share of the overcharge has been passed on to the level of\nindirect purchasers in the dispute pending before it. The infringing\nundertaking should be allowed to bring proof showing that the actual loss has\nnot been passed on or has not been passed on entirely.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Infringements of\ncompetition law often concern the conditions and the price under which goods or\nservices are sold and lead to an overcharge and other harm for the customers of\nthe infringing undertakings. The infringement may also concern supplies to the\ninfringing undertaking (for example in the case of a buyer\u2019s cartel). The rules\nof this Directive and in particular the rules on pass-on should apply\naccordingly.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Actions for damages can be\nbrought both by injured parties that have purchased goods or services from the\ninfringing undertaking and by purchasers further down the supply chain. In the\ninterest of consistency between judgments resulting from such related\nproceedings and hence to avoid the harm caused by the infringement of national\nor Union competition law not being fully compensated or the infringing\nundertaking being required to pay damages to compensate for harm that has not\nbeen suffered, national courts should take due account, as far as allowed under\nUnion and national law, of any related action and of the resulting judgment,\nparticularly where it finds that passing-on has been proven. This should be\nwithout prejudice to the fundamental rights of defence and to an effective\nremedy and a fair trial of those who were not parties to these judicial\nproceedings. Any such actions pending before the courts of different Member\nStates may be considered as related within the meaning of Article 30 of\nRegulation No 1215/2012. Under this provision, national courts other than the\none first seized may stay proceedings or, under certain circumstances, decline\njurisdiction.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An injured party who has\nproven having suffered harm as a result of a competition law infringement still\nneeds to prove the extent of the harm in order to obtain damages. Quantifying\nantitrust harm is a very fact-intensive process and may require the application\nof complex economic models. This is often very costly and causes difficulties\nfor injured parties in terms of obtaining the necessary data to substantiate\ntheir claims. As such, the quantification of antitrust harm can constitute a\nsubstantial barrier preventing injured parties from obtaining compensatory\ndamages for harm suffered.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To remedy the information\nasymmetry and some of the difficulties associated with quantifying antitrust\nharm, and to ensure the effectiveness of claims for damages, it is appropriate\nto presume that in the case of a cartel infringement, the infringement has caused\nharm, in particular via a price effect. Depending on the facts of the case this\nmeans that the cartel has caused a rise in price, or prevented a lowering of\nprices which would otherwise have occurred but for the infringement. The infringing\nundertaking should be free to rebut such presumption. It is appropriate to\nlimit this rebuttable presumption to cartels, given the secret nature of a\ncartel, which increases the said information asymmetry and makes it more\ndifficult for the injured party to obtain the necessary evidence to prove the harm.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of Union\nrules on the quantification of harm caused by a competition law infringement,\nit is for the domestic legal system of each Member State and for the national\ncourts to determine what requirements the injured party has to meet when\nproving the amount of the harm suffered, how precisely he has to prove that\namount, the methods that can be used in quantifying the amount and the\nconsequences of not being able to fully meet the set requirements. However,\nthese domestic requirements should not be less favourable than those governing\nsimilar domestic actions (principle of equivalence), nor should they render the\nexercise of the Union right to damages practically impossible or excessively\ndifficult (principle of effectiveness). Regard should be had in this respect to\nany information asymmetries between the parties and to the fact that quantifying\nthe harm means assessing how the market in question would have evolved had\nthere been no infringement. This assessment implies a comparison with a\nsituation which is by definition hypothetical and can thus never be made with\ncomplete accuracy. It is therefore appropriate to give national courts the\npower to estimate the amount of the harm caused by the competition law\ninfringement.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injured parties and\ninfringing undertakings should be encouraged to agree on compensating the harm\ncaused by a competition law infringement through consensual dispute resolution\nmechanisms, such as out-of-court settlements, arbitration and mediation. Where\npossible, such consensual dispute resolution should cover as many injured\nparties and infringing undertakings as possible. The provisions in this\nDirective on consensual dispute resolution are therefore meant to facilitate\nthe use of such mechanisms and increase their effectiveness.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limitation periods for\nbringing an action for damages could be such that they prevent injured parties\nand infringing undertakings from having sufficient time to come to an agreement\non the compensation to be paid. In order to provide both with a genuine opportunity\nto engage in consensual dispute resolution before bringing proceedings before\nthe national court, the limitation period thus needs to be suspended for the\nduration of the consensual dispute resolution process.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, when parties\ndecide to engage in consensual dispute resolution after an action for damages\nhas been brought before the national court for the same claim, that court may\nsuspend the proceedings before it for the duration of the consensual dispute resolution\nprocess. When considering whether to suspend the proceedings, the national court\nshould take into account the interest in an expeditious procedure.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To encourage consensual\nsettlements, an infringing undertaking that pays damages through consensual\ndispute resolution should not be placed in a worse position vis-\u00e0-vis its\nco-infringers than it would be in without the consensual settlement. This might\nhappen if a settling infringer, even after a consensual settlement, continued\nto be fully jointly and severally liable for the harm caused by the\ninfringement. A settling infringer should in principle therefore not contribute\nto his non-settling co-infringers when the latter have paid damages to the\ninjured party with whom the first infringer had previously settled. The\ncorrelate to this non-contribution rule is that the claim of the injured party\nis reduced by the settling infringer\u2019s share of the harm caused to him. This\nshare should be determined in accordance with the same rules used to determine\nthe contributions among infringing undertakings (recital (27) above). Without\nsuch reduction, the non-settling infringers would be unduly affected by the\nsettlement to which they were not a party. The settling co-infringer will still\nhave to pay damages where that is the only possibility for the injured party to\nobtain full compensation.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When settling co-infringers\nare asked to contribute to damages subsequently paid by non-settling\nco-infringers, the national court should take account of the damages already\npaid under the consensual settlement, bearing in mind that not all\nco-infringers are necessarily equally involved in the full substantive,\ntemporal and geographical scope of the infringement.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As it would be impossible,\nwith a disparity of policy choices and legal rules at national level concerning\nthe Union right to compensation in actions for damages for infringement of the\nUnion competition rules, to ensure the full effect of Articles 101 and 102 of\nthe Treaty, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for\nundertakings and consumers, these objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by\nthe Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the requisite effectiveness\nand consistency in the application of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty, be\nbetter achieved at Union level. The European Parliament and the Council\ntherefore adopt this Directive, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\nthis Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those\nobjectives.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory\ndocuments of 28 September 2011[55],\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\njustified. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope of the Directive\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive sets out certain\nrules necessary to ensure that anyone who has suffered harm caused by an\ninfringement of Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty or of national competition law,\ncan effectively exercise the right to full compensation for that harm.
