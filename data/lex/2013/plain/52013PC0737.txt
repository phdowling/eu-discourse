Various rates of customs duty were\r\nassociated with these articles. This led to a complex tariff system of\r\nclassification.\nThe 2012 version of the HS nomenclature\r\ncreated a single specific HS heading (9619 00) for such sanitary articles.\r\nHowever, the situation prior to 2012 was transposed into the 2012 version of\r\nthe Combined Nomenclature (CN) without any further amendments. Thus, under the\r\nnew CN code 9619 00, the same complex tariff system of classification has been\r\nkept.\nBecause this complexity could lead to\r\nunnecessary difficulties and burden in applying the CN, it would be appropriate\r\nto simplify both the nomenclature and the tariff structure, on an autonomous\r\nbasis (thus, without requiring any amendment to the Union's WTO schedule), with\r\neffect from 1 January 2014.\nThe proposal aims at having four categories\r\nof product (instead of eight), each of these categories being associated with a\r\nsingle autonomous rate of duty (four different rates, instead of eight).\nThe attached proposal has been discussed\r\nwith European federations. It is considered to be a balanced approach, taking\r\ninto account the legal context and the interests of European industry.\nThere is no loss of relevant statistical\r\ndata.\nThe proposal has also been discussed with\r\nMember States.\nThe proposal is in line with the Union's external trade and industry policies.\nIn the light of the foregoing, it is\r\nproposed to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 accordingly.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission's Tariff and Statistical\r\nNomenclature Section of the Customs Code Committee has been consulted on\r\nseveral occasions (in October and December 2012, and in March and July 2013).\nThe Commission's Economic Tariff Questions\r\nGroup was consulted on 10 July 2013.\nIndustry was consulted during the whole\r\nprocess (and, in particular, in meetings in June and July 2011).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe subsidiarity principle does not apply,\r\nsince the proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle given that, as foreseen in the Treaty, it promotes\r\ntrade between Member States and third countries, and balances the commercial\r\ninterests of economic operators (manufacturers in the Union and importers)\r\nwithout changing the Union's WTO schedule.\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union, the autonomous rate of duty is fixed by\r\nthe Council acting by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the\r\nCommission.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe loss of revenue in traditional own\r\nresources is around 320 000 \u20ac on an annual basis (based on the import\r\nstatistics of 2012 and without taking into account the preferential regimes).\n2013/0353 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs\r\nTariff\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until 2012, sanitary\r\ntowels (pads) and tampons, napkins and napkin liners for babies and similar\r\narticles of any material were classified in different Chapters of the Harmonised\r\nSystem nomenclature, depending on the nature or constituent material of the\r\narticle. Different rates of customs duty were associated with those articles.\r\nThis led to a complex tariff system of classification.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2012, a single heading\r\n9619 00 was created in the Harmonised System to cover those sanitary articles.\r\nHowever, the same complex tariff system of classification was kept under the\r\nnew heading, which was divided into twelve subheadings according to the\r\nconstituent material, each corresponding to a different conventional rate of\r\nduty. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This complex system has\r\nbeen found to lead to unnecessary difficulties and burdens in the application\r\nof the Combined Nomenclature. In the interest of legislative simplification and\r\nto avoid unnecessary difficulties in applying the Combined Nomenclature, it is therefore\r\nappropriate to simplify both the nomenclature and the tariff structure for\r\nthose sanitary articles, in order to implement four categories of products\r\n(instead of eight), each of them associated with a single autonomous rate of\r\nduty. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EEC)\r\nNo 2658/87[2]\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is\r\namended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January\r\n2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EEC)\r\nNo 2658/87, the entries for CN codes 9619 00 to\r\n9619 00 90 in Part Two, Section XX, Chapter 96, are\r\nreplaced by the following:\n \"9619 00 ||   || Sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins and napkin liners for babies, and similar articles, of any material: \n 9619 00 30 || \u2013 || Of wadding of textile materials \n(1)\n\u2014\n   || \u2013 || Of other textile materials: \n 9619 00 40 || \u2013 \u2013  || Sanitary towels (pads), tampons and similar articles \n(2)\n\u2014\n 9619 00 50 || \u2013 \u2013  || Napkins and napkin liners for babies, and similar articles \n(3)\n\u2014\n   || \u2013  || Of other materials: \n   || \u2013 \u2013  || Sanitary towels (pads), tampons and similar articles: \n 9619 00 71 || \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || Sanitary towels (pads) \n(4)\n\u2014\n 9619 00 75 || \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || Tampons \n(4)\n\u2014\n 9619 00 79 || \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || Other \n(4)\n\u2014\n   || \u2013 \u2013  || Napkins and napkin liners for babies, and similar articles: \n 9619 00 81 || \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || Napkins and napkin liners for babies \n(4)\n\u2014\n 9619 00 89 || \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || Other (for example, incontinence care articles) \n(4)\n\u2014\n(1) Autonomous\r\nrate of duty : 3,8 %.\nConventional rate\r\nof duty :\n- Of man made fibres : 5 %,\n- Other than of man\r\nmade fibres : 3,8 %.\n(2)\r\nAutonomous rate of duty: 6,3 %.\nConventional rate\r\nof duty:\n- Knitted or\r\ncrocheted: 12 %,\n- Other: 10,5 %.\n(3)\r\nAutonomous rate of duty: 10,5 %.\nConventional rate\r\nof duty:\n- Knitted or\r\ncrocheted: 12 %,\n- Other: 10,5 %.\n(4)\r\nAutonomous rate of duty: Free.\nConventional rate\r\nof duty:\n- Of paper pulp, paper,\r\ncellulose wadding or webs of cellulose fibres: Free,\n- Of other\r\nmaterials: 6,5%.\"\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title\r\nof the proposal\nCouncil Regulation amending Annex I to Council\r\nRegulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on\r\nthe Common Customs Tariff.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature of the proposal\nTo provide autonomous customs duties for\r\ncertain sanitary articles [sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins and\r\nnapkin liners for babies, and similar articles, of any material], with\r\nappropriate changes to the tariff structure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objective\nTo facilitate the classification of certain\r\nsanitary articles, as well as to simplify the tariff, on an autonomous basis\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the proposal\nWith the introduction of the 2012 version of\r\nthe Harmonized System (HS), certain sanitary articles were brought together\r\nunder the same heading, instead of being classified in different chapters of\r\nthe Combined Nomenclature.
