They shall be forwarded to the European Union as soon as they\nhave been drawn up and every quarter thereafter where they have been updated.\n1.3. The\ncompetent authority shall inform the vessel owners concerned, or their\nrepresentatives, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board\ntheir vessel at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before\nthe observer\u2019s planned embarkation date.\n2. The time\nspent on board by the observer shall be one fishing trip. However, at the\nexpress request of the competent Ivorian authorities, this embarkation may be\nspread over several trips according to the average duration of trip for a\nparticular vessel. This request shall be made by the competent authority when\nthe name of the observer appointed to board the vessel in question is notified.\n3. The\nconditions under which the observer is taken on board shall be agreed between\nthe vessel owner or his/her representative and the competent authority.\n4. The observer\nshall be taken on board at a port chosen by the vessel owner at the beginning\nof the first voyage in Ivorian waters after notification of the list of\ndesignated vessels.\n5. Within two\nweeks and giving ten days' notice, the vessel owners concerned shall make known\nat which ports in the subregion and on what dates they intend to take observers\non board. \n6. If an\nobserver is taken on board in a country outside the subregion, his or her\ntravel costs shall be borne by the vessel owner.

The\nnew Protocol shall apply provisionally as from 1 July 2013. To secure\ncontinuity of fishing operations, a procedure for adoption by the Council of a\nDecision on the signing and provisional application of the Protocol has been\nlaunched in parallel with this procedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\nof the European fleet in the Ivorian fishing zone and will, in particular,\nauthorise vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in\nIvorian waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the\nEU and the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with a\nview to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It provides, in particular, for the vessels to be\nmonitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch data. Sectoral support has been strengthened to help the\nRepublic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to meet its international obligations in terms of the\nState's control of the port. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nAs regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow\nprivate agreements to spring up which would not guarantee sustainable\nfisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, the Republic\nof C\u00f4te d'Ivoire will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU with regard\nto sustainable fishing.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe under-utilisation of the previous Protocol led the parties to\nreduce the fishing opportunities.

In any case, any payment which the Commission makes\nunder a fisheries agreement is subject to the Commission's standard rules and\nbudgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to\nfully identify the bank accounts of the third countries into which the\nfinancial contribution is paid.
