The Convention entered into force in the Union on 20 June 1983.\nThe purpose of the proposed Decision is for\nthe Union to adopt the latest amendments to the TIR Convention agreed by the\nUNECE Working Party on Customs Questions Affecting Transport and further\nadopted by the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention, 1975, subject\nto completion of the EU's internal procedures.\nOn 5 July 2012, the Administrative\nCommittee transmitted to the Secretary-General, in accordance with the\nprovisions of article 59 (1) and (2) of the Convention, proposals of amendments\nto Articles 6.2 bis and Annex 9 to the text of the Convention, adopted at its\nfifty-third session held in Geneva on 9 February 2012. On 10 July\nThe Secretary-General issued the Depository Notification C.N.358.2012.TREATIES,\ncommunicating that if by 10 July 2013 none of the Contracting Parties had\nnotified any objections to the amendment proposals, they will enter into force on\n10 October 2013. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nThe TIR Convention, which is administered\nby the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), based in Geneva, has established a customs transit procedure for the international movement of\ngoods by road. The Convention enables goods, which are under customs and tax\nsuspension, to cross international borders with a minimum of intervention en\nroute by the customs authorities. By easing traditional impediments to the\ninternational movement of goods, the TIR system encourages the development of\ninternational trade. By reducing delays in transit, it enables significant\neconomies to be made in transport costs. The most important advantage of the\nsystem is the fact that the TIR Convention provides, through its international\nguarantee chain, relatively simple access to the required guarantees.\nThe UNECE Working Party on Customs\nQuestions Affecting Transport agreed that some modifications of the TIR\nConvention are necessary. These modifications concern the amendment of Article\n6 of the TIR Convention in order to introduce a new part III in Annex 9 to the\nTIR Convention establishing the conditions and requirements to be complied with\nby an international organization which is authorised to take on the\nresponsibility for the effective organization and functioning of an\ninternational guarantee system and to print and distribute TIR Carnets. That\ninternational organization is currently the International Road Transport\nOrganization (IRU).\nThis new Annex 9, part III will complement\nthe purpose of Annex 9 which addresses access to the TIR procedure by the\nprivate sector and which already deals with the authorisations for national\nassociations to issue TIR carnets as well as for natural and legal persons to\nutilize TIR Carnets.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\narea of the proposal\nArticle 6 and Explanatory notes to Article\n6, paragraph 2 bis to the TIR Convention.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the other\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThe proposed Decision is consistent with\nthe common policy in trade and transport. The TIR system, providing\nfacilitation in road transport, allows goods to travel across 68 Contracting\nParties with a minimum of interference by customs administrations and provides,\nthrough an international guarantee chain, relatively simple access to the\nrequired guarantees. The simplifications achieved through the TIR Convention\nare in line with the revised Lisbon strategy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nConsultations on the proposal were carried\nout with the International Road Transport Union IRU. Consultations took place\nwithin the Customs Legislation Committee (Co-ordination Geneva) meetings and\nsessions of the UNECE Working Party on Customs Questions Affecting Transport.\nSummary of responses and how they\nhave been taken into account\nFavourable opinion.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Collection and use of\nexpertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe proposed amendments do not change the\nsubstance of Annex 9 to the TIR Convention. However, the introduction of a new\npart III, will complement its purpose by defining clearly the roles and\nresponsibilities of the all players in the TIR system for the purposes of\ntransparency in its management. In addition, as the international organization\nis currently playing a vital role in the TIR system, the TIR Convention should\nclearly define this organization and explain how the procedure for authorisation\nof this organization should be applied.The introduction of these conditions and\nrequirements in the legal text of the TIR Convention will also simplify the\ntext of the written agreement between UNECE and the international organization\nin accordance with Explanatory Note 0.6.2 bis 2.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\naction\nThe proposed Decision lays down the\nposition to be taken by the Union concerning the proposal to amend the Customs\nConvention on the International Transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticles 207 and 218 (9) of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls within an area of\nexclusive competence of the European Union (common commercial policy) and\ntherefore does not deserve an examination with regard to the principle of\nsubsidiarity (Article 5 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion).\nThe proposed amendments were preliminarily\nadopted by the UNECE Working Party on Customs Questions Affecting Transport and\nAdministrative Committee for the TIR Convention.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal is in conformity with the\nprinciple of proportionality.
