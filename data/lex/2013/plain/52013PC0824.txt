In its\npoint 2.4, the European Council invited the Commission to put forward proposals\nsetting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and\naccused persons by setting common minimum standards on fair trial rights. The measures\ndeal with distinct procedural rights for suspects or accused persons which have\nbeen identified by Member States and stakeholders alike as needing to be\nstrengthened by action at EU level, and thus have to be considered as a\nbuilding-block for a whole edifice.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures have\nalready been adopted: a Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal\nproceedings[2] in October 2010 and Directive 2012/13/EU of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on the right to information in\ncriminal proceedings in May 2012[3],\nand Directive 2013/48/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the\nright of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and in European arrest\nwarrant proceedings, and on the right to have a third party informed upon\ndeprivation of liberty and to communicate with third persons and with consular\nauthorities while deprived of liberty in October 2013.[4] Measures on the protection of\nvulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings are presented\nas a package with the present initiative, together with a Directive on the strengthening\nof certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be\npresent at trial in criminal proceedings, which form part of the underlying\nprinciples of the right of fair trial. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly to the previous\nmeasures, this proposal seeks to improve the rights of suspects or accused persons\nin criminal proceedings. Having common minimum standards governing these rights\nshould boost mutual trust between judicial authorities and thus facilitate the\napplication of the principle of mutual recognition. A certain degree of\ncompatibility between the legislation of Member States is pivotal to improve\njudicial cooperation in the EU.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposal is based on\nArticle 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nThat Article provides that, \u2018[t]o the extent necessary to facilitate mutual\nrecognition of judgments and judicial decisions and police and judicial\ncooperation in criminal matters having a cross-border dimension, the European\nParliament and the Council may, by means of directives adopted in accordance\nwith the ordinary legislative procedure, establish minimum rules. Such rules\nshall take into account the differences between the legal traditions and\nsystems of the Member States.\n\u00a0 'They shall\nconcern:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) mutual\nadmissibility of evidence between Member States;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) the\nrights of individuals in criminal procedure;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) the rights\nof victims of crime;\n(d)(\u2026)\u2019. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current proposal is\nclosely linked to Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer and\nit aims to contributing to rendering effective the right on access to a lawyer\nprovided for in that Directive at the early stages of the proceedings for\nsuspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and to ensure that requested\npersons in European arrest warrant proceedings have access to legal aid to\nensure the right of access to a lawyer in both the executing and issuing Member\nState (\"right of dual defence\"). \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission is presenting\na balanced package of measures, respecting the differences between the legal\ntraditions and systems of the Member States, as provided for in Article 82 (2)\nTFEU and taking the action needed to foster mutual trust while respecting the\nprinciple of proportionality (Article 5 TEU). It has been carefully assessed if\naction should be taken at EU level, and if so, at what level and in what form.\nThe need for caution is particularly obvious in times of fiscal consolidation,\nwhen cost implications need to be carefully weighed.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The aspects on legal aid\nin criminal proceedings dealt with in this Directive have been identified as of\nparticular importance to complement and ensure the effectiveness of the rights\nin the Directive on access to a lawyer and to improve mutual trust between\ncriminal justice systems. \n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nright to legal aid in criminal proceedings is enshrined\nin Article 47(3) of the Charter and in Article 6(3)(c)\nECHR. It is also recognised in\nArticle 14, paragraph 3 (d) of the ICCPR. The fundamental principles on which a\nlegal aid system should be based are outlined in the United Nationals\nPrinciples and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems adopted\non 20 December 2012 by the General Assembly.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the early phase\nof the proceedings, especially if deprived of liberty, that suspects or accused\npersons will be the most vulnerable and most in need of legal aid to be\nassisted by a lawyer. Therefore, the Directive makes provisions for so-called\n\"provisional legal aid\" which brings significant added value and\nimproved mutual trust between criminal justice systems.[5] \n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, while all Member\nStates provide access to legal aid for suspects and accused persons in criminal\nproceedings, it appears that requested persons in European Arrest Warrant\nproceedings do not always have access to legal aid in the Member States. This\nhampers the exercise of the right provided for in the Directive on access to a\nlawyer, i.e. access to a lawyer in both the executing and issuing Member State. Moreover, the rights in Article 6 ECHR, including the right to legal aid, do\nnot extend to extradition proceedings. Therefore, in order to improve mutual\ntrust and make the right to dual defence in European arrest warrant proceedings\neffective, the Directive also requires Member States to give access to legal\naid, beyond provisional legal aid as the requested persons are not always\ndeprived of liberty.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This measure is presented\ntogether with an accompanying Commission Recommendation on the right to legal\naid for suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. The Recommendation\nseeks to foster certain convergence as regards the assessment of eligibility of\nlegal aid in the Member States, as well as encouraging the Member States to\ntake action to improve the quality and effectiveness of legal aid services and\nadministration.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current proposal will\nalso contribute to strengthening the legal safeguards that protect individuals\ninvolved in proceedings conducted by the European Public Prosecutor's Office.\nThe recently presented Proposal for a Council Regulation[6] clarifies that the suspected\nperson has all rights granted by EU legislation as well as other rights which\nderive directly from the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion, to be applied in accordance with applicable national law. It explicitly\nrefers to the right to legal aid and by introducing strengthened standards on\nlegal aid, the current proposal also reinforces the procedural safeguards\napplying in proceedings conducted by the European Public Prosecutor's Office. \n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to an effective\nremedy, to a fair trial and a right of defence are provided for in the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter), Articles 47 and 48,\nand in Article 6 of the European Convention of Fundamental Rights (ECHR). The\nright to legal aid, i.e. benefitting from the assistance of a lawyer in\ncriminal proceedings fully or partially free of charge, is explicitly\nrecognised as an integral part of the right to a fair trial and defence rights.\nArticle 47 (3) of the Charter provides that: \"Legal aid shall be made\navailable to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is\nnecessary to ensure effective access to justice.\" Article 6(3)(c) ECHR\nstates that everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to\n\"defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing\nor, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it\nfree when the interests of justice so require\". Effective access to legal\nrepresentation is paramount to ensure the respect of the presumption of\ninnocence and the rights of the defence as set out in Article 48 of the\nCharter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In March 2009, a 2-days-expert\nmeeting on procedural rights, including the right to legal aid was organised.\nIn a meeting on 3 June 2013, all concerned Member States were consulted in an\nexpert meeting. The Member States had previously, in Council in June 2012,\ncalled upon the Commission to present a legislative proposal on legal aid at\nthe earliest.[7]\nThe European Parliament, in its orientation vote on the Directive on Access to\na Lawyer of 12 July 2012, called on the Commission to come up with a proposal\non legal aid.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In December 2011, the\nPolish Presidency, in cooperation with the European Commission, the Council of Bars\nand Law Societies in Europe (CCBE) and the Academy of European Law (ERA)\norganised a 2-day conference on legal aid in criminal matters. The Conference\nprovided an opportunity for the exchange of views and experiences for experts\nfrom a variety of backgrounds \u2013 legal practitioners, judges, prosecutors,\nacademics, representatives of EU bodies, NGOs, Council of Europe to examine the\nproblems and possible contents of a future measure. \n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stakeholders were\nconsulted on several occasions. The Commission has had regular and bilateral\ncontacts with a number of NGOs and other stakeholders and several of the NGO's\nshared contributions with the Commission in view of the forthcoming measures.[8]\n18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\nstudy for the Impact Assessment, wide outreach with Member States' Ministries\nof Justice, interest organisations in the Member States, Bar Associations and\nlegal aid boards was made. In-depth interviews were carried out with lawyers in\nthe bar associations, representatives from stakeholder organisations and\nMinistries of Justices in all Member States. Moreover, focus groups, bringing\ntogether representatives from Ministries of Justice, bar associations,\nacademics, judicial staff, and stakeholder organisations were organised in a\nnumber of Member States. In addition, an on-line consultation for legal aid\nproviders in the Member States was carried out.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission carried out\nan impact assessment to underpin its proposal. The report on the impact\nassessment is available at http://ec.europa.eu/governance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nArticle 1 \u2013 Subject-matter\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\nDirective is to ensure that suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings\nwho are deprived of liberty and persons subject to European arrest warrant proceedings\nhave access to legal aid to render effective their right of access to a lawyer\nas provided for in the Directive on the right of access to a lawyer. \nArticle 2 \u2013 Scope\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive applies to\nsuspects or accused persons who are deprived of liberty. It applies from the\ndeprivation of liberty, i.e. as from the moment one is taken into police\ncustody or similar custody, which also covers periods before formal charge and\narrest has taken place. This reflects ECtHR jurisprudence under Article 5(1)\nECHR.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive also applies\nto requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings. In such\nsituations, the Directive applies from the time of arrest in the executing Member State until the surrender, or, in cases of non-surrender, until the decision on\nsurrender has become final.\nArticle 3 Definitions\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal aid means funding and\nassistance from the Member State ensuring the effective use of the right of\naccess to a lawyer. It should cover the costs of the defence, such as the cost\nof the lawyer, and other costs of the proceedings, such as court fees.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisional legal aid\nmeans legal aid to a person deprived of liberty until the decision on legal aid\nhas been taken.\nArticle 4 \u2013 Access to provisional legal\naid\n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the early stages of the\nproceedings, suspects or accused persons are particularly vulnerable and access\nto a lawyer is of paramount importance to protect the fair trial rights, inter\nalia the right to not incriminate oneself.[9]\nArticle 6 of the ECHR requires that, as a rule, a suspect should be granted\naccess to legal assistance from the moment he is taken into police custody or\npre-trial detention, and that such assistance should be assigned officially if\nneed be.[10]\n\n26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Directive on\naccess to a lawyer, suspects or accused persons have a right to access to a lawyer\ninter alia without delay after deprivation of liberty and before any\nquestioning. In order for suspects or accused persons who are deprived of\nliberty to be in a position to effectively exercise the right of access to a\nlawyer at the early stages of the proceedings, they should not have to wait for\naccess to a lawyer pending the processing of the application for legal aid and the\nassessment of the eligibility criteria for legal aid, which could be lengthy. Member\nStates should, therefore, ensure that access to provisional legal aid is\navailable without delay after deprivation of liberty and before any questioning\ntakes place. \n27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To this effect, Member\nStates should set in place procedures or mechanisms, for example duty lawyer\nschemes or emergency defence services, allowing intervention with short notice\nat police stations or detention centres, so that the right to provisional legal\naid and access to a lawyer without undue delay after deprivation of liberty and\nbefore any questioning becomes practicable and effective.\n28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right of access to a\nlawyer entails a number of rights for suspects or accused persons, as provided\nfor in Article 3(3) of Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer,\nsuch as the right to meet in private and communicate with the lawyer, the right\nto have the lawyer present and participate effectively when the suspect or\naccused person is questioned, and the right for the lawyer to assist to certain\nevidence-gathering acts. Member States may make practical arrangements\nregarding the exercise of the right of access to a lawyer e.g. as regards the duration\nand frequency of communication with the lawyer and there can thus be certain\nlimits to the exercise of that right, provided they do not prejudice the\nessence of the right. The right to provisional legal aid must be provided to\nthe extent necessary to allow for the effective exercise of the right of access\nto a lawyer and any limitation must ensure that suspects or accused persons are\nnot prevented from exercising effectively their rights.\n29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to provisional\nlegal aid should last at least until the competent authority has made the final\ndecision on whether the suspect or accused person is eligible and benefits from\nlegal aid. In case the application for legal aid is fully or partially\nrejected, the right to provisional legal aid ceases when this decision has\nbecome final and the rights to appeal or review have been exhausted. If the\napplication for legal aid is granted, the right to provisional legal aid ceases\nwhen the legal aid has taken effect and, if applicable, the appointment of the\nlegal aid lawyer has taken effect. In such cases, Member States shall ensure\nthat there is no gap where the suspect or accused person is unrepresented. \n30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to provisional\nlegal aid also applies to requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings\nwho are deprived of liberty. Such persons should have the right to effective provisional\nlegal aid from the time of deprivation of liberty in the executing Member\nState, and at least until the competent authority has treated the application for\nlegal aid and determined the eligibility and, if applicable, the appointment of\nthe legal aid lawyer has taken effect. \n31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States may provide\nin their national law that the costs relating to provisional legal aid can subsequently\nbe recovered from suspects or accused persons, or requested persons, if\nfollowing the final decision on the application for legal aid, the person is\nnot, or is only partially, eligible for legal aid under the Member State's legal aid regime.\nArticle 5 \u2013 Legal aid for requested\npersons\n32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall ensure\nthat requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings have a right to access\nlegal aid in the executing Member State upon arrest pursuant to the European\narrest warrant until the surrender, or, in cases of non-surrender, until the\ndecision on surrender has become final.\n33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\neffectiveness of the right to appoint a lawyer in the issuing Member State to\nassist the lawyer in the executing Member State, according to Article 10 of Directive\n2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer, Member States shall ensure that there\nis a right to access legal aid in the issuing Member State for requested\npersons that exercise this right of access to a lawyer, for the purpose of the\nEuropean arrest warrant proceedings in the executing Member State.\n34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to legal aid in\nthe executing and issuing Member State may be subject to an assessment of the\nmeans of the requested person and/or whether it is in the interests of justice to\nprovide legal aid, according to the applicable eligibility criteria in the executing\nor issuing Member State in question. \n35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in the period\nleading up to the final decision on whether the requested person benefits from\nlegal aid in the executing Member State, requested persons that are deprived of\nliberty are entitled to provisional legal aid in the executing Member State in accordance with Article 3 of this Directive.\nArticle\n6 \u2013 Provision of data\n36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor and\nevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this Directive, there is a need\nfor collection of reliable data by the Member States with regard to the\nexercise of the right to provisional legal aid in Article 3, and with regard to\nthe exercise of the right to legal aid for requested persons in Article 4. \nArticle\n7 \u2013 Non-regression clause\n37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this\nArticle is to ensure that setting common minimum standards in accordance with\nthis Directive does not have the effect of lowering existing higher standards\nin certain Member States and the standards in the Charter and the ECHR. Since\nthe Directive provides for minimum rules, Member States remain free to set\nstandards higher than those agreed in this Directive.\nArticle\n8 \u2013 Transposition \n38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article requires that\nMember States must implement the Directive [18 months after its publication] and,\nby the same date, transmit the text of the provisions transposing it into national\nlaw to the Commission.\nArticle\n9 \u2013 Entry into force\n39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article provides that\nthe Directive will enter into force on the twentieth day following its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDIARITY PRINCIPLE \n40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of this\nproposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, since there is\nsignificant variation in the right to provisional legal aid for suspects or\naccused persons deprived of liberty, and for requested persons. As the aim of\nthe proposal is to promote mutual trust, only action taken by the European\nUnion will establish consistent common minimum standards that apply throughout\nthe European Union. The proposal will approximate Member States' legislation\nwith respect to provisional legal aid in criminal proceedings and legal aid in\nEuropean arrest warrant proceedings. The proposal therefore complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality\nprinciple\n41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, this Directive does not go\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve the relevant objectives. It has been carefully assessed if action should be taken at EU level,\nand if so, at what level and in what form. \u00a0\u00a0 The Directive only addresses\naspects on legal aid in criminal proceedings that have been identified as\nindispendable to complement and ensure the effectiveness of the rights in the\nDirective on access to a lawyer and to improve mutual trust between criminal\njustice systems. The Commission does not propose legally binding parameters on\neligibility testing or on quality in the Directive. These elements are dealt\nwith in a Commission Recommendation which complements this proposal. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThis proposal does not have any impact on the\nEU budget. \n2013/0409 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non provisional legal aid for suspects or\naccused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant\nproceedings \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular point (b) of Article 82\n(2),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\npurpose of this Directive is to ensure the effectiveness of the right of access\nto a lawyer by providing assistance by the Member States for persons deprived\nof liberty at an early stage in the criminal proceedings and for requested\npersons in surrender procedures pursuant to Council Framework\nDecision 2002/584/JHA[11]\n(European arrest warrant proceedings).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nestablishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects\nor accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the trust of Member State in criminal justice systems of other Member States and can thus help improve\nmutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Stockholm Programme[12] put a strong focus on the\nstrengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. In its\npoint 2.4, the European Council invited the Commission to put forward\nproposals, setting out a step by step approach[13]\nto strengthening the rights of suspects or accused persons. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures on\nprocedural rights in criminal proceedings have been adopted to date, namely\nDirective 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[14], Directive 2012/13/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[15]\nand Directive 2013/48/EU of the European Parliament and the Council.[16]\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal aid should cover the\ncosts of the defence and the proceedings for suspects or accused persons in\ncriminal proceedings and requested persons in European arrest warrant\nproceedings.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nscope and content of the right to access to a lawyer are set out in Directive 2013/48/EU.\nA suspect or accused person in criminal proceedings should have the right of\naccess to a lawyer from the time when they are made aware, by official\nnotification or otherwise, by the competent authorities, that they are\nsuspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence, and irrespective\nof whether they are deprived of liberty. That right applies until the\nconclusion of the proceedings, which is understood to mean the final\ndetermination of the question whether the suspect or accused person has\ncommitted the offense, including where applicable, sentencing and the\nresolution of any appeal. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nof the fundamental features of a fair trial, as stated by the European Court of\nHuman Rights (\"ECtHR\") is that everyone charged with a criminal\noffence is effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be. The\nfairness of criminal proceedings requires that a suspect should be granted\naccess to legal assistance from the moment of deprivation of liberty. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\n2013/48/EU provides that in cases where suspects or\naccused persons are deprived of liberty, Member States should make the\nnecessary arrangements to ensure that they are in a position to exercise effectively\ntheir right of access to lawyer, unless they have waived this right.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder for suspects or accused persons who are deprived of liberty to be in a\nposition to exercise effectively the right of access to a lawyer at the early stages\nof the proceedings, they should not have to wait for access to a lawyer pending\nthe processing of the application for legal aid and the assessment of the\neligibility criteria for legal aid. Member States should therefore ensure that\neffective provisional legal aid is available without undue delay after the\ndeprivation of liberty and before any questioning, and it should be available at\nleast until the competent authority has taken the decision on legal aid and, in\ncases of full or partial rejection, this decision has become final, or, where the application for legal aid is granted, the appointment of\nthe lawyer by the competent authority has taken effect.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Member States should ensure\nthat provisional legal aid is provided to the extent necessary and is not\nlimited in a way that prevents the suspects or accused persons from exercising effectively\nthe right of access to a lawyer as provided for in particular in Article 3(3) of\nDirective 2013/48/EU.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requested\npersons in European arrest warrant proceedings who are deprived of liberty\nshould have the right to provisional legal aid upon deprivation of liberty in\nthe executing Member State, at least until the competent authority has taken\nthe decision on legal aid and, in cases of full or partial rejection, that\ndecision has become final, or, where the application\nfor legal aid is granted, the appointment of the lawyer by the competent\nauthority has taken effect.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should be able to provide that the costs relating to provisional legal\naid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and costs relating to provisional\nlegal aid for requested persons can be recovered from those persons if, in the\nsubsequent assessment of whether they have a right to legal aid, they are found\nto not meet the criteria to benefit from legal aid under national law.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the effective\naccess to a lawyer in the executing Member State for requested persons, Member\nStates should ensure that such persons have access to legal aid until the\nsurrender, or, in cases of non-surrender, until the decision on surrender has\nbecome final. The right to legal aid may be subject to an assessment of the\nmeans of the requested person and/or whether it is in the interests of justice\nto provide legal aid, according to the applicable eligibility criteria in the\nexecuting Member State in question.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that requested\npersons can effectively exercise their right to appoint a lawyer in the issuing Member State to assist the lawyer in the\nexecuting Member State, in accordance with Directive 2013/48/EU, the issuing\nMember State should ensure that requested persons have access to legal aid for\nthe purpose of the European arrest warrant proceedings in the executing Member\nState. This right may be subject to an assessment of\nthe means of the requested person and/or whether it is in the interests of\njustice to provide legal aid, according to the applicable eligibility criteria\nin the issuing Member State in question.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective provides for the right to provisional legal aid for children deprived\nof liberty and to legal aid for children that are requested in European arrest\nwarrant proceedings.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\nimplementing this Directive, Member States should ensure the respect of the\nfundamental right of legal aid as provided for in Articles 47(3) of the Charter\nand Article 6(3)(c) ECHR and ensure that legal aid is available to those who do\nnot have sufficient resources to pay for legal assistance when the interest of\njustice so requires. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nMember States should collect data showing how the right to legal aid for\nsuspects or accused persons and requested persons have been accessed. Member\nStates should also collect data on the number of cases where provisional legal\naid was provided for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty, as well\nas for requested persons, and the number of cases where this right was not\nexercised. Such data should include the number of requests for legal aid in European\narrest warrant proceedings when the Member State acts as issuing and executing\nState, as well as the number of cases where these requests were granted. Data\non the costs for providing provisional legal aid for persons deprived of\nliberty and for requested persons should also be collected.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective should apply to suspects or accused persons regardless of their legal\nstatus, citizenship or nationality.This Directive upholds the fundamental\nrights and principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the\nEuropean Union and the European Convention on Human Rights, including the\nprohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, the right to\nliberty and security, respect for private and family life, the right to the\nintegrity of the person, the rights of the child, integration of persons with\ndisabilities, the right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial,\nthe presumption of innocence and the rights of the defence. This Directive should\nbe implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective sets minimum rules. Member States may extend the rights set out in\nthis Directive in order to provide a higher level of protection. Such higher\nlevel of protection should not constitute an obstacle to the mutual recognition\nof judicial decisions that those minimum rules are designed to facilitate. The\nlevel of protection should never fall below the standards provided by the\nCharter or the ECHR, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court of Justice and\nof the ECtHR.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe objectives of this Directive, namely setting common\nminimum rules for the right to legal aid for suspects or accused persons in\ncriminal proceedings, cannot be sufficiently achieved\nby the Member States and can, by reason of the scale of the measure, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with\nArticles 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland\nin respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty\non European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nthose Member States have notified their wish to participate in the adoption and\napplication of this Directive] OR [In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol\n21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of\nFreedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and\nto the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to\nArticle 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the\nadoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to its\napplication][17].\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the\nadoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its\napplication,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1 \nSubject-matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive lays down minimum\nrules concerning:\n(a) the right to\nprovisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings who\nare deprived of liberty, and \n(b) the right\nto provisional legal aid and to legal aid for requested persons who are subject\nto European arrest warrant proceedings.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive complements\nDirective 2013/48/EU.
