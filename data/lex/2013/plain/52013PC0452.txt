Those instruments need to be aligned by a\nseparate proposal as they were adopted under a legal\nbasis pursuant to Title V part III of the TFEU and therefore do not bind all\nMember States, and are thus irreconcilable with the legal bases of the other\nbasic acts.\nThe approach followed in this proposal is the\nsame as the one followed in the preceding proposal. Accordingly, the present\nframework regulation provides that where legal acts listed in the annex provide\nfor the use of Article 5a of the Comitology Decision, the Commission is\nempowered to adopt delegated acts.\nAdaptation to the delegated act regime will\nnot affect pending procedures in which an opinion has already been delivered by\na committee in accordance with the Comitology Decision.\nBasic acts which are adapted to the\ndelegated acts regime are listed in the annex of the proposal.\n2013/0220 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nadapting to Article 290 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union a number of legal acts in the area of\nJustice providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nTreaty of Lisbon introduced the possibility for the legislator to delegate\npower to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nmeasures which can be covered by delegations of powers, as referred to in\nArticle 290(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\ncorrespond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with\nscrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers\nconferred on the Commission[3]. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to adapt\nto Article 290 of the TFEU legal\nacts already in force which make use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should not\naffect pending procedures in which the committee has already delivered its\nopinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC before the entry\ninto force of this Regulation.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the Commission\nprepares delegated acts on the basis of the legal acts adapted by this\nRegulation, it is of particular importance that it carry out appropriate\nconsultations, including at expert level. The\nCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,\ntimely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European\nParliament and to the Council.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by the legal acts referred to in the annex and therefore take\npart in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of the Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not take part in the\nadoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its\napplication,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nWhere the legal\nacts listed in the Annex to this Regulation provide for the use of the\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5a(1) to (4) of\nDecision 1999/468/EC, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts\nin accordance with Article 2 of this Regulation.\nArticle 2\n1.
