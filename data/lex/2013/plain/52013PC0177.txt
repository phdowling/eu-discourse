When goods destined for a third country\nleave Swiss customs territory through the customs territory of the European\nUnion, the security data contained in the declaration must be transmitted to\nthe export office within the European Union. The same procedure in reverse\napplies for goods leaving the European Union through an office of exit in\nSwitzerland. \nThe Joint Committee set up under Article\n19(1) of the Agreement is responsible for the administration and proper\nimplementation of the Agreement. The Committee may determine cases in which\ntransmission of the security information is not necessary. This exemption may\nbe granted only if it does not affect the level of security assured by the\nAgreement. This draft decision of the EU-Switzerland Joint Committee proposes\nan exemption from transmitting security data for some indirect exports made by\nair. The condition that security levels must be maintained is considered to be\nmet because, prior to loading, air carriers subject the whole of an aircraft's\ncargo to the security checks set out in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention on\nInternational Civil Aviation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation\nof interested parties\nThe Swiss\ncustoms authorities have approved the Joint Committee's draft decision \nImpact\nAssessment\nThere is no\nneed for an impact assessment
