It\r\nalso intends to align Directive 97/23/EC to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December\r\n2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures[1].\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alignment to Decision No\r\n768/2008/EC: \nUnion (EU) harmonisation legislation\r\nensuring the free movement of products has contributed considerably to the\r\ncompletion and operation of the Single Market. It is based on a high level of\r\nprotection and provides economic operators with the means to demonstrate\r\nconformity, thus ensuring free movement through trust in the products. \nDirective 97/23/EC is an example of that\r\nUnion harmonisation legislation, ensuring the free movement of pressure\r\nequipment. It sets out essential safety requirements that pressure equipment\r\nand assemblies must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market.\r\nManufacturers must demonstrate that pressure equipment has been designed and\r\nmanufactured in compliance with the essential safety requirements and affix the\r\nCE marking. \nExperience with the implementation of Union\r\nharmonisation legislation has shown \u2013 on a cross-sector scale - certain\r\nweaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this\r\nlegislation, leading to:\n\u2013     \r\nthe presence of non-compliant or dangerous\r\nproducts on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking;\n\u2013     \r\ncompetitive disadvantages for economic operators\r\ncomplying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules;\n\u2013     \r\nunequal treatment in the case of non-compliant\r\nproducts and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to\r\ndifferent enforcement practices;\n\u2013     \r\ndiffering practices in the designation of\r\nconformity assessment bodies by national authorities;\n\u2013     \r\nproblems with the quality of certain notified\r\nbodies.\nFurthermore the regulatory environment has\r\nbecome more and more complex, as frequently several pieces of legislation apply\r\nsimultaneously to one and the same product. Inconsistencies in these pieces of\r\nlegislation make it increasingly difficult for economic operators and\r\nauthorities to correctly interpret and apply that legislation.\nTo remedy these horizontal shortcomings in\r\nUnion harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the\r\n\u2018New Legislative Framework\u2019 was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package.\r\nIts objective is to strengthen and complete the\r\nexisting rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and\r\nenforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary\r\ninstruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market\r\nsurveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for\r\nthe marketing of products (hereinafter NLF Decision).\nThe NLF Regulation has introduced rules on\r\naccreditation (a tool for the evaluation of competence of conformity assessment\r\nbodies) and requirements for the organisation and performance of market\r\nsurveillance and controls of products from third countries. Since 1 January\r\n2010 these rules apply directly in all Member States.\nThe NLF Decision sets out a common\r\nframework for EU product harmonisation legislation. This framework consists of\r\nthe provisions which are commonly used in EU product legislation (e.g. definitions,\r\nobligations of economic operators, notified bodies, safeguard mechanisms, etc.).\r\nThese common provisions have been reinforced to ensure that the directives can\r\nbe applied and enforced more effectively in practice. New elements, such as\r\nobligations on importers, have been introduced, which are crucial for improving\r\nthe safety of products on the market. \nThe provisions of the NLF Decision and\r\nthose of the NLF Regulation are complementary and closely interlinked. The NLF\r\nDecision contains the corresponding obligations for economic operators and\r\nnotified bodies allowing market surveillance authorities and authorities\r\nresponsible for notified bodies to properly perform the tasks imposed on them\r\nby the NLF Regulation and to ensure an effective and consistent enforcement of\r\nEU product legislation. \nHowever, unlike the NLF Regulation, the\r\nprovisions of the NLF Decision are not directly applicable. To ensure that all\r\neconomic sectors subject to Union harmonisation legislation benefit from the\r\nimprovements of the NLF, the provisions of the NLF Decision need to be\r\nintegrated into the existing product legislation.\nThe Commission has already proposed the\r\nalignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF\r\nimplementation package adopted on 21 November 2011[2]. \nIn view of ensuring consistency across\r\nUnion harmonisation legislation for industrial products, it is necessary to\r\nalign Directive 97/23/EC to the provisions of the NLF Decision.\nThe proposal also takes into account the proposal\r\nof the Commission of 13 February 2013 for a Regulation on market surveillance\r\nof products[3].\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alignment to Regulation (EC) No\r\n1272/2008: \nRegulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (hereinafter\r\nCLP Regulation), implements within the Union the Globally Harmonised System of\r\nClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) that has been adopted at the\r\ninternational level, within the structure of the United Nations.\nDirective 97/23/EC provides, in Article 9, for\r\na classification of pressure equipment in categories, according to the ascending\r\nlevel of risk due to pressure. While the\r\nclassification of pressure equipment under the Directive is mainly based on the\r\ntotal energetic content (pressure and volume of the pressure equipment), it is\r\nalso influenced by the classification (dangerous or not) of the fluid it\r\ncontains.\nThe classification of\r\npressure equipment into categories is directly related to the conformity\r\nassessment procedure applied in order to verify the conformity of the pressure equipment\r\nto the essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC. In particular, the\r\nconformity assessment procedure to be applied is determined by the category, as\r\ndefined in Article 9, in which the equipment is classified.\nThe classification of\r\nthe fluids contained in the pressure equipment for the purposes of the\r\nclassification of the pressure equipment in view of its conformity assessment, is\r\nbased on Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967\r\non the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions\r\nrelating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances[4].\nAccording to Article 9 of Directive\r\n97/23/EC, the \u2018fluids\u2019 are divided into two groups. Group 1 comprises the\r\nfollowing \u2018dangerous fluids\u2019[5],\r\nas classified on the basis of their intrinsic properties and the degree and\r\nspecific nature of the hazards involved in Directive 67/548/EEC: explosive,\r\nextremely flammable, highly flammable, flammable, very toxic, toxic and oxidising.\r\nGroup 2 comprises all other fluids not referred to in Directive 97/23/EC as\r\n\u2018dangerous\u2019.\nTo take account of the pressure hazards\r\nassociated with dangerous fluids, the conformity assessment requirements of\r\nDirective 97/23/EC are more stringent for pressure equipment containing Group 1\r\nfluids than for pressure equipment containing Group 2 fluids.\nAccording to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, Directive\r\n67/548/EEC will be repealed on 1 June 2015 and replaced by the Regulation. That\r\nRegulation introduces new hazard classes and categories only partially\r\ncorresponding to those used under the current provisions.\nThe fluid classification criteria of Directive\r\n97/23/EC must therefore be aligned to the classification criteria of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1272/2008 until 1 June 2015, while maintaining the existing levels of\r\nprotection of the Directive.\nThe alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the\r\nCLP Regulation requires therefore redefining what constitutes a \u2018dangerous\r\nfluid\u2019 in the terms of the new classification introduced by the Regulation.\nThe need to align the fluid classification\r\ncriteria of Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation is therefore a direct consequence\r\nof implementing the CLP Regulation in the Union, which requires all downstream\r\nlegislation to be aligned to the CLP Regulation at the latest by the date on\r\nwhich Directive 67/548/EEC will be repealed (1 June 2015).\nAlthough the two classification systems provided\r\nby the CLP Regulation and Directive 67/548/EEC are similar, there is no perfect\r\nmatch. Some substances are classified differently under the CLP Regulation than\r\nunder Directive 67/548/EEC due to changes in the classification criteria or\r\ncut-off values. A change in the classification of the fluid (substance or preparation)\r\ncontained in the pressure equipment may therefore result in a change of the\r\nclassification of the pressure equipment itself (categories of pressure\r\nequipment).\nDirective 97/23/EC provides for four\r\ncategories of pressure equipment, according to the ascending pressure related\r\nhazard. For each category of pressure equipment, the Directive provides for a\r\nset of conformity assessment procedures. Pressure equipment must be subject to\r\none of the conformity assessment procedures which may be chosen by the\r\nmanufacturer among those laid down for the category in which the pressure equipment\r\nis classified. The manufacturer may also choose to apply one of the procedures\r\nwhich apply to a higher category, if available. \nThe change in category under Directive\r\n97/23/EC is having an impact only on the conformity assessment procedure and\r\nnot on the design or manufacturing of the pressure equipment itself. If pressure\r\nequipment is classified in a higher category due to the fluid it contains, it\r\nmay result in a more demanding and more expensive conformity assessment\r\nprocedure.\nAs the current\r\nprovision[6]\r\nrelated to the classification of pressure equipment based also on the characteristics\r\nof the fluid it contains is considered satisfactory, Directive 97/23/EC should\r\nbe aligned to the CLP Regulation while maintaining the current scope in\r\nrelation to the hazards due to the fluids. The new classification of the fluids\r\nshould therefore match as close as possible the current classification based on\r\nDirective 67/548/EEC. \nThe proposed alignment\r\nis therefore a technical alignment primarily designed to minimize the impact of\r\nthe changes in the classification system of the fluids introduced by the CLP\r\nRegulation on the classification of the pressure equipment itself. \nConsistency with other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThis initiative is in\r\nline with the Single Market Act[7],\r\nwhich stressed the need to restore consumer confidence in the quality of\r\nproducts on the market and the importance of reinforcing market surveillance.\nFurthermore it supports\r\nthe Commission\u2019s policy on Better Regulation and simplification of the\r\nregulatory environment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES\r\nAND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nConsultation of interested parties\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The alignment of Directive\r\n97/23/EC to the NLF Decision has been discussed with national experts\r\nresponsible for the implementation of the Directive, the conformity assessment\r\nbodies\u2019 forum, the administrative cooperation group on market surveillance as\r\nwell as in bilateral contacts with industry associations. \nFrom June to October 2010 a public\r\nconsultation was organised that comprised all the sectors involved in this\r\ninitiative. It consisted of four targeted questionnaires for economic\r\noperators, authorities, conformity assessment bodies and users and the\r\nCommission services received 300 replies. The results are published at: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/internal-market-for-products/new-legislative-framework/index_en.htm\nIn addition to the general consultation a\r\nspecific SME consultation was carried out. 603 SMEs were consulted through the\r\nEnterprise Europe Network in May/June 2010. The results are available at http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/files/new-legislative-framework/smes_statistics_en.pdf\nThe consultation process revealed\r\nwidespread support for the initiative. There is unanimity on the need to improve\r\nmarket surveillance and the system for assessing and monitoring conformity assessment\r\nbodies. Authorities fully support the exercise because it will strengthen the\r\nexisting system and improve cooperation at EU level. Industry expects a more\r\nlevel playing field resulting from more effective actions against products that\r\ndo not comply with the legislation, as well as a simplification effect from the\r\nalignment of legislation. Certain concerns were expressed on some obligations\r\nwhich are, however, indispensable for increasing the efficiency of market\r\nsurveillance. These measures will not entail significant costs for industry and\r\nthe benefits resulting from improved market surveillance should by far outweigh\r\nthe costs. \nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nalignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation has been discussed with\r\nnational experts responsible for the implementation of the Directive, the conformity\r\nassessment bodies\u2019 forum, the administrative cooperation group as well as in\r\nbilateral contacts with industry associations. \nAn impact assessment study on the alignment\r\nof Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation was conducted in 2012.\nIn the context of this study, a survey was\r\norganised amongst key stakeholders. The Commission organised a workshop on 7\r\nNovember 2012 in order to collect further information and to allow direct\r\ninteraction with stakeholders. The workshop was attended by representatives of\r\nnational authorities, user and manufacturer associations, conformity assessment\r\nbodies, standardisers and experts in the field of the CLP Regulation.\nCollection and use of expertise - Impact\r\nassessment \na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment concerning\r\nthe alignment to the NLF Decision\nIn addition to the general impact\r\nassessment for the New Legislative Framework, an impact assessment was conducted\r\nfor the NLF implementation package adopted in November 2011. That impact\r\nassessment covered also the alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the NLF Decision\r\nand was largely built on the general impact assessment carried out for\r\nthe New Legislative Framework. In addition to the expertise collected and\r\nanalysed in that context, further consultation of the sector-specific experts\r\nand interest groups, as well as horizontal experts active in the area of\r\ntechnical harmonisation, conformity assessment, accreditation and market\r\nsurveillance, has taken place.\nBased on the information collected, the\r\nCommission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three\r\noptions.\nOption 1 - No changes to the current\r\nsituation\nThis option proposes no changes to the current\r\ndirective and relies exclusively on certain improvements that can be expected\r\nfrom the NLF Regulation.\nOption 2 \u2013 Alignment to the NLF Decision\r\nby non-legislative measures\nOption 2 considers the possibility of\r\nencouraging a voluntary alignment to the provisions set out in the NLF Decision\r\nby, e.g., presenting them as best practices in guidance documents.\nOption 3 \u2013 Alignment to the NLF Decision\r\nby legislative measures\nThis option consists in integrating the\r\nprovisions of the NLF Decision into Directive 97/23/EC.\nOption 3 was\r\nfound to be the preferred option because:\n\u2013     \r\nit will improve the competitiveness of companies\r\nand conformity assessment bodies taking their obligations seriously;\n\u2013     \r\nit will improve the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers\r\nand distributors, as well as conformity assessment bodies;\n\u2013     \r\nit does not entail significant costs for\r\neconomic operators and conformity assessment bodies; for those who are already\r\nacting responsibly, no extra costs or only negligible costs are expected;\n\u2013     \r\nit is considered more effective than option 2:\r\ndue to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the\r\npositive impacts would materialise under that option;\n\u2013     \r\noptions 1 and 2 do not provide answers to the\r\nproblem of inconsistencies in the regulatory framework and therefore have no\r\npositive impact on the simplification of the regulatory environment.\nAs outlined above in option 3, the\r\nalignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the NLF Decision will lead to a better\r\nimplementation of the Directive. \nThe proposal includes:\n\u00b7              \r\nMeasures to address the problem of\r\nnon-compliance by clarifying the obligations of economic operators and\r\nrequiring enhanced traceability requirements. \n\u00b7              \r\nMeasures intended to ensure the quality of work\r\ndone by conformity assessment bodies by reinforcing the notification\r\nrequirements, revised notification process, specifying requirements for\r\nnotifying authorities and more stringent information obligations.\n\u00b7              \r\nMeasures intended to ensure greater consistency\r\namongst Directives by aligning commonly used definitions and terminology and\r\naligning the conformity assessment procedures. \nThe impact of these measures will lead to\r\nstrengthening the competitiveness of European enterprises as a result of guaranteeing\r\na level playing field for the economic operators.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment concerning\r\nthe alignment to the CLP Regulation\nThe alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the\r\nCLP Regulation is a direct consequence of implementing the CLP Regulation in the\r\nUnion.\nIn particular, the classification of hazardous\r\nsubstances and mixtures is regulated at European level by the CLP Regulation\r\nwhich transposes the international Global Harmonised System (GHS) in the EU.\nTherefore, the objective of the alignment\r\nof Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation is to ensure legal coherence. Such\r\nan alignment requires only the modification of Article 9(2) of Directive\r\n97/23/EC. \nA non-alignment to the CLP Regulation would\r\nlead to legal uncertainty as from 1 June 2015, when Directive 67/548/EEC will\r\nbe repealed, because, as from this date, there would be no legal basis for the classification\r\nof pressure equipment based on the fluid it contains.\nThe evaluation study of Directive 97/23/EC\r\ncompleted in November 2012, concluded that there is no urgent need for a full\r\nrevision of Directive 97/23/EC. Better implementation of the Directive can be\r\nachieved by introducing the NLF provisions and by complementary measures such\r\nas improving the market surveillance. Additional studies should be conducted\r\nbefore preparing a full revision of the Directive, analysing e.g. issues\r\nrelated to the scope, technical provisions related to the essential safety\r\nrequirements, etc\u2026 It also confirmed that the current classification mechanism\r\nof the pressure equipment provided for by the Directive and based also on the\r\nclassification of the fluid is satisfactory.\nThe proposed alignment options are the\r\nresult of a technical mapping of the current hazard classes of dangerous\r\nsubstances and preparations provided for by Directive 97/23/EC and based on\r\nDirective 67/548/EEC to the hazard classes for the classification of substances\r\nand mixtures classified as hazardous in accordance with the CLP Regulation. This\r\ntechnical mapping results to minimal changes to the existing classification\r\nsystem of pressure equipment provided for by Directive 97/23/EC.\nSimilar to the current provisions of\r\nDirective 97/23/EC, the proposal should therefore address the physical and\r\nhealth hazards due to the fluids contained in the pressure equipment, as far as\r\nrelevant for the classification of pressure equipment in view of its conformity\r\nassessment. \nFor most pressure equipment there will be\r\nno change of the classification of the equipment due to the alignment to the\r\nCLP Regulation. \nThe best possible mapping between Directive\r\n67/548/EEC and the CLP Regulation should be envisaged reducing the impact of\r\nthis change to the minimum. The technical detail of the alignment and the\r\noptions chosen on how to modify Article 9(2) of Directive 97/23/EC could lead\r\nto increasing or reducing the number of substances or mixtures included in Group\r\n1 of Directive 97/23/EC (the group which imposes more demanding requirements with\r\nregard to the conformity assessment procedures).\nThe impact of the various options has been\r\nanalysed in an impact assessment study on the alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to\r\nthe CLP Regulation, finalised in February 2013.\nIt results from the analysis that whilst\r\nthere will be changes in the terminology used to identify the hazards, only a\r\nsmall number of fluids will be classified in a different group under Directive\r\n97/23/EC possibly leading to a different classification of the pressure\r\nequipment itself. \nA possible change in the classification of\r\nthe fluids under Directive 97/23/EC does not always necessarily result in a different\r\nclassification of the pressure equipment itself since such classification of\r\nthe equipment depends not only on the nature of the fluid but also on the total\r\nenergetic content (based on the pressure and the volume of the equipment).\nIn particular, the transition from Directive\r\n67/548/EEC to the CLP Regulation for physical hazards is reasonably smooth as\r\nthere is a good matching between that Directive and the new classification\r\nunder the CLP Regulation. Only for a few substances the classification will\r\nchange because the CLP Regulation introduces new cut-off values for the\r\nflammability criteria.\nThe transition from Directive 67/548/EEC to\r\nthe CLP Regulation for the health hazards is more complex as the boundaries of\r\nsome categories do not always align with those of Directive 67/548/EEC, as the\r\nCLP Regulation introduces also new hazard classes and categories.\nIn particular, the hazard classes and\r\ncategories related to acute toxicity have been analysed more in detail with\r\nregard to their potential safety and economic impact.\nWith regard to the hazard classes for acute\r\ntoxicity, the findings can be summarized as follows:\n- the inclusion of the fluids that are\r\nclassified under the hazard classes acute oral toxicity category 1 and 2 in\r\nGroup 1 under Directive 97/23/EC will lead to a decrease in the number of fluids\r\n(in the meaning of substances or preparations) in Group 1. This option is\r\nsupported by the fact that the oral take-up of substances or mixtures due to\r\nfailure of pressure equipment cannot be excluded but the risk is very limited.\r\nThis option would therefore not cause an unacceptable safety risk. However, the\r\ninclusion of acute oral toxicity category 3 would lead to a substantial\r\nincrease in the number of fluids in Group 1, possibly resulting in a higher\r\ncategory of the equipment which may lead to an increase of the costs of the\r\nconformity assessment, without a substantial gain in the level of safety.\n- the inclusion of the fluids that are\r\nclassified under the hazard classes acute dermal toxicity category 1 and 2 will\r\nlead to a small decrease in the number of fluids (in the meaning of substances\r\nor preparations) in Group 1 under Directive 97/23/EC. This option is supported\r\nby the fact that dermal contact with substances or mixtures due to failure of\r\npressure equipment cannot be excluded but the risk is rather limited and would\r\nnot cause an unacceptable safety risk. However, the inclusion of acute dermal\r\ntoxicity category 3 would lead to a relatively small increase in the number of fluids\r\nin Group 1, without a substantial gain in the level of safety.\n- the inclusion of the fluids that are\r\nclassified under the hazard classes acute toxicity inhalation category 3 in\r\naddition to category 1 and 2 will lead to an increase of fluids (in the meaning\r\nof substances or preparations) in Group 1 under Directive 97/23/EC which is\r\njustified given the risk that might exist due to small leakages of fluids in\r\nthe pressure equipment.\nIn summary, for most of the fluids used in\r\npressure equipment, there will be no change in the classification of the\r\nequipment due to the alignment to the CLP Regulation. For a limited number of\r\nfluids, used in a limited number of applications, the alignment to the CLP\r\nRegulation may lead to a different classification of the equipment and may\r\ninfluence the cost for the conformity assessment process.\nThe impact assessment study concluded that the\r\nimpact of the proposed alignment would be limited and in particular that the\r\noverall economic impact will be low considering that the proposed alignment\r\noptions are aiming at the best possible mapping between the current\r\nclassification (based on Directive 67/548/EEC) and the future one (based on the\r\nCLP Regulation).\nBased on the number of substances that\r\nwould be subject to a different classification and the proportion of\r\nmanufacturers that would be affected, the impact assessment study estimates the\r\noverall costs of aligning Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation to be of the\r\norder of 8,5 million euros per year. The cost is due to the changes in the\r\nalignment for the health hazard classes.\nHowever, looking at the current compliance\r\ncosts, and according to the impact assessment study, the total average cost of\r\nthe conformity assessment for the pressure equipment covered by Directive\r\n97/23/EC is estimated at 236,3 million euros per year. \nTherefore, the incremental cost due to the alignment\r\nof Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation is low compared to the total cost\r\nfor conformity assessment. However, the implementation of the CLP Regulation in\r\nthe Union is mandatory and the cost cannot be avoided.\nThe impact assessment study is available\r\nat: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/pressure-and-gas/documents/ped/index_en.htm\nOn the basis of the above, the Commission concluded\r\nthat:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no alternative course\r\nof action because all downstream legislation which is using classification of\r\nchemical substances has to be aligned to the CLP Regulation, which is the European\r\nUnion initiative transposing the international Global Harmonised System (GHS)\r\nin the EU. The current legal basis for the classification of substances and\r\npreparations, referred to in Article 9(2.1) of Directive 97/23/EC, namely\r\nDirective 67/548/EEC, will be repealed on 1 June 2015. By that time, Directive\r\n97/23/EC should be modified and refer to the CLP Regulation for the purpose of the\r\nclassification of pressure equipment within its scope. The proposed alignment\r\nis therefore a technical alignment which is primarily designed to minimize the\r\nimpact of the changes in the classification system of the pressure equipment\r\nitself and to guarantee legal certainty as from 1 June 2015.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The impact assessment study did\r\nnot identify significant economic or health related impacts.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main elements of the proposal\n3.1. Horizontal definitions\nThe proposal\r\nintroduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout\r\nUnion harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent\r\nmeaning throughout that legislation. \n3.2. Obligations of economic operators\r\nand traceability requirements\nThe proposal clarifies the obligations of\r\nmanufacturers and authorised representatives and introduces obligations for\r\nimporters and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has\r\ncarried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a\r\ntechnical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that\r\nthis technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request.\r\nFurthermore importers must verify that pressure equipment is correctly marked\r\nand accompanied by the instructions and safety information. They must keep a\r\ncopy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on\r\nthe product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying\r\ndocumentation. Distributors must verify that pressure equipment bears the CE\r\nmarking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and\r\nthat it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions.\nImporters and distributors must cooperate\r\nwith market surveillance authorities and take appropriate actions when they\r\nhave supplied non-compliant pressure equipment.\nEnhanced traceability obligations are introduced for all economic operators. Pressure equipment has\r\nto bear the manufacturer\u2019s name and address and a number allowing to identify\r\nand link the pressure equipment to its technical documentation. When pressure\r\nequipment is imported the importer\u2019s name and address must also be on the\r\npressure equipment. Furthermore every economic operator must be able to\r\nidentify towards authorities the economic operator who has supplied him with\r\npressure equipment or to whom he has supplied pressure equipment.\n3.3. Harmonised standards\nCompliance with harmonised standards\r\nprovides for a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October\r\n2012 on European Standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and\r\n93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC,\r\n2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No\r\n1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] sets out a horizontal legal\r\nframework for European standardisation. The Regulation contains inter alia\r\nprovisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European\r\nStandardisation Organisation, on the procedure for objections to harmonised\r\nstandards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently,\r\nit repealed Article 6 of Directive 97/23/EC covering the same aspects. The\r\nprovision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been\r\nmodified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards\r\nonly partially cover the essential requirements. \n3.4. Conformity assessment and CE marking\nDirective 97/23/EC has selected the\r\nappropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply\r\nin order to demonstrate that their pressure equipment complies with the\r\nessential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their\r\nupdated versions set out in the NLF Decision. \nGeneral principles of the CE marking are\r\nset out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, while the detailed\r\nprovisions on the affixing of the CE marking to pressure equipment have been\r\ninserted in this proposal.\n3.5. Conformity assessment bodies\nThe proposal reinforces the notification\r\ncriteria for conformity assessment bodies, namely notified bodies but also\r\nrecognised third-party organisations and user inspectorates. It clarifies that\r\nsubsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification\r\nrequirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced\r\nand the procedure for notification of notified bodies and user inspectorates\r\nand for designation of recognised third-party organisations is revised. The\r\ncompetence of conformity assessment bodies must be demonstrated by an\r\naccreditation certificate. Where accreditation has not been used to evaluate\r\nthe competence of a conformity assessment body, the notification must comprise\r\nthe documentation demonstrating how the competence of that body has been\r\nevaluated. Member States will have the possibility to object to a notification.\n3.6. Market surveillance and the\r\nsafeguard clause procedure\nOn 13 February 2013, the Commission adopted\r\na proposal for a Regulation on market surveillance of products, which intends\r\nto set out a single legal instrument on the market surveillance activities in\r\nthe field of non-food goods, consumer or non-consumer products and products\r\ncovered or not by Union harmonisation legislation. The proposal merges the\r\nrules on market surveillance of Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety[9], Regulation (EC) No 765/2008\r\nand sector- specific harmonisation legislation in order to increase the\r\neffectiveness of market surveillance activities within the Union. The proposed\r\nRegulation covers also the reference provisions on market surveillance and\r\nsafeguard clauses contained in the NLF Decision. Therefore, provisions in\r\nexisting Union harmonisation legislation that relate to market surveillance and\r\nsafeguard clauses should be removed from that harmonisation legislation.\nThe overarching objective of the proposed\r\nRegulation is to simplify the Union market surveillance framework fundamentally\r\nso that it works better for its main users: market surveillance authorities and\r\neconomic operators. This will result in a better implementation of the market\r\nsurveillance rules across Member States, providing better protection for\r\nconsumers and other users, reduced administrative burdens and enhanced\r\ninformation and work-sharing between market surveillance authorities.\nIn this framework, the proposed Regulation\r\nwill lead to a better implementation of Directive 97/23/EC, which covers\r\nconsumer and non-consumer products, and to an improved competitiveness\r\nframework in the internal market.\nOn this basis, the proposal does not\r\ninclude provisions on market surveillance and safeguard clause procedures, but in\r\norder to ensure legal clarity, it makes a reference to the proposed Regulation\r\non market surveillance of products. \n3.7. Classification of pressure\r\nequipment\nThe proposal modifies Article 9(2) of\r\nDirective 97/23/EC so as to align, for purposes related to the conformity\r\nassessment of the pressure equipment, the current classification of fluids\r\ncontained in the equipment and which is based on the classification of dangerous\r\nsubstances and preparations provided for by Directive 67/548/EEC, to the new\r\nclassification of hazardous substances and mixtures provided for by the CLP Regulation.\n3.8. Comitology and delegated acts\nThe provisions on the operation of the\r\nCommittee on Pressure Equipment have been adapted to the new rules on delegated\r\nacts laid down in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and to\r\nthe new provisions on implementing acts laid down in Regulation (EU) No\r\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[10].\n4. legal elements of the proposal\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe internal market is a competence that is\r\nshared between the Union and the Member States. The subsidiarity principle\r\narises in particular with regard to the newly added provisions aiming at the\r\nimprovement of effective enforcement of Directive 97/23/EC, namely, the\r\nimporter and distributor obligations, the traceability provisions, the\r\nprovisions on the assessment and notification of conformity assessment bodies,\r\nand the enhanced cooperation obligations in the context of the revised market\r\nsurveillance and safeguard procedures. \nExperience with the enforcement of the\r\nlegislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to\r\ndivergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside\r\nthe EU, which undermines the objective of this directive. If actions are taken\r\nat national level to address the problems, this risks creating obstacles to the\r\nfree movement of goods. Furthermore action at national level is limited to the\r\nterritorial competence of a Member State. In view of the increasing\r\ninternationalisation of trade, the number of cross-border cases is constantly\r\nrising. Coordinated action at EU level can much better achieve the objectives\r\nset, and will in particular render market surveillance more effective. Hence it\r\nis more appropriate to take action at EU level.\nAs regards the problem of inconsistencies\r\nthroughout the directives, this is a problem which can only be solved by the EU\r\nlegislator.\nIn accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, the modifications to be proposed will not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives set.\nProportionality\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives set. \nThe new or modified obligations do not\r\nimpose unnecessary burdens and costs on industry - especially on small and\r\nmedium sized enterprises - or administrations. Where modifications have been identified\r\nto have negative impacts, the analysis of the impacts of the option serves to\r\nprovide the most proportionate response to the problems identified. A number of\r\nmodifications concern the improvement of clarity of the existing Directive\r\nwithout introducing new requirements that entail added cost. \nLegislative technique used\nThe alignment to the NLF Decision and to\r\nthe CLP Regulation requires a number of substantive amendments to the\r\nprovisions of Directive 97/23/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text\r\nthe technique of recasting has been chosen in line with the Inter-institutional\r\nAgreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting\r\ntechnique for legal acts[11].\r\n\nThe changes made to the provisions of\r\nDirective 97/23/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic\r\noperators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the\r\ndeclaration of conformity, CE marking, conformity assessment bodies, the\r\nsafeguard clause procedure, the conformity assessment procedures and the\r\nclassification of the fluids.\nThe proposal does not change the scope of\r\nDirective 97/23/EC and the essential safety requirements. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis proposal does not have any\r\nimplications for the EU budget.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nRepeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the proposal will lead to\r\nrepeal of Directive 97/23/EC as from 1 June 2015.\nIn particular, in order to ensure the\r\nsimultaneous and coherent implementation of the alignment of Directive 97/23/EC\r\nto Decision 768/2008/EC and to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, the proposal\r\nprovides that the new Directive will apply as from 1 June 2015.\nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposal concerns the EEA and should\r\ntherefore be extended to the European Economic Area.\n\u00ea 97/23/EC\r\n(adapted)\n2013/0221 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the approximation \u00d6 harmonisation \u00d5 of the laws of\r\nthe Member States concerning\r\n\u00d6 relating\r\nto making available on the market of \u00d5 pressure\r\nequipment\n(Recast)\r\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European\r\nCommunity \u00d6 on\r\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 and in\r\nparticular Article 100a\r\n\u00d6 114 \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposals from the European\r\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997 on the\r\napproximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment[13] has been substantially amended\r\nseveral times.

General principles governing\r\nthe CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 765/2008.

It is, however, essential that all conformity assessment\r\nbodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair\r\ncompetition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for\r\nconformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide\r\nconformity assessment services.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure a consistent level of conformity assessment quality, it is also\r\nnecessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies\r\ninvolved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of conformity\r\nassessment bodies.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If\r\na conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid\r\ndown in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the\r\ncorresponding requirements set out in this Directive.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nsystem set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation\r\nsystem provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an\r\nessential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it\r\nshould also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparent\r\naccreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the\r\nnecessary level of confidence in conformity certificates, should be considered\r\nby the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means\r\nof demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies.\r\nHowever, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate\r\nmeans of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to\r\nensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other\r\nnational authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member\r\nStates with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of\r\nthe conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory\r\nrequirements.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conformity assessment bodies frequently\r\nsubcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or\r\nhave recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection\r\nrequired for the pressure\r\nequipment to be placed on the\r\nUnion market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and\r\nsubsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the\r\nperformance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the\r\nassessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and\r\nthe monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by\r\nsubcontractors and subsidiaries. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification\r\nprocedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable\r\nonline notification.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\r\nconformity assessment bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it\r\nis appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the\r\nopportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore\r\nimportant to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the\r\ncompetence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start\r\noperating as notified bodies.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that conformity assessment\r\nbodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary\r\nburdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal\r\ntreatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of\r\nthe conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be\r\nachieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between conformity\r\nassessment bodies.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\r\nStates should take all appropriate measures to ensure that pressure equipment\r\nmay be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their\r\nintended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen,\r\nthey do not endanger the health and safety of persons.

In choosing the most appropriate\r\nsolutions, the manufacturer must \u00d6 shall \u00d5 apply the\r\nprinciples set out below in the following order:\n\u2013                        \r\neliminate or reduce hazards \u00d6 risks \u00d5 as far as is\r\nreasonably practicable,;\n\u2013                        \r\napply appropriate protection measures against hazards\r\n\u00d6 risks \u00d5 which cannot\r\nbe eliminated,;\n\u2013                        \r\nwhere appropriate, inform users of residual hazards\r\n\u00d6 risks \u00d5 and indicate\r\nwhether it is necessary to take appropriate special measures to reduce the\r\nrisks at the time of installation and/or use.\n1.3. Where the potential for misuse is\r\nknown or can be clearly foreseen, the pressure equipment must \u00d6 shall \u00d5 be designed to\r\nprevent danger from such misuse or, if that is not possible, adequate warning\r\ngiven that the pressure equipment must \u00d6 shall \u00d5 not be used in\r\nthat way.\n2. DESIGN\n2.1. General\nThe pressure equipment must \u00d6 shall \u00d5 be properly\r\ndesigned taking all relevant factors into account in order to ensure that the\r\nequipment will be safe throughout its intended life.\nThe design must \u00d6 shall \u00d5 incorporate\r\nappropriate safety coefficients using comprehensive methods which are known to\r\nincorporate adequate safety margins against all relevant failure modes in a\r\nconsistent manner.\n2.2. Design for adequate strength\n2.2.1.
