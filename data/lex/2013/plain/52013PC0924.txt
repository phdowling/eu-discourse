Negotiations with Vietnam were launched in Hanoi in November 2007. Both sides\r\ninitialled the PCA in Brussels on 4 October 2010. The PCA was signed in Brussels on 27\r\nJune 2012. \nThe PCA with Vietnam will supersede the\r\ncurrent legal framework of the 1995 Agreement between the European Community\r\nand Vietnam and the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic\r\nCommunity and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), which was extended in 1999 to include Vietnam. \nThe PCA with Vietnam constitutes an\r\nimportant step towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in\r\n South-East Asia. It covers the EU\u2019s standard political clauses on human rights,\r\nInternational Criminal Court, weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light\r\nweapons and counter-terrorism. \nThe PCA strengthens the sectoral\r\ncooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as taxation, migration,\r\nhealth, environment, climate change, energy, education and culture, labour,\r\nemployment and social affairs, science and technology and transport. It also addresses\r\nlegal cooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime\r\nand corruption, and covers areas of particular interest to Vietnam such as cooperation\r\non human rights and the rule of law, remnants of war and natural disaster\r\nprevention. \nThe PCA provides the basis for more\r\neffective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Vietnam in the development, trade and economic fields and will facilitate the conclusion of a Free\r\nTrade Agreement with Vietnam. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the\r\nEU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political\r\nframework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries.\nThe Commission notes that Council Decision\r\nNo 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines is the subject of Court\r\nCase C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul this Decision insofar as\r\nthe Council had added legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100\r\nTFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4)\r\nTFEU). Council Decision No 2012/279/EU on the signature of the PCA Vietnam\r\nraises, mutatis mutandis, the same legal issues as Council Decision No 2012/272/EU\r\non the signature of the PCA Philippines. Court Case C-377/12 is therefore of\r\nrelevance to the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA with\r\n  Vietnam too. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a\r\nCouncil Decision on the conclusion of the PCA Vietnam is based on Articles 207,\r\n209 and 218(6).\nThe Commission draws the attention of the\r\nCouncil to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of\r\nthe UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The\r\naddition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on\r\nthe outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice,\r\nthis recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The\r\nCommission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure\r\nfor conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised.\n2013/0440 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Framework\r\nAgreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European\r\nUnion and its Member States, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of\r\nViet Nam, of the other part\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 207 and 209, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nCouncil Decision No 2012/279/EU[1],\r\nthe Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between\r\nthe European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, of the other part was signed on 27 June 2012, subject to\r\nits conclusion at a later date.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement should be\r\napproved on behalf of the European Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Framework Agreement\r\non Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its\r\n Member States, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, of the\r\nother part is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. \nThe text of the Agreement is attached to\r\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall chair the Joint Committee provided for\r\nin Article 52 of the Agreement.\nThe Union or, as the case may be, the Union\r\nand the Member States, shall be represented in the Joint Committee depending on\r\nthe subject matter.\nArticle 3\nThe President of the Council shall\r\ndesignate the person empowered to give, on behalf of the European Union, the\r\nnotification provided for in Article 63(1) of the Agreement.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.
