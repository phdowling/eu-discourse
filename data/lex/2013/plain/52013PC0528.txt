The requests of the Canadian authorities are based on section 107.1 of the Customs\nAct, the Passenger Information (Customs) Regulations, paragraph 148(1)(d) of\nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Regulation 269 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.\nThis legislation aims at obtaining PNR data\nelectronically in advance of a flight's arrival and therefore significantly\nenhances the Canada Border Services Agency's ability to conduct efficient and\neffective advance risk assessment of passengers and to facilitate bona fide\ntravel, thereby enhancing the security of Canada. The European Union, in\ncooperating with Canada in the fight against terrorism and other serious\ntransnational crime, views the transfer of PNR data to Canada as fostering international police and judicial cooperation. This will be achieved\nthrough the sharing of analytical information containing PNR data obtained by Canada with competent police and judicial authorities of Member States, as well as with\nEuropol and Eurojust within their respective mandates.\nPNR is a record of each passenger's travel\nrequirements which contains all information necessary to enable reservations to\nbe processed and controlled by air carriers. \nAir carriers are under an obligation to\nprovide the Canada Border Services Agency with access to certain PNR data to\nthe extent it is collected and contained in the air carrier's automated\nreservation and departure control systems.\nThe data protection laws of the EU do not\nallow European and other carriers operating flights from the EU to transmit the\nPNR data of their passengers to third countries which do not ensure an adequate\nlevel of protection of personal data without adducing appropriate safeguards. A\nsolution is required that will provide the legal basis for the transfer of PNR\ndata from the EU to Canada as a recognition of the necessity and importance of\nthe use of PNR data in the fight against terrorism and other serious\ntransnational crime, whilst providing legal certainty for air carriers. In\naddition, this solution should be applied homogenously throughout the European\nUnion in order to ensure legal certainty for air carriers and respect of\nindividuals' rights to the protection of personal data as well as their physical\nsecurity.\nThe European Union concluded an agreement[1] in 2005 with Canada on the processing of PNR data based on a set of commitments by the Canada Border\nServices Agency in relation to the application of its PNR programme. The\ncommitments were annexed to a Commission Decision on the adequate protection of\npersonal data contained in the Passenger Name Record of air passengers\ntransferred to the Canada Border Services Agency. [2] Following the expiry of the\nCommission Decision in 2009, the Canada Border Services Agency unilaterally\nundertook to assure the EU that the commitments would continue in full force\nand effect until a new agreement applies.\nFollowing the entry into force of the\nLisbon Treaty, the European Parliament adopted a resolution[3] on 5 May 2010 in which it\nrequested a renegotiation of the Agreement on the basis of certain criteria.\nOn 21 September 2010, the Council received\na recommendation from the Commission to authorise the opening of negotiations\nfor an Agreement between the European Union and Canada for the transfer and use\nof PNR data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational\ncrime.\nOn 11 November 2010, the European\nParliament adopted a resolution[4]\non the recommendation from the Commission to the Council to authorise the\nopening of negotiations.\nOn 2 December 2010, the Council adopted a\nDecision, together with a negotiation directive, authorising the Commission to\nopen negotiations on behalf of the European Union. Following negotiations\nbetween the parties, the Agreement was initialled on 6 May 2013. \nThis Agreement takes into consideration and\nis consistent with the general criteria laid down in the Communication from the\nCommission on the Global Approach to the transfer of PNR data to third\ncountries[5]\nand the negotiating directives given by the Council. \nPNR has proven to be a very important tool\nin the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The Agreement secures several\nimportant safeguards for those persons whose data will be transferred and processed.\nIn particular, the purpose of processing of PNR data is strictly limited to\npreventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and\nserious transnational crime. The retention period of the PNR data is limited\nand the data will be depersonalised after a period of 30 days. Individuals are\nprovided with the right to access, correction, redress and information. The\ndata will be transferred using exclusively the 'push' method, under which air\ncarriers transfer (\u2018push\u2019) the required PNR data to the Canada Border Services\nAgency, thus allowing air carriers to retain control of what data is provided.\nThe use of sensitive data is limited to very exceptional cases and subject to\nstrict conditions and effective safeguards, including the approval by the President\nof the Canada Border Services Agency and the deletion of the data after a very\nshort timeframe. Oversight of Canada's compliance with these rules shall be\nexercised by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the Recourse Directorate of\nthe Canada Border Services Agency.\nArticle 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union states that the Council shall authorise the conclusion\nof international agreements.\nThe Commission therefore proposes to the\nCouncil to adopt a decision approving the conclusion of the Agreement between Canada and the European Union on the transfer and processing of Passenger Name Record data.\n2013/0250 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion of the Agreement between\n  Canada and the European Union on the transfer and processing of Passenger\nName Record data\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a),\nin conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[6],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 2 December 2010, the\nCouncil adopted a Decision, together with negotiation directives, authorising\nthe Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union with Canada for the transfer and use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to prevent and combat\nterrorism and other serious transnational crime.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Council\nDecision 2013/XXX of [][7]\nthe Agreement between Canada and the European Union on the transfer and\nprocessing of Passenger Name Record data was signed on \u2026 2013, subject to its\nconclusion at a later date.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agreement should be concluded.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Agreement respects\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to\nprivate and family life, recognised in Article 7 of the Charter, the right to\nthe protection of personal data, recognised in Article 8 of the Charter and the\nright to effective remedy and fair trial recognised by Article 47 of the\nCharter.
