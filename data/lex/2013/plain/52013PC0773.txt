Objective(s)\n1.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\u2019s\r\nmultiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \nThe negotiation and conclusion of fisheries agreements with third\r\ncountries meets the general objective of giving EU fishing vessels access to\r\nfishing zones under the jurisdiction of third countries and developing\r\npartnership with those countries with a view to strengthening the sustainable\r\nexploitation of fishery resources outside EU waters.\nThe Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) also ensure coherence\r\nbetween the principles governing the Common Fisheries Policy and the\r\ncommitments made under other European policies (sustainable use of\r\nthird-country resources, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)\r\nfishing, integration of partner countries into the global economy and better\r\npolitical and financial governance of fisheries).\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\r\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nSpecific Objective 1:\nTo contribute to sustainable fishing in non-EU waters, maintain a\r\nEuropean presence in distant-water fisheries and protect the interests of the\r\nEuropean fisheries sector and consumers by negotiating and concluding FPAs with\r\ncoastal states, consistent with other European policies.\nABM/ABB activity(ies)

for the period 2011-2013 will expire on 31 December 2013.\r\nThe new Protocol shall apply provisionally as from 1 January 2014. To secure\r\ncontinuity of fishing operations, a procedure for adoption by the Council of a\r\nDecision on the signing and provisional application of the Protocol has been\r\nlaunched in parallel with this procedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\r\nof the European fleet in the Union of the Comoros's fishing zone and will allow\r\nEuropean vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in\r\nthe Union of the Comoros's fishing zone. In addition,\r\nthe new Protocol enhances cooperation between the EU and the Union of the Comoros, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It\r\nprovides, in particular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the\r\nelectronic transmission of catch data. Sectoral support has been strengthened\r\nto help the Union of the Comoros to meet its international obligations in terms\r\nof the State's control of the port.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nAs regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow\r\nthe emergence of private agreements which would not guarantee sustainable\r\nfisheries. The EU also hopes that with this Protocol, the Union of the Comoros will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as regards the\r\nfight against illegal fishing.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe under-utilisation of the previous Protocol led the parties to\r\nreduce the fishing opportunities.
