Therefore, in 2006 the EU legislator established multiannual\nfunding for the Agency's action in the field of response to pollution caused by\nships for the period from 2007 to 2013[3].\nThis legislative proposal seeks to renew the multiannual funding for the period\nfrom 2014 to 2020 in the framework of the new financial perspectives[4].\n2.\nJUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED MEASURE\n2.1. Context\nThe large-scale maritime accident of the\noil tanker ERIKA in December 1999 involving an extensive oil spill led to the creation\nof the Agency in 2002. In the light of the oil spill caused by the accident of\nthe oil tanker PRESTIGE in November 2002, the Agency was entrusted with\nspecific tasks and obligations in the field of response to pollution caused by\nships. The Agency adopted an Action Plan in October 2004 for oil pollution\npreparedness and response (hereinafter \u201cthe Oil Action Plan\u201d). In June 2007, a\nsecond Action Plan for Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution Preparedness\nand Response was adopted (hereinafter \"the HNS Action Plan\")[5]. The EMSA Administrative Board updates\nboth Action Plans as part of the Agency\u2019s annual Work Programmes.\nIn March 2010, the Administrative Board endorsed\na 5-year strategy[6]\nwhich contains two themes relevant for response to pollution caused by ships.\nFirstly, theme 8 develops EMSA's role with regard to illegal discharges by\nships (enforcement issues, further enhancement of CleanSeaNet by integration of\nship position information). Secondly, theme 12 deals with marine pollution\npreparedness and response.\nFinally, the Commission proposed a\nmodification to the EMSA Regulation in October 2010, which, inter alia,\nforesees an explicit extension of the pollution response activities to cover\naccidents by offshore oil and gas installations[7].\nFurthermore, it is also suggested in this proposal to extend EMSA's assistance to\nthe EU neighbouring countries including the pollution response activities. The European\nParliament and the Council reached an agreement on the proposal in April 2012\nand the Regulation adopted in January 2013[8]\nconfirms the aforementioned provisions.\n2.2. Current tasks of EMSA in the\nfield of pollution response\nIn accordance with Regulation 2038/2006 and\nDirective 2005/35/EC on ship source pollution[9],\nthe three main tasks of the Agency in the field of response to pollution caused\nby ships are the following:\n(a) Operational assistance to Member\nStates \nThe Agency offers a network of stand-by oil\nspill response vessels to \"top up\" Member States\u2019 response capacity\nwhen affected by a spill. It also provides a satellite based oil spill\ndetection and monitoring service called \"CleanSeaNet\" and information\non chemical spills through the \"MAR-ICE\" network. Affected coastal\nstates can request the intervention of oil spill response vessels through the\nCommunity Civil Protection Mechanism[10].\nSmooth integration with Member State response mechanisms is undertaken through\nregular participation in national and regional exercises. \n(b) Cooperation and coordination\nThe Agency liaises with pollution response\nexperts of Member States as well as with existing Regional Agreements and the\nInternational Maritime Organisation (IMO).\n(c) Information\nThe Agency collects, analyses and\ndisseminates information on best practices, techniques and innovation in the\nfield of marine pollution response.\n Summary of deliverables (2007 \u2013 September 2012) \n Key EMSA marine pollution preparedness and response service and associated deliverables that have been made available using the existing multi-annual funding framework are shown below. \n Network of Stand-by Oil Spill Response Vessels: \n 16 contracts are currently active providing coverage for all the regional sea basins around the European Union. 18 vessels, with an average recovered oil storage capacity of approximately 3500 m3 can be mobilised simultaneously and ready to sail within 24 hrs. || The EMSA vessels have participated in 36 international (cross border) operational exercises since 2007. Participation in exercises facilitates the integration of EMSA services with the response mechanisms of Member States. \n CleanSeaNet \n Over 12,000 satellite images have been delivered since the service was launched in April 2007, an average of over 2000 images per year. || Over 1,000 million km2 has been monitored. || Around 200 illegal discharges per year are confirmed by Member States following \u201con the spot\u201d surveillance. \n Incident Response \n EMSA pollution response services have been used in a total of 25 incidents since 2007. Emergency support to affected coastal states has included: Response vessels, Satellite imagery, MAR-ICE activation, and Onsite expertise. || Emergency support includes 4 mobilisations of response vessels in Europe. || Emergency support includes 1 equipment assistance package to the USA during the Deepwater Horizon incident. \n Best practice: Development and promotion \n EMSA has hosted 20 expert meetings and workshops. (This is in addition to regular training with Member State duty officers regarding CleanSeaNet and/or meetings with Network vessel operators.) || Published 7 inventories on different aspects of Member States\u2019 preparedness and response policies and capacities. || Managed the civil servant exchange programme \u201cEMPOLLEX\u201d, which has facilitated the exchange of 21 experts between Member States since its inception in June 2008. || Developed one decision response tool for the application of dispersants during an incident. Coordinated specific studies when needed (e.g. Study on discharge facilities, Safe Platform study: development of vessel requirements to operate in dangerous atmospheres) \n2.3. Future tasks\nAs explained above, with the entry into\nforce of the amendments to the Founding Regulation in January 2013, EMSA\nreceived the following new tasks in the area of pollution response:\na) EMSA's current response actions in case\nof \"pollution caused by ships\" will also cover \"marine pollution\ncaused by oil and gas installations\",\nb) EMSA's existing CleanSeaNet will also \"monitor\nthe extent and environmental impact of marine oil pollution caused by oil and\ngas installations\",\nc) The current geographical coverage (Member States and accession countries) is extended to \"European Neighbourhood partner\ncountries and to countries taking part in the Paris Memorandum of Understanding\non Port State Control\". With this, the EMSA vessels can be used throughout\nthe entire area of the Union's regional sea basins.\nThe Commission proposes that the earmarked\namount should only extend to the first two new tasks, with initial funding to start\nbuilding up the new tasks while not compromising the existing tasks. The third\nnew task should be financed from existing EU programmes for countries covered\nby the enlargement policy and by the European Neighbourhood Policy (the\nprogramme SAFEMED for the Mediterranean Sea and programmes under the TRACECA\ninitiative for the Black Sea). It is considered more appropriate from a\nprogramme management and a budgetary perspective to finance this new task from\nwithin the existing framework of EU support to these countries. \n2.4. Evaluation of EMSA's current activities\nin the field of pollution response\nIn accordance with Regulation 1406/2002,\nthe Agency has submitted reports on the financial execution of the action plans\nby 31 January of each year until 2012. These reports are available on the\nagency's website. As from 2013, the reporting will be integrated in the\nAgency's Annual Activity Report.\nFurthermore, the Commission submitted in\nMay 2011 a report on the implementation of Regulation 2038/2006[11]. This report is based on a\ncomprehensive contribution from the Agency, as endorsed by the EMSA\nAdministrative Board, including a stakeholder consultation and detailed\nscenarios[12].\nEMSA's Administrative Board - in particular through the adoption of the work\nprogramme, the budget and the annual report - the Court of Auditors and the Budgetary\nAuthority through the discharge procedure are supervising and monitoring the\nAgency's action.\nThe two main conclusions drawn from these\nevaluation activities are: \n(1) The budget dedicated to pollution\nresponse is adequate and \n(2) The measures financed are cost\nefficient, provide added value and are appropriately managed.\n2.5. Ex ante evaluation of the\nproposed activities\nAn ex ante evaluation has been carried out\nand is attached to this proposal (document SEC(2013)xxx). It confirms the\nusefulness and the efficiency of the multiannual financial framework and\ndetermines the amount to be earmarked.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal Elements of the proposal\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article\n100 (2) TFEU, which has served as legal basis for Regulation 2038/2006 under the\nprevious version of the Treaty.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and proportionality\nprinciples\nThe principles of subsidiarity and\nproportionality are fully respected, as the Agency's action presents the\nEuropean tier of a differentiated system of response to pollution caused by\nships and offshore installations. Most activities are triggered by requests from\nthe affected coastal States. The fact that the EU is contracting party to the\nfollowing regional organisations might illustrate the close coordination at\nregional level: \n\u00b7                        \nthe Convention on the Protection of the Marine\nEnvironment of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention as revised in 1992); \n\u00b7                        \nthe Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution (Barcelona Convention) and to a number of protocols\nthereof; \n\u00b7                        \nthe Agreement for cooperation in dealing with pollution\nof the North Sea by oil and other harmful substances (Bonn Agreement); \n\u00b7                        \nthe Convention for the protection of the marine\nenvironment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention); \n\u00b7                        \nthe Cooperation Agreement for the protection of\nthe coasts and waters of the north-east Atlantic against pollution, (Lisbon\nAgreement), with its Additional Protocol, which have not yet entered into\nforce. \nThe Union is also negotiating accession to\nthe Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution (Bucharest\nConvention).\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nA Regulation is the most appropriate legal instrument\nto establish a multiannual financial framework. This instrument was already chosen\nin 2006.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary\nImplication\nIn the light of the above the Commission proposes\nto provide again for a multiannual financial envelope to be imputed into the Union\nbudget for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020\ncoinciding with the new multiannual financial framework. In accordance with the\nCommission package of June 2011 \"A Budget for Europe 2020\" and the\ncurrent practice the amount should be taken from Heading 1 \"Smart and\nInclusive Growth\". The Commission thus proposes earmarking an amount of\n\u0404 160.5 million for the reference period. Further details are provided in\nthe attached legislative financial statement and the ex ante evaluation. The\nannual amounts should be authorised by the Budgetary Authority in accordance\nwith the budgetary procedure.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content\nof the proposal\nThe proposal follows closely the structure\nof Regulation 2038/2006 with the necessary adaptations. It consists of the\nfollowing 8 articles:\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 1: Objective\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 2: Definitions\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 3: Scope\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 4: Union funding\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 5: Monitoring existing capabilities\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 6: Protection of Union financial\ninterests\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 7: Mid-term evaluation\n\u00b7                        \nArticle 8: Entry into force\n2013/0092 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non multiannual funding for the action of\nthe European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution\ncaused by ships and to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the proposal to the\nnational Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[13],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[14],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[15],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002[16] established a European\nMaritime Safety Agency (hereinafter 'the Agency') for the purpose of ensuring a\nhigh, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution\nby ships.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n724/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004[17], which amended Regulation (EC)\nNo 1406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks in the fields of prevention and\nresponse to pollution caused by ships, following accidents in European waters,\nparticularly those of the oil tankers \"Erika\" and\n\"Prestige\".\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 100/2013\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013[18], amending Regulation (EC) No\n1406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks with regard to response to marine\npollution caused by oil and gas installations and extended the Agency's\nservices to the countries covered by the enlargement policy and by the European\nNeighbourhood Policy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n2038/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006[19] established a multiannual\nfunding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of\nresponse to pollution caused by ships which expires on 31 December 2013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of\nimplementing the tasks of preventing and responding to pollution by ships, the\nAdministrative Board of the Agency adopted on 22 October 2004 an Action Plan\nfor Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response, which determines the Agency's oil\npollution response activities and is aimed at optimum use of the financial\nresources available to the Agency. On 12 June 2007, the Administrative Board\nadopted an Action Plan for Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution\nPreparedness and Response. In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation\n1406/2002, both action plans are updated yearly through the Agency's annual\nwork programme.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pollution response\naction of the Agency, as specified in the Action Plans, relates to activities\nin the fields of information, cooperation and coordination and above all the\nprovision of operational assistance to the affected States by supplying, on\nrequest, additional anti-pollution vessels to combat oil pollution and other\ntypes of pollution such as that caused by hazardous and noxious substances. The\nAgency should pay particular attention to those areas identified as most\nvulnerable without prejudice to any other area in need.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The activities of the\nAgency in this field should not relieve coastal states of their responsibility\nto have appropriate pollution response mechanisms in place and should comply\nwith existing cooperation arrangements providing for mutual assistance in the\nevent of a maritime pollution incident. The Union has acceded to various\nregional organisations and is preparing accession to other regional\norganisations.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency's action should\nbe coordinated with the activities of the bilateral and regional agreements\nthat the Union has acceded to. In the event of a maritime pollution incident,\nthe Agency should assist the affected State(s), under whose authority clean-up\noperations are conducted.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency should play an\nactive role in maintaining and developing further the satellite imagery service\nfor surveillance, the early detection of pollution and identification of the responsible\nships or oil and gas installations. This system should improve the availability\nof data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The additional means to be\nprovided by the Agency to the affected States should be made available through\nthe Community Civil Protection Mechanism established by Council Decision 2007/779/EC,\nEuratom of 8 November 2007[20].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure thorough\nimplementation, the Agency should be provided with a viable and cost-effective system\nfor financing, in particular, its operational assistance to the affected\nStates.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial security should therefore\nbe provided for the funding of the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field\nof pollution response and associated actions on the basis of a multiannual\ncommitment. The annual amounts of the Union contribution should be determined by\nthe Budgetary Authority in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts to be committed\nfor the funding of pollution response should cover the period from 1 January\n2014 to 31 December 2020, in line with the new multiannual financial framework.\nA financial envelope covering the same period should therefore be provided.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency's support to countries\ncovered by the enlargement policy and by the European Neighbourhood Policy\nshould be financed through existing Union programmes for these countries and\nshould therefore not be part of this multiannual financial framework.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to optimise the\nallocation of commitments and take into account any changes with regard to\nactivities in response to pollution caused by ships, it is necessary to ensure\ncontinuous monitoring of the particular needs for action so as to allow for\nadaptation of the annual financial commitments.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nRegulation (EU) No 100/2013 amending Regulation 1406/2002, the Agency should\nreport on the financial execution of the multiannual framework in its annual\nreport.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the detailed\narrangements for the financial contribution of the Union to the budget of the\nEuropean Maritime Safety Agency for the implementation of the tasks assigned to\nit in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships and offshore oil and\ngas installations, pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 of Regulation (EC) No\n1406/2002.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(a) \"oil\" means petroleum in any\nform including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and refined products as\nestablished by the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness,\nResponse and Cooperation, 1990;\n(b) \"hazardous and noxious\nsubstances\" means any substance other than oil which, if introduced into\nthe marine environment, is likely to create hazards to human health, to harm\nliving resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with\nother legitimate uses of the sea, as established by the Protocol on\nPreparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and\nNoxious Substances, 2000.\nArticle 3\nScope\nThe financial contribution of the Union\nreferred to in Article 1 shall be allocated to the Agency with the aim of\nfinancing actions in the field of response to pollution caused by ships and to marine\npollution caused by offshore oil and gas installations such as the ones\nmentioned in the Agency's Action Plans for Oil Pollution Preparedness and\nResponse and for Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution Preparedness and\nResponse, in particular those relating to:\n(a) information, in particular the assemble,\nanalysis and dissemination of best practices, techniques and innovations, such\nas instruments for monitoring ships' tank-emptying and for monitoring of\noffshore platforms for operational releases and accidental spills;\n(b) cooperation and coordination and the\nprovision to the Member States and the Commission of technical and scientific\nassistance in the framework of the relevant activities of the EU Civil\nProtection Mechanism, the International Maritime Organization and the relevant\nregional agreements;\n(c) operational assistance and supporting,\non request, with additional means, such as stand-by anti-pollution ships,\nsatellite images and equipment, pollution response actions by the affected\nStates in the event of accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships or\nmarine pollution caused by offshore oil and gas installations.\nArticle 4\nUnion funding\nThe financial envelope for the\nimplementation of the tasks referred to in Article 3 for the period from 1\nJanuary 2014 to 31 December 2020 shall be EUR 160.500.000 expressed in current\nprices.\nAnnual appropriations shall be determined\nby the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial framework.
