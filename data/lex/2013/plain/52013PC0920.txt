This proposal is one of the main legislative pillars to achieve\nthese reductions.\nAs well as setting out the further emission\ncuts needed, this proposal addresses some of the shortcomings in the\nimplementation of the Union air policy framework and the need for enhanced\nco-ordination between emission reductions and air quality as well as climate\nchange and biodiversity protection. \nGiven the nature and extent of the\nnecessary modifications to Directive 2001/81/EC and the need to enhance\nconsistency and legal clarity, the review of Directive 2001/81/EC calls for its\nrepeal and the adoption of a new Directive (this Directive). \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union \nThe\nobjectives of this initiative are consistent with and reinforce the Europe 2020\nobjectives on smart, inclusive, and sustainable growth. They should stimulate\ninnovation that will help support green growth and maintain the competitiveness\nof the European economy whilst assisting the transition to a low carbon\neconomy, protecting Europe's natural capital and capitalising on Europe's leadership in developing new green technologies.[4]\nSimplification and clarification\nof existing policy to enable better implementation is pursued where possible in\nthe spirit of smarter regulation.[5]\nWhere measures are introduced, care is taken to safeguard the interests of SMEs\nalong the \"think small first\" principle.[6] Coherence has been\nensured with the closely-related areas of transport, industrial, agriculture\nand climate change, and resource efficiency. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation with interested parties \nThe review process drew on expertise built up\nover several decades of air quality assessments, management and review\nactivities in the Union and internationally. Consulted parties included Member State authorities responsible for the implementation of the current policy framework\nat all administrative levels. Five stakeholder meetings were held between June\n2011 and April 2013 to ensure transparency and offer opportunities for\nstakeholder comments and inputs. All meetings were web-streamed to enable the\nbroadest possible participation. In parallel, two public consultations were\norganised: a first at the end of 2011 focused on review of the strengths and\nweaknesses of the existing air quality policy framework; the second on-line\npublic consultation of all stakeholders on the main policy options available to\naddress the remaining air quality problems in early 2013.[7] A Eurobarometer survey\nseeking the view of the general public on air pollution issues was conducted\nand reported in 2012.[8]\nThe Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) also conducted an Air\nImplementation Pilot project, bringing together 12 cities from across the Union to assess local experience with implementing the air policy framework.[9]\nResult of the impact assessment \nFull compliance with\nair quality legislation can be achieved in the short to medium term by focusing\non the implementation of existing policy plus Member State action. While\nDirective 2001/81/EC should be revised to incorporate the Union's international\ncommitments for 2020 under the Gothenburg Protocol, more stringent reductions\nare not appropriate for 2020. \nHowever, the period\nto 2030 is a different case. To address the outstanding health and\nenvironmental impacts requires substantially tighter emission reduction\ncommitments. For 2030 the preferred option is 70% of the maximum feasible\nreduction of health impacts in 2030, further optimised for additional\nreductions in eutrophication and ozone. These emission reduction commitments\nprovide a continuing trajectory towards the Union's long-term objective. \nImplementation of\nthe Gothenburg reduction commitments for 2020 entails no additional Union\nexpenditure over the baseline. The new reduction commitments for 2030 are\ndesigned to implement the reduction of air quality impacts by 2030 established\nin the Communication on a Clean Air Programme for Europe. The impact assessment\nmodelled the optimal delivery of the desired reduction, and this optimisation\nyielded national emission reduction commitments for the six most relevant pollutants.\nThese reduction commitments will reduce total external costs of air pollution\nby \u20ac40bn (on the most conservative valuation) compared to the \u20ac212bn in the\nbaseline, including direct economic benefits amounting to more than \u20ac2.8\nbillion: \u20ac1,85bn from reduced labour productivity losses, reduced health care\ncosts of \u20ac600m, reduced crop value losses of \u20ac230m, and reduced damage to the\nbuilt environment of \u20ac120m. This compares with annual compliance costs of \u20ac3,3bn,\nor about one twelfth of the external cost savings. The\nbaseline shall deliver in 2030 a reduction of health burden by 40% as compared\nto 2005. This proposal delivers an extra 12%, which makes a 52% reduction in\ntotal regarding health burden as compared to 2005. For eutrophication, it\ndelivers an extra 50% on top of the baseline. \nMethane ceilings under the NEC regime of the Union could bring down\nemissions cost-effectively although the policy would need to be consistent with\nDecision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.[10] Provisions to improve\ngovernance and align monitoring and reporting with international obligations\ncould be included at very modest administrative cost (around \u20ac8m initial cost\nand \u20ac3.5m annual cost Union-wide).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal repeals and replaces the\ncurrent Union regime on the annual capping of national emissions of air\npollutants, as defined in Directive 2001/81/EC. By doing so, it ensures that\nthe national emission ceilings (NECs) set in Directive 2001/81/EC for 2010\nonwards for SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3 shall apply until 2020\nand establishes new national emission reduction commitments (\"reduction\ncommitments\") applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO2, NOx,\nNMVOC, NH3, fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane\n(CH4) as well as intermediate emission levels for the year 2025\napplicable to the same pollutants. \nSpecific\ninformation on the main Articles and Annexes is provided below. \nArticles 1, 2 and 3 specify the subject-matter and the scope of this proposal and\nprovide definitions of key terms used therein.\nIn accordance with Article 4 read in\ncombination with Annex II, Member States must limit their annual\nemissions of SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, PM2,5 and\nCH4, to meet their reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030.\nFurthemore, Member States must limit in 2025 their annual emissions of those\npollutants to the levels defined on the basis of a linear reduction trajectory,\nunless this would require measures entailing disproportionate costs. Article 4\nindicates what emission sources should not be accounted for. \nArticle 5\nentitles Member States to use certain flexibilities, provided that the\nCommission does not object: to account for a share of NOx, SO2, and PM2,5\nemission reductions achieved by international maritime traffic under certain\nconditions; to implement jointly their reduction commitments for CH4;\nand to propose adjusted emission inventories when non-compliance with a\nreduction commitment (save for CH4) results from improved inventory\nmethodology. \nArticle 6\nrequires Members States to adopt, implement and regularly update their national\nair pollution control programmes (NAPCPs) describing how their reduction\ncommitments shall be met. NAPCPs should, at least, contain the information set\nout in Annex III (part 2) and on the reduction of black carbon emissions\nand may prescribe specific measures, as listed in Annex III (part 1), to\ncurb PM2,5 and NH3 emissions from the agricultural\nsector. NAPCPs shall be developed in the context of the overall air quality\npolicy framework and shall include information on the analysis underpinning the\nselection of measures. Member States shall subject their NAPCPs to public\nconsultation before their finalisation. To this end, Article 16 amends Directive\n2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[11] to ensure that it\ncovers NAPCPs.\nArticle 7 read\nin combination with Annex I requires Member States to monitor air\npollutant emissions and, in so doing, prepare and update, in line with the\nobligations and guidelines enacted under the LRTAP Convention referred to and\nfurther specified in Annex IV, national emission inventories and\nprojections to be accompanied by an informative inventory report (IIR). Member\nStates that apply the flexibilities under Article 5 must include relevant\ninformation in the IIR or in a separate report. \nUnder Article 8, Member States shall\nmonitor, where practicable, the adverse impacts of air pollution upon water and\nterrestrial ecosystems, based on the modalities specified in Annex V.\nMember States are entitled to make use of monitoring systems established under\nother Union instruments. \nArticle 9\nrequires Member States to communicate to the Commission, at the dates specified\nin Annex I, their NAPCP and any updates and all monitoring information established\nin accordance with Articles 7 and 8. The Commission, assisted by the European\nEnvironment Agency and Member States, shall regularly verify the accuracy and\ncompleteness of reported national emission inventory data. \nArticle 10\nprovides that the Commission shall report every five years on the\nimplementation of this Directive, including on the application of Article 4,\nparagraph 2 related to intermediate emission levels set for 2025. \nArticle 11\npromotes the systematic, active and electronic dissemination of the information\ncollected and processed under this proposal and refers, in that context, to the\nrequirements established in Union law, including in Directive 2003/4/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council.[12]\n\nArticle 12\npromotes cooperation between the Commission and Member States with third\ncountries and relevant international organisations to further and better\naddress air pollutant emissions at a global level. \nArticle 13\nlays down the modalities of the procedure applicable under Articles 6(7), 7(9)\nand 8(3) to the adaptation of Annexes I, III (part 1), IV and V to scientific\nand technical progress through delegated acts. \nArticle 14\nrefers to the Committee examination procedure that the Commission shall use to\nenact implementing acts under Articles 5(6) and 6(9) and specifies that the\nexisting Committee established under Article 29 of Directive 2008/50/EC shall\nbe used. \nArticles 15, 17 and 19 lay down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the\nnational provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal, on the entry into force\nand the transposition of the proposal into Member States\u2019 legislation. \nArticle 18 is\nconcerned with the repeal of Directive 2001/81/EC while\nspecifying that the NECs it sets shall remain applicable until 31 December\n2019. \nAnnex VI\ncontains the correlation table. \nLegal basis \nAs the primary objective of the proposal is\nthe protection of the environment, in accordance with Article 191 TFUE, it is\nbased on Article 192(1) TFUE. \nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nprinciples and choice of instrument \nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar\nas the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Union. \nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States. To address the significant remaining\nair quality impacts in the Union, each Member State must reduce its pollutant\nemissions, and the cost-effective combination of reductions across Europe can only be co-ordinated at Union level. The reduction commitments identified take\naccount not only of the domestic impacts of national emissions, but also of\ntheir transboundary impacts. \nAction by the Union will better achieve the\nobjective of the proposal. Directive 2001/81/EC sets reduction targets and\nminimum requirements for their implementation, while leaving Member States to\ndetermine the optimum combination of measures to achieve those reductions. That\nprinciple is maintained in this proposal, which further harmonises the\nrequirements on national programmes and on the monitoring and reporting of\nemissions of air pollutants with a view to correcting shortcomings of Directive\n2001/81/EC, and to complying with international commitments undertaken under\nthe LRTAP Convention and its protocols. Although the\nproposal requires control of emissions at source in the agriculture sector,\nMember States are entitled not to implement them if they are not necessary to\nachieve the relevant reduction commitment. \nThis proposal therefore respects the\nsubsidiarity principle.\nThe chosen legal instrument is a Directive\nas the proposal lays down objectives and obligations, while leaving sufficient\nflexibility to the Member States as regards the choice of measures for\ncompliance and their detailed implementation. The proposal therefore complies\nwith the proportionality principle. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Directive will be implemented using the\nexisting budget and will not impact on the multi-annual financial framework.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nExplanatory\ndocuments\nThe Commission\nconsiders that explanatory documents are necessary in order to improve the\nquality of information on the transposition of the directive for the following\nreasons.\nThe complete and correct transposition of\nthe Directive is essential to guarantee that its objectives (i.e. protecting\nhuman health and the environment) are achieved. Given\nthat certain Member States already regulate emissions of air pollutants,\nthe transposition of this directive would probably\nnot consist of one piece of legislation, but rather, various amendments or new\nproposals in relevant fields. In addition, the implementation of the\nDirective is often highly decentralised, as the regional and local authorities\nare responsible for its application and, in some Member States, even for its\ntransposition. \nThe above factors are likely to increase\nthe risks of incorrect transposition and implementation of the Directive, and\ncomplicate the Commission\u2019s task of monitoring the application of Union law.\nClear information with respect to the transposition of the Directive is\ninstrumental in ensuring the conformity of national legislation with its\nprovisions.\nThe requirement\nto provide explanatory documents may create an additional administrative burden\non those Member States which do not work on this basis in any case. However,\nthe possible additional administrative burden is proportionate to the aim\npursued, namely to ensure effective transposition and fully achieve the\nobjectives of the Directive.\nIn view of the\nabove it is appropriate to ask Member States to accompany the notification of\ntheir transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the\nrelationship between the provisions of the Directive and the corresponding\nparts of national transposition instruments.\n2013/0443 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the reduction of national emissions of\ncertain atmospheric pollutants and amending Directive 2003/35/EC \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[13],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[14],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Significant progress has\nbeen achieved in the past 20 years in the Union in the field of anthropogenic air\nemissions and air quality by a dedicated Union policy, including the 2005 Communication\nfrom the Commission \"Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution\u201d (\u201cTSAP\u201d)[15]. Directive 2001/81/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[16]\nhas been instrumental in this progress by setting caps on Member States' total\nannual emissions for 2010 onwards of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen\noxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic\ncompounds other than methane (NMVOC). As a result, SO2 emissions were\nreduced by 82%, NOx emissions by 47%, NMVOC emissions by 56% and NH3\nemissions by 28% between 1990 and 2010. However, as indicated in the \"Clean\nAir Programme for Europe\" (\"revised TSAP\"),[17] significant adverse impacts\nand risks remain on the environment and human health.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The seventh Environment\nAction Programme[18]\nconfirms the Union's long-term objective for air policy, to achieve levels of\nair quality that do not give rise to significant negative impacts on and risks\nto human health and the environment, and calls, to that end, for full\ncompliance with the current air quality legislation of the Union, post-2020\nstrategic targets and actions, enhanced efforts in areas where the population\nand ecosystems are exposed to high levels of air pollutants, and reinforced\nsynergies between air quality legislation and Union's policy objectives set for\nclimate change and biodiversity in particular.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The revised TSAP sets out\nnew strategic objectives for the period up to 2030 with a view to moving\nfurther towards the Union's long-term objective.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States and the Union\nare parties to the 1979 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\nConvention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (\"LRTAP\nConvention\")[19]\nand to several of its Protocols, including the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to\nAbate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the year 2020\nand thereafter, the revised Gothenburg Protocol accepted by the Council in\nDecision [xxxx/xxxx/EU][20]\nsets out new emission reduction commitments, taking the year 2005 as a base\nyear, for each party regarding SO2, NOx, NH3,\nNMVOC and fine particulate matter (PM2,5), promotes emission\nreductions of black carbon and calls for the collection and keeping of\ninformation on the adverse effects of air pollutant concentrations and\ndepositions on human health and the environment and participation in the\neffects-oriented programmes under the LRTAP Convention. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national emission\nceiling regime established by Directive 2001/81/EC should therefore be revised in\norder to align it with the international commitments of the Union and the Member States.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\nimplement this Directive in a way that contributes effectively to the meeting\nof the Union's long-term objective on air quality as supported by the\nguidelines of the World Health Organisation and of the Union's biodiversity and\necosystem protection objectives by reducing the levels and deposition of\nacidifying, eutrophifying and ozone air pollution below critical loads\nand levels as set out by the LRTAP Convention. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should also\ncontribute to the achievement of the air quality objectives set in Union\nlegislation and to the mitigation of climate change impacts by reducing\nemissions of short-lived climate pollutants as well as to the improvement of\nair quality globally. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\ncomply with the emission reduction commitments set out in this Directive for\n2020 and 2030. So as to ensure demonstrable progress towards the 2030\ncommitments, Member States should meet intermediate emission levels in 2025,\nset on the basis of a linear trajectory between their emission levels for 2020\nand those defined by the emission reduction commitments for 2030, unless this\nwould entail disproportionate costs. Where the 2025 emissions cannot be so\nlimited, Member States should explain the reasons in their reports under this\nDirective. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some Member States opted\nunder the LRTAP Convention for setting emission ceilings based on fuel used\nregarding the transport sector. This has resulted in a lack of coherence with\ntheir overall energy consumption and statistics as well as those of the Union as a whole. Accordingly, in order to guarantee a common and coherent basis for all\nMember States and the Union as a whole, this Directive sets out reporting\nrequirements and emission reduction commitments based on national energy\nconsumption and fuel sold, which ensures further coherence with Union climate\nchange and energy legislation. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to promote\ncost-effective achievement of the national emission reduction commitments and\nof the intermediate emission levels, Member States should be entitled to\naccount for emission reductions from international maritime traffic if\nemissions from that sector are lower than the levels of emissions that would\nresult from compliance with Union law standards, including the sulphur limits\nfor fuels set in Directive 1999/32/EC of the Council.[21] Member States should\nalso have the possibility to jointly meet their commitments and intermediate\nemission levels regarding methane (CH4) and of making use of\nDecision n\u00b0406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council for so\ndoing.[22]\nFor the purpose of checking compliance with their national emission ceilings,\nemission reduction commitments and intermediate emission levels, Member States\ncould adjust their national emission inventories in view of improved scientific\nunderstanding and methodologies regarding emissions. The Commission could\nobject to the use of any of these flexibilities by a Member State, should the conditions set out in this Directive not be met. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should adopt\nand implement a national air pollution control programme with a view to meeting\ntheir emission reduction requirements and intermediate emission levels, and to\ncontributing effectively to the achievement of the Union air quality\nobjectives. To this effect, Member States should take account of the need to\nreduce emissions in zones and agglomerations affected by excessive air\npollutant concentrations and/or in those that contribute significantly to air\npollution in other zones and agglomerations, including in neighbouring\ncountries. National air pollution control programmes should, to that end,\ncontribute to the successful implementation of air quality plans enacted under\nArticle 23 of Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil.[23]\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce\natmospheric NH3 and PM2,5 emissions from the main\ncontributors, national air pollution control programmes should include measures\napplicable to the agricultural sector. Member States should be entitled to\nimplement measures other than those set out in this Directive with an\nequivalent level of environmental performance owning to specific national\ncircumstances.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The national air pollution\ncontrol programme, including the analysis supporting the identification of\npolicies and measures, should be regularly updated. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to draw up well\ninformed national air pollution control programmes and any significant updates,\nMember States should make those programmes and updates subject to consultation\nby the public and competent authorities at all levels when all options\nregarding policies and measures remain open. Member States should engage in\ntransboundary consultations in case where the implementation of their programme\ncould affect air quality in another country, in accordance with the\nrequirements set out in Union and international legislation, including the\nConvention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context\n(Espoo, 1991) and its Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment (Kyiv,\n2003), as approved by the Council.[24]\n\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\nestablish and report emission inventories, projections and informative\ninventory reports for all air pollutants covered by this Directive, which\nshould then enable the Union to meet its reporting duties under the LRTAP\nConvention and its Protocols.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to preserve\noverall consistency for the Union as a whole, Member States should ensure that\ntheir reporting to the Commission of their national emission inventories,\nprojections and informative inventory are fully consistent with their reporting\nunder the LRTAP Convention. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to assess the\neffectiveness of the national emission reduction commitments laid down in this\nDirective, Member States should also monitor, where practicable, the effects of\nsuch reductions in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, in accordance with\ninternationally established guidelines and report these effects. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Directive\n2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[25], Member States should\nensure active and systematic dissemination of information by electronic means.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to amend\nDirective 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[26] with a view to\nensuring consistency of this Directive with the 1998 Aarhus Convention on\nAccess to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to\nJustice in Environmental Matters.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of amending the reporting guidelines set\nout in Annex I, as well as Part 1 of Annex III and Annexes IV and V to adapt\nthem to technical progress. It is of particular importance that the Commission\ncarry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at\nexpert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should\nensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should\nbe conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.[27] \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should lay\ndown rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions\nadopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those\npenalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to the nature\nand extent of the modifications which should be made to Directive 2001/81/EC,\nthat Directive should be replaced to enhance legal certainty, clarity,\ntransparency and legislative simplification.
