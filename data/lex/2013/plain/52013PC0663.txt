This Internal Agreement will\r\nonly enter into force after ratification by all the Member States. This process will probably not be concluded before January 2014.\nTherefore the Commission proposes transitional\r\nmeasures (\u2018Bridging Facility\u2019) to\r\nensure the availability of funds for cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and\r\nwith Overseas Countries and Territories, as well as for support expenditure, between January 2014 and the entry into\r\nforce of the Internal Agreement establishing the 11th EDF. This\r\nfacility shall be financed from balances and\r\ndecommitted funds of the 10th and previous EDFs. \nIt is also proposed that funds committed under this Bridging Facility shall be accounted for\r\nunder the 11th EDF, which means that they would not constitute additional\r\nresources to the 11th EDF, and that the necessary measures shall be adopted as\r\nsoon as possible for the operational and financial management of this Bridging Facility.\nThe Commission therefore suggests that the Council\r\nadopt the attached decision.\n2013/0319 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nregarding transitional EDF management measures\r\nfrom 1 January 2014 until the entry into force of the 11th European Development\r\nFund\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European\r\nUnion and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\r\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of\r\nStates, of the one part and the European Community and its Member States, of\r\nthe other part, signed in Cotonou, on 23 June 2000[1],\nHaving regard to the Council Decision on\r\nthe association of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) with the\r\nEuropean Community (\u2018Overseas Association Decision\u2019)[2],\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on the financing of Community aid under the multi-annual\r\nfinancial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 in accordance with the ACP-EC\r\nPartnership Agreement and on the allocation of financial assistance for the\r\nOverseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the EC Treaty applies[3] (hereinafter referred to as\r\nTenth EDF Internal Agreement), and in particular Article 1(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1(5) of the 10th\r\nEDF Internal Agreement provides that the funds of the 10th EDF shall\r\nno longer be committed beyond 31 December 2013 unless the Council decides otherwise\r\nunanimously, on a proposal from the Commission.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 5 of Annex Ib[4] (Multi-annual\r\nfinancial framework for the period 2008 to 2013) to the ACP-EU Partnership\r\nAgreement provides that the funds of the 10th\r\nEDF, apart from amounts allocated to the Investment Facility, excluding the\r\nrelated interest rate subsidies, shall no longer be committed beyond 31 December\r\n2013, unless the Council of the European Union decides otherwise by unanimity,\r\non a proposal from the Commission.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1(2) of Annex IIAa\r\nof the Council Decision of 27 November 2001 on the association of the Overseas\r\nCountries and Territories with the European Community provides that the funds\r\nof the 10th EDF may no longer be committed after 31 December 2013,\r\nunless the Council decided otherwise unanimously, on a proposal from the\r\nCommission[5].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13(3) of the 10th\r\nEDF Internal Agreement provides that it is concluded for the same duration as\r\nthe multiannual financial framework of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and\r\nthat it shall remain in force for as long as is necessary for all the\r\noperations financed under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and the Association\r\nDecision and the said multiannual financial framework to be fully executed.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The organisation and\r\nfunctioning of the European External Action Service are described in Council\r\nDecision 2010/427/EU.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The entry into force of\r\nthe 11th EDF may be delayed beyond 1 January 2014. It is therefore appropriate\r\nto provide for transitional measures (a \u2018Bridging Facility\u2019) to ensure the\r\navailability of funds for cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific\r\ncountries and with Overseas Countries and Territories, as well as for support\r\nexpenditure, between January 2014 and the entry into force of the Internal\r\nAgreement, to be financed from balances and decommitted funds of the 10th and\r\nprevious EDFs.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nPending entry into force of the Internal\r\nAgreement of the 11th EDF, transitional measures in the form of action\r\nprogrammes, individual measures and special measures for ACP partners, financing\r\ndecisions in support of OCTs, and specific action programmes for support expenditure\r\nshall be financed from a Bridging Facility for the 11th EDF, composed of\r\nbalances from the previous EDFs and from funds decommitted from projects or\r\nprogrammes under these EDFs.
