The review was initiated following a substantiated request by three Union producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 40%, of the Union production of ironing boards. In parallel, on 12 June 2012, the Commission announced by notice, published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of ironing boards originating in Ukraine for the sole exporting producer of ironing boards in Ukraine. The expiry review investigation found continuation of dumped imports from the People's Republic of China and likelihood of recurrence of injury. Neither dumping nor likelihood of recurrence of dumping was found in respect of the imports of the product concerned from Ukraine. It was further established that the continuation of measures applicable to imports of ironing boards originating in the People's Republic of China and repeal of the measures applicable to imports of ironing boards originating in Ukraine was not against the interest of the Union. The partial interim review investigation did not show the existence of dumping in respect of the imports of the product concerned from the Ukrainian exporting producer concerned, which was found representative for the whole country. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to prolong the existing measures with regard to imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China and to terminate the existing measures with regard to imports of the product concerned from Ukraine, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 25 July 2013 at the latest. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0212 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of ironing boards originating in the People's Republic of China, and\nrepealing the anti-dumping measures on imports of ironing boards originating in\nUkraine following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) and a partial\ninterim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[4]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 9(4) and 11(2), (3) and\n(6)thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA.

Ltd., a Chinese exporting\nproducer of ironing boards.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EU) No\n580/2010[8], the Council amended the definitive anti-dumping duty in force with\nregard to imports of ironing boards originating in Ukraine to 7%, following a\npartial interim review limited in scope to dumping pursuant to Article 11(3) of\nthe basic Regulation. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EU) No\n77/2010[9], the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of\nironing boards of Greenwood Houseware (Zhuhai) Ltd Co, a Chinese exporting\nproducer of ironing boards, following a new exporter review pursuant to Article\n11(4) of the basic Regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EU) No\n805/2010[10], the Council re-imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on import of\nironing boards of Foshan Shunde Yongjian Housewares and Hardware Co. Ltd,\nFoshan, a Chinese exporting producer of ironing boards, as a measure to comply\nwith the judgment of the Court of Justice in case C-141/08 P[11]. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nRegulation (EU) No 987/2012[12], the\nCouncil re-imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ironing boards\noriginating in the People's Republic of China, manufactured by Zhejiang\nHarmonic Hardware Products Co.

The request was lodged by Eurogold Industries Ltd., the only\nexporting producer of the product concerned from Ukraine (\u2018the applicant of the interim review\u2019). \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the applicant\nof the interim review, the circumstances on the basis of which the measures\nhave been established had changed and these changes were of lasting nature. On\nthe basis of these changes it was alleged that the existing anti-dumping\nmeasures were no longer necessary to offset dumping.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation\nof a partial interim review, the Commission initiated this review on 12 June\n2012[16] (\u2018interim review notice of initiation\u2019).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expiry review\n(a)         \nInvestigation period and period\nconsidered in the expiry review investigation\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of\ndumping and injury for the expiry review covered the period from 1 January 2011\nto 31 December 2011 ('the expiry review investigation period' or 'ERIP'). The examination\nof trends in the context of the analysis of injury covered the period from\nJanuary 2008 to the end of the ERIP ('the period considered').\n(b)         \nParties concerned by the investigation\nand sampling \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicants, other known Union producers, exporting producers,\nimporters, users in the Union known to be concerned and their associations, and\nthe representatives of the exporting countries concerned of the initiation of\nthe expiry review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in\nthe expiry notice of initiation. All interested parties, who so requested and\nshowed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were\ngranted a hearing.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nlarge number of Chinese exporting producers and Union producers, sampling was\nenvisaged in the expiry review notice of initiation in accordance with Article\n17 of the basic Regulation. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary\nand, if so, to select a representative sample, Chinese exporting producers were\nrequested to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide the\ninformation specified in the expiry notice of initiation. Only two exporting\nproducer in the PRC made themselves known and provided the Commission with the\ninformation requested in the expiry review notice of initiation. Therefore,\nsampling was not considered necessary. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sole Ukrainian\nexporting producer cooperated in the parallel partial interim review and requested\nthat the data verified and collected in the context of the interim review are\nused for the purpose of this expiry review (see recital (31) below).\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission announced in the expiry review notice of initiation\nthat it had provisionally selected a sample of Union producers. This sample\nconsisted of three companies, out of the estimated 20-30 Union producers that\nwere known prior to the initiation of the investigation to produce the like product. The three\nsampled companies were selected on the basis of their sales and production\nvolume of the like product in 2011 as well as their geographic location in the Union. The sample represented over 40% of the total estimated Union production and sales\nduring the ERIP and was therefore considered representative. Interested parties were invited to consult\nthe file and to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within 15 days of\nthe date of publication of the notice of initiation. No interested party\ncommented on the proposed sample. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No unrelated importers in\nthe Union made themselves known and cooperated in the expiry review\ninvestigation.\n(c)         \nQuestionnaires and verification \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and\nfor the determination of the Union interest. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaires were sent to\nboth Chinese exporting producers that came forward in the sampling exercise.\nOnly one of these Chinese exporting producers cooperated and provided a questionnaire\nreply. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaire replies were\nreceived from the three sampled Union producers. In addition, four cooperating\nUnion producers provided general data for the injury analysis.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification visits were\ncarried out at the premises of the following companies:\n\u00b7              \nPRC\n\u2013              \nGreenwood Houseware\n(Zhuhai) Limited, Guangdong, the PRC\n\u2013              \nBrabantia S&S, Hong Kong\n\u00b7              \nUnion producers \n\u2013              \nColombo New Scal SpA, Italy\n\u2013              \nR\u00f6rets Polska Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z.o.o., Poland\n\u2013              \nVale Mill (Rochdale) Ltd, United Kingdom\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the need to\nestablish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC to which MET was\nnot granted in the original investigations, a verification visit to establish\nnormal value on the basis of data from an analogue country took place at the\npremises of the following company:\n\u00b7              \nUkraine\n\u2013              \nEurogold Industries Ltd., Zhytomyr, Ukraine \n(d)         \nDisclosure \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\nintended to recommend imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of the\nproduct concerned originating in the PRC and to terminate the investigation\nconcerning the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of the product\nconcerned originating in Ukraine. The parties were also granted a period within\nwhich they could make representations subsequent to this disclosure. No\ncomments were received. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Partial interim review \n(a)         \nInvestigation period in the interim review\ninvestigation\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation period for the partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3)\nof the basic Regulation concerning imports originating in Ukraine covered the\nperiod from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 ('the interim review investigation\nperiod'). A less recent investigation period, such\nas the one used for the expiry review, would not have been consistent with the\nrequirements of Article 6(1) of the basic Regulation. Furthermore, a similar\ninvestigation period has been used in a parallel refund proceeding.\n(b)         \nParties concerned by the investigation \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicant of the interim review and the representatives of the\nexporting country concerned of the initiation of the partial interim review.\nInterested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in\nwriting and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in the interim review\nnotice of initiation. All interested parties, who so requested and showed that\nthere were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(c)         \nQuestionnaires and verification\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for a determination of dumping\nof the applicant of the interim review and the need of continued imposition of\nthe measures. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\napplicant of the interim review represented all the imports of the product\nconcerned from Ukraine. A\nquestionnaire was sent to this company that cooperated and provided a\nquestionnaire reply. A verification visit was carried out at the following\npremises:\n\u00b7              \nUkraine\n\u2013              \nEurogold Industries Ltd., Zhytomyr, Ukraine \n(d)         \nDisclosure\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\nintended to terminate the investigation concerning the anti-dumping measures\napplicable to imports of the product concerned originating in Ukraine. The parties were also granted a period within which they could make\nrepresentations subsequent to this disclosure. No comments were received. \nB. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product subject to both\nthe expiry and the partial interim reviews is the same as that covered by\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 and Council Regulation (EU) No 1243/2010,\nnamely ironing boards, whether or not free-standing, with or without a steam\nsoaking and/or heating top and/or blowing top, including sleeve boards, and\nessential parts thereof, i.e. the legs, the top and the iron rest, originating\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China and Ukraine (\u2018the product concerned),\ncurrently falling within CN codes ex 3924 90 00, ex 4421 90 98, ex 7323 93 00,\nex 7323 99 00, ex 8516 79 70 and ex 8516 90 00. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current review\ninvestigations confirmed that, as in the original investigations, the product\nconcerned and ironing boards produced and sold on the domestic markets in the\ncountries concerned, ironing boards produced and sold by the Union industry on\nthe Union market and those produced and sold on the analogue country market of\nUkraine have the same basic physical and technical characteristics and the same\nbasic uses.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore these products\nare considered to be like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the\nbasic Regulation.\nC. DUMPING, LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION\nAND/OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING AND LASTING NATURE OF THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping - expiry review\u2013 the\nPRC\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General remarks\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned above, only one Chinese exporting producer cooperated in the\ninvestigation, representing only a negligible amount of total Chinese exports\nduring the ERIP. The findings for this company were therefore not considered\nrepresentative for the country. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the Chinese\nauthorities and non-cooperating Chinese exporting producers were notified of\nthe application of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation and were given an\nopportunity to present their comments in accordance with Article 18(4) of the\nbasic Regulation. No comments were received in this regard.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n18(1) of the basic Regulation, the findings in relation to dumping and likelihood\nof a continuation of dumping set out below had to be based on facts available,\nin particular, information in the request for the expiry review and the statistics\navailable to the Commission found to be the most accurate, i.e. the monthly\ndata transmitted by Member States under Article 14 (6) of the basic Regulation\n('the 14.6 database'). Other statistical sources such as the Chinese export\ndatabase and Eurostat (8 digits) were found unreliable as the respective custom\ncodes covered other products than the product concerned. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(a)         \nAnalogue country\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article\n2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, normal value for the exporting producers not\ngranted market economy treatment (MET) has to be established on the basis of\nthe domestic prices or constructed normal value in an analogue country.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For this purpose, in the\nexpiry review notice of initiation the Commission suggested Ukraine as analogue country. Ukraine was one of the countries used in the previous\ninvestigations as an appropriate market economy third country for the purpose\nof establishing a normal value in respect of the PRC. All interested parties\nwere given the opportunity to comment on the choice of the analogue country\nenvisaged. No comments were received in this regard.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the Commission\ntried to obtain cooperation from other potential analogue countries, namely Malaysia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Israel and Turkey. Only the Turkish authorities came\nforward with a list of known producers to be contacted, without indicating\nwhether any of them would cooperate with the investigation. At the same time, the sole Ukrainian exporting producer\nagreed for its data submitted and verified in the context of the parallel\ninterim review to be used for the purposes of the expiry review. The data\nis representative for the whole country.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above\nfacts and of the requirements of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, it\nwas concluded that Ukraine was an appropriate analogue country. \n(b)         \nDetermination of normal value in analogue\ncountry \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sole Ukrainian\nexporting producer did not cooperate in the expiry review but it cooperated in\nthe parallel partial interim review and made its data, collected and verified in\nthe framework of the partial interim review, available for the purpose of the\nexpiry review. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the significant overlap\nbetween the expiry and interim investigation periods and considering that the\nUkrainian exporter in question represented 100% of the exports from Ukraine to the Union, normal value was therefore established on the basis of the data collected and\nverified in the framework of the parallel partial interim review (see recitals (77) to (83) below).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The export price for the non-cooperating Chinese exporting\nproducers was based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the\nbasic Regulation. The export price was thus established on the basis of the\nimport statistics available to the Commission (i.e. 14 (6) database) calculated\non a weighted average basis. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case of the cooperating\nChinese exporting producer the export prices were based on the price at which\nthe imported products were first resold to an independent buyer, in accordance\nwith Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe non-cooperating Chinese exporting producers the comparison between the\nnormal value and the export price was made on an ex-works basis. For the\npurpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export\nprice, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences\naffecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of\nthe basic Regulation. Adjustments were made, where appropriate, in respect of\nfreight and transport costs, in all cases where demonstrated to affect price\ncomparability, determined on the basis of the data collected from the\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the\ncooperating Chinese exporting producer, the comparison was made between the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price established\non the basis of the reported and verified data compared on an ex-works basis\nper product type and at the same level of trade. For the purpose of ensuring a\nfair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in\nthe form of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAdjustments up to 5.9% were made, where appropriate, in respect of freight and\ntransport costs, in all cases where demonstrated to affect price comparability.\n\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under\nArticle 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin for the cooperating\nChinese exporting producer was established on the basis of a comparison of the\nweighted average normal value by type with the weighted average export price of\nthe corresponding type of the product concerned. This indicative comparison did\nnot show the existence of dumping. Since the imports of this company\nrepresented only a marginal proportion of total Chinese imports in volume, the\nfindings for this company are not considered representative for whole PRC\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the\nnon-cooperating Chinese exporting producers the dumping margin was established\non the basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the\nweighted average export price. Given the lack of cooperation, the comparison\nper product type was not possible. Instead the comparison had to be based on\nthe statistical data as explained in recitals (44) and (45) above. The\ncomparison showed existence of an indicative dumping margin of 11.5%. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likelihood of a continuation\nof dumping PRC\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the low cooperation no information concerning Chinese domestic market\nwas available during the investigation. The cooperating Chinese exporter was\nset up to produce for the Union market only and had no information on the\ndomestic situation. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfindings in respect of likelihood of continuation of dumping had to rely mainly\non the information available in the expiry review request and the information verified\nand published in the framework of the sunset review of June 2010 carried out by\nthe US International Trade Commission ('US sunset review')[17] which the Commission considered relevant for the purpose of its\ninvestigation. \n(a)         \nVolume and prices of dumped imports from the\nPRC\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the measures in\nplace and despite a decrease of Chinese imports during the period considered as\nestablished below (see recital (106)), they continued to have a significant\nmarket share in the Union market of around 15-20% during the ERIP, undercutting\nthe Union prices by close to 20% during the same period (see recital (109)\nbelow). \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the substantial\nmarket share and continued significant undercutting in ERIP, it can be\nreasonably expected that the Chinese imports of substantial volumes would\ncontinue exercising significant price pressure on the Union industry should the\nmeasures be lifted.\n(b)         \nProduction capacity and spare capacity in\nthe PRC\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndata published in the US\nsunset review shows significant capacity in the PRC representing around 80% of\nthe Union consumption (2009). The Commission did not identify more recent\ninformation that would contradict the information collected by the US investigating authority. Given the lack of cooperation, the exact unused capacity could\nnot be established. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the information in\nthe expiry review request, the number of existing producers in the PRC remained\nhigh. Therefore, no indication on the decrease of the production capacity in\nthe PRC was thus identified.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, based on the information collected by the Commission from the US sunset review and confirmed by the findings of\nthe current expiry review with regard to the cooperating Chinese exporting\nproducer, additional capacity can be easily installed to meet an increase in\ndemand as the production is mainly labour based. Furthermore, the investigation\nrevealed that the producers manufacturing also other products than the product\nconcerned were able to switch easily between the production of other products\nand the production of the product concerned depending on demand. Therefore, if\nthe anti-dumping duty was revoked the Chinese producers would most likely be\nable to increase their production of ironing boards relatively quickly without\nany substantial investments required. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, on the basis of\nthe information available, it was concluded that there are at least potentially\nhigh capacities available in the PRC, which could be re-directed to the Union\nmarket should the anti-dumping measures be allowed to lapse. \n(c)         \nAttractiveness of the Union market and\nother third markets\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the low cooperation\nand unavailability of reliable data price comparison between the imports to the\n Union and to other third export markets as well as the Chinese domestic prices\ncould not be carried out. The indicative comparison based on facts available\nrevealed significant undercutting of the average Union prices by the Chinese\nimports (see recital (109) below). The Union market is therefore considered\nattractive for the Chinese exporting producers in terms of price.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, based on the\nfindings in the US sunset review, against which no contradicting information\nwas found, it can be considered that the Union is currently the largest export market\nfor the Chinese producers. The second largest export market, the US, remains closed to the Chinese exporting producers as the anti-dumping duties are\nsubstantial and have been recently extended until 2015. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The relatively stable and\nsubstantial market share of the Chinese imports despite the measures in place\nindicates that the Union continues to be an attractive export market for the\nChinese exporting producers. The closure of the US market, the second largest\nexport market, shows that the absorption capacity of third markets is limited.\nTherefore, the Union market is likely to be targeted by the Chinese exporting\nproducers should the anti-dumping measures against the PRC be lifted.\n(d)         \nPast behaviour\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information collected\nin the framework of the US sunset review shows that the Chinese producers are\nhighly export oriented. This seems to be partly confirmed by the findings of the\ncurrent expiry review where the sole exporting producer was not active in the\nChinese domestic market, but exclusively export oriented. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The extension of the\nanti-dumping measures by the US following the US sunset review is an indication\nthat the dumping practice of Chinese exporting producers on other markets may\nbe replicated on the Union market if the existing measures were to be lifted. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also,\nthe behaviour of a Chinese exporter that had benefitted in the past from a 0%\nduty rate, Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co, can be considered to be a strong indication of the likely\nbehaviour of the Chinese exporters, if the duties were lifted. Since Hardware, one\nof the largest Chinese exporting producers increased its market share on the\nUnion market by approximately 64% in volume, with established dumping of around\n52% and an undercutting of the Union industry prices of 16%[18]. In view of the attractiveness of the\nUnion market and available capacity in the PRC, this past behaviour indicates\nthat the dumped imports are likely to recur in substantial volumes if the\nmeasures were to be lifted. \n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion of the\nlikelihood of a continuation of dumping -the PRC\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the findings described above, it can be concluded that considering the\nsignificant production capacity available in the PRC, the ability of Chinese\nproducers to increase rapidly their production volumes and direct them for\nexport, the significant level of dumping and undercutting of such exports and\nthe attractiveness of the Union market for such exports, it is reasonable to\nassume that a repeal of the measures would result in increased exports at\ndumped levels of ironing boards from the PRC to the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping - expiry review \u2013 Ukraine\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General remarks\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\ncase of Ukraine, the sole\nknown Ukrainian exporting producer did not cooperate in the expiry review\ntherefore the facts available had to be used. Given the\noverlap between the expiry review and interim review investigation periods and\nconsidering that the Ukrainian\nexporting producer represented 100% of imports from Ukraine, the data collected and verified in the context of the interim review\nwas used as facts available in the parallel expiry, in\nagreement with that producer.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfindings of the interim review\ndescribed in the section 6 below were used as facts available for the purpose\nof the expiry review. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under\nArticle 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on\nthe basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value by type with the\nweighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product\nconcerned. This comparison did not show the existence of dumping\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likelihood of recurrence of\ndumping\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of likelihood of\nrecurrence of dumping the following elements were analysed: the volume and\nprices of dumped imports from Ukraine, attractiveness of the Union market and\nother third markets, production capacity and excess capacity available for\nexports of the Ukrainian producer.\n(a)         \nVolume and prices of dumped imports from Ukraine \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports of ironing boards\noriginating in Ukraine increased by 24%. The corresponding market share\nincreased slightly from 8% in 2008 to 10% in the expiry review investigation\nperiod. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period\nconsidered, imports prices followed the same trends as the sales prices of the\nUnion industry on the Union market. Overall, imports prices increased from 2008\nto the expiry review investigation period by 14%. \n(b)         \nAttractiveness of the Union market and\nother third markets\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the period\nconsidered, Ukrainian export prices to third countries were generally lower\nthan its prices on the Union market. This price difference was more than 10% of\nthe export price level during the expiry review investigation period. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ukrainian export prices to\nthird countries were generally below the price of Ukrainian exports to the Union which supports the conclusion that the Union market is attractive as the Union market\nmay generate higher profits. \n(c)         \nProduction capacity and excess capacity\navailable for exports of the Ukrainian producer\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the expiry review\ninvestigation period, Ukraine had only a small part of its production capacity\navailable for exports. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the information\ncollected during the investigation, Ukrainian capacity is not projected to\nincrease further. Therefore there is no likelihood that exports to the Union would increase should the measures be repealed.\n(d)         \nConclusion on the likelihood of\nrecurrence of dumping - Ukraine\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, in\nparticular the findings concerning the expected evolution of capacity, it was\nconsidered that there is no likelihood that Ukrainian exporting producer will\nresume exporting injurious quantities at dumped prices to the Union market in\nthe short to medium term should measures be repealed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping - interim review \u2013\n  Ukraine\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, it\nwas examined whether the total domestic sales volume of the like product to\nindependent customers were representative during the interim review\ninvestigation period, i.e. if the total volume of such sales represented 5 % or\nmore of their export sales volume of the product concerned to the Union. On\nthat basis, the domestic sales of the cooperating Ukrainian producer were\nconsidered to be overall representative.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission subsequently\nidentified those product types sold domestically that were identical or\ncomparable with the types sold for export to the Union.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For each product type sold\nby the exporting producer on its domestic market and found to be identical or\ncomparable with the product type sold for export to the Union, it was examined\nwhether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of\nArticle 2(2) of the basic Regulation. Domestic sales of a particular product\ntype were considered sufficiently representative when the total volume of that\nproduct type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the interim\nreview investigation period represented at least 5% of the total volume of the\ncomparable product type sold for export to the Union. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was subsequently\nexamined whether the domestic sales of the like product could be regarded as\nbeing made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the\nbasic Regulation, by establishing for each product type the proportion of\nprofitable sales to independent customers on the domestic market. \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the sales volume of a\nproduct type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost\nof production, represented more than 80% of the total sales volume of that\ntype, and where the weighted average sales price of that type was equal to or\nhigher than the unit cost of production, normal value was based on the actual\ndomestic price calculated as the weighted average of the prices of all domestic\nsales of that type made during the interim review investigation period,\nirrespective of whether those sales were profitable or not.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the volume of\nprofitable sales of a product type represented 80 % or less of the total sales\nvolume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below\nthe unit cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic\nprice, which was calculated as a weighted average price of only the profitable\ndomestic sales of that type made during the interim review investigation\nperiod.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the types of product that were not profitable,\nnormal value was constructed in accordance with Article 2(3) and 2(6) of the\nbasic Regulation. The normal value was constructed by adding to the cost of\nmanufacturing of the Ukrainian producer during the expiry review investigation\nperiod the weighted average selling, general and administrative expenses\n(SG&A) incurred in the ordinary course of trade and the weighted average\nprofit realised for the product types that were profitable. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nthe Ukrainian exporting producer made export sales to the Union directly to\nindependent customers in the Union, the export prices were based on the prices actually paid or\npayable for the product concerned, in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic\nRegulation. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The normal value and export\nprice were compared on an ex-works basis. For the purpose of ensuring a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the\nform of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price comparability\nin accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. Adjustments were made\nin respect of transport, insurance, handling and ancillary costs, packing,\ncredit, bank charges and commissions in all cases where demonstrated to affect\nprice comparability. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under Article\n2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on the basis\nof a comparison of the weighted average normal value by type with the weighted\naverage export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned. This\ncomparison did not show the existence of dumping.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lasting nature of the\nchanged circumstances \u2013 Ukraine\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(3) of the basic Regulation, it was also examined whether the changed\ncircumstances could reasonably be considered to be of a lasting nature. \n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lasting nature of the\nchanged circumstances\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUkrainian producer has restructured its sales organisation so that, since\nDecember 2010, all its export sales of the product concerned to the Union has\nbeen made directly to the independent customer without involving any related\nsales company. The calculation of the export prices was therefore adjusted to\ntake into account these new circumstances. \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These changes are\nconsidered to be of lasting nature since the tasks previously carried out by\nthe related company were effectively transferred to the Ukrainian producer for\na period of about one year. No indications pointing to possible future changes\nin the sales structure were found. Therefore, it is concluded that the changed\ncircumstances are of a lasting nature.\nD. DEFINITION OF THE UNION INDUSTRY\n\nUnion production\nand Union Industry\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The like product was\nmanufactured by an estimated 20-30 producers in the Union. They constitute the\nUnion industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation. \n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annual\nproduction of the Union industry was estimated on the basis of the findings\nmade in the investigation mentioned in recital (1) above concerning imports of\nironing boards of Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co, a Chinese exporting producer of ironing boards and of the\nbasis of the data submitted by the cooperating Union producers. As mentioned in\nrecital (65) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1243/2010 imposing anti-dumping\nmeasures on imports of the before mentioned exporting producer, the annual\nUnion production of ironing can be estimated at above 5 million pieces in 2009.\nThus, and in the absence of any other information, it was considered reasonable\nto assume that the total annual Union production amounted to 5 million pieces\nat the beginning of the period considered of the current expiry review (2008).\nThe development of the production volume over the period considered was\nestablished on the basis of the trends in production volume of the cooperating\nUnion producers. The Union production volume thus established amounted to an\nestimated 5,2 million pieces during the ERIP. \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital (20)\nabove, three Union producers were selected in the sample representing more than\n40 % of the total Union production of the like product. These sampled producers\nprovided questionnaire replies.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, four other\nUnion producers submitted basic information on their production and sales data.\n\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above seven Union\nproducers were found to account for more than 55%, of the total Union\nproduction of the like product.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion market for ironing boards is characterised by mostly small and medium\nproducers located in a number of Member States including\n Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nE. SITUATION ON THE UNION MARKET\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since there is only one\nexporting producer in Ukraine, Union consumption and some of the macroeconomic\nindicators are presented in indexed form or ranges, so as to protect\nconfidentiality pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption was established on the basis of the sales volumes of the Union\nindustry on the Union market as described in recital (100) and the import\nvolume as recorded in the 14(6) database. \n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfar as import volumes from the PRC are concerned, the data of the only\ncooperating Chinese exporter could not be used to extrapolate the total amount\nof imports from the PRC as they represented only a very small part of total\nimports from the PRC. Total import volume had therefore to be established on\nthe basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation. As the relevant CN codes in Eurostat cover more products than the\nproduct concerned, Eurostat was not considered suitable either to establish\nimport volumes from the PRC. Thus, in light of the extremely low cooperation of\nthe Chinese exporting producers and the lack of cooperation of unrelated\nimporters, the only reliable statistical source to determine import volumes was\nthe information contained in the 14(6) database. As import volumes in the 14(6)\ndatabase are however only reported in kg, the data had to be converted in\npieces (units) by using the conversion rate established for the imports from Ukraine in the parallel interim review. This was\nconsidered reasonable since the imports of the Chinese cooperating company were\nnot considered representative and in addition, as mentioned above in recital (36),\n  Ukraine was also used as an analogue country for determining normal value for\nthe PRC and therefore data were considered representative for the determination\nof the level of Chinese imports. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\ncase of imports from Ukraine the verified data reported in the questionnaire reply in the\nparallel interim review were used. Although the interim\ninvestigation period was set from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 and therefore\ndid not cover the first quarter of the expiry review investigation period, it\nwas found that that information is nevertheless suitable for the determination\nof the import volumes. Indeed, that information had been verified and was found\naccurate and representative for the determination of import volumes from Ukraine in the expiry review investigation period.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsales volumes of the Union industry on the Union market were estimated by\nextrapolating the ratio between total production volume and total sales volume\nof the seven cooperating Union producers to the total estimated production\nvolume of the Union industry for each year of the period considered. \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis, Union consumption decreased between 2008 and the ERIP by 11 %. In\ndetails, the apparent demand decreased by 7 percentage points between 2008 and\n2009, where after it increased by 9 percentage point between 2009 and 2010.\nDuring the ERIP the Union consumption totalled 9 to 10 million pieces,\nrepresenting a decrease of 13 percentage points as compared to the previous\nyear. \n Table 1 || \n Volume ('000 pieces) || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Consumption || 10,000 - 11,000 || 9,000 - 10,000 || 10,000 - 11,000 || 9,000 - 10,000 \n Index || 100 || 93 || 102 || 89 \n Source: 14(6) database, questionnaire replies   ||   ||   ||   || \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from countries\nconcerned\nCumulative assessment of the effects of the\nimports from the countries concerned \n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 In the original investigation\nconcluded in 2007, imports originating in the PRC and Ukraine were assessed cumulatively in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation.\nIt was examined whether a cumulative assessment was also appropriate in the\ncurrent expiry review.\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it was\nfound that the dumping margin established for imports from the PRC was above\nthe de minimis level (11,5%) as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic\nRegulation. As regards the imports from Ukraine, no dumping was established for\nthe ERIP and no likelihood of recurrence of dumping. On these grounds the\nimports from Ukraine should be de-cumulated from the imports from The PRC,\nsince the criteria set out in Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation are not met.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the PRC \n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned above in recital (98), given the extremely low cooperation of the\nChinese exporting producers, total imports volume from the PRC was established\non the basis of the information available in the 14(6) data base in accordance\nwith Article 18 of the basic Regulation.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, imports of\nthe product concerned from the PRC decreased in absolute terms from [4 to 4,5\nmillion pieces] in 2008 to [1,5 to 2,0 million pieces] in the ERIP, which\nrepresented a decrease of 59% during the period considered. This decrease was\nparticularly pronounced between 2010 and the ERIP where imports from the PRC\ndecreased from [3 to 3,5 million] in 2010 to [1,5 to 2,0 million pieces] in the\nERIP, by 36 percentage points. This decrease coincides with the re-introduction\nof the anti-dumping duty on Since Hardware in December 2010 (see rectial (64)\nabove).\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 While\nmarket shares of Chinese imports decreased by 22 percentage points during the\nperiod considered, the market share held during the ERIP, i.e. 15-20%; was substantial. \n Table 2 \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Volumes of imports subject to measures from the PRC ('000 pieces) || 4,000 - 4,500 || 3,000 - 3,500 || 3,000 - 3,500 || 1,500 - 2,000 \n Index || 100 || 73 || 76 || 40 \n Market share of imports subject to measures from the PRC || 40% - 45% || 30% - 35% || 30% - 35% || 15% - 20% \n Source: Article 14(6) database ||   ||   ||   ||   \n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices and price\nundercutting\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Due\nto the extremely low cooperation of the Chinese exporting producers, the\naverage import price regarding imports from the PRC had to be established on\nthe basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation, i.e. on the basis of the information contained in the 14(6)\ndatabase. Information recorded therein were converted into price/piece\nfollowing the above mentioned methodology (see recital (104) above).

On this basis, the volume of imports from other\nthird countries increased considerably in the period considered and reached [1,5-1,9]\nmillion pieces in the ERIP, translating in a market share of in the range of\n15-20% during the ERIP. Most of these imports came from Turkey where imports increased from [0,3 \u2013 0,5] million pieces in 2008 to [0,8 \u2013 1,0]\nmillion pieces in the ERIP.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 The average price of imports\nfrom other third countries without measures increased from 7,7 EUR/piece in\n2008 to 9,0 EUR/piece during the ERIP, i.e. an increase of 17%.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 3(5) of\nthe basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on\nthe Union industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices\nhaving a bearing on the state of the Union industry during the period\nconsidered.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above in\nrecital (20) sampling was used for the examination of the possible injury\nsuffered by the Union industry. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of the\ninjury analysis, the injury indicators have been established at two levels: \n\u2013              \nthe macroeconomic indicators (production, production\ncapacity, capacity utilisation, productivity, sales volume, market share,\ngrowth, employment, and magnitude of dumping margins and recovery from past\ndumping) were assessed at the level of the whole Union production, estimated on\nthe basis of the information collected from the producers that came forward; \n\u2013              \nthe analysis of microeconomic indicators\n(average unit prices, unit costs, stocks, labout costs, profitability, return\non investments, cash flow, ability to raise capital and investments) was\ncarried out on the basis of information provided by the three sampled Union\nproducers.\n10.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macroeconomic indicators\n(a)         \nProduction\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Total\nUnion production was estimated as described above in recital (91) On this basis,\nthe Union production increased by 4% between 2008 and the ERIP. More\nspecifically, it decreased by 2% between 2008 and 2009 but increased by 6\npercentage points between 2009 and ERIP to around 5,2 million units. \n Table 7 \n in '000 pieces || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Production || 5,000 || 4,887 || 5,072 || 5,194 \n Index || 100 || 98 || 101 || 104 \nSource: Questionnaire replies\n(b)         \nProduction capacity and capacity utilisation\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity was\nestimated by applying the ratio between total production volume and total\ncapacity of the seven cooperating Union producers for each year of the period\nconsidered to the total production of the Union industry as established above\nin recital (122) above. \n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 The production capacity of\nthe Union industry increased by 17 % throghout the period considered. However\nthis increase is only related to one of the Union producers whereas the other\ncooperating Union producers had stable capacities over the period considered. The\nfindings of the investigation indicate that some of the non-cooperating Union\nproducers may have closed down their production facilities thereby decreasing\nthe total Union production capacity during the period considered which is not\nreflected in table 8 below. The investigation revealed also that the Union\nindustry produced other products than the product concerned (such as dryers)\npartly on the same production lines. Furthermore, the investigation has shown\nthat Union producers can switch easily between production of the product\nconcerned and other products. It was therefore not possible to clearly\nestablish production capacity of the product concerned.\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 Capacity utilisation was 66%\nin 2008 and dropped slightly to 58% during the ERIP. As indicated in the\npreceding recital, total production capacity in the Union could not be reliably\nestablished. As capacity utilisation is established on the basis of total\ncapacity, likewise, it cannot necessarily be considered as a meaningful injury\nindicator in this case.\n Table 8 \n in '000 pieces || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Production capacity || 7,592 || 7,962 || 8,375 || 8,906 \n Index || 100 || 105 || 110 || 117 \n Capacity utilisation || 66% || 61% || 61% || 58% \n Index || 100 || 93 || 92 || 89 \nSource: Questionnaire replies\n(c)         \nSales volume\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 Sales\nvolume of the Union industry was established as described in recital (100)\nabove. Thus, sales volume of the Union industry to unrelated customers on the\nUnion market increased by 10 % between 2008 and the ERIP. This increase was particularly pronounced between 2010 and the ERIP,\nwhere sales volumes increased by 7 percentage points. This coincides with a\ndecrease in imports from the PRC due to the imposition of the anti-dumping duty\non Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Table 9 \n in '000 pieces || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Sales to unrelated customers in the Union || 4,300 - 4,500 || 4,300 - 4,500 || 4,500 - 4,700 || 4,800 - 5,000 \n Index || 100 || 99 || 103 || 110 \nSource: Questionnaire replies\n(d)         \nMarket share\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 During the period\nconsidered, the Union industry regained market share, which increased from\n40-45% in 2008 to 50-55% in the ERIP, i.e. by 24%.

Likewise,\nproduction of the Union industry increased by 4%, investment more than doubled\n(recital (141) below) and employment increased 10% (recital (129) below) during\nthe same period.

However, the Union\nindustry was not in a position to increase its prices to sustainable levels but\nwas forced to match prices with the low priced Chinese imports to re-gain\nmarket share in a period of declining consumption.\n(b)         \nLabour cost\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 The average wages were\nstable over the period considered, while the unit cost of production increased\nby 3% (table 13 above). \n Table 14 || \n EUR / employee || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Average wage || 20,669 || 19,377 || 19,885 || 20,523 \n Index || 100 || 94 || 96 || 99 \n Source: Questionnaire replies ||   ||   ||   ||   || \n(c)         \nStocks\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 Volume of stocks increased\nduring the period considered.

However, profitability decreased again\nin 2010 and even further during the ERIP where it reached -1.7%. Overall, the\nprofitability decreased by almost 2% over the period considered. As mentioned\nabove in recital (134) this was mainly due to the fact, that the Union industry\nwas not able to increase its sales prices in line with the increase in costs as\nit was forced to match the low Chinese import prices to re-gain its market\nshare. \n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 The return on investments\n(ROI), expressed as the profit in percent of the net book value of investments,\nbroadly followed the profitability trend. It increased between 2008 and 2009,\nand from 2009 to the ERIP it decreased.

It increased sharply between 2008\nand 2009. The increase in investments can be explained by the restructuring\nefforts made by the Union industry by investing in their production process to\nmake it more competitive. Between 2010 and the ERIP there was a decrease while\nthe level of investments remained considerably higher when compared to 2008.\n Table 18 \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || ERIP (2011) \n Net investments ( 000 EUR) || 239 || 504 || 1046 || 569 \n Index || 100 || 211 || 438 || 239 \n Source: Questionnaire replies   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of the\nmacro-economic indicators showed signs of improvement in particular in terms of\nproduction and sales volumes as well as the Union industry\u2019s market share over the\nperiod considered. At the same time some of the relevant micro-economic\nindicators decreased such as profitability and return on investments. Sales\nprices, although increasing slighlty could not reach sustainable levels and\nmatch the increase in the production cost. This is mainly explained by the fact\nthat the market share of the Chinese imports remained at high levels throughout\nthe period considered, whereas the Chinese imports also were at low prices\nwhich the Union industry had to follow to re-gain market share. \n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the measures\nagainst the PRC had only partly helped the Union industry to recover from the\ninjury suffered. \n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above\nanalysis, the situation of the Union industry has improved and no material\ninjury was taking place. Nevertheless, despite apparent positive trends and the\nsignificant restructuring efforts, the Union industry is still fragile and\nvulnerable. \nF.

The import volumes of the product\nconcerned from the PRC would most likely increase without measures at prices\nsignificantly undercutting the Union industry\u2019s sales prices on the Union\nmarket. The investigation has shown that the main customers of the Union\nindustry are retailers, i.e. large supermarkets which are in a strong\nnegotiation position and will increasingly source ironing boards from the PRC\nthat will very likely enter the market at very low dumped prices. Therefore,\nthe price pressure on the Union industry would likely aggravate, and it will be\nforced to lower its prices with disastrous effect on their profitability\nsituation which was already negative during the ERIP. \n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, against the fragile and\nvulnerable situation of the Union industry, the increased volumes and price\neffects of the dumped imports from the PRC would result in heavy financial\nlosses and decrease of market share.\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 The behaviour of a Chinese\nexporter that had benefitted in the past from a 0% duty rate, Since Hardware\n(Guangzhou) Co, can be considered to be a strong indication of the likely\nbehaviour of Chinese exporters, if the duties were lifted. It is recalled that\nSince Hardware (Guangzhou) Co, which benefitted from a 0% duty in the past\n(from April 2007 to December 2010) significantly increased its exports to the Union at substantially dumped prices undercutting the Union industry prices during that\nperiod. As mentioned before, an anti-dumping investigation regarding this\ncompany resulted in the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty of 35,8%.\nThis investigation also concluded that the volume of imports from this company\nduring the investigation period of that investigation (2009) had doubled when\ncompared to the imports of the same company during the investigation period of\nthe original investigation concluded in 2007 (2005). The investigation with\nregard to Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co concluded that as a consequence the\nUnion industry suffered material injury. \n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the investigation\nshowed that, prior to the initiation of the present expiry review, Chinese\nexporting producers already approached potential customers in the Union with\nprice offers significantly undercutting the Union industry\u2019s sales price. This\nshows that it is very likely that the Chinese exporting producers would attempt\nto enter the Union market in increased quantities by lowering their current\nprice levels if measures would be allowed to lapse.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket, existing measures in other third countries and spare capacity\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above in\nrecitals (55) to (57), the Chinese industry of ironing boards is highly export\noriented and, even after the imposition of the measures, the Union remains\ntheir largest and most attractive market. \n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 For the Chinese exporting\nproducers the US the second largest export market. However, access to the US market remains restricted due to the existence of high anti-dumping measures which were\nextended until 2015. This reinforces the likelihood that imports from the PRC\nwould be directed to the Union market in increased quantities should measures\nnot be maintained. \n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the information\ncollected by the Commission from the US sunset review, there are potentially substantial\nspare capacities available in the PRC and further additional capacity can be\neasily increased in case the anti-dumping duties were revoked as the production\nof ironing boards in the PRC is labour intensive and any increase in production\ndoes not require important investments or specific skills. Therefore, on the\nbasis of all the information available, it was concluded that there are at\nleast potentially substantial spare capacities available in the PRC, which\ncould be re-directed to the Union market should the anti-dumping measures be\nallowed to lapse.\n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other factors\n15.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-dumped imports from the\nPRC\n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above, during\nthe ERIP no dumping was found for the only cooperating Chinese exporter which\nhas an individual duty of 22,7%. However, since the imports of this company\nrepresented only a minimal proportion of the total Chinese import volume, they\ncould not be considered as significant and could not be considered as having\ncontributed to the fragile situation of the Union industry during the ERIP.\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also established that\nimports from this company were not undercutting the prices of the Union\nindustry during the ERIP.\n15.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from Ukraine\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above, imports\nof ironing boards originating in Ukraine increased by 24%. This resulted in a\nslight increase of the corresponding market over the period considered. \n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the average import\nprice increased from 2008 to the ERIP by 14%, and reached the same price level\nthan the Union industry in the Union market during the ERIP. \n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the fragile\nsituation of the Union industry cannot be explained by the imports of ironing\nboards from Ukraine. Likewise, it is not likely that imports from the Ukraine would contribute to the recurrence of injury should measures be allowed to lapse.\n1.1.                \n15.3.\u00a0 Imports from other third countries\nnot subject to measures\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 Import volume from other\nthird countries not subject measures increased over the period considered,\nthough there was a slight decrease between 2010 and the ERIP. This increase in\nimport volume also translated into an increase in market share during the same\nperiod, from 5-10% to 15-20%. \n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 Although price levels of\nother third countries\u2019 imports were below the average prices of the Union\nindustry, they were above the average import prices from The PRC as established\nduring the current investigation.\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the above, Chinese\nimports are likely to increase significantly at dumped prices undercutting the\nUnion industry`s prices. Indeed, the investigation revealed that the average\nimport prices from the PRC without anti-dumping duty were undercutting the\nUnion industry\u2019s sales prices on the Union market by about 20%. Thus, Chinese\nimports are expected entering the Union market at prices lower than the average\nprice of the imports from other third countries, should measures be allowed to\nlapse, as it was already the case during the ERIP. Therefore, it was concluded\nthat imports from third country markets although having had some impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry, cannot invalidate the conclusion of the likelihood\nof recurrence of injurious dumping from Chinese imports should measures be\nallowed to lapse. \n15.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease in consumption\n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the apparent\ndecrease in consumption between 2010 and the ERIP is mainly the statistical\neffect of the decrease in imports caused the imposition of anti-dumping\nmeasures against Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co. During the same period, the\nUnion industry was able to increase its sales volume and market share.\nTherefore, the decrease in consumption could not have had an impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry. \n16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the liklihood\nof recurrecne of injury\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation\nestablished a likelihood of recurrence of injury should measures be allowed to\nlapse.\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nlevel of dumping still exercised by the Chinese exporting producers, the\nattractiveness of the Union market, the past behaviour of the Chinese exporting\nproducer Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co evidenced in the investigation concluded\nin December 2010, the possibility for Chinese producers to increase capacity\neasily in case of increased demand, the strong export orientation of Chinese\nproducers and their price strategies, in the event that measures were allowed\nto lapse, it is likely that the Union industry would be confronted with an\nincrease of dumped Chinese imports, significantly undercutting the Union\nindustry's prices. In such case, not only the already difficult situation of\nthe Union industry in terms of profitability is expected to worsen, but also\nsome of the recent improvements in the overall performance of the Union\nindustry are likely to reverse.\nG. UNION INTEREST\n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 In compliance with Article\n21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the imposition of\nanti-dumping measures on imports of ironing boards originating in the PRC\nfollowing the findings of the present expiry review would not be in the\ninterest of the Union as a whole. The determination of the Union interest was\nbased on an appreciation of all the various interests involved. All interested\nparties were given the opportunity to make their views known pursuant to\nArticle 21(2) of the basic Regulation. \n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 The present investigation is\na review that analyses a situation in which anti-dumping measures have already\nbeen in place. Therefore, it allows the assessment of any undue negative impact\non the parties concerned by the current anti-dumping measures.\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also noted that it is\nproposed to terminate the anti-dumping proceeding with regards to imports of\nironing boards originating in Ukraine which leads to an increased access of\nimports of third countries without restrictions to the Union market.\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\nexamined whether, despite the conclusions on the likelihood of recurrence of\ninjurious dumping, compelling reasons existed which would lead to the conclusion\nthat it is not in the Union interest to maintain measures against imports\noriginating in the PRC.\n18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry \n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry has\nproven to be a viable industry. This was confirmed by the positive development\nof its economic situation observed during the period considered partly due to\nits efforts to be more competitive and the measures in place. It can reasonably\nbe expected that the Union industry will continue to benefit from the measures\nto be maintained. Should the measures against imports originating in the PRC\nnot be maintained, it is likely that the Union industry will suffer material\ninjury from substantial volumes of dumped imports from the PRC, causing a\nserious deterioration of its financial situation given the undercutting margins\nestablished during the ERIP. The currently already negative profitability rates,\nreturn on investments and stocks will further decline and ultimately lead to\nthe likely disappearance of the Union industry.\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is concluded\nthat the maintenance of anti-dumping measures against the PRC would be clearly\nin the interest of the Union industry.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of other parties\n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the 15 contacted\nimporters/traders cooperated. None of other potential interested parties made\nthemselves known during the investigation. There is no evidence suggesting that\nthe measures in force would considerably affect the importers or consumers of\nthe product concerned. In this context, it can be reasonably assumed that the\nmain customers, i.e. large retail stores, will be able to pass on any price\nincrease resulting from anti-dumping duties to the final consumer without\nimpacting substantially on consumer\u2019s perception. \n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it can be\nconcluded that there are no compelling reasons clearly indicating that\nmaintaining the measures against the PRC would be against the overall Union\ninterest.\nH. ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to\nrecommend that the existing measures be maintained on imports of the product\nconcerned originating in the PRC and the repeal of the measures in force on imports\nof the product concerned originating in Ukraine. They were also granted a\nperiod to make representations.\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\nthat, as provided for by Article 11(2) and Article 11(3) of the basic\nRegulation, the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of ironing boards\noriginating in the People\u2019s Republic of the PRC should be maintained and the\nanti-dumping duty in force on imports of ironing boards originating in Ukraine\nshould be allowed to lapse.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive anti-dumping\nduty is hereby imposed on imports of ironing boards, whether or not free-standing,\nwith or without a steam soaking and/or heating top and/or blowing top,\nincluding sleeve boards, and essential parts thereof, i.e. the legs, the top\nand the iron rest, currently falling within CN codes ex 3924 90 00, ex 4421 90\n98, ex 7323 93 00, ex 7323 99 00, ex 8516 79 70 and ex 8516 90 00 (TARIC codes\n3924 90 00 10, 4421 90 98 10, 7323 93 00 10, 7323 99 00 10, 8516 79 70 10 and\n8516 90 00 51) and originating in the People's Republic of China. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive\nanti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price, before\nduty, for products described in paragraph 1 and manufactured by the companies\nlisted below shall be as follows: \n Country || Manufacturer || Rate of duty(%) || TARIC additional code \n People\u2019s Republic of China || Foshan City Gaoming Lihe Daily Necessities Co.
