In order to assure\r\nthe quality and the coverage of intra-EU trade statistics, it is proposed to\r\ncollect information on movements of these goods through the Intrastat system.\nFurthermore, intra-EU trade statistics\r\ncould, in terms of quality of the statistics and the efficiency of the system, also\r\nbenefit from an increased exchange of confidential data between the relevant\r\nnational authorities of the Member States. Such exchanges for statistical\r\npurposes only, should therefore be explicitly allowed.\nA uniform definition of the data element\r\n\u201cstatistical value\u201d is necessary in all trade in goods statistics at Union\r\nlevel. It is therefore proposed to align the current definition of this data\r\nelement in intra-EU trade statistics with that of the extra-EU trade statistics.\n\u00b7      (iii) Streamlining of the European Statistical System\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics[4] defined the European Statistical System (ESS) as the partnership between the European\r\nstatistical authority, which is the Commission (Eurostat), and the national\r\nstatistical institutes (NSIs) and other national authorities responsible in\r\neach Member State for developing, producing and disseminating European statistics.\nThe European Statistical System Committee\r\n(ESSC), set up under Article 7 of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 223/2009, is regarded as the umbrella committee\r\nwithin the ESS. It assists the Commission in exercising its implementing powers\r\nfor certain statistical domains. These exclude international trade in goods statistics. \nIn this domain, the Committee for the\r\nstatistics on the trading of goods between Member States (Intrastat Committee) assists\r\nthe Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004. \nThe Commission is proposing a new ESS structure to improve\r\ncoordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with\r\nthe ESSC as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate\r\ncomitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012[5], the ESSC supported this new\r\napproach.\nTherefore it is also proposed to amend Regulation\r\n(EC) No 638/2004 by replacing reference\r\nto the Intrastat Committee by a\r\nreference to the ESSC. \n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 338 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union. \n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\r\nIMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNone.\n\u00b7      European Economic Area\nN/A \n2013/0278 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 on\r\nCommunity statistics relating to trading of goods between Member States as\r\nregards conferring of delegated and implementing powers upon the Commission for\r\nthe adoption of certain measures, the communication of information by the\r\ncustoms administration, the exchange of confidential data between Member States\r\nand the definition of statistical value. \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u201cthe Treaty\u201d),\r\nthe powers conferred upon the Commission should be aligned with Articles 290\r\nand 291 of the Treaty.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In connection with the\r\nadoption of Regulation (EU) No\r\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\r\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\r\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[6], the Commission has committed\r\nitself[7]\r\nto reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty, legislative\r\nacts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with\r\nscrutiny. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on\r\nCommunity statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and\r\nrepealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91[8]\r\nconfers powers upon the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions\r\nof this Regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of the\r\nalignment of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 with the new rules of the Treaty,\r\nimplementing powers currently conferred upon the Commission should be provided\r\nfor by conferring powers on the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing\r\nacts.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to provide a satisfactory response to users' needs for statistical\r\ninformation without imposing excessive burdens on economic operators, to take\r\ninto account changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to\r\nset up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of\r\nstatistics, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the\r\nadoption of different or specific rules applying to\r\nspecific goods or movements, the adaptation of the\r\nreference period, the adaptation of the Intrastat coverage rates, the\r\nspecification of the conditions for defining the thresholds referred to in\r\nArticle 10(4), the definition of the conditions for simplifying the information\r\nto be provided for small individual transactions, the definition of the aggregated\r\ndata and the definition of the criteria with which the results of the estimates\r\nshould comply. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\r\nimportance that the Commission carries out the appropriate consultations during\r\nits preparatory work, including at expert level. When preparing and drawing-up\r\ndelegated acts, the Commission should ensure the simultaneous, timely and\r\nappropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that these delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on the Member States and on the respondent units.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission enabling it to adopt the\r\narrangements for collecting information, particularly concerning the codes to\r\nbe used, technical provisions for compiling annual statistics on trade by\r\nbusiness characteristics and any measures necessary to ensure that the quality\r\nof the statistics transmitted is according to the quality criteria. These\r\npowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Committee for the statistics on the trading of goods between Member\r\nStates (Intrastat Committee) referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No\r\n638/2004 provides advice to the Commission and assists it in exercising its\r\nimplementing powers.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the strategy for a\r\nnew European Statistical System (hereinafter referred to as 'ESS') structure intended\r\nto improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the\r\nESS, the European Statistical System Committee (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as 'ESSC'), established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics[9], should have an advisory role\r\nand assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 638/2004\r\nshould be amended by replacing the reference to the Intrastat Committee with a\r\nreference to the ESSC. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simplifications of customs\r\nclearance schemes have led to the non-availability, at customs level, of\r\nstatistical information about goods under customs processing procedures. To assure\r\ncoverage of the data, movements of those goods should be included in the\r\nIntrastat system.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exchange of confidential\r\ndata relating to intra-EU trade statistics should be allowed between Member\r\nStates with a view to increasing the efficiency of the development, production\r\nand dissemination or to improving the quality of those statistics. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The definition of statistical\r\nvalue should be clarified and aligned with the definition of this data element\r\nunder the extra-EU trade statistics. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate to lay down rules\r\non the communication of information by the customs administration, the exchange\r\nof confidential data between MS and the definition of statistical value in the\r\ndomain of intra-EU trade statistics. This Regulation does not go beyond what is\r\nnecessary to achieve that objective, in accordance with Article 5(4) of the\r\nTreaty on the European Union. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure legal certainty,\r\nprocedures for the adoption of measures which have been initiated but not\r\ncompleted before the entry into force of this Regulation should not affected by\r\nthis Regulation.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 638/2004\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 638/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 3, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.
