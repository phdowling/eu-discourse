The present proposal responds to this mandate\nand aims to contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy.\nThe implementation reports[1] of Directives 2005/71/EC of 12\nOctober 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for\nthe purposes of scientific research[2]\nand Directive 2004/114 of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of\nthird-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange,\nunremunerated training or voluntary service[3]\nhave shown a number of weaknesses of these instruments. These shortcomings concern\nkey issues such as admission procedures including visas, rights (including\nmobility aspects) and procedural safeguards. The current rules are\ninsufficiently clear or binding, not always fully coherent with existing EU\nfunding programmes, and sometimes fail to address the practical difficulties\nthat applicants face. When combined, these problems put into question whether\nthird-country nationals consistently receive fair treatment under the existing\ninstruments.\nDirective 2004/114/EC on students lays down mandatory\nrules for the admission of third-country national students, with an option for\nMember States to apply the Directive for school pupils, volunteers and\nunremunerated trainees. Directive 2005/71/EC on researchers provides for a fast\ntrack procedure for the admission of third-country researchers who have\ncompleted a hosting agreement with a research organisation approved by the Member State.\nThe need to improve the current rules is reinforced by\nthe fact that circumstances and policy context are very different today than\nwhen the Directives were adopted. In the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy\nand the need to ensure smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, human capital\nrepresents one of Europe's key assets. Immigration from outside the EU is one\nsource of highly skilled people, and third-country national students and researchers\nin particular are groups which are increasingly sought after. Fostering\npeople-to-people contacts and mobility are also important elements of the EU\u2019s\nexternal policy, notably vis-\u00e0-vis the countries of the European Neighbourhood\nPolicy or the EU\u2019s strategic partners.\nThe present proposal aims at improving the provisions of\nthird-country national researchers, students, school pupils, unremunerated trainees\nand volunteers, and applying common provisions to two new groups of\nthird-country nationals: remunerated trainees and au-pairs. The proposal takes\nthe form of a Directive amending and recasting Directives 2004/114/EC and\n2005/71/EC. Its overall objective is to support social, cultural and economic\nrelationships between the EU and third countries, foster\nthe transfer of skills and know-how and promote competitiveness while, at the same time, provide for safeguards ensuring fair treatment of these\ngroups of third-country nationals.\n\u00b7      General context\nThe EU is facing important structural challenges\nof both demographic and economic nature. The working age population has\npractically stopped growing and over the next couple of years it will start\nshrinking. For both economic and demographic reasons\nthe observed patterns of employment growth with emphasis on skilled labour will\npersist during the decade ahead. The EU is also facing a\nsituation of 'innovation emergency'.\nEurope is spending 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan every year on Research & Development (R&D). Thousands of the best researchers\nand innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more favorable.\nAlthough the EU market is the largest in the world, it remains fragmented and\nnot enough innovation-friendly. The Europe 2020\nStrategy and its Innovation Union flagship initiative set the goal of increased\ninvestment in research and innovation, requiring an estimated extra one million\nmore research jobs in Europe. Immigration from outside\nthe EU is one source of highly skilled people, and third-country national\nstudents and researchers in particular are groups which are increasingly sought\nafter and which the EU needs to actively attract. Third-country national\nstudents and researchers can contribute to a pool of well-qualified potential\nworkers and human capital that the EU needs to cope with the above-mentioned\nchallenges.\nThe EU Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM) sets the\noverarching framework of the EU\u2019s external migration policy. It defines how the\nEU organises its dialogue and cooperation with non-EU countries in the area of\nmigration and mobility. The GAMM aims to contribute \u2013 inter alia \u2013 to the\nachievement of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular through its objective of\nbetter organising legal migration and fostering well-managed mobility (alongside\nits other pillars dealing with irregular migration, migration and development\nand international protection). Particularly relevant in this context are the\nMobility Partnerships, which offer a tailor-made bilateral frameworks for\ncooperation between the EU and selected non-EU countries (notably in the EU neighbourhood),\npotentially also containing measures and programmes for promoting the mobility\nof the groups addressed in this proposal for Directive.\nAllowing third-country nationals to acquire\nskills and knowledge through a period of training in Europe encourages \u201cbrain\ncirculation\u201d and supports cooperation with third countries, which benefits both\nthe sending and the receiving countries. Globalization\ncalls for enhanced relationships between EU enterprises and foreign markets,\nwhile movements of trainees and au-pairs foster the development of human\ncapital, result in mutual enrichment for the migrants,\ntheir country of origin and the host country and an improved mutual familiarity\nbetween cultures. However, in absence of a clear legal framework, there is also\na risk of exploitation to which trainees and au-pairs are particularly exposed,\nwith the subsequent risk of unfair competition.\nWith a view to better optimise those\nbenefits and to properly tackle those risks, and taking account of the\nsimilarities of the challenges faced by these categories of migrants, the\npresent proposal amends Council Directive 2004/114/EC on the conditions of\nadmission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil\nexchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service, extending its scope to\nremunerated trainees and au-pairs and making mandatory provisions on\nunremunerated trainees that are currently discretionary, as well as Council\nDirective 2005/71/EC on a specific procedure for admitting third-country\nnationals for the purposes of scientific research.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nCouncil Directive 2004/114/EC provides\ncommon rules regarding the conditions of entry and stay of third-country national\nstudents. However, according to Article 3 of Directive 2004/114/EC, Member States\nare free to decide, on an optional basis, whether they apply the Directive to\nthird-country nationals who apply to be admitted for the purposes of pupil\nexchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service. \nThe conditions for the admission of\nremunerated trainees are also addressed by the 1994 Council Resolution on\nlimitations on admission of third-country nationals on the territory of the\nMember States for employment[4].\nIt provides a general definition of trainees and a maximum period of stay. \nCouncil Directive 2005/71/EC provides a specific\nprocedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific\nresearch.\nThe recommendation of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 28 September 2005[5]\nproposes measures to facilitate the issue by the Member States of uniform\nshort-stay visas for researchers from third countries travelling within the\nCommunity for the purpose of carrying out scientific research.\nThe format of a residence permit for\nthird-country national is laid down in EC Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002. It is\napplicable to this proposal.\nAs regards au-pairs, the European Agreement\non \"au pair\" Placement of 24 November 1969[6], drawn up by the Council of\nEurope, provides a set of European rules. However, the majority of Member\nStates have not ratified this Agreement.\n\u00b7      Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe provisions in this proposal are\nconsistent with and supportive of the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and\nthe EU Global Approach to Migration and Mobility. In addition, setting up\ncommon admission procedures and securing a legal status for trainees and\nau-pairs can serve as a safeguard from exploitation.\nThis proposal is also in line with one of\nthe objectives of the EU action on education, which is to promote the Union as a world centre of excellence for education and international relations and to\nshare knowledge better around the world as a means of helping to disseminate\nthe values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.\nThe proposal also complies with the EU's\ndevelopment policy's focus on eradication of poverty and the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals. In particular, its provisions on mobility of\ntrainees between the EU and home countries would allow reliable inflows of\nremittances and transfer of skills and investments. \nThis proposal has positive effects on\nfundamental rights, as it strengthens third-country nationals' procedural\nrights and recognises and safeguards the rights of remunerated trainees and\nau-pairs. In this respect, it is consistant with the rights and principles\nrecognized by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, notably with Article 7 on the\nright to respect of private and family life, Article 12 on freedom of assembly\nand association, Article 15(1) on freedom to choose occupation and the right to\nengage in work, Article 15(3) on equal working conditions, Article 21(2) on\nnon-discrimination, Article 31 on fair and just working conditions, Article 34\non social security and social assistance and Article 47 on the right to an\neffective remedy and to a fair trial.\n2. CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT\nASSESSMENT\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nDiscussions with the Member States took\nplace within the framework of meetings of the Committee on Immigration and\nAsylum (CIA). First, on the findings of the implementation reports and,\nsecondly, in the context of the preparation of this initiative, where, in\naddition, Member States submitted their written contributions in response to\nquestions circulated before the CIA meeting. \nConsultation of relevant stakeholders\nincluded workshops organized by European Audiovisual Culture Education Agency\n(EACEA) with the Erasmus Mundus community on visa and on Erasmus Mundus Joint\nDoctorates, workshops and discussions with National Platforms of youth exchange\norganisations (including school pupil and volunteering organisations), and a workshop\non the views of the research Community in a meeting of the EURAXESS bridgehead\norganizations[7].\nSeveral workshops were organized by the\nEuropean Migration Network (EMN) on international students' mobility, EMN\nAd-hoc queries[8]\nas well as a large-scale study on: \"Immigration of International Students\nto the EU\".[9]\n\nAn online public consultation was launched\non 1 June 2012 through IPM[10]\nand 1461 replies were received. A very large majority of respondents (91%)\nthought that the attractiveness of the EU as a destination for researchers\nshould be improved, with 87% saying the same for students. For both groups the\nbiggest issues were seen to be visas and residence permits. Over 70% of\nrespondents thought that the attractiveness of the EU should also be improved\nfor school pupils, volunteers and unremunerated trainees. There was no\ngeographical bias between responses from within or outside the EU. \nFinally, the relevant results of the public\nconsultation of the European Research Area framework Communication[11] as well as the results of\nErasmus Mundus Visa Survey of Erasmus Mundus Alumni and students carried out by\nthe Erasmus Mundus Students and Alumni Association (EMA)[12] at the request of European\nAudiovisual, Education and Culture Agency (EACEA) were also taken into account.\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise in addition to\nthe data collected as indicated above.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe following options were considered:\nOption 1 (baseline): No change to the existing\nsituation\nDifferent and diverging solutions with respect to admission\nconditions, in particular visa, would continue to be implemented by the Member\nStates acting independently. The lack of clarity and transparency on these\naspects would remain. Problems with procedural safeguards would continue, and\nconditions to exercise intra-EU mobility (in particular in the case of\nstudents) would remain restrictive, whereas remunerated trainees would not be\ncovered at all by EU legislation. Similarly, regarding access to the labour\nmarket for students and researchers following graduation/finalisation of their\nstudies/research, different approaches would continue to apply across the EU.\nOption 2: Increased communication efforts (in particular in case of\nresearchers), and strengthened enforcement of the current rules\nThis option includes better provision of and access to information\nto increase the transparency of existing rules and making them better used.\nThere could also be increased efforts in raising awareness about best practices\namong Member States in admitting and protecting groups which are currently not\ncovered by existing Directives, i.e. au pairs and remunerated trainees. A more\nsystematic exercise of ensuring that Member States understand and respect their\nobligations under these Directives would be carried out.\nOption 3: Improvement of admission conditions, rights and procedural\nguarantees\nThis option mainly includes improvements for students, school\npupils, volunteers and unremunerated trainees as it makes admission conditions\ncomparable to those that apply for researchers and brings some of the rights to\nthe standard enjoyed by researchers. This option would make rules for the\ncurrently optional groups of school pupils, volunteers and unremunerated\ntrainees mandatory. Member States would be obliged to\ngrant every facility to obtain the requisite visas to the third-country\nnational (students and other categories) who has submitted an application and\nmeets the admission conditions. There would also be\nchanges regarding procedural guarantees, mainly through the introduction of time-limits\nthat oblige Member States' authorities to decide on an application within 60\ndays. In exceptional circumstances, this time-limit could be extended by an\nadditional 30 days. Students'\nright to work during their period of study would be extended to cover a minimum\nof 15 hours per week as of the first year of residence.\nOption 4: Further improvement of admission conditions, rights also on intra-EU mobility and procedural guarantees; access\nto job-seeking following completion of studies or research project; extended\nscope to au-pairs and remunerated trainees\nThis option aims at a higher degree of\nambition in improving the conditions and rights of the groups covered by\nexisting Directives, extending the scope of the Directive to au-pairs and\nremunerated trainees and introducing specific admission conditions to ensure\nbetter protection for them. Member States would have the possibility to issue\nlong-stay visas or residence permits, and they should, in case both types of\nauthorizations would be used, require only the fulfillment of admission\nconditions mentioned in the Directive (so that the conditions remain the same\nirrespective of the type of authorization). \nIn case the third-country nationals' stay exceeds\na period of one year, Member States issuing long-stay visas would have to issue\nresidence permits after the first year. Intra-EU mobility provisions would be\nstrengthened for researchers and students, and introduced for the first time\nfor remunerated trainees. In addition, regarding intra-EU mobility, specific,\nmore favorable rules would apply to beneficiaries of EU programmes including\nmobility measures such as Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie.\nStudents would obtain the right to work for\na minimum of 20 hours per week as of the first year of residence. After\nfinalization of their studies/research, students and researchers would be\nallowed to stay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of\n12 months. As for procedural guarantees, Member States would be obliged to\ndecide on applications within 60 days (all groups), and within 30 days for\nErasmus Mundus and Marie Curie fellows.\nThe analysis and comparison of the options suggest that there are\nproblems that cannot be solved by improved communication efforts, and therefore\nrequire an update of the Directives. \nOption 4 appears to be the most cost-effective option to meet the\nkey objectives and brings about positive economic and social impacts. The main\ndisadvantage of legislative changes would be the costs involved. Member States\nwill have to make modifications to their legislative frameworks, mainly\nconcerning authorisations to enter and stay, intra-EU mobility and time-limits\nto handle applications. At the same time the costs implied by option 4 would be\nrelatively limited, and some Member States are already implementing some of the\nprovisions foreseen.\nSince the issues identified are similar for both Directives, and in\norder to provide more coherence and clarity of the EU rules, the most effective\nway to implement the preferred option is to combine the two Directives in a\nsingle legislative instrument. This will be carried out through a recast of\nboth Directives, bringing them together in a single legislative act and\nproposing new substantial changes.\n3. LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe proposal establishes the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national\nresearchers, students, pupils, remunerated and unremunerated trainees,\nvolunteers and au pairs to the territory of the Member States for a period\nexceeding three months. The proposal introduces admission conditions for two\ngroups of third-country nationals currently not covered by a legally binding EU\nlegal framework, au pairs and remunerated trainees, to ensure their legal\nrights and protection. In the case of third-country national researchers, family\nadmission is made more favourable, as well as access to the labour market by\nfamily members, and their intra-EU mobility.\nThe proposal provides that an applicant who\nsatisfies all the conditions set out for admission to one of the Member States\nshall be granted a long-stay visa or residence permit. The proposal facilitates\nand simplifies intra-EU mobility for students and researchers, in particular for\nthose under the Erasmus Mundus/Marie Curie programmes which will be expanded\nand see an increase in participation under the next Multiannual Financial\nFramework. The proposal increases the rights of students to work part-time and\nallows students and researchers, after finalization of studies/research, to\nstay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of 12 months.\nIncreased information and transparency are\nintroduced, as well as time limits for decisions and improved procedural\nguarantees, such as written reasons for a decision and rights of appeal. Fees\ncharged would have to be proportionate.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 79(2) TFEU\nempowers the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the\nordinary legislative procedure, to adopt measures in the following areas: \n(a) The conditions of entry and residence,\nand standards on the issue by Member States of long-term visas and residence\npermits; \n(b) The definition of the rights of third-country\nnationals residing legally in a Member State, including the conditions\ngoverning freedom of movement and of residence in other Member States.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nImmigration policy is a competence shared by the\nUnion and the Member States. The principle of\nsubsidiarity therefore applies, which involves ensuring that the objectives of\nthe proposed action could not be achieved sufficiently by the Member States\n(necessity test), and considering whether and how these objectives could be\nbetter achieved by action on the part of the Union (European added value test).\nThe challenge to keep and improve the capacity to attract talent\nfrom outside of the EU has increased and is common to all Member States. Although\neach Member State could continue to have its own national system of admitting the\nthird-country nationals groups concerned by this proposal, this would not\nachieve the general objective of increasing the attractiveness of the EU as a\ndestination for talented migrants. Having one set of common admission and\nresidence requirements rather than a fragmented situation with diverging\nnational rules is clearly more efficient and simpler for potential applicants as\nwell as for organizations involved than having to look into and deal with 27\ndifferent systems. In addition, the promotion of intra-EU mobility, one of the\nkey objectives of this proposal, requires an EU-wide instrument.\nWith the increased number of initiatives targeting youth and\nstimulating cultural, social, educational people-to-people contacts with\nnationals of third countries and forms of informal training, the need for\nmatching them with adequate immigration rules is even greater. \nFinally, a minimum uniform level of protection and rights of third-country\nstudents, researchers and other groups should offer solid safeguards against the\nexploitation of certain vulnerable categories, such as remunerated trainees and\nau-pairs.\nThe EU added value of the existing Students and Researchers\nDirectives has been proven over the years, and this proposal will lead to\nfurther improvements.\nA transparent legal framework including appropriate safeguards to\nensure a genuine transfer of skills would facilitate economic, social and\ncultural international relationships between the Member States and sending\ncountries. As regards external aspects of migration policy, an EU instrument\ncovering remunerated trainees will help further deepening of the Global Approach\nto Migration and Mobility, as it both provides transfers of skills and\nstrengthens third countries\u00b4 commitment to fight irregular immigration thanks\nto additional legal migration routes. Concerning au-pairs, an EU framework\nwould help to increase their protection.\nOne of the key elements of this proposal would be to better tap into\nthe potential of students and researchers upon finalizing their studies/research.\nThey constitute a future pool of highly-skilled workers as they speak the\nlanguage and are integrated in the host society. \nBy addressing remunerated trainees who fall outside the scope of\nintra-corporate transferees, the proposal would complement the Directive on\nintra-corporate transferees which is currently being negotiated with the Council\nand the European Parliament.\nProvisions aiming at clarifying and promoting rights and residing\nconditions would also contribute to the overall objective of enhancing the protection\nof fundamental rights.\nGiven all these considerations, it is\nconsidered that the proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe principle of proportionality applies, meaning that\n\u2018the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to\nachieve the objectives of the Treaties' - Article 5(4) of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for\nthe following reasons:\nThe instrument chosen is a Directive, which gives Member\nStates a high degree of flexibility in terms of implementation.\nThe content of the action is limited to what is\nnecessary to achieve its aim. The proposed rules concern admission conditions,\nprocedures and authorisations (residence permits and long-stay visas), as well\nas rights of students, researchers, pupils, volunteers, trainees and au pairs, which\nare the areas that constitute elements of a common immigration policy under\nArticle 79 TFEU. EU-wide rules already exist for some of these groups but need\nto be up-dated and improved, and the content of this proposal is limited to\nwhat is necessary to achieve the above aim.\n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nThe proposed instrument is a\nDirective. It is the appropriate instrument for this\naction as it sets binding minimum standards but, at the same time, gives Member\nStates the necessary flexibility. Furthermore it is the\nmost appropriate instrument for bringing together in a single legislative act the\ntwo existing Directives through the recast of both existing Directives, in\norder to ensure a coherent legal framework for different groups of third\ncountry nationals coming to the EU. \n4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal has no implications for the EU\nbudget.\n5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b7      Transposition clause\nThe proposal includes a transposition clause.\n\u00b7      Explanatory documents accompanying the notification of transposition\nmeasures\nThe proposed Directive has a wide personal\nscope as regards the different third-country national groups that it covers (researchers, students, school pupils, trainees, volunteers and au-pairs). The proposal also contains a large number of legal obligations,\nextending the latter compared to the existing Directives 2005/71/EC and\n2004/114/EC. Given this, and the fact that the proposal includes provisions on\na number of groups not yet covered in a mandatory way by the current legal\nframework, explanatory documents accompanying the notification of transposition\nmeasures will be needed so that the transposition measures that the Member\nStates have added to existing legislation are clearly identifiable.\n\u00b7      Detailed explanation of the proposal\nCHAPTER I \u2013 GENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nThe proposal is part of the EU\u2019s efforts to\nput in place a comprehensive immigration policy. It has two specific purposes.\nThe first one is to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country\nnationals to the territory of the Member States for a period exceeding three\nmonths for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and\nunremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing. The second is to set\nout the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national students\nand remunerated trainees in Member States other than the Member State which first grants the third-country national an authorisation on the basis of this\nDirective. The third one covers the conditions of entry and residence of third-country\nnational researchers in Member States other than the Member State which first grants the third-country national an authorisation on the basis of this\nDirective.\nArticle 2\nThis Article sets out the scope of the proposal, which applies to third-country nationals who apply to be admitted to the\nterritory of a Member State for the purpose of research, studies, pupil\nexchange, remunerated or unremunerated training, voluntary service or au\npairing. The optional provisions of the Students' Directive on pupils,\nunremunerated trainees and volunteers have been made mandatory and the general\nscope has been extended to cover remunerated trainees and au pairs.\nRegarding the groups that are not covered by the\nproposal, the proposal very much follows the approach developed in Directive\n2004/114/EC and 2005/71/EC. The proposal does not cover, as an example, EU\ncitizens and their family members. As was the case with previous Directives\n2004/114/EC and 2005/71/EC, it also does not cover third-country nationals who\nare EC long-term residents given their more privileged status and their specific\ntype of residence permit, or refugees, those residing in a Member State on a\nstrictly temporary basis in accordance with EC legislation or under commitments\ncontained in international agreements, and other limited categories.\nArticle 3\nThis Article sets out the definitions used in the\nproposal, which are to a large extent common to other existing migration\nDirectives (most notably 2004/114/EC and 2005/71/EC). The definition of\nau-pairs is inspired by the 1969 European Agreement on \"au pair\"\nPlacement. The definition of remunerated trainee is based on that for\nunremunerated trainee, while highlighting the element of remuneration. The term\n\"authorisation\" is used to cover both residence permits and long term\nvisas.\nArticle 4\nThis Article states that Member States may grant more\nfavourable conditions for the persons to whom the proposal for Directive applies,\nhowever only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern family\nmembers of researchers, rights to equal treatment, economic activities and\nprocedural safeguards,\nso as not to undermine the scope of the Directive.\nCHAPTER II - ADMISSION\nArticle 5\nThis Article lays down the general principle that an\napplicant who satisfies all the general and specific conditions for admission\nshall be granted a residence permit or a long-stay visa by the Member State where the application has been made. The reason for this is to avoid\nsituations in which the applicant might be refused admission although he or she\nfulfils all the conditions but is not granted the necessary visa.\nArticle 6\nThis Article lays down the general conditions which all\napplicants must fulfil in order to be admitted to a Member State, besides the specific conditions that apply to the different categories of third-country\nnationals laid down in the subsequent Articles. The general conditions are very\nmuch in line with those developed in the existing acquis on legal migration,\nand include valid documents, sickness insurance and minimum resources. Once the general conditions as well as the specific conditions of admission\nare fulfilled, applicants shall be entitled to an authorisation, meaning a\nlong-stay visa and/or residence permit.\nArticles 7, 8 and 9\nThese Articles set out specific conditions of admission\nfor third-country national researchers, which already exist in the Researchers'\nDirective, in particular the requirement that the research organisation be\napproved by the Member State, and that a hosting agreement be signed by both\nthe approved research organisation and the researcher. This proposal explicitly\nlists the elements that should be contained in the hosting agreement. They are\nthe title and purpose of the research project, the confirmation of the\nresearcher that he or she undertakes to complete the research project, the confirmation\nof the organisation that it hosts the researcher so that he or she can complete\nthe research project, the start and end date of the research project, information\non the legal relationship between the research organization and the researcher\nand information on the working conditions of the researcher. For third-country\nnational researchers to be aware of research organisations that can enter into\nhosting agreements, emphasis is placed on the need for the list of approved\norganisation to be publicly available and up-dated whenever a change occurs in\nthe list.\nArticles 10 \nThis provision of Article 10 sets out the specific\nconditions of admission for third-country national students, similar to those\nalready found in the Students Directive.\nArticles 11, 12, 13 and 14\nThese provisions set out the specific conditions of\nadmission for third-country national school pupils, remunerated and\nunremunerated trainees, volunteers and au-pairs, who need to show evidence of\nthe organisation that is responsible for their exchange, training or,\nvolunteering. Whereas school pupils, unremunerated trainees and volunteers were\nalready included in Directive 2004/114/EC on an optional basis, remunerated\ntrainees is an entirely new group of third-country nationals to be covered. The\nsame applies to au-pairs. These two latter groups share similar characteristics\nwith those already addressed by EU law. Both groups benefit from increased\nlevels of protection. For au-pairs to be admitted there needs to be evidence\nthat the host family accepts responsibility for example as far as subsistence\nand accommodation are concerned. The au-pair stay also needs to be based on an\nagreement between the au-pair and the host family defining his/her rights and\nobligations. For remunerated trainees the training programme, its duration,\nconditions of supervision and working conditions need to be specified. In order\nto avoid situations in which trainees are used as 'cheap labour', the host entity\nmay be obliged to declare that the third-country national is not filling a job.\nCHAPTER III - AUTHORISATIONS AND\nDURATION OF RESIDENCE\nArticles 15, 16 and 17\nThese provisions set out the information that should be\nincluded on the third-country national's residence permit or long-term visa.\nArticle 16 specifies that for researchers and students an authorisation should\nbe granted for at least one year. For all other groups the authorisation is\nlimited to one year as a rule, with the possibility for exceptions. This is in\nline with the durations applied under Directives 2005/71 and 2004/114. Furthermore,\nArticle 17 enables Member States to provide additional information on the full\nlists of Member States where the third country national students or researchers\nintend go.\nCHAPTER IV -\nGrounds for refusal, withdrawal or\nnon-renewal of authorisations\nArticles 18, 19 and 20\nThese provisions lay down the mandatory and possible\ngrounds for refusing, withdrawing or not renewing an authorisation,\nsuch as the general and specific conditions for admission no longer being met,\nfalse documents etc., which are standard conditions under the existing\nmigration Directives.\nCHAPTER V-RIGHTS\nThis proposal introduces a specific chapter\non rights for all groups covered by the proposal.\nArticle 21\nIn order to ensure the fair treatment of\nthird-country nationals falling under the scope of the Directive, this\nprovision entitles them to equal treatment under the Single Permit Directive[13]. More favourable rights to\nequal treatment with nationals of the host Member State as regards branches of\nsocial security as defined in Regulation No 883/2004 on the coordination of\nsocial security schemes are maintained for third-country national researchers, without\nthe possibility for the limitations laid down by the Single Permit Directive. Furthermore,\nthird-country national school pupils, volunteers, unremunerated trainees and\nau-pairs will benefit of equal treatment rights with nationals of the host\nMember State as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods\nand services made available to the public independently on whether Union or\nnational law gives them access to the labour market .\nArticles 22 and 23\nUnder these provisions third country national researchers\nand students are given the right to work, with Member States being able to set certain\nlimits. Researchers, as was the case under Directive 2005/71, are allowed to\nteach in accordance with national legislation. Regarding students, whereas\nunder Directive 2004/114/EC students were allowed to work for a minimum of 10\nhours per week, this period has been increased to 20 hours. With respect to\nstudents' access to economic activities, Member States may continue take into\nconsideration their labour market situation but this should be done in a\nproportionate way in order not to systematically endanger the right to work[14].\nArticle 24\nArticle 24 introduces the possibility for students and\nresearchers, if they fulfil the general admission conditions of the proposal\n(except for the condition on being a minor), to stay in the Member State for 12\nmonths upon finalization of their studies/research in order to look for work or\nset up a business. A number of Member States already provide for this\npossibility but the amount of time may differ. The\npossibility to remain in the relevant Member State appears to be an important\nfactor when third-country national students/researchers choose their country of\ndestination. This provision thus has the potential to make the Member States\nmore competitive in the search for talents on a global stage. This is an issue\nof common interest in the context of a declining\nworking-age population and future skills needs and would be in line with the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action\nPlan[15]. It would however not be an automatic work\npermit, but Member States, could still apply the relevant authorization\nprocedures. In a period of more than 3 and less than 6\nmonths, Member States could ask the third-country nationals to provide\ndocumentation that they are genuinely seeking for a job (for example, copies of\nthe letters and CVs sent to employers) or are in the process of setting up a\nbusiness. After 6 months, they could also ask third- country\nnationals to provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged\nor of launching a business. \nArticle 25\nThis Article includes specific provisions on the\nadmission and access to the labour market of researchers' family members in\nderogation to Directive 2003/86/EC with a view to increase the EU\nattractiveness to third-country national researchers. Whether or not family\nmembers of researchers can have immediate access to the Member State concerned\nas well as to the labour market can play a role in the researcher's decision to\nbe mobile or not.\nCHAPTER VI-MOBILITY\nBETWEEN MEMBER STATES\nArticles 26 and 27 \nThese Articles set out the conditions under which\nresearchers, students and trainees can move between the Member States, in order\nto facilitate such mobility. For researchers, under Directive 2005/71/EC, the\nperiod for which they are allowed to move to a second Member State on the basis of the hosting agreement concluded in the first Member State has been\nextended from 3 to 6 months. For students, provisions were introduced in the\nnew proposal that also allow them to move to a second Member State for a period\nof up to 6 months on the basis of the authorisation granted by the first Member\nState. Specific rules apply to third-country nationals who come under EU\nmobility programmes, for example the current Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie\nprogrammes, in order to simplify the exercise of mobility. This will limit\nsituations in which third-country nationals who qualify for scholarships of\nfellowships under EU mobility programmes cannot take them up as they cannot\nenter the territory of the Member State concerned.\nArticle 28\nIn line with the provisions of the Blue Card Directive,\nresearchers' family members can move between Member States together with the\nresearcher.\nCHAPTER VII- PROCEDURE AND TRANSPARENCY\nArticle 29\nThis provision introduces a time-limit that obliges\nMember States to decide on the complete application for an authorisation and\nnotify the applicant in writing within 60 days (applying for all groups), and\nwithin 30 days for Union programmes including mobility measures such as Erasmus\nMundus and Marie Curie fellows. The current legal framework does not specify\nany time limit. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal\nchallenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the\nrequirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decisions in writing,\nand ensuring respect for the right to a legal remedy.\nArticles 30 and 31\nRecognising that availability of information is crucial\nfor achieving the objectives of this proposal. Article 30 requires the Member\nStates to make information available on the entry and residence conditions as\nset by this proposal, including on approved research organisations and on fees.\nIn line with existing migration Directives, Article 31 explicitly states that\nMember States may charge fees for the processing of applications. In addition,\nin line with recent case-law by the European Court of Justice[16], Article 31 introduces a\nprovision indicating that the amount of such fees should not endanger the\nfulfilment of the Directive's objectives.\nCHAPTER VIII - FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticles 32 to 38\nArticle 32 requires the Member States to establish national contact\npoints to exchange information on third-country nationals covered by the\nproposal who move between Member States. Such national contact points already\nexist in relation to certain existing migration Directives such as the Blue\nCard Directive and have proved to be an efficient mechanism allowing technical\ncommunication between the Member States.\nArticle 33\nThis provision requires the Member States to communicate to the\nCommission statistics on the numbers of third-country nationals granted\nauthorisations under this proposal, in accordance with Regulation No 862/2007, with the possibility for additional\nstatistics to be requested by the Commission.\nArticle 36\nThis provision provides that the proposal formally repeals the\nexisting Directives 2005/71/EC and 2004/114/EC on third-country national researchers and\nstudents.\nThe remaining provisions (Articles 34, 35, 37 and 38) are standard\nfinal provisions dealing with reporting, transposition, entry into force and\naddresses of the Directive.\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC,\n2005/71/EC (adapted)\n\u00f0 new\n2013/0081 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the conditions of admission \u00f0 entry and residence \u00ef of third-country nationals for the purposes of \u00d6 research, \u00d5 studies, pupil\nexchange, \u00f0 remunerated and \u00ef unremunerated training or, voluntary service \u00f0 and au pairing \u00ef\non a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the\npurposes of scientific research\n[RECAST]\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL\nOF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty \u00d6 on the\nFunctioning of the European Union \u00d5 establishing\nthe European Community, and in\nparticular points (3) (a) \u00d6 and (b) \u00d5 (4)(b)of\nthe first subparagraph of Article 63 \u00d6 79(2) \u00d5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n\u00f2 new\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of\namendements are to be made to Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of third-country\nnationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training\nor voluntary service[17]\nand Council\nDirective 2005/71/EC of 12 October\n2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the\npurposes of scientific research[18].\nIn the interests of clarity, those Directives should be recast.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective should respond to the need identified in the implentation reports of\nthe two Directives[19] to remedy the identified weaknesses, and to offer\na coherent legal framework for different groups coming to the Union from third\ncountries. It should therefore simplify and streamline the existing provisions\nfor the different groups in a single instrument. Despite differences between the groups covered by\nthis Directive, they also share a number of characteristics which makes it\npossible to address them through a common legal framework at Union level.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive\nshould contribute to the Stockholm\nProgramme's aim to approximate national legislation on the conditions for entry\nand residence of third-country nationals. Immigration from outside the Union is one source of highly skilled people, and in particular students and researchers\nare increasingly sought after. They play an important role to form the Union's key asset \u2013 human capital - in ensuring smart, sustainable and inclusive growth,\nand therefore contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Europe\n2020 Strategy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The shortcomings\nhighlighted in the implementation reports of the two Directives concern mainly\nadmission conditions, rights, procedural safeguards, students' access to the\nlabour market during studies, intra-Union mobility provisions as well as a lack\nof harmonization, as coverage of some groups, such as volunteers, school pupils\nand unremunerated trainees was left optional to Member States. Subsequent wider\nconsultations have also pointed to the need for better job-seeking\npossibilities for researchers and students and better protection of au-pairs\nand remunerated trainees which are not covered by the current instruments.\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 1\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the gradual\nestablishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, the Treaty provides\nfor measures to be adopted in the fields of asylum, immigration and the\nprotection of the rights of third-country nationals.\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 2 (adapted)\nThe Treaty provides that the Council is to\nadopt measures on immigration policy relating to conditions of entry and\nresidence, and standards on procedures for the issue by Member States of\nlong-term visas and residence permits. \n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 3 (adapted)\nAt its special meeting at Tampere\non 15 and 16 October 1999, the European Council acknowledged the need for\napproximation of national legislation on the conditions for admission and\nresidence of third-country nationals and asked the Council to rapidly adopt\ndecisions on the basis of proposals by the Commission. \n\u00f2 new\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective should also aim at fostering people-to-people contacts and mobility, as\nimportant elements of the Union\u2019s external policy, notably vis-\u00e0-vis the\ncountries of the European Neighbourhood Policy or the Union\u2019s strategic\npartners. It should allow for a better contribution to the Global Approach to\nMigration and Mobility and its Mobility Partnerships which offer a concrete\nframework for dialogue and cooperation between the Member States and third\ncountries, including in facilitating and organizing legal migration.\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 6 (adapted)\nOne of the objectives of Community action in the\nfield of education is to promote Europe as a whole as a world centre\nof excellence for studies and vocational\ntraining.

Opening\nthe Union up to third-country nationals who may be admitted for the purposes of\nresearch is also part of the Innovation Union flagship initiative. Creating an\nopen labour market for Union researchers and for researchers from third\ncountries was also affirmed as a key aim of the European Research Area (ERA), a\nunified area, in which researchers, scientific knowldedge and technology\ncirculate freely. \n\u00ea 2005/71/EC\nrecital 5 (adapted)\nThis Directive is intended to contribute to\nachieving these goals by fostering the admission and mobility for\nresearch purposes of third-country nationals for stays of more than three\nmonths, in order to make the Community\nmore attractive to researchers from around the world and to boost its position\nas an international centre for research.\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 9 (adapted)\nThe new Community rules are based on definitions\nof student, trainee, educational establishment and volunteer already in use in\nCommunity law, in particular in the various Community programmes to promote\nthe mobility of the relevant persons (Socrates, European Voluntary Service\netc.).\n\u00ea 2004/114/EC\nrecital 11\nThird-country\nnationals who fall into the categories of unremunerated trainees and volunteers\nand who are considered, by virtue of their activities or the kind of\ncompensation or remuneration received, as workers under national legislation\nare not covered by this Directive.

This needs to be reflected through improved intra-Union mobility\nprovisions for students. Making European higher education attractive and\ncompetitive is one of the objectives of the Bologna declaration.
