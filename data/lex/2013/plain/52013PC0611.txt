The creation of a genuine internal market\r\nis fundamental to revitalising the railway sector and will help to make rail\r\nfreight and passenger transport services more competitive and attractive, and\r\nincrease their modal share of transport.\nIn 2011, the European Commission adopted a\r\nroadmap (White Paper \u2014 Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area \u2014 Towards a\r\ncompetitive and resource efficient transport system) featuring 40 concrete\r\ninitiatives for the next decade aimed at building a competitive transport\r\nsystem that will increase mobility, remove major barriers in key areas and fuel\r\ngrowth and employment. At the same time, the proposals will dramatically reduce\r\nEurope\u2019s dependence on imported oil and cut carbon emissions in transport by 60 %\r\nby 2050. According to the White Paper, a necessary condition for establishing a\r\nSingle European Transport Area is the creation of Single European Railway Area,\r\nwhich can be done by completing the process of market liberalisation, including\r\ngiving the European Rail Agency a stronger role in the field of rail safety, in\r\nparticular in terms of supervising national safety measures and working towards\r\ntheir progressive harmonisation.\nThe availability of detailed and timely\r\nrail transport statistics is becoming increasingly important given the growing momentum\r\nof evidence-based policy making in the Commission and the need to monitor progress\r\ntowards the goals set out in the White Paper.\nEurostat\u2019s rail transport statistics are predominantly based on\r\nRegulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16\r\nDecember 2002), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1192/2003 and Commission\r\nRegulation (EC) No 332/2007. These Regulations cover passenger and freight\r\ntransport by rail, as well as rail safety.\nThe Commission needs statistics on the transport of goods and\r\npassengers by rail in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy.\nDetailed rail transport statistics for\r\ngoods and passengers and information on intermodality are necessary to monitor\r\nthe targets set in the 2011 Commission\u2019s White Paper.\nSimplified reporting for goods and\r\npassengers presents only aggregated figures (total goods transported by type of\r\ngoods and total passengers transported). There are no\r\ndetailed breakdowns of, for example: country of embarkation/loading country,\r\nand country of disembarkation/unloading country; goods transported in intermodal transport units, by type of transport\r\nand by type of transport unit; goods transported, by category of dangerous\r\ngoods; and the number of loaded intermodal transport units carried, by type of\r\ntransport and by type of transport unit.\nAccidents have become a priority issue in EU transport policy,\r\ntogether with the other undesirable effects of transport: congestion,\r\npollution, noise and CO2 emissions. Consequently it has become important to\r\ncollect and disseminate data on accidents, fatalities, serious injuries and\r\ndamage caused to the environment (by spillage of dangerous goods transported)\r\nin all modes of transport: road, rail, inland waterways, sea and air.\nRail accident data have so far been collected under Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 91/2003 on rail freight transport; they are also collected by the European\r\nRailways Agency (ERA) under the Statistical Annex to Directive 2009/149/EC on\r\nrail safety.\nIn line with the requirement that official\r\nstatistics should be relevant, i.e. that they should satisfy current and\r\npotential user needs, the proposal revises the current legal basis and further\r\nsimplifies the requirements for data provision.\nDue account is also taken of the necessary trade-off between user\r\nneeds and the burden on respondents and national\r\nstatistical institutes.\nA technical analysis of the data collected under the European\r\nlegislation on rail transport statistics and of the dissemination policy has\r\nbeen carried out at European level, in order to propose possible technical\r\nsolutions to simplify as much as possible the various activities necessary for\r\nstatistical production, while keeping the final output in line with present and\r\nfuture user needs.\nThe aim of this proposal is thus to modify\r\nRegulation (EC) No 91/2003 in order to update, simplify and optimise the\r\nexisting legal framework for European statistics on rail transport and to align\r\nit with the new institutional context.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAt the beginning of 2010, a Task Force on Rail Transport Statistics\r\nwas charged with carrying out a technical analysis of the existing policy on\r\ndata collection and dissemination, under the European legislation on rail\r\ntransport statistics. The Task Force members were all experts with specific\r\nknowledge of the existing legislation and the national systems for collecting\r\nand compiling rail transport statistics and new trends in the development of\r\nrail transport.\nThe Task Force produced a proposal to simplify Regulation (EC) No\r\n91/2003. The effect of the proposal will be to reduce the burden on Member\r\nStates and respondents without any significant loss in the quality of data for\r\nthe transport of goods and passengers by rail and to improve the timelines for\r\ndisseminating passenger rail data.\nThe proposal has been discussed with data producers and users on a\r\ntechnical level, in working groups on rail transport statistics and the\r\nCoordinating Group for Statistics on Transport, in the context of the European\r\nStatistical System. There have also been consultations\r\nwithin the Commission with DG MOVE.\nThis proposal is the result of in-depth negotiations between all\r\ninterested parties.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal covers the following changes:\n(1)                   \r\nData on transport of passengers\nIn line with Annexes C and D to Regulation (EC)\r\n91/2003 on rail transport statistics, countries are currently required to\r\nprovide annual statistics on passenger transport, under detailed and/or\r\nsimplified reporting. The way that passenger transport data are currently\r\ndisseminated is considered ambiguous and inconsistent due to the deadlines for\r\ntransmitting tables being different for simplified and detailed reporting. Moreover,\r\nsome provisional data (Tables C1 and C2) and optional figures (Table C1 \u2014 passenger-km)\r\nfor passenger transport must be provided within the same deadline as simplified\r\ndata \u2014 eight months after the end of the reference period.\nIt is proposed to delete Annex D (simplified\r\nreporting) and the provisional Tables C1 and C2 in Annex C, while shortening\r\nthe deadline for providing the final passenger data from 14 months to eight\r\nmonths after the end of the reference period. Data will thus be available\r\nsooner.\n(2)                   \r\nData on transport of goods\nIn the interests of consistency, it is also proposed\r\nto delete Annex B (simplified reporting).\n(3)                   \r\nNew Annex\nAs it is proposed to abandon the current\r\nconcept of \u2018simplified\u2019 reporting, for the smallest undertakings below the\r\nspecified thresholds, Member States would have to report a \u2018total\u2019 figure for\r\naggregated indicators in Annex L.\n(4)                   \r\nData on accidents\nAs data on accidents are also collected by the\r\nEuropean Rail Agency, it is proposed to delete Annex H (statistics on\r\naccidents).\n(5)                   \r\nAnnex I\nAs the concept of \u2018simplified\u2019 reporting will\r\ndisappear, it is proposed to delete this Annex as it is currently used only to\r\nvalidate coverage between simplified and detailed reporting in relation to the total\r\nrail activity of undertakings.\n(6)                   \r\nThresholds\nThe present thresholds are established for tonne-km\r\nand passenger-km, i.e. multiplication of tonnes/passengers transported and the\r\ndistance covered in kilometres.\nAs significant rail activity involves only\r\nsmall distances in some Member States, it is proposed to decrease the thresholds\r\nboth for goods and passengers, in order to minimise the loss of important data.\r\nFor the same reason, a double threshold in tonnes transported and in tonne-km is\r\nproposed for goods.\n(7)                   \r\nTransit data\nFor harmonisation reasons, it is proposed that\r\n\u2018Rail Waybill\u2019 information (if available) be used when administrative data are\r\nused as the data source.\n(8)                   \r\nIn connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\r\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the\r\nCommission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[1], the Commission has committed\r\nitself[2]\r\nto reviewing legislative acts that currently contain\r\nreferences to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, in order to adapt them to\r\nthe criteria laid down in the Treaty.\n(9)                   \r\nFinally, the proposed amendment of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 91/2003 takes into account the necessary adjustments to the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union as regards granting the Commission delegated\r\nand implementing powers. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018the\r\nTreaty\u2019), makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to\r\nadopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend\r\ncertain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article\r\n290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the powers conferred on the Commission\r\nto adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid\r\ndown in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the\r\nUnion budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe adoption of the proposal will not lead to existing legislation\r\nbeing repealed.\n2013/0297 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport\r\nstatistics, as regards the collection of data on goods, passengers and\r\naccidents\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national\r\nParliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 91/2003\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail\r\ntransport statistics[3]\r\nestablishes a common framework for producing, transmitting, evaluating and\r\ndisseminating comparable rail transport statistics in the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistics\r\non the transport of goods and passengers by rail are necessary to enable the\r\nCommission to monitor and develop the common transport policy, and the\r\ntransport elements of policies on the regions and on trans-European networks.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistics\r\non rail safety are also necessary to enable the Commission to prepare and\r\nmonitor Union action in the\r\nfield of transport safety. The European Rail Agency collects data on accidents under the Statistical Annex to Directive 2004/49/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on\r\nsafety on the Community's railways as regards common safety indicators and common methods of calculating accident costs.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most Member States\r\ntransmitting passenger data to the Commission (Eurostat) under Regulation (EC) No\r\n91/2003 have regularly provided the same data for both the provisional and\r\nfinal datasets.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There should be a balance\r\nbetween the needs of the users and the burden on respondents when producing\r\nEuropean statistics.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurostat has conducted a technical\r\nanalysis of the existing data on rail statistics collected under the Union\r\nlegislation and of the dissemination policy, within its Working Group and Task\r\nForce on rail transport statistics, to simplify as much as possible the various\r\nactivities necessary for producing statistics, while keeping the final output\r\nin line with present and future user needs.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its report to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council on the experience acquired in the\r\napplication of the Regulation (EC) No 91/2003, the Commission mentions that\r\nlong term developments will probably mean the suppression or simplification of\r\nthe data already collected under the Regulation, and that the intention is to\r\nreduce the data transmission period for annual data on rail passengers.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 91/2003\r\nconfers powers on the Commission to implement some of the provisions of this Regulation.\r\nAs a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of\r\nthe European Union (\u2018the Treaty\u2019), the powers conferred on the Commission under\r\nthis Regulation need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reflect new\r\ndevelopments in the Member States but at the same time to maintain harmonised\r\nrail data collection across the Union and with a view to maintaining the high\r\nquality of the data transmitted by the Member States, the power to adopt acts\r\nin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\r\nCommission, with a view to adapting the definitions and thresholds for\r\nreporting and the contents of the Annexes, and to specifying the information to\r\nbe supplied.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is particularly important\r\nthat the Commission carry out the appropriate consultations during its\r\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission should, when\r\npreparing and drawing up delegated acts, ensure simultaneous, timely and\r\nappropriate submission of the relevant documents to the European Parliament and\r\nto the Council.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that these delegated acts do not impose a significant additional\r\nadministrative burden on the Member States and on the respondents.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure uniform conditions for implementation of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003,\r\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the\r\nspecification of information to be supplied for the reports on the quality and\r\ncomparability of the results. These powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nof 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms\r\nfor control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing\r\npowers[4].\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Statistical\r\nSystem Committee has been consulted.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 91/2003\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 91/2003 is amended as follows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 3 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nIn paragraph 1 points 24-30 are deleted.\n(b)         \r\nParagraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt,\r\nin accordance with Article 10, delegated acts to adapt the technical\r\ndefinitions referred to in paragraph 1 and to provide additional definitions\r\nwhen needed to take into account new developments which require a certain level\r\nof technical detail to be defined in order to ensure harmonisation of\r\nstatistics.\u2019\n(2)                   \r\nArticle 4 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nIn paragraph 1, points b, d and h are deleted.\n(b)         \r\nParagraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182. Under Annexes A and\r\nC, Member States shall report data for undertakings:\n(a)          \r\nwhose total volume of goods transport is at\r\nleast 200 million tonne-km or at least 500 000 tonnes;\n(b)         \r\nwhose total volume of passenger transport is at\r\nleast 100 million passenger-km.\n(c)          \r\nReporting in Annex A and Annex C is optional\r\nbelow these thresholds.\u2019 \n(c)         \r\nParagraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183. Under Annex L, Member States shall provide the\r\ntotal data for undertakings below the threshold referred to in paragraph 2 if\r\nthese data are not reported under Annexes A and C, as specified in Annex L.\u2019\n(d)         \r\nParagraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\u20185. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts, in accordance with Article 10, concerning the adaptation of the\r\ncontents of the Annexes and the thresholds for reporting as referred to in\r\nparagraphs 1 and 3, in order to take account of economic and technical\r\ndevelopments.\u2019\n(e)         \r\nThe following paragraph 6 is added:\n\u20186. When exercising its power pursuant to this\r\nparagraph, the Commission shall ensure that the delegated acts adopted do not\r\nimpose a significant additional administrative burden on the Member States and\r\non the respondents.\u2019\n(3)                   \r\nIn Article 5 (2) point b is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) administrative data, including data\r\ncollected by regulatory authorities, in particular the rail freight waybill if\r\navailable\u2019.\n(4)                   \r\nArticle 7 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 7\nDissemination\nStatistics based on the data specified in\r\nAnnexes A, C, E, F, G and L shall be disseminated by the Commission (Eurostat).\n(5)                   \r\nIn Article 8, paragraphs 3 and 4 are added:\n\u20183. For the purposes of this Regulation, the\r\nquality criteria to be applied to the data to be transmitted are those referred\r\nto in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\n4.
