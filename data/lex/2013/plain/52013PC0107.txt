Space-based applications and derived services as well as\nspace research have become critical for the implementation of EU policies, such\nas environment, climate change, martime policies, development, agriculture,\nsecurity related policies including the CFSP/CSDP, as well as the furthering of\ntechnical progress and industrial innovation and competitiveness.\nWith increasing dependance on space-based\nservices, the ability to protect space infrastructure has become essential to\nour society. Any shutdown of even a part of space infrastructures could have\nsignificant consequences for the well-functioning of economic activities and\nour citizens' safety, and would impair the provision of emergency services.\nHowever, space infrastructures are\nincreasingly threatened by the risk of collision between spacecraft and more\nimportantly, between spacecraft and space debris. As a matter of fact, space\ndebris has become the most serious threat to the sustainability of certain\nspace activities.\nIn order to mitigate the risk of collision\nit is necessary to identify and monitor satellites and space debris, catalogue\ntheir positions, and track their movements (trajectory) when a potential risk\nof collision has been identified, so that satellite operators can be alerted to\nmove their satellites. This activity is known as space surveillance and\ntracking (SST), and is today mostly based on ground-based sensors such as\ntelescopes and radars.\nThere are other actions to mitigate the\nrisk from collisions or their consequences. These include research efforts to\nbetter protect the satellites against the impacts of collisions and to develop\ntechnologies to remove space debris from orbits. Furthermore, there are several\ninitiatives that seek to ensure the commitment of space-faring nations to\nreducing the production of space debris when conducting space activities\nthrough international level. The international Code of Conduct on Outer Space\nActivities proposed by the Union and currently under negotiation with\nspace-faring nations has received wide international support so far. However,\nimportant as these instruments may be if their provisions are implemented, they\nwill not eliminate the problem that existing and future space debris poses,\nthey will just reduce the exponential growth of space debris in the future. The\nonly solution today is to avoid collisions and monitor uncontrolled re-entry of\nspacecraft or their debris in the Earth's athmosphere.\nHowever, in Europe there are today limited\ncapacities to monitor and survey satellites and space debris as well as\nre-entry of space objects into the Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, there are\nno proper services to issue collision warnings for satellite operators .\nThe Commission's Communication\n\"Towards a space strategy for the European Union\" (COM(2011)152) recognising\nboth the importance of space infrastructures and derived services as well as\nthe need to ensure their protection, underlines that the Union should define\nthe organisation and governance of a European system for surveillance and\ntracking of spacecraft taking into account its dual nature and the need to\nensure its sustainable exploitation as highlighted in the Industrial Policy\nCommunication adopted in October 2010.\nEU action in this domain is justified with\nthe entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1.12.2009 which expands the EU's\ncompetences in space. Article 189 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union empowers the EU to promote joint initiatives, support research\nand technological development and coordinate the efforts needed for the\nexploration and exploitation of space in the context of a European Space\nPolicy.\nThe need for EU action in the domain has\nbeen supported by Member States in several Council Resolutions and Conclusions[1]. In 2008, the fifth Space\nCouncil meeting confirmed that Europe must \"develop a European capability\nfor the monitoring and surveillance of its space infrastructure and of space\ndebris\"[2].\nIt also confirmed that the Union needs to play an active role in the\nimplementation of the SSA system and its governance mechanisms. Most recently,\nthe May 2011 Council conclusions on the EU space strategy Communication\nreiterate the need for a European SST capability to enhance the safety of\nEuropean space assets and their launches. It stipulates that to this end,\n\"the Union should make the widest possible use of assets, competences and\nskills that are already existing or being developed in Member States, at\nEuropean level and as appropriate internationally\". The Resolution called\non the EU [European Commission and EEAS], in close cooperation with ESA and\nMember States, to come forward with proposals for a governance scheme and a\ndata policy which takes care of the high sensitivity of SST data. These views\nare also shared by the European Parliament in its report on the space strategy\nfor the EU adopted on 30 November 2011[3].\nProgress on two flagship European\nprogrammes, Galileo and Copernicus (the new name for GMES, the Global\nMonitoring for Environment and Security programme) has also raised awareness of\nthe need to protect EU space infrastructure. Galileo is the first EU space\nflagship project and will remain one of the major building blocks of the EU\nintervention in space and Copernicus has a major space-based component (the\nSentinel satellites). Born as a R&D project, Copernicus has recently entered\nits initial operational phase.\nIn line with the above, the current\nproposal for a Decision concerns the establishment of a European service which\nwill seek to prevent collisions between spacecraft or between spacecraft and\ndebris and monitor uncontrolled re-entry of complete spacecraft or parts\nthereof. In technical terms this service is referred to as a European SST\nservice.\nFollowing the approach envisaged in the\nCommission Communication \"Towards a space strategy for the European Union\nthat benefits its citizens\" of 2011[4],\nthis Decision allows for the definition of a partnership, whereby Member States\nwill contribute with their existing and future assets to the SST capability at\nEuropean level and the Union will provide a legal framework and a financial\ncontribution to the implementation of the actions defined. The legal framework\ndefines the governance scheme and the data policy in accordance with the\nrelevant Council conclusions.\nLast, but not least, the proposed European\nSST services accommodate an essential objective of the space industrial policy\nof the EU (indentified in the Commission's Communication on Elements for an EU\nSpace Industrial Policy to be released in 2013), namely to achieve European\ntechnological non-dependence in critical domains, and to maintain independent\naccess to space.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe proposal follows an extensive\nconsultation with stakeholders and the public. It is accompanied by an impact\nassessment.\nOver the past years, DG Enterprise and\nIndustry consulted different parties interested and involved in space affairs\non various areas of potential future EU activities in space and notably on the\ndevelopment of a European Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) service. The\ndevelopment of such service has also been the subject of political debate among\nEU Ministers responsible for space.\nThe main conclusions of these consultations\ncan be summarised as follows:\n\u2013     \nThere is a consensus among EU and ESA Member\nStates Ministers responsible for space that the development of a European SST\nservice is to be led by the EU and not by the European Space Agency (ESA). This\nconsensus is reflected in the Council Resolutions mentioned above. The\nunderlying reason for this emerged in numerous discussions: The European SST\nservice has a security dimension (it allows gathering intelligence on States'\ncivil and military space infrastructure and operations) which the EU, unlike\nESA, has the competence and is equipped to deal with. The TFEU grants the EU\nthe competence to coordinate the exploitation of space systems and has also the\ncompetence and the mechanisms in place to deal with the security dimension of\nsuch a service; Member States consider that ESA should support the EU in this\nendeavour (and it is doing so through its SSA preparatory programme) but, as an\nR&D organisation, does not have the competence and the mechanisms necessary\nto set up and run a European SST service on its own.\n\u2013     \nIn particular, Member States ask the EU to\ndefine the governance and data policy for a European SST service, to play an\nactive role in the setting up of the service, and to make best use of existing\nsensors and expertise. Member States are also explicit as to how security\nconcerns should be taken into account: SST sensors need to remain under\nnational control. Confidentiality of SST information has been defined as a key\nprinciple for SST data policy. SST information should only be declassified on a\ncase by case basis when the need arises.\n\u2013     \nThere is a consensus among EU and ESA Member\nStates and experts that a future European SST service should capitalise and\nbuild on existing sensor assets which should be linked and operated as a\nnetwork. There is also convergence regarding the fact that current assets are\ninsufficient to ensure a desirable level of performance. To reach a desirable\nlevel new assets (such as tracking and surveillance radars and telescopes)\nwould have to be built and integrated in a European SST system. Member States\npossessing sensor capacity and those willing to develop it should play a key\nrole in the setting up of the European SST service.\n\u2013     \nThere is also consensus among Member States and\nexperts in the field that in order to set up and operate a European SST\nservice, it is necessary as a minimum to:\n\u00b7      Link the limited existing assets (mostly ground-based telescopes and\nradars to capture information of the position of satellites) and increase these\ncapacities by building and linking new assets (sensor function);\n\u00b7      To develop a processing function which merges and analyses SST data\ncaptured (processing function); \n\u00b7      Set up a 24/7 front desk that forms the link to the users and issues\nalerts on collision risks and re-entries to satellite operators and relevant\npublic authorities.\n\u2013     \nThroughout years-long discussions, Member States\nowning assets relevant for SST insisted on one crucial governance aspect: Due\nto security concerns, the sensor and processing functions of a future European\nSST system must remain under the control of the national competent authorities\n(in some cases military authorities). The majority of Member States support the\nidea that, for the purpose of setting up a European SST service, those Member\nStates owning existing or new assets could form a consortium to run, as a\nnetwork, both the sensor and processing function. Member States are also of the\nview that the front desk function should be run either by the consortium itself\nof by another body with adequate security credentials, such as the European\nUnion Satellite Center. At the same time, for reasons of national security,\nMember States made clear that they would not collaborate with a commercial\nactor in this domain.\n\u2013     \nThere is a consensus that the development of a\nEuropean SST service should be done in close cooperation with the United States\nof America.\n\u2013     \nMember States are willing to make their assets\navailable for the setting up of the European SST service. They are of the view\nthat, in return, the development of the service should involve EU funding and\nshould, as a minimum, cover operations directly linked to the setting up of the\nservice. In addition to making their assets available, Member States are open\nto contributing to it financially.\nThe consultation also showed that the\npublic opinion is aware of and supports the need to protect space\ninfrastructure.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the Commission proposal\nis Article 189(2) TFUE.\nThe proposal adopts the form of a Decision\nof the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the\nordinary legislative procedure. The text has a general scope and its content is\nto be directly applicable to all Member States, although participation in the\nestablishment and operation of the European SST system is not mandatory.\nThe proposal defines the objectives of the\nproposed action, namely, the provision of Space Surveillance and Tracking\nservices, the scope of the services to be provided, the governance aspects, as\nwell as the budgetary resources. The main text is supplemented by an annex on\nSST data policy principles that forms an integral part of it.\nThe proposal complies with the principles\nof subsidiarity and proportionality. The objective of the proposal, namely support\nthe setting up of European SST services by means of the federation of existing\nnational assets exceeds the financial and technical capacities of a Member\nState acting alone and can only be achieved in a satisfactory manner at Union\nlevel. As far as proportionality is concerned, the Union action does not go\nbeyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of the proposal insofar as\nthe planned budget corresponds to costs estimated following extensive analyses\nand where the governance model used appears to be the most suitable.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe SST programme remains within the\noverall EU budget envelope proposed by the Commission for the next MFF. No\nfunding requests beyond the MFF proposal are made. Article 11(1) of the\nproposal specifies that funding for the SST support programme shall be drawn\nfrom other relevant programmes in full compatibility with their legal base. \nThe Union will support activities by means\nof grants (including lump sums). The beneficiaries of such grants will be participating\nMember States contributing with national assets to the European SST system as\nwell as the EUSC where it cooperates with the participating Member States in\nthe establishment and operation of the SST service function as referred to in\nArticle 3(c) functioning as EU \"Front Desk\". The indicative Union\noverall contribution to the implementation of the support programme is EUR 70\nmillion over the period from 2014-2020 at current prices. However, this overall\ncontribution depends on the outcome of the ongoing co-decision process on the\nMFF and the MFF related programmes from which funding should be drawn for the\nSST support programme. Furthermore, it will depend on decisions to be made\nunder each of the relevant programmes concerning the use of funding for the\nactivities to be co-financed by the SST support programme.\nThe estimated costs of the programmes are\nthe result of extensive analyses and discussions with experts, in particular\nfrom the space agencies or similar bodies from Member States and from ESA.\n2013/0064 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nEstablishing a space surveillance and\ntracking support programme\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 189(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[6],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication\nentitled \"Towards a space strategy for the European Union that benefits\nits citizens\"[7]\nthe Commission underlined that the shared competence in the field of space conferred\nupon the Union by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)\ngoes hand in hand with a reinforced partnership with the Member States. The\nCommission also emphasised that all new actions must be based on existing\nresources and on identifying jointly where new resources are needed.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Resolution of 26\nSeptember 2008, 'Taking forward the European space policy'[8], the Council recalls that space\nassets have become indispensable for our economy and that their security must\nbe ensured. It underlined the 'need for Europe [\u2026] to develop a capability for\nthe monitoring and surveillance of its space infrastructure and space debris,\ninitially based on existing national and European assets, taking benefit of\nrelationships which may be established with other partner nations and their\ncapabilities'.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Resolution 'Global\nchallenges: taking full benefit of European space systems'[9] of 25 November 2010, the\nCouncil recognises the need for a future space situational awareness\n(hereinafter referred to as 'SSA') capability as an activity at European level\nto develop and exploit existing national and European civil and military\nassets, and invites the European Commission and the Council to propose a\ngovernance scheme and data policy that will allow Member States to contribute\nwith their relevant national capabilities in accordance with applicable\nsecurity requirements and regulations. It further invites 'all European\ninstitutional actors to explore appropriate measures' which would build on\ndefined civil and military user requirements, make use of relevant assets in\naccordance with applicable security requirements, and take into account the\nearly developments from the SSA preparatory programme of the European Space\nAgency (ESA).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council conclusions of\n31 May 2011 on the Communication of the Commission 'Towards a space strategy\nfor the European Union that benefits its citizens'[10] and the Council resolution of\n6 December 2011 'Orientations concerning added value and benefits of space for\nthe security of European citizens'[11]\nreiterated the 'need for an effective SSA capability at European level', and\ncalled on the Union to make 'the widest possible use of assets, competences and\nskills that are already existing or being developed in Member States, at\nEuropean level and as appropriate, international level'. Recognising the dual\nuse nature of such a system and taking account its particular security\ndimension, the Council called on the Commission 'in close cooperation with the\nHigh Representative [of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy], in\nclose cooperation with ESA and Member States, which own such assets and have\ncapacities, and in consultation with all actors involved, to come forward with\nproposals to fully exploit and build on these assets and capacities in order to\ndevelop a SSA capability as an activity at European level, and in that context,\nto define an appropriate governance and data policy taking care of the high\nsensitivity of SSA data'.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Space debris has become\nthe most serious threat to the sustainability of space activities. A space\nsurveillance and tracking (hereinafter referred to as 'SST') support programme\nshould therefore be established with the aim to support the setting up and\noperation of services consisting of monitoring and surveying space objects with\na view to preventing damage to spacecraft resulting from collisions, as well as\nto prevent damage to ground infrastructure or human population as a result of uncontrolled\nre-entries of entire spacecraft or space debris thereof into the Earth's\natmosphere.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of SST\nservices will benefit all public and private operators of space-based\ninfrastructures, including the Union in view of its responsibilities for its EU\nspace programmes \u2013 European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS)\nand Galileo being implemented by Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of\nthe European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo)[12] and Copernicus/GMES\nestablished by Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 Of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 22 September 2010 on the European Earth monitoring programme\n(GMES) and its initial operations (2011 to 2013)[13]. Re-entry warnings will also\nbenefit national public authorities concerned with civil protection.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SST services should be\ncomplementary to research activities related to the protection of space-based\ninfrastructure carried out under the Horizon 2020 programme established by [reference\nto Horizon 2020 Regulation to be added once adopted], as well as to the\nEuropean Space Agency's activities in this domain.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SST support programme\nshould also be complementary to existing mitigation measures such as the United\nNations (UN) guidelines for space debris mitigation or other initiatives, such\nas the Union proposal for an international Code of Conduct on outer space\nactivities.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Civil-military SSA user\nrequirements were defined in the Commission staff working paper 'European space\nsituational awareness high-level civil-military user requirements'[14] endorsed by the Member States\nin the Political and Security Committee of the Council on 18 November 2011[15]. The provision of SST services\nshould serve only civilian purposes. Purely military requirements should not be\naddressed by this Decision.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The operation of SST\nservices should be based on a partnership between the Union and the Member\nStates and use existing as well as future national expertise and assets, such\nas mathematical analysis and modelling know-how, ground-based radars or\ntelescopes made available by participating Member States. The Member States\nretain ownership and control over their assets and remain responsible for their\noperations, maintenance and renewal.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\nSatellite Centre (EUSC), an agency of the Union established by Council Joint\nAction of 20 July 2001 on the establishment of a European Union Satellite\nCentre (2001/555/CFSP)[16]\nwhich provides geospatial imagery information services and products with\nvarious levels of classification to civil and military users, could be\nresponsible for the operation and provision of SST services. Its expertise in\nhandling confidential information in a secure environment and its tight\ninstitutional links with the Member States is an asset facilitating the\nprovision of SST services. A pre-condition for the EUSC participation in the\nSST support programme is the amendment of the Council Joint Action which does\ncurrently not provide for EUSC action in the field of SST.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Precise information on the\nnature, specifications and location of certain space objects may affect the\nsecurity of the European Union or its Member States. Adequate security\nconsiderations should therefore be taken into account in the establishment and\noperation of the network of SST sensors, the capacity to process and analyse\nSST data and the provision of SST services. It is therefore necessary to lay\ndown general provisions on the use and secure exchange of SST data and\ninformation between the Member States, the EUSC and the recipients of SST\nservices in this Decision. Furthermore, the European Commission and the\nEuropean External Action Service should define the coordination mechanisms\nneeded to address matters related to the security of the SST support programme.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participating Member States\nand the EUSC should be responsible for the negotiation and implementation of\nthe provisions on the use and secure exchange of SST data and information. The\nprovisions on the use and exchange of SST data and information set out in this\nDecision and in the agreement between the participating Member States and the\nEUSC should take into account the recommendations on SST data security endorsed\nby the Security Committee of the Council. [17]\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Security Committee of\nthe Council recommended the creation of a risk management structure to ensure\nthat data security issues are duly taken into account in the implementation of the\nSST support programme. For that purpose, the appropriate risk management\nstructures and procedures should be established by the participating Member\nStates and the EUSC.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SST support programme should\nbe financed by the Union in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the\nfinancial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union[18].

avoidance of unnecessary manoeuvres which are\nrisky in itself and reduce a satellite\u2019s lifetime);\niii) Survey uncontrolled re-entries of spacecraft or their debris\ninto the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and provide more accurate and efficient early\nwarnings to national security and civil protection/disaster management\nadministrations with the aim to reduce the potential risks to the security and\nhealth of European citizens and mitigate potential damage to critical\nterrestrial infrastructure.\nHence, this proposal contributes to ensuring the success of the EU\nflagship programmes Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus/GMES which form integral part\nof the Europe 2020 Strategy and policies for sustainable growth.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned \nSpecific objective No 1\nEstablish the regulatory framework for the setting-up and operation\nof an SST sensor function (network of SST sensors owned by Member States), and\nof a processing function\nSpecific objective No 2\nEstablish the regulatory framework for the setting-up and operation\nof SST services to public and private spacecraft operators and public\nauthorities users\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nChapter XX 01 \u2013 Administrative expenditure allocated to policy areas\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nIt is expected that, as a consequence of the proposal, effective and\ntimely services will be provided to public and private spacecraft operators as\nwell as to Member States which will enable them to avoid the economic, social\nand environmental impact resulting from: \ni) damages or destruction of spacecrafts due to collisions between\nspacecrafts and other space objects, as well as uncontrolled re-entries;

The EU's economy,\nsociety, security and political independence heavily rely on space-based\nsystems and infrastructures. This is the reason why the EU has engaged in costly\nlarge-scale space projects such as Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus. These systems\nand infrastructures need to be protected against damage or destruction due to\ncollisions or uncontrolled re-entries in order to ensure their actual operation\nand services delivery. Such protection is a permanent requirement.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nFrom discussions with stakeholders over the past years, it became\nclear that the setting up of operational European SST services will require the\nintervention of the EU.\nThere is a consensus among EU and European Space Agency (ESA)\nMinisters responsible for space that the development of this service is to be\nled by the EU and not by ESA. This consensus is reflected in several Space\nCouncil Resolutions (Space Council resolution of 26 Nov. 2010, pt. 24;\nCompetitiveness Council conclusions of 31 May 2011, pt. 14-15; Space Council\nresolution of 6 Dec. 2011, chap. II). In\nparticular, Member States asked the EU to define the governance and data policy\nfor a European SST service, to play an active role in the setting up of the\nEuropean service, and to make best use of sensors and expertise that already\nexists at national and European level. Member States were also very explicit as\nto how security concerns should be taken into account: SST sensors need to\nremain under national control. Confidentiality of SST information was defined\nas the key principle for the SST data policy (e.g. all information is to be\nclassified and to be declassified on a case by case basis only).\nThe reason for such position is not formally recorded but emerged in\nnumerous discussions: European SST service has a security dimension (it allows\ngathering intelligence on States' civil and military space infrastructure and\noperations) which the EU, unlike ESA, has competence and is equipped to deal\nwith. The TFEU grants the EU competence to coordinate the exploitation of space\nactivities and the TEU confers the EU competence over security issues such as\nthose that arise in the context of SST. The EU has the necessary legislative\ncapacity to put in place governance mechanisms and a data policy for SST.\nESA, on the other hand, is a world-class R&D agency designed to\ndefine and implement scientific, technology and space application development\nprogrammes. ESA is neither conceived to do the sort of complex policy and\nlegislative work necessary to set up an SST system where assets are largely in\nthe hands of the military, nor has it been designed to operate space-based\nservices (a fact which ESA itself underlines in its policy documents).\nArguably, Member States could set up a new organisation to deal with\nSSA. Such organisation would have to have many of the features that the EU\nalready has. Therefore such new organisation would generate duplications and\ninefficiency. In addition, some Member States have expressed concerns that any\nsolution outside the EU framework may be dominated by those Member States that\nalready possess today some sensor capacity preventing others from developing\ntheir own in the framework of a truly European service.\nFinally, the EU does not seek to replace initiatives taken by Member\nStates individually or in the framework of ESA. It seeks to complement actions\ntaken at their level and reinforce coordination where such coordination is\nnecessary to achieve common objectives.\nThe EU involvement is necessary to aggregate the investment required\nto fund certain space projects, set in place governance arrangements, define a\ndata policy and ensure that existing and future capacities are brought to work\nin a coordinated and efficient manner ensuring a robust and interoperable\nsystem benefiting all relevant European stakeholders.\nFurthermore, the proposed EU action does not seek to replace or\nduplicate existing mitigation measures at international or multi-lateral level,\nsuch as the UN guidelines for space debris mitigation or the EU proposal for an\ninternational Code of Conduct on outer space activities. These measures will\nnot solve the problem at hand, but will reduce the growth of space debris in\nthe long-term.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThere is no previous experience in this area. However, wherever\ninformation and data is shared, the added value is undeniable.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nThe proposal COM(2011) 814 final for a regulation on the\nimplementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems\nmentions the need to protect the system through an SSA system (recital 15,\narticle 3c) and foresees funding for such activities (article 7.1a), without\nprejudging the outcome of the legislative procedure and of the next MFF.\nThe space segment of Copernicus has similar protection needs. Hence,\nCopernicus might contribute to the funding of SST activities depending on the\noutcome of the next MFF.\nFurthermore, this proposal is coherent and will create synergies\nwith the objectives for space and security research under the proposed 'Horizon\n2020' framework (COM(2011) 809 final), as well as with those on critical\ninfrastructure protection under the proposed 'Internal Security Fund'\n(COM(2011)753 final). Under both instruments funding is available for SST\nactivities, without prejudging the outcome of the legislative procedure and of\nthe next MFF.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00fd\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2020\n\u2013     \n\u00fd\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[27] \n\u00fd Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[28]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nUnion funding for the SST support programme will be drawn from other\nrelevant programmes foreseen in the next MFF in full compatibility with their\nlegal base. The relevant programmes may include Galileo, Horizon 2020 and the\nEU Internal Security Fund. Monitoring and reporting requirements of these\nprogrammes will apply.\nIrrespective of the monitoring and reporting requirements of the\nprogrammes providing funding for the SST programme, a specific monitoring\nsystem will be put in place to ensure the highest quality outputs and most\nefficient use of resources. Monitoring will run throughout the life of the\nprogramme. It will be based on feedback about the programme from the\nbeneficiaries.\nAn extended impact assessment integrating ex-ante evaluation\nrequirements has been undertaken. Following a comparative assessment of the\navailable policy options, the preferred policy option was identified and the\nassociated impact, risks, assumptions and cost-effectiveness were assessed.\nThis proposal is fully consistent with the conclusions of the assessment.\nA mid-term evaluation of the programme will be undertaken in the\nfifth year of its implementation, hence in due time for the preparation of the\nfollowing multiannual financial framework. The evaluation will focus on the\nresults achieved and the qualitative aspects of implementation of the\nprogramme.

All participating administrations\nengage themselves to respect the Commission's financial and administrative\nrules on expenses.\nFor the Commission the provisions of the Financial Regulation apply\nconcerning the ex-ante verification of commitments and payments by the\nfinancial unit, as well as the written declarations to be given by the AOSD. Administrative monitoring of the grants and related payments will be the responsibility of the central\nCommission services.
