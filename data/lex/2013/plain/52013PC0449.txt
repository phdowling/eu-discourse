E-invoicing is a particularly\npromising area to help achieve this objective.\nThe widely-acknowledged benefits of\ne-invoicing have led several EU Member States (Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Finland) to require the submission of e-invoices in public procurement in all or\npart of the public sector. However, these bottom-up initiatives are for the\nmost part based on national standards, most of which are not interoperable. As\nsuch, they lead to an increase in complexity and costs for firms wishing to\nparticipate in cross-border procurement, and thereby generate market access\nbarriers. The overall result is that the adoption of e-invoicing in Europe is still very limited, accounting for 4 to 15% of all invoices exchanged. An\ninitiative in the area of e-invoicing in public procurement would prevent the\nfurther fragmentation of the internal market and facilitate the uptake of\ne-invoicing. Considering the fact that public procurement covered by the Public\nProcurement Directives represents roughly 3.7% of EU GDP, the implementation of\nan initiative aimed at eliminating market access barriers in e-invoicing in\npublic procurement would make the public sector a 'lead market' in this area\nand spearhead its wider use in the economy. \nOver the last couple of years, a\nsignificant number of actors have called for action at the European level to\nstimulate the e-invoicing market across the EU, especially with regards to the\nexchange of invoices by governments. In the Communication \"Reaping the\nbenefits of e-invoicing for Europe\", COM(2010) 712, the Commission has\ncalled for e-invoicing to become the predominant invoicing mode in the EU by\n2020. In a resolution in April 2012, the European Parliament called for making\ne-invoicing compulsory in public procurement by 2016, while Member States have\ncalled for measures to promote e-invoicing at the Informal Competitiveness\nCouncil of February 2012 and in the European Council Conclusions of June 2012.\nThe occasion therefore seems ripe to undertake the proposed initiative on\ne-invoicing in public procurement and effectively remove the market access\nbarriers caused by insufficient e-invoicing interoperability.\nA proposal in this area would also\ncomplement the on-going modernisation of EU public procurement rules, a key\naction under the \u201cSingle Market Act I\u201d, in particular with regard to the\nproposals on a full transition to e-procurement. Finally, action on promoting\nthe uptake of e-invoicing in public procurement is seen by the Commission as a\npriority. This is reflected in the inclusion of an initiative on e-invoicing in\npublic procurement in the \u201cSingle Market Act II\u201d as one of its Key Actions.\n\u00b7                        \nLinks with standardisation issues\nThe proposal foresees that a new European\ne-invoicing standard will be drawn by the relevant European standard-setting\nbody, in this case the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN). This will\nbe done on the basis of a mandate by the European Commission which will be\nprepared at a later stage. The mandate will include a list of minimum\nrequirements which the standard will have to incorporate. The work will then be\ncarried out in line with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7                        \nConsultations with the interested parties\nThe content of this proposal builds on\nextensive consultations with stakeholders. Two meetings of the European Multi\nStakeholder Forum (EMSF) on e-invoicing were held in Brussels (on 26 September\n2012 and 7 March 2013) and provided an important forum for discussing the\nbuilding blocks of the potential EU initiative on e-invoicing in public\nprocurement. The discussion papers of four Activity Groups of the EMSF provided\npractical feedback from the representatives of national multi-stakeholder\nforums and practitioners, such as service providers and firms. Additionally, a\nquestionnaire was circulated among the members of the EMSF which attempted to\ngather data on existing e-invoicing systems, and their effectiveness, costs and\nbenefits. The 20 replies which were received (19 from national fora and one\nfrom a standards-setting body) were also extensively used in the Impact\nAssessment.\nThe content of the initiative was presented\nand discussed with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts (ACPC),\ncomprising of Member State representatives, during a meeting on 19 September\n2012. More informal bilateral meetings also took place with representatives of\nvarious industry associations, including the European E-invoicing Service\nProviders Association (EESPA), Business Europe and the European Association of\nCraft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME).\nFinally, an on-line consultation via the\nInteractive Policy Making tool (IPM) was held between 22 October 2012 and 14\nJanuary 2013 to gather information on current usage of e-invoicing and opinions\nconcerning a potential EU initiative in this area. The public response to the\nconsultation was very positive, with more than 700 replies submitted.\nThe various consultations with stakeholders\nprovided the Commission with a good cross-section of the views held by the\ndifferent stakeholders.\n\u00b7                        \nImpact Assessment\nThe Impact Assessment was submitted to the\nImpact Assessment Board (IAB) in February 2013. During the meeting of 20 March\n2013, the IAB raised a number of issues which in the board\u2019s opinion would need\nto be addressed further, and requested a resubmission of the Impact Assessment.\n\nThe revised Impact Assessment was\nresubmitted to the IAB on 19 April 2013. The main modifications in response to\nthe opinion of the IAB concerned the strengthening of the problem definition\nand the subsidiarity and proportionality analysis, the improvement of the\nimpacts analysis and better presentation of stakeholder views.\nOn the 8th of May 2013, the IAB\nissued a positive opinion. \nAfter having analysed five different\noptions, the Impact Assessment concluded that the most appropriate solution is\nto impose on contracting authorities and contracting entities an obligation to\naccept the reception of electronic invoices complying with a new common European\ninvoicing standard as of a particular date. This would help to overcome the\nfragmentation inherent in the current patchwork of national e-invoicing systems\nand guarantee the integrity of the internal market. The chosen approach would\ncombine the strong stimulus of an obligation to ensure interoperability in\ne-invoicing in public procurement with a more flexible approach as to the most\nappropriate means of ensuring the use of e-invoicing as such.\nThe final Impact Assessment report and its\nexecutive summary are published with this proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). By providing for the\nestablishment of a common European standard and obliging Member States to\nensure that contracting authorities and contracting entities do not refuse the\nreception of electronic invoices complying with such European standard, this\nproposal will remove market access barriers in cross-border public procurement\nand obstacles to trade. It will therefore improve the conditions for the\nfunctioning of the internal market.\n\u00b7                        \nSubsidiarity principle\nAccording to the principle of subsidiarity,\nthe Union can act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed\naction cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can be better\nachieved at EU level. For the reasons detailed below, EU action is needed to\nremove market barriers and obstacles to trade deriving from the existence of\ndifferent national rules and standards as well as to ensure interoperability.\nHence, the proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle. The number of\nexisting standards, requirements, and solutions remains very large and\ne-invoicing networks appear to be growing more, not less, entrenched along\nnational boundaries. The bottom-up initiatives from Member States have\naggravated the interoperability problem, as more e-invoicing standards have\nemerged on the market, further increasing the costs and complexity of ensuring\ninteroperability. As a consequence, actions undertaken by Members States are\nnot sufficient to ensure e-invoicing interoperability in cross-border\nprocurement.\nThe rationale for an EU action stems from\nthe transnational nature of the problem of insufficient interoperability\nbetween national (and proprietary) e-invoicing systems. Given the cross-border\nnature of public procurement transactions covered by the Public Procurement Directives\nand the lack of meaningful results of some Member States\u2019 efforts to resolve\nthe interoperability issues, an EU action on e-invoicing in public procurement\nseems to be the only solution available to co-ordinate their actions and to\nprevent further fragmentation of the internal market. Furthermore, only the EU\ncan act as an unbiased arbiter in the discussion on interoperability and\nobjectively recommend the best approach to eliminating market barriers.\nThere is little indication that, without EU\naction, the current situation concerning e-invoicing in public procurement will\nchange or improve in the foreseeable future.\n\u00b7                        \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle since it does not go beyond what is necessary in\norder to achieve the objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the\ninternal market.\nDifferent policy options have been assessed\nin the Impact Assessment, leading to the conclusion that the preferred option\nis also optimal in terms of proportionality - the chosen approach would combine\nthe strong stimulus of an obligation to ensure interoperability in e-invoicing\nin public procurement with a more flexible approach as to the most appropriate\nmeans of ensuring the use of e-invoicing as such. \n\u00b7                        \nChoice of instruments\nThe choice of legal form for the\nCommission's legislative proposal is determined both by the chosen legal basis\nand by the content of the proposal. As mentioned previously, Article 114 TFEU\nis the appropriate legal basis for this proposal. In principle, this article\nleaves open the choice of either a directive or a regulation as the legal form\nof a proposal. However, since the objective of the proposal can sufficiently be\nachieved by imposing on the Member States an obligation of result while leaving\nthem the choice of form and methods, the choice of a directive is the most\nappropriate.\n\u00b7                        \nTransposition measures and explanatory\ndocuments\nNational measures at different levels\n(legislative, regulatory, administrative and technical) are likely to be needed\nin order to transpose this Directive and to concretely enable contracting\nauthorities and contracting entities to apply it. Only Member States can\nexplain how these different measures transpose the Directive and how they\ninteract each with the others. Hence, the notification of transposition\nmeasures needs to be accompanied by such explanatory documents.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nAll budgetary implications linked to the\ndevelopment of a European standard by the appropriate European standardisation\norganisation are already covered by the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nThis proposal has no additional financial impact over and beyond the resources\nalready allocated to the standardisation actions in the current and the future\nMultiannual Financial Framework.\n2013/0213 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non electronic invoicing in public\nprocurement\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several global, national,\nregional and proprietary standards on electronic invoices exist and are\ncurrently used in Member States. None of these standards prevails, and most of\nthem are not interoperable.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of a common\nstandard, Member States decide, when promoting the use of electronic invoices\nin public procurement or making it mandatory, to develop their own technical\nsolutions based on separate national standards. Hence, the number of different\nstandards coexisting across Member States is increasing and is likely to\ncontinue increasing in the future.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The multiplicity of\nnon-interoperable standards results in excessive complexity, legal uncertainty\nand additional operating costs for economic operators using electronic invoices\nacross Member States. Economic operators wishing to carry out cross-border\nprocurement activities are often required to comply with a new e-invoicing\nstandard each time they access a new market. By discouraging economic operators\nfrom undertaking cross-border procurement activities, the divergent legal and\ntechnical requirements concerning electronic invoices constitute market access\nbarriers in cross-border public procurement and obstacles to trade. They obstruct\nthe fundamental freedoms and thus have a direct effect on the functioning of\nthe internal market.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those obstacles to intra-Union\ntrade are likely to increase in the future as more non-interoperable national\nand proprietary standards are developed and as the use of electronic invoices\nin public procurement becomes more widespread or is made mandatory in Member\nStates.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obstacles to trade\nderiving from the co-existence of several legal requirements and technical\nstandards on electronic invoices and from the lack of interoperability should\nbe removed or reduced. In order to achieve this objective, a common European\nstandard for the semantic data model of the core electronic invoice should be\ndeveloped. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\napply the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation[3] to request the relevant\nEuropean standardisation organisation to draft a European standard for the\nsemantic data model of the core electronic invoice. In its request to the\nrelevant European standardisation organisation, the Commission should require\nthat such European standard is technologically neutral, in order to avoid any\ndistortion of competition. Since electronic invoices may contain personal data,\nthe Commission should also require that such European standard guarantees\npersonal data protection in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October\n1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal\ndata and on the free movement of such data[4].\nIn addition to these minimum requirements, the Commission should determine, in\nits request to the relevant European standardisation organisation, further\nrequirements as to the content of such European standard and a deadline for its\nadoption.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European standard for the\nsemantic data model of the core electronic invoice should build on existing\nspecifications, including in particular those developed by European or\ninternational organisations such as CEN (CWA 16356 and CWA 16562), ISO\n(Financial Invoice based on the ISO 20022 methodology), and UN/CEFACT (CII v.\n2.0). It should not require electronic signatures. Such European standard\nshould define semantic data elements referring to, in particular, complementary\nseller and buyer data, process identifiers, invoice attributes, invoice item\ndetails, delivery information, payment details and terms. It should also be\ncompatible with the existing standards for payments in order to allow for\nautomatic processing of payments.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the European\nstandard drawn up by the relevant European standardisation organisation\nsatisfies the requirements contained in the Commission\u2019s request, the\nreferences of such European standard should be published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contracting authorities\nand contracting entities should not refuse the reception of electronic invoices\nwhich comply with such common European standard on the grounds of\nnon-compliance with other technical requirements (for example national or\nsector specific requirements).\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should apply\nto electronic invoices received by contracting authorities and contracting\nentities and issued as a result of the performance of contracts awarded in\naccordance with Directive [replacing Directive 2004/18/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of\nprocedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and\npublic service contracts[5]],\nDirective [replacing Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities\noperating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors[6]], or Directive 2009/81/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination\nof procedures for the award of certain works contracts, supply contracts and\nservice contracts by contracting authorities or entities in the fields of\ndefence and security, and amending Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC[7].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The goal of\ninteroperability is to allow information to be presented and processed in a\nconsistent manner between business systems, regardless of their technology,\napplication or platform. Full interoperability includes the ability to\ninteroperate in terms of content (semantic), format (syntax), and transmission.\nSemantic interoperability implies that the precise meaning of the exchanged\ninformation is preserved and well understood in an unambiguous manner,\nindependently of the way in which it is physically represented or transmitted. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By ensuring semantic interoperability\nand improving legal certainty, this Directive will also promote the uptake of\nelectronic invoicing in public procurement, thereby allowing Member States,\ncontracting authorities, contracting entities, and economic operators to gain\nsignificant benefits in terms of savings, environmental impact, and reduction\nof administrative burdens.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council, in its\nconclusions of 28 and 29 June 2012, stated that priority should be given to\nmeasures aimed at further developing cross-border online trade, including by\nfacilitating the transition to electronic invoicing.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament in\nits resolution of 20 April 2012 pointed at market fragmentation resulting from\nnational rules on electronic invoicing, underlined the substantial benefits\noffered by electronic invoicing, and stressed the importance of legal\ncertainty, a clear technical environment and open and interoperable electronic invoicing\nsolutions based on common legal requirements, business processes and technical\nstandards. For these reasons, the European Parliament called on making\nelectronic invoicing in public procurement mandatory by 2016.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Multi-stakeholder\nForum on Electronic Invoicing (e-invoicing) set up by Commission Decision of 2\nNovember 2010[8]\nadopted a Recommendation on interoperability for electronic invoicing by the\nuse of a semantic data model in [month] 2013.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since contracting\nauthorities and contracting entities will be able to accept electronic invoices\nwhich comply with standards other than the common European standard, as well as\npaper invoices unless otherwise provided in national legislation, this\nDirective does not place any additional costs or burden on enterprises,\nincluding micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the meaning of\nCommission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition\nof micro, small and medium-sized enterprises[9].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules on electronic invoicing\nare already contained in Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on\nthe common system of value added tax[10].\nIt should be ensured that the conditions for issuing and accepting electronic\ninvoices for VAT purposes remain unaffected by any provisions in this\nDirective. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow contracting\nauthorities and contracting entities to take the technical measures that,\nfollowing the establishment of the European standard, are necessary to comply\nwith the provisions of this Directive, a transposition deadline of 48 months is\njustified.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nremoving market barriers and obstacles to trade deriving from the existence of\ndifferent national rules and standards and of ensuring interoperability cannot\nsufficiently be achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\n2011 on explanatory documents[11],\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\njustified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nScope\nThis Directive shall apply to electronic invoices\nissued as a result of the performance of contracts awarded in accordance with\nDirective [replacing Directive 2004/18/EC], Directive [replacing Directive\n2004/17/EC], or Directive 2009/81/EC.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \n\u2018electronic invoice\u2019 means an invoice that has\nbeen issued and received in any electronic format;\n(2)                   \n\u2018semantic data model\u2019 means a structured and\nlogically interrelated set of terms and meanings that specify the content\nexchanged in electronic invoices;\n(3)                   \n\u2018core electronic invoice\u2019 means a subset of\ninformation contained in an electronic invoice that is essential to enable\ncross-border interoperability, including the necessary information to ensure\nlegal compliance;\n(4)                   \n\u2018contracting authorities\u2019 means contracting\nauthorities as defined in Article [2] of Directive [replacing Directive\n2004/18/EC];\n(5)                   \n\u2018contracting entities\u2019 means contracting\nentities as defined in Article [4] of Directive [replacing Directive\n2004/17/EC];\n(6)                   \n\u2018European standard\u2019 means a European standard as\ndefined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 3\nEstablishment of a European standard\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall\nrequest the relevant European standardisation organisation to draw up a\nEuropean standard for the semantic data model of the core electronic invoice.\nThe Commission shall require that the European\nstandard for the semantic data model of the core electronic invoice be technologically\nneutral, and guarantee personal data protection in accordance with Directive\n95/46/EC.\nThe request shall be adopted in accordance with\nthe procedure laid down in Article 10(1) to (5) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the European\nstandard drawn up following the request referred to in paragraph 1 satisfies\nthe requirements contained therein, the Commission shall publish the reference\nto such European standard in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 4\nElectronic invoices complying with the European standard\nMember States shall ensure that contracting\nauthorities and contracting entities do not refuse to receive electronic\ninvoices which comply with the European standard whose reference has been\npublished pursuant to Article 3(2).\nArticle 5\nDirective 2006/112/EC\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the\nprovisions of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.\nArticle 6\nTransposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall bring\ninto force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to\ncomply with this Directive by 48 months following the entry into force at the\nlatest.
