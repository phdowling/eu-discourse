The Chair of the Scientific\nCommittee submitted the risk assessment report to the Commission and to the Council\non 16 April 2013.\nThe main results of the risk assessment are\nthe following:\n(1)                   \n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is a synthetic\nderivative of indole substituted at the phenyl side of the indole ring system.\nIt appears to be a stimulant substance that may also have hallucinogenic\neffects. Despite the structural similarities with better known compounds such\nas \u03b1-Methyltryptamine (AMT), 5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran (5-APB) and the\ninternationally controlled drug 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), the\neffects of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole cannot be compared with the ones of these\nsubstances due to potential differences in mechanisms of action.\n(2)                   \nThe acute toxicity of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole\nappears to provoke adverse effects in humans such as tachycardia and\nhyperthermia, and may also cause mydriasis, agitation and tremor. In addition,\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole may interact with other substances, including medical\nproducts and stimulants that act on the monoaminergic system.\n(3)                   \nSince 2012, seven Member States, as well as Croatia and Norway, have detected 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole and reported information about it to the\nEMCDDA and Europol. Between April and August 2012, four Member States reported 24\nfatalities where 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole alone or in combination with other\nsubstances has been detected post-mortem, and three Member States have reported\n21 non-fatal intoxications associated with this new psychoactive substance. If\nthis new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used,\nthe implications for individual and public health could be significant.\n(4)                   \n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole has no known,\nestablished or acknowledged medical value or use and, apart from its use as an\nanalytical reference standard and in scientific research, there is no\nindication that it is being used for other purposes.\nPursuant to Article 8 (1) of the Council\nDecision, within six week from the date of receipt of the risk assessment\nreport, the Commission shall present to the Council either an initiative to subject\nthe new psychoactive substance to control measures across the Union, or a\nreport explaining its views on why such an initiative is not deemed necessary.\nAlthough the scientific evidence concerning\nthe overall risks of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is limited at this stage, the\nCommission considers that there are grounds for subjecting the substance to\ncontrol measures across the Union. The main reason is that, according to the\ninformation available from the risk assessment report, the acute toxicity of\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is such that it can cause severe harms to the health of\nindividuals. Moreover, the risks are heightened by the fact that\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole has been reported to be consumed unknowingly by some\nusers together with or instead of other stimulant substances.\nThe objective of this proposal for a\nCouncil Decision is to call upon the Member States to subject 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole\nto control measures and criminal penalties as provided under their legislation\nby virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on\nPsychotropic Substances.\n2013/0207 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to\ncontrol measures\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Decision\n2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and\ncontrol of new psychoactive substances[3],\nand in particular Article 8(3) thereof, \nHaving regard to the initiative of the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A risk assessment report\non the new psychoactive substance 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole was drawn up in\ncompliance with Article 6 of Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the\nextended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and\nDrug Addiction, and was subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the\nCouncil on 16 April 2013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is\na synthetic derivative of indole substituted at the phenyl side of the indole\nring system. It appears to be a stimulant substance that may also have\nhallucinogenic effects. 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole has been found mostly as a\npowder but also in tablets and capsules, and is commercially available on the\ninternet and from 'head shops', marketed as 'research chemical'. It has also\nbeen detected in samples of a product sold as a 'legal high', called 'Benzo\nFury', and in tablets resembling ecstasy.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing information\nand data suggests that the acute toxicity of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole can\nprovoke adverse effects in humans, such as tachycardia and hyperthermia, and\nmay also cause mydriasis, agitation and tremor. 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole may\ninteract with other substances, including medical products and stimulants that\nact on the monoaminergic system. The specific physical effects of\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole in humans are difficult to determine because there are\nno published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological\nand behavioural effects, and dependence potential, and because of the limited\ninformation and data available.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There have been a total of\n24 fatalities registered in four Member States between April and August 2012,\nwhere 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole alone, or in combination with other substances,\nhas been detected in post-mortem samples. While it is not possible to determine\nwith certainty the role of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole in all of the fatalities, in\nsome cases it has been specifically noted in the cause of death. If this new\npsychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the\nimplications for individual and public health could be significant. There is no\ninformation available on the social risks posed by 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nine European countries\nhave reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction\nand Europol that they detected 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole. No prevalence data is\navailable on the use of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole, but the limited information that\nexists suggests that it may be consumed in similar environments as other\nstimulants, such as home, bars, nightclubs, music festivals.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no information\nthat suggests that 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole is manufactured in the Union, and there is no evidence suggesting the involvement of organised crime in the\nmanufacture, distribution or supply of this new psychoactive substance.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole\nhas no known, established or acknowledged medical value or use, and there is no\nmarketing authorisation covering this new psychoactive substance in the Union. Apart from its use as an analytical reference standard and in scientific research,\nthere is no indication that it is being used for other purposes.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole\nhas not been under assessment and is currently not under assessment by the\nUnited Nations system. Two Member States control this new psychoactive\nsubstance under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971\nUnited Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Five European countries apply\nlegislation on new psychoactive substances, dangerous goods or medicines to\ncontrol 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk assessment report\nreveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole\nand points out that further research would be needed to determine the health\nand social risks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information\nprovides sufficient ground for subjecting 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control\nmeasures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as\ndocumented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that\nusers may unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use,\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole should be subjected to control measures across the\nUnion.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since six Member States\nalready control 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole via legislative provisions of different\nnature, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and\njudicial cooperation, and protect users from the risks that its consumption can\npose,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe new psychoactive substance,\n5-(2-aminopropyl)indole, is hereby subjected to control measures across the Union.\nArticle 2\nBy [one year from the date this Decision\nis published], Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance\nwith their national law, to subject 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole to control measures\nand criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying with\ntheir obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic\nSubstances.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\ntwentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Document 5284/13.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
