Fostering the employability\r\nand productivity of young people is key to bringing them onto the labour market.\r\nHowever, although traineeships increasingly represent\r\na standard feature in our labour markets, their spread has been accompanied by\r\ngrowing concerns as to learning content and working conditions. If traineeships\r\nare really to facilitate access to employment, they must offer quality learning\r\ncontent and adequate working conditions, and should not be a cheap substitute\r\nfor regular jobs. \nIn December 2012, the\r\nCommission presented the Youth Employment Package[1] including the launching of the second stage consultation of social\r\npartners on a Quality Framework for Traineeships[2]\r\n(QFT), following\r\nrepeated calls by the European Parliament[3] and the European Council[4]. The Commission's consultations[5] on the matter along with other\r\nstudies and surveys, identified a range of problems currently affecting\r\ntraineeships in the EU. The issues concern two areas in particular:\n\u00b7        \r\ninsufficient learning content (i.e. trainees are\r\nasked to do menial tasks); and \n\u00b7        \r\ninadequate working conditions (long working\r\nhours, unsatisfactory coverage for health and safety or occupational risks,\r\nlittle or no remuneration/compensation, unclear legal situation, extended\r\nduration, etc.). \nIn addition, stakeholders highlighted the\r\nissue that a large proportion of unpaid or low\u2011paid traineeships may\r\ncreate an equal access problem[6] and also leads to a tendency to replace paid workers with trainees[7]. Also, trainees are sometimes not told clearly whether they will\r\nreceive remuneration or compensation, or informed about key working conditions\r\nsuch as health and accident insurance or holiday entitlements.\nMore transparency regarding the learning\r\ncontent and working conditions of the traineeship will lead to a more efficient\r\nfunctioning of the labour market. The 2013 Eurobarometer on traineeships\r\nsuggests that transparency regarding working conditions in traineeship vacancy\r\nnotices and advertisements might be improved.\nMember States\r\nregulatory frameworks in general and the strictness of the regulation in\r\nparticular varies widely both amongst the different types of traineeships and\r\nacross Member States. In some Member States no legal definition of traineeships\r\nexists. While the current fragmentation of regulation\r\nand the absence of quality criteria in general use is remarkable, a common\r\nunderstanding of what a traineeship is and of its minimum standards can help\r\nshape Member States\u2019 policies and regulatory approaches. Finally, evidence shows that the number\r\nof transnational traineeships is very low[8],\r\ndespite very high mobility rates among students, e.g. in the Erasmus programme.\r\nThis appears to be an important missed opportunity in terms of reducing youth\r\nunemployment through mobility: transnational traineeships could be a key factor\r\nin helping young people take up employment in another Member State. A Europe-wide QFT would help address the low\r\nnumber of transnational traineeships. It would help address\r\none key obstacle for cross border mobility, lack of information, in an area of\r\ngreat regulatory fragmentation. The\r\ndevelopment of a QFT is also essential for the\r\nextension of EURES to traineeships, as requested by the European Council in its\r\nJune 2012 conclusions[9].\nIn response to very high youth unemployment\r\nin several Member States and following up on earlier commitments, the\r\nCommission proposed a Recommendation on Establishing a Youth Guarantee[10], which the Council adopted on 22 April 2013[11]. This calls on Member States to ensure that all young people up\r\nto the age of 25 years receive a good\u2011quality offer of employment,\r\ncontinued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of\r\nbecoming unemployed or leaving formal education. Quality requirements for\r\ntraineeships are essential for effective implementation of the Recommendation. \nAgainst this background, the current\r\nproposal for a Council Recommendation seeks to ensure that traineeships\r\nefficiently ease education\u2011to\u2011work transitions and thus increase\r\nyoung people\u2019s employability. The proposal sets out guidelines that can ensure\r\nhigh\u2011quality learning content and adequate working conditions. It also\r\noutlines how the Commission will support Member States\u2019 action through the EU\r\nfunding framework, the exchange of good practices, and monitoring. It covers\r\nso-called \u2018open-market\u2019 traineeships, i.e. traineeships agreed between trainee\r\nand a traineeship provider (business, non-profit or government) without the\r\ninvolvement of a third party, generally conducted after completion of studies\r\nand/or as part of a job search. The proposed Recommendation does not address\r\ntraineeships forming part of academic and or vocational curricula, neither the\r\none which form part of mandatory professional training (e. g. medicine,\r\narchitecture etc). \nThe proposal is accompanied by an impact\r\nassessment which presents the outcomes of stakeholder consultations, looks in\r\nmore detail at the problems regarding traineeships, discusses legal and\r\nsubsidiarity issues, and provides an analysis of possible options to respond to\r\nthe problem.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nPublic consultation \nThe Commission consulted a wide range of\r\nstakeholders on the problems regarding traineeships and on possible solutions. \nIn response to a public consultation\r\nbetween April and July 2012, trade unions, NGOs, youth organisations,\r\neducational institutions and most individual respondents generally supported a\r\nCommission initiative. While generally supportive of the initiative, employer\r\norganisations, chambers of commerce and Member States often referred to the\r\nneed to keep the framework sufficiently flexible to take into account the\r\ndiversity of national practices. \nMost respondents agreed with the Commission\u2019s\r\nanalysis (a written traineeship agreement, clear objectives and learning\r\ncontent[12],\r\nlimited duration, adequate social security coverage etc.). Businesses and some\r\nemployers\u2019 organisations argued that remuneration and social protection issues did\r\nnot fall under EU competence.\nConsultation with social partners\nA two\u2011stage social partner\r\nconsultation on the QFT initiative took place between October 2012 and February\r\n2013. The social partners restated the positions they had taken in the public\r\nconsultation, with the trade union side arguing for a stronger initiative and\r\nthe employers\u2019 side concerned about flexibility and the burden on business. However,\r\nthey did not launch negotiations on a possible agreement under Article 154\r\nTFEU. \nOn 11 June 2013, ETUC, BUSINESSEUROPE,\r\nUEAPME and CEEP presented a Framework of Actions on Youth Employment (FoA),\r\nresulting from social dialogue negotiations taking note of the Commission\u2019s\r\nintention to propose a Council Recommendation on the European Quality Framework\r\non Traineeships. Social partners envisage taking further joint actions towards\r\nthe Council and the European Parliament based on an upcoming Commission proposal\r\nfor a Council Recommendation on a European QFT.\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises\r\n(SMEs)\nBetween March and June 2013, an SME test\r\nwas conducted to investigate from an employer perspective the quality of\r\ntraineeships provided by SMEs and gauge the compliance costs of potential\r\nmeasures within a QFT. In total, 914 SMEs replied to the survey. The test\r\nhighlighted the importance of traineeships for creating jobs in SMEs, with a\r\nmajority of those questioned (71.9 %) seeing traineeships as a way to\r\nselect and train future employees. It also confirmed that an overwhelming\r\nmajority of SMEs (9 out of 10) would have no problems with the proposed quality\r\nelements.\nEurobarometer survey on traineeships\nIn May 2013, a Eurobarometer survey was\r\nconducted in the EU-27 and Croatia to quantify concerns about the quality of\r\ntraineeships. The results of this first ever EU-wide representative survey on\r\nthe topic included:\n\u00b7        \r\nconfirmation of how widespread traineeships are:\r\n46 % of the 18\u201135 year\u2011olds surveyed had completed at least\r\none;\n\u00b7        \r\none in three traineeships was deemed\r\nunsatisfactory, in terms either of working conditions (25 % of all\r\ntraineeships), learning content (18 %) or both;\n\u00b7        \r\na key factor in the rarity of transnational\r\ntraineeships (9 %of all traineeships) is lack of information: 38 % of\r\nthose who would have been interested cited insufficient information on\r\ntraineeship regulations in other Member States.\nAn econometric analysis based on the\r\nEurobarometer results found a significant correlation between the quality of\r\ntraineeships and \u2018employment outcome\u2019. In other words, those that had completed\r\na substandard traineeship were significantly less likely to find a job\r\nafterwards.\nImpact assessment\nThe second stage of the social partner\r\nconsultation was accompanied by an analytical document[13] on the problems regarding the quality of traineeships, which sets\r\nout possible policy responses. \nThis document was expanded in 2013 to form a\r\nfully-fledged impact assessment (IA)[14] with previously unavailable data on the number\r\nand quality of traineeships, and new evidence of the correlation between quality\r\nand employment prospects. The\r\nIA identifies and analyses policy options for increasing the share of quality\r\ntraineeships, notably by issuing \u2018best practice\u2019 standards and discouraging employers\r\nfrom offering substandard traineeships. It also analyses new proposals on\r\ntransparency to make it easier for young people to screen traineeships for\r\nquality.\nThe IA examines four\r\noptions in addition to the baseline scenario: \n\u00b7        \r\nsetting up an information website;\n\u00b7        \r\nestablishing voluntary quality labels;\n\u00b7        \r\nproposing a Council Recommendation; and\n\u00b7        \r\nproposing a Directive. \nIt concludes that the\r\nmost effective, efficient and proportionate option would be a Commission\r\nproposal for a Council Recommendation on a QFT to be transposed by Member\r\nStates in national practice and/or the national legal system. \nIt would recommend\r\nMember States to ensure that the conclusion of a written traineeship agreement is made compulsory. The\r\nagreement would include information on the learning objectives of the\r\ntraineeship, the working conditions, whether remuneration/compensation is\r\nprovided, the rights and obligations under applicable EU and national law, as\r\nwell as the duration of the traineeship.\nAlso, additional transparency requirements would\r\ngenerate incentives for quality traineeships and/or disincentives for\r\nsubstandard traineeships. \nAccording to the preferred option,\r\ntraineeship vacancy notices would have to indicate whether the traineeship is\r\npaid or not and, if the traineeship is paid, the level of\r\nremuneration/compensation. Furthermore, traineeship providers would be asked to\r\ndisclose the share of trainees that were offered an employment contract\r\nafter the end of their traineeship.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal bases for this initiative are\r\nArticles 153, 166 and 292 TFEU. According to Article 292 TFEU, the Council can\r\nadopt recommendations on the basis of a Commission proposal in the areas of EU\r\ncompetence. \nAccording to Article 153 TFEU, the Union\r\nshall support and complement Member States' activities in the field of, inter\r\nalia, working conditions, social security and social protection of workers, and\r\nalso the integration of persons excluded from the labour market and the\r\ncombating of social exclusion. In accordance with the case law of the Court of\r\nJustice, traineeships which are remunerated fall under Article 153.\nIn order to cover also\r\ntraineeships which are not remunerated, Article 166 TFEU has been added as\r\nadditional legal basis. According to this provision, the Union shall implement\r\na vocational training policy which shall support and supplement the action of\r\nthe Member States, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member\r\nStates for the content and organisation of vocational training. \nTherefore, depending on\r\nwhether the traineeship is remunerated or not, Article 153 or 166 TFEU will\r\napply respectively.\nThe provisions of Article 153 TFEU do not\r\napply to pay, by virtue of Article 153 para. 5 TFEU. However, the latter\r\nprovision does not stand in the way of addressing problems regarding\r\ntransparency of pay, by recommending that the written traineeship agreement\r\nclarifies whether or not remuneration would be applicable.\nAn analogy may be made with other EU\r\ninstruments such as Directive 91/533/EEC, on an employer's obligation to inform\r\nan employee of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment\r\nrelationship. That Directive provides at Article 2 that: \n'1. An employer shall be obliged to\r\nnotify an employee \u2026 of the essential aspects of the contract or employment\r\nrelationship.\n2. The information referred to \u2026. shall\r\ncover at least the following:\n(h) the initial basic amount, the other\r\ncomponent elements and the frequency of payment of the remuneration to which\r\nthe employee is entitled \u2026'[15]\nSimilarly, the Proposal for a Directive on\r\nconditions of entry and residence of third country nationals in the framework\r\nof an intra-corporate transfer[16] addresses the issue of remuneration as an element of an assignment\r\nletter from the employer, or of a contract.\nTraining forms a\r\ncentral objective in the EU's employment and educational policies. It is also\r\nan integral part of the freedom of movement of persons under Article 45 TFEU \u2013\r\na fundamental freedom protected by the Treaty. Given the transnational\r\ndimension of traineeships, actions of individual Member States alone will not\r\nachieve the objectives of the proposed initiative - to comprehensively improve\r\nthe quality of traineeships undertaken in the EU.\nFinally, the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union also contains a number of rights and\r\nfreedoms which may be relevant to future measures concerning traineeships, in\r\nparticular Article 21 (Non-discrimination), Article 29 (Right of access to\r\nplacement services), Article 31 (Fair and just working conditions) and Article\r\n32 (Prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work).\nSubsidiarity\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not\r\nfall under the exclusive competence of the Union. \nIn the case of traineeships,\r\nan EU-wide solution presents several advantages: \n(1)                   \r\nThe quality guidelines adopted or proposed by\r\ndifferent bodies in different Member States broadly point to similar elements\r\nthat are supposed to be key for enhancing the quality of traineeships. This\r\nsuggests that defining quality standards for traineeships should not\r\nfundamentally differ according to national practices or local circumstances.\n(2)                   \r\nAn EU-wide solution would have benefits in terms\r\nof trainees\u2019 mobility. Young people would find it easier to accept a\r\ntraineeship in another country if the existence of standard practices or rules\r\ngave them a clear understanding of what they can expect. \n(3)                   \r\nExperience shows that, owing to coordination\r\nproblems, the process of defining internationally accepted quality standards\r\ncan be faster if supranational institutions adopt a coordinating and supporting\r\nrole. \nMember States could independently adopt\r\nmeasures to improve the quality of traineeships. I in practice, however, they\r\nhave repeatedly called upon the Commission to adopt a QFT (see among others the Conclusions of three\r\nrecent European Councils: December 2012, February 2013 and June 2013). \nIn a situation of diverging regulatory\r\nframeworks it helps to have a common understanding of what a traineeship is and\r\nof its minimum standards. This will help shape Member States\u2019 regulatory\r\napproaches, since the proposed standards are to be operationalized through the\r\nspecific regulatory approach of Member States. In this way, the EU could concretely support Member States in\r\nimplementing the Europe 2020 employment guideline 8, in particular \u2018enacting\r\nschemes to help young people and in particular those not in employment,\r\neducation or training find initial employment, job experience, or further\r\neducation and training opportunities, including apprenticeships, and should\r\nintervene rapidly when young people become unemployed.\u2019 This would\r\naddress one key obstacle for cross border mobility, lack of information, in an\r\narea of great regulatory fragmentation, and the Recommendation would help to\r\nunderpin the support provided by Erasmus+[17]\r\nand further development of EURES[18].\nProportionality\nThe Council\r\nRecommendation instrument allows strict respect of the proportionality\r\nprinciple: Member States that have already introduced in their legislation or\r\nnational practice the proposed safeguards and quality elements will not need to\r\nact. Member States shall also be free to assess whether it is opportune to go\r\nbeyond the QFT proposed here, notably to encompass also the issue of minimum\r\nremuneration, which the QFT does not touch.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nNot relevant.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nNot relevant.\n2013/0431 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL RECOMMENDATION\non a Quality Framework for Traineeships\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 153, 166 and 292\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Young people have been hit\r\nparticularly hard during the crisis. Youth unemployment rates have reached\r\nhistorical peaks in the past years in several Member States, without any sign\r\nof decrease in the short term. Fostering the employability and productivity of\r\nyoung people is key to bringing them onto the labour market.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A smooth transition from\r\neducation to employment is crucial to enhance the chances of young people on\r\nthe labour market. Improving young people's education and facilitating their\r\ntransition to employment are necessary to reach the Europe 2020 headline target\r\nof 75% of 20-64 year-olds in employment by 2020. Guideline 8 on employment\r\npolicies of the Member States calls on Member States to enact \"schemes\r\nto help young people and in particular those not in employment, education or\r\ntraining find initial employment, job experience, or further education and\r\ntraining opportunities, including apprenticeships, and should intervene rapidly\r\nwhen young people become unemployed\"[19].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the past two decades,\r\ntraineeships have become an important entry point into the labour market for\r\nyoung people.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Socio-economic costs arise\r\nif traineeships, particularly the repeated ones, replace regular employment,\r\nnotably entry-level positions usually offered to young people. Moreover, low-quality\r\ntraineeships, especially those with little learning content, do not lead to\r\nsignificant productivity gains nor entail positive signalling effects. Social\r\ncosts also relate to unpaid traineeships that may limit the career\r\nopportunities of those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is evidence that links\r\nexist between the quality of the traineeship and the employment outcome. The\r\nvalue of traineeships in easing the transition to employment depends on their\r\nquality in terms of learning content and working conditions. Quality\r\ntraineeships bring direct productivity benefits, improve labour market matching\r\nand promote mobility, notably by decreasing search and matching costs both for\r\nenterprises and for young people.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council Recommendation\r\non establishing a Youth Guarantee[20]\r\nrequests that Member States ensure that all young people up to the age of 25\r\nyears receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an\r\napprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or\r\nleaving formal education. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Various studies and\r\nsurveys have found that quality problems affect a significant share of\r\ntraineeships, most particularly those where no educational or training institution\r\nis directly responsible for the learning content and the working conditions of\r\nthe traineeship (so called 'open market\u2019 traineeships). \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence shows that a\r\nsignificant share of trainees is asked to do menial tasks without sufficient\r\nlearning content. A quality traineeship has to provide a solid and meaningful learning\r\ncontent, notably by the identification of the specific skills to be acquired,\r\nsupervision and mentoring of the trainee as well as monitoring of his/her\r\nprogress. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Problems have also been\r\nidentified as regards working conditions, e.g. long working hours, social\r\nsecurity coverage, health and safety or occupational risks, little or no remuneration\r\nand/or compensation, a lack of clarity on the applicable legal regimes, and the\r\nprolonged duration of the traineeship.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Traineeships are currently\r\nregulated in very diverse ways across the Union. Where regulation exists, it\r\nprovides different quality elements or different implementing practices, while traineeships\r\nremain largely unregulated in some Member States and sectors. A considerable\r\nshare of traineeship providers use trainees as cheap or even unpaid labour,\r\nwhich is often caused by the absence of a regulatory framework or instrument,\r\nor by a lack of transparency regarding working conditions for traineeships and\r\ntheir learning content. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Quality Framework for\r\nTraineeships will support the improvement of working conditions and the\r\nlearning content of traineeships. The conclusion of a written traineeship\r\nagreement that indicates the educational objectives, adequate working\r\nconditions, rights and obligations and a reasonable duration constitutes the\r\nmain element of the Quality Framework for Traineeships.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lack of information is one\r\nof the causes of low quality traineeships and is a much more widespread problem\r\nregarding traineeships than regular employment. Increased transparency requirements\r\nfor notices or announcements advertising traineeship positions would help to\r\nimprove working conditions and stimulate cross-border mobility.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Social partners play a key\r\nrole in the design, implementation and monitoring of training policies and\r\nprogrammes. Cooperation between social partners and relevant authorities could\r\naim at providing young people with targeted information on available career\r\nopportunities and skills needs on labour markets, as well as on trainees'\r\nrights and responsibilities. In addition, social partners can play a role in\r\nfacilitating the implementation of the Quality Framework for Traineeships,\r\nnotably by elaborating and making available simple and concise model traineeship\r\nagreements, particularly for use by micro enterprises and tailored for their\r\nspecific purposes. In their Framework of Actions on Youth Employment of July\r\n2013, the European social partners took note of the Commission\u2019s intention to\r\npropose a Council Recommendation on the European quality framework on\r\ntraineeships and announced to support Member States\u2019 actions aiming to improve\r\nthe quality of traineeships.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the challenges is to\r\nincrease the cross-border mobility of trainees in the Union to help foster a\r\ngenuine European labour market. The existing diversity in regulations\r\nconstitutes an obstacle to the development of cross-border trainee mobility. Moreover,\r\nin some cases, administrative and legal obstacles to cross-border mobility of\r\ntrainees have been found to affect several of the receiving Member States. By\r\nproviding standards and guidelines that should be used as a reference, the\r\nQuality Framework for Traineeships will facilitate access to transnational\r\ntraineeships.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The development of a\r\nQuality Framework for Traineeships will increase transparency. Furthermore, it\r\nwill support the extension of EURES to traineeships, thus facilitating mobility,\r\nand help to underpin the support for trainee mobility provided by Erasmus+.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States' programmes\r\npromoting and offering traineeships to young people can be financially\r\nsupported by the European Funds. In addition, the Youth Employment Initiative\r\nwill support traineeships in the context of the Youth Guarantee, targeting\r\nyoung people from the Union's regions worst affected by youth unemployment and\r\nwhich will be co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) 2014-20. The ESF as\r\nwell as the Youth Employment Initiative can be used to increase the number and\r\nthe quality of Member States' traineeship schemes. This involves a possible\r\ncontribution to the cost of the traineeships including, under certain\r\nconditions, a part of the remuneration. In addition,\r\nthey can also support the costs of other trainings that young people may pursue\r\noutside their traineeship, e.g. language courses.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has launched\r\na specific ESF Technical Assistance Support Programme to help Member States\r\nestablish traineeship schemes with ESF support.
