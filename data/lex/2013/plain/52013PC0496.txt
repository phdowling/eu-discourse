In particular, it provides for\nthe creation of public-private partnerships that will contribute to tackling\nsome of the key challenges Europe is facing.\nBio-based industries in the EU could make a\nsignificant contribution to the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and its\nflagship initiatives \"Innovation Union\", \"A Resource Efficient\nEurope\" and \"An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era\".\nThis has been recognised in several recent EU policy initiatives, such as the\nEuropean Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and\nSustainability[1],\nthe Smart Specialisation Strategy for Member States and Regions[2] and the proposal for the 7th\nEnvironmental Action Programme. The Communication outlining the European\nBioeconomy Strategy, adopted on 13 February 2012[3]\nproposes the creation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) for bio-based industries\n(Bio-based PPP) as part of its Action Plan. The Commission Communication\npromoting a stronger European industry for growth and economic recovery[4] reiterates the importance of\nsetting up a Bio-based PPP in the form of a Joint Technology Initiative (JTI)\nin the context of the EU's industrial policy, which is also in line with the\nCommission Communication \"Public-private partnerships, in Horizon 2020: a\npowerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe\"[5].\nThe Committee\nof the Regions has also underlined the important role of bio-based products and\na bio-based society in Europe in its opinion on the European Bioeconomy\nStrategy end of November 2012[6].\nIn view of broader economic and social sustainability issues and of\nimplications for consumers, the Commission is currently studying biofuels from\na consumer perspective as a part of a broader study on the functioning of the\nfuels market[7].\n\nReasons and objectives for a JTI in\nthe area of bio-based industries\nBio-based industries are industries, which\nuse renewable biological resources for the production of bio-based products and\nbiofuels. Production usually takes place in biorefineries and often relies on\nbio-based processes. They give rise to new value chains, linking previously\nunrelated primary producers (and e.g. managers of organic waste) and\nindustries, thus opening new opportunities for a wide range of established\nplayers. An increasing number of processing industries, such as the chemical,\nbiofuels, pulp and paper, sugar and starch, and technology providers (in\nparticular on industrial biotechnology and engineering) are interested in\nmoving partially or entirely towards sustainable renewable bio-based resources\nand/or products.\nThe main focus of this JTI will be on the transformation\nof non-edible parts of plants (e.g. wood, agricultural and forestry residues)\nand biodegradable wastes into bio-based products and biofuels. The non-edible\npart of plants, also referred to as ligno-cellulosic material, is usually\nheterogeneous and contains a mix of different types of complex biomolecules\n(i.e. cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin). The technology required for transforming\nligno-cellulosic material is considered \"more advanced\" compared to\ncurrent technologies converting edible parts of plants, and is still being developed.\nThe resulting products and processes are therefore called \"advanced\".\nBio-based industries are a cornerstone of\nthe EU bioeconomy in generating growth and jobs. Although bio-based products\nand biofuels currently only represent about 3% of the EUR 2 trillion in annual\nturnover and 1% of the 22 million jobs generated by the European bioeconomy\ntoday[8],\nbio-based industries are expected to grow more rapidly and substantially than\nmore traditional bioeconomy sectors[9],[10]. Estimates from\ndifferent sources consider that: \n\u00b7       \nThe global revenue potential of the entire\nbiomass value chain for biorefineries could exceed EUR 200 billion by 2020[11]; \n\u00b7       \nThe share of bio-based processes in all chemical\nproduction taken on its own is likely to increase from less than 2% in 2005 to\n25% in 2025[12];\n\n\u00b7       \nThe volume growth of EU bio-based chemical\nproducts (including bio-plastics, bio-lubricants, bio-solvents, bio-surfactants\nand chemical feedstock) will be at 5.3% per year up to 2020, resulting in a\nmarket worth EUR 40 billion and 90,000 jobs within the bio-chemical industry\nalone[13];\n\n\u00b7       \nUp to 75 billion litres of bioethanol could be\nsustainably produced at a competitive cost by 2020, which would represent about\nEUR 15 billion in additional revenue for the agricultural sector[14].\nTo realise this potential and ensure the\ncompetitiveness of Europe's bio-based industries and their value chains in\nglobal markets, a number of hurdles need to be overcome:\n\u00b7       \nBiomass feedstock will need to be sourced in\nEurope in a sustainable way and without unintended negative consequences, such\nas loss of biodiversity, indirect land use change (ILUC) or negative effects\nfor food security.\n\u00b7       \nDifferent players, including agriculture and\nforestry, industries and waste managers need to set-up cooperations along full\nvalue chains, with the aim of increasing resource-use efficiency by reducing\nthe current fragmentation and isolation of these sectors.\n\u00b7       \nNew processes need to be developed to separate,\npre-treat and convert this feedstock into bio-based products and biofuels. A\nwide range of radically different technological options (e.g. enzyme based\nversus thermochemical processes) will need to be taken forward simultaneously\nin a strong and multi-facetted research effort to enhance process efficiency\nand optimise yield.\n\u00b7       \nSignificant investment in up-scaling of\ntechnology and infrastructure is needed to assess the relative merits of\nradically different technology options and to identify winning option(s). This\nwill mean upgrading existing bio-based industries (e.g. pulp and paper mills,\nbiofuels, starch, chemical, etc.) and developing new and scalable integrated\nbiorefinery models. \n\u00b7       \nThe successful uptake of new bio-based products\nand bioenergy/fuels would require developing standards, labelling and\ncertification systems and achieving customer acceptance. Product prices should\nappropriately reflect externalities and consumers should be able to make\ninformed product choices, e.g. based on data on the benefits of these products\nover the full product lifecycle from cradle to grave.\nThe bio-based industry value chains\n(ranging from primary production, biorefineries, industrial users to consumer\nbrands) are complex and so are the technological and innovation challenges that\nneed to be overcome to unlock its socio-economic and environmental potential.\nOnly a strong strategic vision, a well-structured and defined research and\ninnovation agenda and a long-term stable financial commitment can bring\ntogether in one programme the different competences from across Europe to achieve the necessary breakthroughs and provide sufficient certainty and critical\nmass to leverage significant private investments.\nThe objectives of the proposed JTI on\nbio-based industries are to:\n\u00b7                        \nContribute to a more resource efficient and\nsustainable low-carbon economy and to increasing economic growth and\nemployment, in particular in rural areas, by developing sustainable and\ncompetitive bio-based industries in Europe, based on advanced biorefineries\nthat source their biomass sustainably; and in particular to:\n\u00b7                        \nDemonstrate technologies that enable new\nchemical building blocks, new materials, and new consumer products from\nEuropean biomass, which replace the need for fossil-based inputs;\n\u00b7                        \nDevelop business models that integrate economic\nactors along the value chain from supply of biomass to biorefinery plants to\nconsumers of bio-based materials, chemicals and fuels, including through\ncreating new cross-sector interconnections and supporting cross-industry\nclusters; and\n\u00b7                        \nSet-up flagship biorefinery plants that deploy\nthe technologies and business models for bio-based materials, chemicals and\nfuels and demonstrate cost and performance improvements to levels that are\ncompetitive with fossil-based alternatives.\nBuilding on past experience\nThe EU has funded a wide range of projects\nthat contribute to the advancement of bio-based industries over the past\ndecades. The EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development\n(FPs) cover almost 6% of total R&D investment of the EU and 15% of European\npublicly funded R&D financed in a cross-border collaborative manner. Under\nthe FP7 Specific Programme on \"Cooperation\", Theme 2 \"Food,\nAgriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology\" is currently financing 100\nprojects in the area of biotechnology with an EU contribution of about EUR 400\nmillion.\nIn view of the multidisciplinary nature of\nbiorefineries, DG RTD organised a Joint Call in 2008 on biorefineries involving\nfour Themes of the \"Cooperation\" Programme (Theme 2, Theme 5, Theme 4\n\"Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production\nTechnologies, and Theme 6 \"Environment\"). Three flagship\ncollaborative projects (BIOCORE, EUROBIOREF and SUPRABIO) were selected for\nfunding in 2009 with a combined EU contribution of about EUR 50 million.\nThe experience of the past years confirms\nthat Europe has a strong research base in the area of bio-based industries with\nsome successful biorefinery plant projects, both at EU level and at regional\nand national level. \nFunding mechanisms applied at EU and\nregional level, in particular large and integrated biorefinery projects and\nregional bioeconomy clusters, are a step in the right direction by applying a\nvalue chain approach that covers research, demonstration and deployment\nactivities and encourages cross-border collaboration. Yet, they have not\nsucceeded in reaching a critical mass sufficient to overcome fragmentation and\ncreate integrated bio-based industry value chains in Europe. The impact of\neither funding mechanism could have been even better if they had been part of\nan integrated long-term vision for bio-based industries and if more support was\ngiven to demonstration and deployment activities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nA wide range of sources were consulted in\npreparation of this JTI:\n\u00b7                        \nA public consultation on the proposed Bio-based\nPPP took place from 21 September to 14 December 2012 and received 638 valid\nresponses. 64.6% of responses came from the private sector, 24.6% from academia,\n8.8% from the public sector and 2% from NGOs. Responses were received from 19\nout of 27 Member States, with most replies coming from Poland, followed by the\nNetherlands, Germany, Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Austria,\nthe UK, Romania, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland, Hungary,\nGreece and Slovakia. Almost all respondents (94.3%) called for EU intervention\nand 86.9% viewed a PPP as the most appropriate mechanism to implement the\nR&I programme for bio-based industries under Horizon 2020, and considered\nthat it would have positive socio-economic impacts. Other key messages were the\nneed to strengthen EU innovation, to improve competitiveness and to formulate\nclear intervention objectives for bio-based industries. The results from the\nconsultation were presented and discussed at a stakeholder event on 9 January\n2013 in Brussels, which was attended by 162 people. The full report of the\nonline public consultation forms part of the Impact Assessment; it is planned\nto publish a printed version in June 2013.\n\u00b7                        \nSeveral events organised in the framework of the\nBioeconomy Strategy implementation allowed for regular and broad-based contacts\nwith stakeholders during the preparation of the Impact Assessment . This\nincluded the conference \"Partnering for the Bioeconomy in European\nRegions\" of 12 October 2012, co-organised by DG RTD and the Committee of\nthe Regions. During the conference, information on the potential of a Bio-based\nPPP was provided and examples of regional activities highlighted possible\nbenefits of bioeconomy partnerships. DG REGIO specifically informed conference\nparticipants about the Smart Specialisation Strategy, being part of the rural\ndevelopment policy of the EU. It proposed focusing investments on the\nbioeconomy where appropriate.\n\u00b7                        \nSeveral studies conducted in connection with the\nbioeconomy, bio-based products and biofuels were consulted.\n\u00b7                        \nA group of ten external reviewers with expertise\nrelevant to the different parts of the bio-based industries value chain was brought\nin to assist DG RTD with collecting and analysing the above data and preparing\nthe Impact Assessment.\nImpact\nAssessment\nThe proposed Regulation is supported by a Commission\nImpact Assessment, which is accompanying the proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThis proposal concerns setting-up the Bio-based\nIndustries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union (TFEU) for the implementation of the Joint Technology\nInitiative on Bio-based Industries (BBI JTI).\nThe BBI JU should be established for a period\nending on 31 December 2024. It will have its seat in Brussels, Belgium.\nIt will be founded by the EU, represented\nby the European Commission, and the Biobased Industries Consortium (BIC). The\nactivities of the BBI JU will be jointly funded by its founders. The Commission\nand BIC will contribute in equal parts to the running costs of the BBI JU. The\nresearch and demonstration activities will be funded through contributions by\nthe BIC member companies with monetary and non-monetary resources (staff,\nequipment, consumables, etc.), and monetary resources from the EU. The level of\nEU resources will vary, in line with Horizon 2020 rules, depending on the type\nof activity considered.\nThe BBI JU will be open to new members,\nprovided that they contribute with resources to the achievements of the\nobjectives.\nThe Commission will be represented in the\nGoverning Board in rights and votes as the industrial BIC members. \nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\n187 of the TFEU.\nThe Rules for Participation and\nDissemination of Horizon 2020 will apply. However, given a specific operational\nneed of this initiative, a derogation from these Rules is necessary.\nNevertheless, this specific derogation is not included in the present proposal\nat this stage, in order not to prejudice the inter-institutional discussions\nconcerning the appropriate legal basis/procedural modalities for their\nadoption, which are still pending in the context of the legislative works\nconcerning the Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\nand of the Council laying down the Rules for Participation and dissemination in\nHorizon 2020 (COM(2011) 0810 - 2011/0399 (COD). The specific derogation will be\nintroduced at a later stage in view of the outcome of the abovementioned\ndiscussions.\nThe derogation will allow to limit, for\nactions other than innovation actions, the eligibility for funding to entities\nsuch as SMEs or secondary and higher education establishments whilst achieving\nat the same time the optimal level of leverage effect on private investment.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThe proposal concerns an area in which the EU\ndoes not have exclusive competence, which is why the principle of subsidiarity\napplies.\nThe policy objectives underlying the\nproposal can only be achieved through EU action for the following main reasons:\n(1)              \nThe transnational and complex nature of this\nlarge research and innovation challenge identified, which requires pooling\ncomplementary knowledge and financial resources across sectors and borders. No\nsingle Member State, company or stakeholder can resolve the problem by itself.\n(2)              \nThe coordination effort and the resources\nrequired are of such a large scale that they can only be credibly implemented\nat European level.\n(3)              \nGiven similar and competing initiatives underway\nor being launched in other leading economies (US, Brazil, China, Canada), only\nlarge-scale action implemented at European level is sufficiently attractive for\nindustries to invest in Europe.\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the provisions of this Regulation do not go beyond what is\nnecessary to achieve the objectives.\nChoice\nof instrument\nThe proposed Regulation will significantly\nboost public and private investment in research and innovation activities that aim\nto improve the competitiveness of European bio-based industries and create\nemployment, in particular in rural areas. The BBI JU can leverage private\nresources with EU funds at a level that cannot be achieved with traditional\ninstruments, which lack the strategic long-term approach regarding programming\nand financing. Every EUR 1 of EU funds will leverage EUR 2.8 of private funds\nduring the operation of the Joint Undertaking.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe total budget of the BBI JU will be EUR 2\n000 million (including in cash and in kind contributions). In addition, the\nindustry has committed to invest EUR 1 800 million in the establishment of\nlarge demonstration and flagship plants contributing to the objectives of this\nJTI. \nThe maximum contribution from the European\nUnion (including EFTA) will be EUR 1 000 million[15], paid from the Horizon 2020\nbudget.\nThe running costs of the BBI JU will be\ncovered in equal parts by the EU and the BIC from the outset. The administrative\ncosts shall not exceed EUR 60 million for the duration of the JU.\nThe research and demonstration activities\nimplemented by the BBI JU and eligible for co-funding under Horizon 2020 will\nbe jointly funded by the EU and BIC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nReview\nThe EU will present an annual report on the\nprogress made by the BBI JU and will perform a mid-term review by 31 December\n2017. Discharge for the implementation of the EU contribution shall be part of\nthe discharge given by the European Parliament, upon recommendation of the\nCouncil, to the Commission in accordance with the procedure provided for in\nArticle 319 of the TFEU. \n2013/0241 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the Bio-Based Industries Joint\nUndertaking\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 187 and the first\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[16],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEconomic and Social Committee[17],\nWhereas\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public-private partnerships\nin the form of Joint Technology Initiatives were initially provided for in Decision\n(EC) No 1982/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December\n2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[18].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2006/971/EC\nof 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019\nimplementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[19] identified specific\npublic-private partnerships to be supported. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing Horizon\n2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[20] aims to achieve a greater\nimpact on research and innovation by combining Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\nand private-sector funds in public-private partnerships in key areas where\nresearch and innovation can contribute to the Union's wider competitiveness\ngoals and help tackle societal challenges. The involvement of the Union in those partnerships may take the form of financial contributions to joint\nundertakings established on the basis of Article 187 of the Treaty under\nDecision No 1982/2006/EC \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Decision\n(EU) No \u2026/2013 of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing the Specific Programme implementing\nHorizon 2020 (2014-2020)[21] support may be provided to joint\nundertakings established in the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme under the\nconditions specified in that Decision.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe 2020 Strategy[22] underscores the need to\ndevelop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and innovation so as\nto achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Union. Both European Parliament and Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Bio-based Industries\nConsortium (hereinafter \"BIC\") developed a vision paper and a\nStrategic Innovation and Research Agenda, based on extensive consultation with public\nand private stakeholders. The Strategic Innovation and Research Agenda\ndescribes the main technological and innovation challenges that need to be\novercome in order to develop sustainable and competitive bio-based industries\nin Europe and identifies research, demonstration and deployment activities to\nbe carried out by a Joint Technology Initiative on \"Bio-based\nIndustries\".\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BIC is a non-profit\norganisation that was created to represent the industry group that supports the\nJoint Technology Initiative on Bio-based Industries. Its members cover the\nentire bio-based value chain and consist of large industries, small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), regional clusters, European trade\nassociations, and European Technology Platforms. The aim of BIC is to ensure\nand promote the technological and economic development of the bio-based\nindustries in Europe. Any interested stakeholders along the bio-based value\nchain may apply for membership. It applies general principles of openness and\ntransparency regarding membership, ensuring a wide industrial involvement.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\nCommunication of 13 February 2012 \"Innovating for Sustainable Growth: A\nBioeconomy for Europe\"[23]\nand in particular its Action Plan calls for a public private partnership to\nsupport the establishment of sustainable and competitive bio-based industries\nand value chains in Europe. In view of moving towards a post-petroleum society,\nthe Communication aims to integrate better biomass producing and processing\nsectors in order to reconcile food security and natural resource scarcity and\nenvironmental objectives with the use of biomass for industrial and energy\npurposes. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\nCommunication of 10 October 2012 \"A Stronger European Industry for Growth\nand Economic Recovery\"[24] confirms the strategic importance of\nbio-based industries for the future competitiveness of Europe, as identified in\nthe Commission Communication of 21 December 2007 \"A lead market initiative\nfor Europe\"[25]\nand stresses the need for a Joint Technology Initiative on \"Bio-based\nIndustries\".\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bio-based industries and\ntheir value chains are facing complex and substantial technology and innovation\nchallenges. As a nascent sector, bio-based industries have to overcome the\ndispersion of technical competences and the limited publically available data\non real resource availability in order to build sustainable and competitive\nvalue chains. In order to tackle these challenges, critical mass has to be\nachieved in a focused and coherent way at European level in terms of scale of\nactivity, excellence, and potential for innovation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Joint Technology\nInitiative on Bio-based Industries should mitigate the different types of\nmarket failures that discourage private investment into pre-competitive\nresearch, demonstration and deployment activities for bio-based industries in Europe. In particular, it should ascertain the availability of reliable biomass supply\ntaking into account other competing social and environmental demands, and\nsupport the development of advanced processing technologies, large scale\ndemonstration activities and policy instruments, thus reducing the risk for\nprivate research and innovation investment in the development of sustainable\nand competitive bio-based products and biofuels. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Joint Technology\nInitiative on Bio-based Industries should be a public-private partnership\naiming at increasing investment in the development of a sustainable bio-based\nindustry sector in Europe. It should provide environmental and socio-economic\nbenefits for European citizens, increase the competitiveness of Europe and\ncontribute to establishing Europe as a key player in research, demonstration\nand deployment of advanced bio-based products and biofuels.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the Joint\nTechnology Initiative on Bio-based Industries is to implement a programme of\nresearch and innovation activities in Europe that will assess the availability\nof renewable biological resources that can be used for the production of\nbio-based materials and on that basis support the establishment of sustainable\nbio-based value chains. These activities should be carried out through\ncollaboration between stakeholders along the entire bio-based value chains, including\nprimary production and processing industries, consumer brands, SMEs, research\nand technology centres and universities.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ambition and scope of\nthe objectives of the Joint Technology Initiative on Bio-based Industries, the\nscale of the financial and technical resources that need to be mobilized, and\nthe need to achieve effective coordination and synergy of resources and\nfunding, require the involvement of the Union.

These key performance\nindicators will measure the impact of the Joint Undertaking on EU\ncompetitiveness and the research environment for biobased and renewable\nindustries. The quantitative indicators will be measured on a large scale in a\ncomparative and systematic manner, while the qualitative approach will include\ncase studies and technical audits. The key performance indicators should be\nassessed against the baseline of the state of affairs in the years prior to the\nstart of the Joint Undertaking to help assess additionality effects during its\nlifetime.\nThe progress of the Joint Undertaking will be\ncontinuously monitored against a set of objectively verifiable indicators\nincluding:\n\u2013              \nmonitoring of public (EC and other) and private\nfunding;\n\u2013              \nfollow-up of additionality;\n\u2013              \nselection of projects and allocation of funding;\n\u2013              \ntechnical monitoring against well-defined\nspecific programme milestones;\n\u2013              \nadherence to time schedule;\n\u2013              \nquantified monitoring of market penetration in\ntarget sectors;\n\u2013              \nlevel of SME participation and of participation\nfrom the newer Member States;\n\u2013              \nsustainability indicators.\nAt mid-term, the Joint Undertaking will be\nevaluated by independent experts on behalf of the Commission.

These may not be situated in the same Region or Member State, which can add further complications to an already complex scenario.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nA number of small scale initiatives by Member States or Regions have recognised that the successful development of the bioeconomy\nis highly dependent on effective transnational cooperation. This is reflected\nin a growing number of collaborations between national and regional bioeconomy\nclusters, for example between IAR and Wagralim, or CLIB2021 and BE-BASIC.\nAlthough these collaborations between Regions and clusters look promising at\nfirst sight, they are also often affected by the differences in funding levels\nand financing rules.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThere may be compatibility in the orientations\nboth in Horizon 2020 and in the Structural Funds, for supporting RTD activities\n-especially on innovation. The different new legal frameworks, programming\nmechanisms and approaches in terms of participation have to be considered.\nSynergies between funding actions in Horizon 2020 and funds of Member States and regions could be possible. Being the PPP a key enabler for bridging the\nResearch and Innovation activities with the regional clusters organised under\nthe Smart Specialisation Strategy it may be instrumental for facilitating\ncombination of these sources of funding and increase efficiency of the action.\nAlso synergies can be considered to access new financial instruments as the\nRSFF (Risk Sharing Funding Facility) of EIB, for the deployment.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative of limited duration\n\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 01/01/2014\nto 31/12/2024 \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 01/01/2014 to\n31/12/2020 for commitment appropriations\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 01/01/2014 to\n31/12/2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\nFollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[36]\n\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direct management by the Commission through:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Executive agencies \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shared management with Member States:\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indirect management by entrusting\nbudget implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International organisations and their agencies (please\nspecify);\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Investment Bank;\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies referred to in Article 209 FR;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public law bodies;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bodies governed by private law with a public service mission\nto the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\nin the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and identified in the relevant basic\nact.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nThe BBI Joint Undertaking will be\nmonitored through intermediary contacts and as provided in Clauses 6 and\n16 of the Statutes.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internal control framework \nThe Commission through the Authorising Officer by Delegation will\nensure that the rules applicable to the BBI JTI JU fully comply with the\nrequirements of Article 60 and 61 of the Financial Regulation. Monitoring\narrangements, including membership of the Governing board, of the BBI JTI JU\nand reporting arrangements will ensure that the Commission services can meet\nthe accountability requirements both to the College and to the Budgetary\nAuthority.\nThe internal control framework for the BBI JTI JU will be built on:\n-the implementation of the Internal Control Standards offering at\nleast equivalent guarantees to those of the Commisson;\n-procedures for selecting the best projects through independent\nevaluation, and for translating them into legal instruments;\n- project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every\nproject;\n-ex-ante checks on 100% of claims, including receipt of audit\ncertificates and ex-ante certification of cost methodologies; \n- ex post audits on a sample of claims as part of the Horizon 2020\nex-post audits;\n- and scientific evaluation of project results.\nVarious measures will be established to mitigate the inherent risk\nof conflict of interest within the BBI JTI JU, especially equal votes for the\nCommission and for industrial partners in the Governing Board, selection of the\nDirector by the Governing Board based on a proposal by the Commission,\nindependence of staff, evaluations by independent experts based on published\nselection criteria together with appeal mechanisms and full declarations of any\ninterests. The establishment of ethical and organisational values will be one\nof the key roles of the JTI JU, and will be monitored by the Commission.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\ncontrols\nThe Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the same powers\nover the Joint Undertaking as those exercised in respect of the Commission.\nMoreover, the Governing Board may arrange, as appropriate, for the\nestablishment of an internal audit capability of the Joint UndertakingThe\nExecutive Director of the BBI JTI JU, as Authorising Officer, will be required\nto introduce a cost-effective system of internal control and management. He/she\nwill be required to report to the Commission on the internal control framework\nadopted.\nThe Commission will monitor the risk of non-compliance through the\nreporting system that it will develop, as well as by following the results of\nex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from the BBI JTI, as part of ex\npost audits covering the whole of the Horizon 2020. \nThe control system established will need to take account of the\nstrong feeling, amongst the recipients of EU funds as well as amongst the\nlegislative authority, that the control burden required to attain an error\nlimit of 2% has become too great. This runs the risk of lowering the\nattractiveness of the Union's Research programme, and so negatively affecting\nUnion research and innovation.\nThe European Council of February 4th 2011 concluded that\n\u2018it is crucial that EU instruments aimed at fostering R&D&I be\nsimplified in order to facilitate their take-up by the best scientists and the\nmost innovative companies, in particular by agreeing between the relevant\ninstitutions a new balance between trust and control and between risk taking\nand risk avoidance\u2019 (see EUCO 2/1/11 REV1, Brussels 8 March 2011).\nThe European Parliament, in its Resolution of 11 November 2010\n(P7_TA(2010)0401) on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework\nProgrammes explicitly supports a higher risk of errors for research funding and\n\"expresses its concern that the current system and the practice of FP7\nmanagement are excessively control-oriented, thus leading to waste of\nresources, lower participation and less attractive research landscapes; notes\nwith concern that the current management system of \u2018zero risk tolerance\u2019 seems\nto avoid, rather than to manage, risks\". \nThere is therefore an acceptance among stakeholders and Institutions\nthat the whole range of objectives and interests, especially the success of the\nResearch policy, international competitiveness and scientific excellence,\nshould be considered, along with the error rate. At the same time, there is a\nclear need to manage the budget in an efficient and effective manner, and to\nprevent fraud and waste. \nAs stated above, the Commission will monitor the risk of\nnon-compliance through the reporting system that it will establish , as well as\nby following the results of ex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from\nthe BBI JTI JU, as part of the ex post audits covering the whole of the Horizon\n2020. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected level of risk of\nnon-compliance \nAs the Commission reported in the Legislative Financial Statement\nfor Horizon 2020, it remains the ultimate objective to achieve a residual error\nrate of less than 2% of total expenditure over the lifetime of the programme,\nand to that end, it has introduced a number of simplification measures. However,\nthe other objectives set out above as well as the costs of controls need to be\nconsidered.\nAs the rules of participation in the BBI JTI JU are basically the\nsame as those that the Commission will use, and with a population of\nbeneficiaries with a similar risk profile to those of the Commission, it can be\nexpected that the level of error will be similar to that established by the\nCommission for Horizon 2020, i.e. to give reasonable assurance that the risk of\nerror over the course of the multiannual expenditure period is, on an annual\nbasis, within a range of 2-5 %, with the ultimate aim to achieve a residual\nlevel of error as close as possible to 2 % at the closure of the multi-annual\nprogrammes, once the financial impact of all audits, correction and recovery\nmeasures have been taken into account.\nSee the Legislative Financial Statement for Horizon 2020 for full\ndetails of the error rate expected with respect to participants.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities\nThe Commission will ensure that procedures to fight against fraud at\nall stages of the management process are applied by the BBI JTI JU. The\nproposals for Horizon 2020 have been subject to fraud proofing and an\nassessment of their impact. Overall the measures proposed should have a positive\nimpact on the fight against fraud, especially the greater emphasis on risk\nbased audit and reinforced scientific evaluation and control.\nThe Commission will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to\nensure that, when actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the\nfinancial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive\nmeasures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by\neffective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the\namounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and\ndeterrent penalties.\nThe Commission will ensure that cooperation with its services from\nthe BBI JTI JU in matters relating to fraud and irregularity will and be\nstrong. \nThe Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of\ndocuments and on-the-spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and\nsubcontractors who have received Union funds under the Programme.\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot\nchecks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly\nby such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation\n(Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 with a view to establishing whether there has\nbeen fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial\ninterests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision\nor a contract concerning Union funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7       \nNew budget lines requested \nIn order of multiannual financial framework\nheadings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Heading 1A \u2013 Competitiveness for growth and jobs || Diff./non-diff. || from EFTA countries || from candidate countries || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n 1A || 08 02 07 32 -
