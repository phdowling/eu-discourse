In particular, Article 46 (1) (b) of\nthe Fourth Directive provides that, where appropriate and to the extent\nnecessary for an understanding of the company's development, performance or\nposition, the annual report shall also contain non-financial information,\nincluding information relating to environment and employee matters. \nIn addition, Article 46a of this Directive\nsets rules for the content of the corporate governance statement to be prepared\nby listed companies. \nThe opportunity to improve the transparency\nof the social and environmental information provided by companies in all\nsectors, in order to ensure a level playing field, has been acknowledged by the\nCommission in the Single Market Act[2].\nand was reiterated in the Communication \"A renewed strategy 2011 \u2013 2014\nfor Corporate Social Responsibility\"[3].\nThis proposal delivers on one of the principal commitments of the renewed\nstrategy. \nThe Communication defines CSR as \u201cthe\nresponsibility of enterprises for their impact on society\". It\nacknowledges that its development should be led by enterprises themselves, and\nthat companies should have a process in place to integrate social and\nenvironmental concerns into their business operation and strategy.\nNon-financial transparency is therefore a key element of any CSR policy.\nEnhanced transparency may help companies to\nbetter manage non-financial risks and opportunities, and thus improve their\nnon-financial performance. At the same time, non-financial information is used\nby civil society organisations and local communities to assess the impact and\nrisks related to the operations of a company. Moreover, it allows investors to\ntake better account of sustainability considerations and long term performance.\n\nHowever, consultations have shown that only\na limited number of EU large companies regularly disclose non-financial\ninformation, and the quality of the information disclosed varies largely,\nmaking it difficult for investors and stakeholders to understand and compare\ncompanies\u2019 position and performance. \nThis proposal sets therefore a requirement\nfor certain large companies to disclose relevant non-financial and diversity\ninformation, ensuring a level playing field across the EU. \nNevertheless, it takes a flexible and\nnon-intrusive approach. Companies may use existing national or international\nreporting frameworks and will retain their margin of manoeuvre to define the\ncontent of their policies, and flexibility to disclose information in a useful\nand relevant way. When companies consider that some policy areas are not\nrelevant for them, they will be allowed to explain why this is the case, rather\nthan being forced to produce a policy.\nThe European Parliament, in its two\nresolutions on respectively,\u201cCorporate Social Responsibility: accountable,\ntransparent and responsible business behaviour and sustainable growth\u201d[4] and \u201cCorporate Social\nResponsibility: promoting society\u2019s interests and a route to sustainable and\ninclusive recovery\u201d[5],\nacknowlegded the need to increase transparency in this field and called the\nCommission to bring forward a legislative proposal. \nAgainst this background, this proposal pursues\nthe following key objectives:\n(1)         \nTo increase the transparency of certain\ncompanies, and to increase the relevance, consistency, and comparability of the\nnon-financial information currently disclosed, by strengthening and clarifying\nthe existing requirements.\n(2)         \nTo increase diversity in the boards of companies\nthrough enhanced transparency in order to facilitate an effective oversight of\nthe management and robust governance of the company.\n(3)         \nTo increase the company's accountability and\nperformance, and the efficiency of the Single Market\nThe current approach to the disclosure of\nnon-financial information in the Accounting Directives has not been\nsufficiently effective. A majority of stakeholders consulted considered that the\nobligation set by the Accounting Directives lacks clarity and may prejudice legal\ncertainty. \nClearer requirements and stronger focus on\ntopical issues important for the company's long-term success are therefore necessary.\nSome Member States have developed national legislation that goes beyond the\nrequirements of the Accounting Directives. However, national requirements are\nsignificantly diverse, which adds to the lack of clarity for companies and\ninvestors who operate across the Internal Market.\nSome Member States have privileged\n\"report or explain\" models, where companies can choose between the\nactual reporting, or, alternatively, disclosing the reasons for not doing so.\nOthers establish an outright legal requirement, which may be quite\nprescriptive. Some Member States target large companies, while others focus on\ncertain listed companies or government-owned companies only. Some Member States\nrefer to international guidelines (although often different ones), while others\nare developing their own national reporting guidelines. This varied pattern has\nled to a fragmentation of the legislative frameworks across the EU. That is why\nthis proposal aims at ensuring a level playing field, at limiting costs for\nenterprises operating in more than one Member State, and ensuring easier and\nmore widespread investors\u2019 access to key, useful information\nIn addition, insufficient diversity in the\nboards may lead to a similarity of views of the members of the board of\ndirectors (the so-called phenomenon of \"group think\") and more resistance\nto innovative ideas. This can lead to a negative impact on the challenge and\noversight of the management by the board of directors and therefore on the\nperformance of companies. Enhanced transparency on diversity policies could\nalso make a considerable contribution to the promotion of equal treatment and\nto the fight against any discrimination in decision-making bodies of the\ncompanies concerned and beyond. Discrimination on grounds of religion or\nbelief, disability, age or sexual orientation as regards employment or\noccupation is prohibited by Directive 2000/78/EC. Discrimination on grounds of\nsex is prohibited in employment and occupation according to Directive\n2006/54/EC. Discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin in employment\nis prohibited by Directive 2000/43/EC.\nThe identified problems may affect the\noverall performance of companies, their accountability, the ability of\ninvestors to assess and factor appropriately and timely all relevant\ninformation, and the efficiency of the EU financial markets. As a consequence,\nthe Single Market potential for sustainable growth and employment may not always\nbe fully exploited. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of stakeholders and\ninterested parties\nThe Commission services have maintained\nregular and wide dialogues with stakeholders throughout the procedure leading\nto this proposal for amendment. The objective was to gather views from all\ninterested parties, including preparers, users, non-governmental organisations,\netc. The dialogue took place through:\n\u2013              \nTwo public consultations, respectively on \"Disclosure\nof non-Financial information by companies\" and on the \"EU corporate\ngovernance framework. On non-financial information, an overall majority of\nstakeholders supported the need to improve the current legislative framework,\nas this could be beneficial for both preparers and users of information. On\ndiversity most of the respondents to the consultation on the \"EU Corporate\nGovernance Framework\" showed a clear support for the disclosure of\ncompanies' diversity policies. They considered that enhanced transparency would\nenable investors to make more informed decisions and would help reducing the\nphenomenon of \"group think\".\n\u2013              \nAn ad hoc Experts' group composed of 16 members\nwith diverse experience and background, and\n\u2013              \nSeveral meetings with stakeholders and Member\nStates' representatives\nImpact assessment\nThe impact assessment undertaken by the Commission\nservices identified two main issues concerning (1) the inadequate transparency\nof non-financial information and (2) the lack of diversity in the boards of\ndirectors. \nInadequate Transparency of\nNon-Financial Information \nCertain companies have failed to adequately\nmeet growing demand from stakeholders (including investors, shareholders,\nemployees and civil society organisations) for non-financial transparency. Specific\nissues have been highlighted with regard to both quantity and quality of\ninformation. \n\u2013                        \nQuantity of information: it is estimated that only ~ 2500 out of the total ~ 42000 EU large\ncompanies formally disclose non-financial information on a yearly basis \n\u2013                        \nQuality of information: overall the information disclosed by\ncompanies does not adequately meet the needs of users. \nThe analysis carried out by the Commission\nservices has identified both a market and regulatory failure as underlying\ncauses of the problem. First, market incentives appear insufficient or uneven.\nDespite the increase in demand for non-financial information, the benefits\nrelated to non-financial disclosure are perceived by some stakeholders as\nlong-term and difficult to quantify in a precise manner, while short-term costs\nare more apparent and easily measurable. Some companies, although conceptually\nacknowledging the benefits of non-financial reporting, may be less inclined to\nactively pursue policies in this field due to this perception.\nSecond, the regulatory responses, both at\nEU and at Member States' level, have not been effective enough in addressing\nthis problem. \nA number of options have been considered to\nimprove the current situation, including strengthening the existing\nrequirement, introducing new requirements for detailed reporting, or setting up\nan EU Standard. In light of the assessment of these policy options, it appeared\nthat the preferred option would be strengthening the existing obligation, by\nrequiring a non-financial statement within the Annual Report. \nInsufficient\nboard diversity \nCompany boards with members who have a\nsimilar educational and professional background, geographical origin, age or\ngender may be dominated by a narrow \"group think\". This can contribute\nto the failure of an effective challenge of the management decisions, as the lack\nof diverse views, values, and competences may lead to less debate, ideas and\nchallenge in the boardroom. It can also lead to a harder acceptance of\ninnovative ideas proposed by the management. The insufficient board diversity\nis linked above all to insufficient market incentives for companies to change\nthe situation. In this respect, inadequate recruitment practices for board\nmembers drawing often on a too narrow pool of people contribute to perpetuating\nthe selection of members with similar profiles. Another element reinforcing the\nproblem is the inadequate transparency on board diversity, as the level of\ninformation and the extent to which this information is available to the public\nat large is often insufficient.\nThis insufficient board diversity and lack\nof transparency can therefore result in companies that are less well managed,\nless inclusive and less innovative, so they contribute less to growth. In the\nlight of the EU 2020 objectives of inclusive and sustainable growth the\nCommission has therefore considered a number of options to address these\nproblems. In the light of the assessment of these policy options, it appeared\nthat the most appropriate option at this stage would be the disclosure of\ndiversity policy. It is also the option that is preferred by most\nstakeholders compared to other options such as a compulsory diversity policy or\nto an action focusing only on recruitment policy.\nComplementary to these provisions, the\nCommission has already proposed on\n14 November 2012 legislation with the aim of attaining a\n40% objective of the under-represented gender in non-executive board-member\npositions in publicly listed companies, with the exception of small and medium\nenterprises.[6]\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nProposed amendment of the Directives \nThe proposal takes the form of an amendment\nto Article 46 of the Fourth Directive and to Article 36 of the Seventh\nDirective dealing with disclosure of non-financial information. Concerning the\nnew requirement on diversity in the boards, it is proposed to amend Article 46a\nof the Fourth Directive. \nThe Accounting Directives regulate the\ninformation provided in the financial statements of all limited liability\ncompanies which are incorporated under the law of a Member State or European\nEconomic Area (EEA). As Article 4(5) of the Transparency Directive refers to\nArticle 46 of the Fourth Directive and to Article 36 of the Seventh Directive,\nthe amendements proposed to these provisions will also cover companies listed\non EU regulated markets even if they are registered in a third country. \nLegal basis, subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nThe proposal is based on Article 50(1) of\nthe Treaty, which is the legal basis for adopting EU measures aimed at\nachieving an Internal Market in company law. The proposal provides that large companies\nshould disclose non-financial information under a set of requirements devised\nto increasing transparency with the objective of strengthening the company's transparency\nand accountability, while limiting any undue administrative burden. \nAccording to the principle of subsidiarity\nthe EU should act only where it can provide better results than intervention at\nMember State level and action should be limited to what is necessary and\nproportionate in order to attain the objectives of the policy pursued. Several\nMember States have recently adopted legislation requiring additional disclosure\nin this field. However, national requirements appear significantly diverse,\nleading to difficulties to benchmark companies across the Internal Market. The\nobjectives of this amendment are such that they cannot be fulfilled by unilateral\naction at the level of the Member States. \nFuther transparency should not translate\ninto undue administrative burden. Smaller companies face more difficulties to\ncollect and analyse information. According to the \"think-small-first\"\nprinciple, the disclosure requirements under this Directive should not apply to\ncompanies whose size is below a defined threshold. \nAs far as large companies are concerned,\ndisclosure of non-financial information needs to be made more available,\nuseful, and consistent at EU level, as the activities of these companies are\noften EU-wide and relevant to investors and other stakeholders throughout the\ninternal market. Nevertheless, over and above a harmonised requirement of\nconsistent information common across the Single Market, Member States should\nhave a degree of flexibility as far as additional reporting requirements are\nconcerned. To this end, an amendment to the Accounting Directives is the most\nappropriate legal instrument as it allows a certain flexibility for Member States.\nAmending the Directives also ensures that the content and form of the proposed\nEU action does not go beyond what is necessary and proportionate in order to\nachieve the regulatory objective. \nDetailed Explanation of the Proposal \nNon-financial\ninformation \nThe current\nobligation set by Art 46 (1) (b) provides that large companies disclose\nnon-financial information, including relating to environmental and employee\nmatters. This measure is designed to deliver significant benefits for\ncompanies, investors and other stakeholders operating in the Single Market,\nand, therefore, contribute to inclusive and sustainable long-term growth and\nemployment..\nArticle 1 (a) of the\nproposal will require certain large companies to disclose a statement in their Annual\nReport including material information relating to at least environmental,\nsocial, and employee-related matters, respect of human rights, anti-corruption\nand bribery aspects. Within these areas, the statement will include (i) a\ndescription of its policies, (ii) results and (iii) risk-related aspects. \nIn providing this\ninformation, without prejudice to possible more ambitious requirements set at\nMember States level, the company may rely on national, EU-based or\ninternational frameworks, such as the UN Global Compact, the Guiding Principles\non Business and Human Rights implementing the UN \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d\nFramework, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ISO 26000, the\nILO Tripartite Declaration of\nprinciples concerning multinational enterprises and social policy, and the\nGlobal Reporting Initiative, and disclose which framework they have relied\nupon. A company that does not apply a specific policy in one or more of these\nareas will be required to explain why this is the case. \nAs such, the measure\ntargets business-relevant information, useful for decision-making purposes\nwithin the company as well as for investors and other stakeholders. The measure\nallows for significant flexibility and avoids unnecessary administrative burden\non companies, in particular on the smallest ones, which are not subject to new\ndisclosure requirements. Costs associated with the required disclosures for\nlarge companies are commensurate to the value and usefulness of the information\nand the size, impact and complexity of the undertakings.\nIn particular, as\nspecified in Article 1 (a), the obligation will only apply to those companies\nwhose average number of employees exceeds 500, and exceeds either a balance\nsheet total of 20 million euros or a net turnover of 40 million euros. This\nthreshold, higher than the one currently applied within the Accounting\nDirectives (i.e.: 250 employees) is balanced since it limits any undue\nadministrative burden and ensures an appropriate scope of the non-financial\nreporting obligations. It is estimated that, on this basis, the new requirement\nwould cover around 18.000 companies in the EU.\nMoreover, as\nspecified in Article 1 (b), those companies that prepare a report corresponding\nto the same financial year shall be exempted from the obligation to provide the\nnon-financial statement, provided that the report: (i) covers the same topics\nand content required by Article 1 (a), (ii) relies on national, EU-based or international\nframeworks, and (iii) is annexed to the Annual Report. \nFinally, Article 1\n(c) will exempt subsidiaries companies from the obligation set out by paragraph\n1 (a), provided that the exempted company and its subsidiaries are consolidated\nin annual report of another company, and that consolidated annual report fulfils\nthe requirements set out under Article 1 (a). \nDiversity \nThe new paragraph 1(g) will require large\nlisted companies to provide information on their diversity policy, including aspects\nconcerning age, gender, geographical diversity, and educational and professional\nbackground. The information will be included in the corporate governance statement\nand will have to contain the objectives of such a policy, its implementation\nand the results obtained. Companies not having a diversity policy will only be\nobliged to explain why this is the case. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implications for the\nCommunity budget. \n2013/0110 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and\n83/349/EEC as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by\ncertain large companies and groups\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 50 (1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[8],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its Communication to\nthe European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the\nCommittee of the Regions entitled 'Single Market Act Twelve levers to boost\ngrowth and strengthen confidence \"Working together to create new\ngrowth\"',[9]\nadopted on 13 April 2011, the Commission identifies the need to improve the\ntransparency of the social and environmental information provided by companies\nin all sectors, in order to ensure a level playing field. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The necessity to improve\ncompany disclosure of social and environmental information, by presenting a\nlegislative proposal in this field, was reiterated in the Communication from\nthe Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social\nCommittee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \u201cA renewed EU strategy\n2011-14 for Corporate Social Responsibility\u201d[10]\nadopted on 25 October 2011.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament\nhas, in its resolutions of 6 February 2013 on, respectively, \u201cCorporate Social\nResponsibility: accountable, transparent and responsible business behaviour and\nsustainable growth\u201d[11]\nand \u201cCorporate Social Responsibility: promoting society\u2019s interests and a tour\nto sustainable and inclusive recovery\u201d[12],\nacknowledged the importance of businesses divulging information on\nsustainability such as social and environmental factors, with a view to\nidentifying sustainability risks and increasing investor and consumer trust,\nand called the Commission to bring forward a proposal on non-financial\ndisclosure by companies. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The coordination of\nnational provisions concerning the disclosure of non-financial information in\nrespect of large undertakings with limited liability is of importance for the interests\nof companies, shareholders and other stakeholders alike. Coordination is\nnecessary in those fields because most of these undertakings operate in more\nthan one Member State.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also necessary to\nestablish a certain minimum legal requirement as regards the extent of the\ninformation that should be made available to the public by undertakings across\nthe Union. Annual reports should give a fair and comprehensive view of an\nundertaking's policies, results, and risks.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance\nconsistency and comparability of non-financial information disclosed throughout\nthe Union, companies should be required to include in their annual report a\nnon-financial statement containing information relating to at least\nenvironmental matters, social and employee-related matters, respect for human\nrights, anti-corruption and bribery matters. Such statement should include a\ndescription of the policies, results, and the risks related to those matters. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In providing this information,\ncompanies may rely on national frameworks, EU-based frameworks such as the\nEco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), and international frameworks such as\nthe United Nations (UN) Global Compact, the Guiding Principles on Business and\nHuman Rights implementing the UN \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework, the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 26000, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of principles concerning multinational\nenterprises and social policy, and the Global Reporting Initiative.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 47 of the final\ndeclaration of the United Nations Rio +20 conference, \"The Future We Want\"[13], recognises the importance of\ncorporate sustainability reporting and encourages companies, where appropriate,\nto consider integrating sustainability information into their reporting cycle.\nIt also encourages industry, interested governments and relevant stakeholders\nwith the support of the United Nations system, as appropriate, to develop\nmodels for best practice and facilitate action for the integration of financial\nand non-financial information, taking into account experiences from already\nexisting frameworks.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investors' access to\nnon-financial information is a step towards reaching the milestone of having in\nplace by 2020 market and policy incentives rewarding business investments in\nefficiency under the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe[14].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council of 24\nand 25 March 2011 called for the overall regulatory burden, in particular for\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (\"SMEs\"), to be reduced at both\nEuropean and national levels and suggested measures to increase productivity\nwhile the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth aims\nto improve the business environment for SMEs and to promote their internationalisation. Thus, according to the\n\"think-small-first\" principle, the disclosure requirements under\nDirective 78/660/EEC and Directive 83/349/EEC should only apply to certain\nlarge undertakings and groups.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scope of these\nnon-financial disclosure requirements should be defined by reference to the average\nnumber of employees, total assets and turnover. SMEs should be exempted from\nadditional requirements, and the obligation to disclose a non-financial\nstatement in the annual report should only apply to those companies whose\naverage number of employees exceeds 500, and exceed either a balance sheet\ntotal of EUR 20 million or a net turnover of EUR 40 million. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the companies and\ngroups falling under the scope of Directive 78/660/EEC and Directive 83/349/EEC\nalready prepare non-financial reports on a voluntary basis. Those companies\nshould not be subject to the obligation to provide a non-financial statement in\nthe annual report, provided that the report corresponds to the same financial\nyear, covers at least the same content required by this Directive, and is\nannexed to the annual report. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many of the undertakings which\nfall under the scope of Directive 78/660/EEC are members of groups of\nundertakings. Consolidated annual reports should be drawn up so that the information\nconcerning such groups of undertakings may be conveyed to members and third\nparties. National law governing consolidated annual reports should therefore be\ncoordinated in order to achieve the objectives of comparability and consistency\nof the information which undertakings should publish within the Union.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As required by Article 51a\n(e) of Directive 78/660/EEC, the report of the statutory auditors should also\ncontain an opinion concerning the consistency or otherwise of the annual\nreport, including non-financial information contained in the annual report,\nwith the annual accounts for the same financial year. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diversity of competences\nand views of the members of administrative, management and supervisory bodies\nof companies facilitates a good understanding of the business organisation and\naffairs. It enables members of these bodies to exercise a constructive\nchallenge of the management decisions and to be more open to innovative ideas, addressing\nthe similarity of views of members, the \"group-think\" phenomenon. It\ncontributes thus to effective oversight of the management and a successful\ngovernance of the company. It would therefore be\nimportant to enhance transparency regarding the diversity policy companies have\nin place. This would inform the market of corporate\ngovernance practices and thus put indirect pressure on companies to have more\ndiversified boards. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligation to disclose\ntheir diversity policies for their administrative, management and supervisory\nbodies with regard to aspects such as age, gender, geographical diversity,\neducational and professional background should only apply to large listed\ncompanies. Therefore small and medium-sized companies that may be exempted from\ncertain accounting obligations under article 27 of Directive 78/660/EEC should\nnot be covered to by this obligation. Disclosure of the diversity policy should\nbe part of the corporate governance statement, as laid down by Article 46a of\nDirective 78/660/EEC. Companies not having a such a diversity policy should not\nbe obliged to put one in place, but they should clearly explain why this is the\ncase.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective, namely to increase the relevance, consistency and comparability of\ninformation disclosed by companies across the Union, cannot be sufficiently\nachieved by the Member States, and can therefore by reason of its effect be\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with\nthe principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the\npursued objective.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the freedom to\nconduct a business, respect for private life and the protection of personal\ndata.
