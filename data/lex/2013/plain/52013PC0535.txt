It has helped to build mutual trust and to\r\nbridge the EU's wide variety of legal systems and traditions. By rapidly\r\nsolving legal problems, and identifying competent authorities in other\r\ncountries, Eurojust has facilitated the execution of requests for cooperation\r\nand mutual recognition instruments. These years have witnessed the continued\r\ngrowth of the organisation into what is now a central player in judicial\r\ncooperation in criminal matters. \nThe fight against organised crime and the\r\ndisruption of criminal organisations remain a daily challenge. Regretfully, the\r\npast decade has seen an explosion of cross-border crime. Drug trafficking,\r\ntrafficking in human beings, terrorism and cybercrime, including child\r\npornography are some examples. A common feature of all these areas of crime is\r\nthat they are committed across borders by highly mobile and flexible groups\r\noperating in multiple jurisdictions and criminal sectors. Combatting them\r\neffectively therefore requires a coordinated pan-european response. \nThe increased cross-border dimension of\r\ncrime as well as its diversification into multi-crime activities make it more\r\ndifficult for single Member States to detect and tackle cross-border crime, and\r\nin particular organised crime. In this context, Eurojust's role in improving\r\njudicial cooperation and coordination between competent judicial authorities of\r\nMember States and assisting investigations involving third countries remains\r\ncrucial. \nUnder the Lisbon Treaty, new possibilities\r\nto enhance Eurojust's efficiency in tackling these forms of criminality have\r\nbeen introduced. Article 85 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) explicitly\r\nrecognises Eurojust's mission of supporting and strenghtening coordination and\r\ncooperation between national investigating and prosecuting authorities in\r\nrelation to serious crime affecting two or more Member States or requiring a\r\nprosecution on common bases. It is therefore important to ensure that the best\r\npossible use is made of Eurojust and that obstacles to its efficient\r\nfunctioning are removed.[2]\nIn 2008 a wide reform of the Eurojust\r\nDecision was put into place in order to strengthen Eurojust.[3] The transposition deadline was\r\n4 June 2011. The correct implementation of the Decision as amended is\r\nimportant, but should not prevent progress in addressing new challenges and\r\nimproving Eurojust's functioning whilst maintaining those aspects that\r\nstrengthened its operational effectiveness.\nArticle 85 TFEU also provides for\r\nEurojust's structure, operation, field of action and tasks to be determined by\r\nregulations adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. It\r\nalso requires that they determine arrangements for involving the European\r\nParliament and national Parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities.\r\n\nIn addition, following the Commission\r\nCommunication \"European agencies: the way forward\"[4], the European Parliament, the\r\nCouncil and the Commission agreed to launch an inter-institutional dialogue in\r\norder to improve the coherence, effectiveness and work of decentralised\r\nagencies, leading to the creation of an Inter-Institutional Working Group\r\n(IIWG) in March 2009. It addressed a number of key issues, including the role\r\nand position of the agencies in the EU's institutional landscape, their\r\ncreation, structure and operation, funding, budgetary, supervision and\r\nmanagement issues. \nThis work led to the Common Approach on EU\r\ndecentralised agencies, endorsed by the European Parliament, the Council and\r\nthe Commission in July 2012, which is destined to be taken into account in the\r\ncontext of all their future decisions concerning EU decentralised agencies,\r\nfollowing a case by case analysis.\nThis proposal for a Regulation takes all\r\nthese elements into consideration and provides a single and renovated legal\r\nframework for a new Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) which is\r\nthe legal successor of Eurojust as established by Council Decision\r\n2002/187/JHA.\nWhilst maintaining those elements that have\r\nproved efficient in the management and operation of Eurojust, the Regulation\r\nmodernises its legal framework and streamlines its functioning and structure in\r\nline with the Lisbon Treaty and the requirements of the Common Approach, as far\r\nas its nature allows. \nSince the proposal for this Regulation is\r\nadopted at the same time as the proposal for a Regulation establishing the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor's Office, provisions have been included to ensure\r\nthat this Office is set up from Eurojust as required under Article 86 TFEU, and\r\nthat Eurojust can support it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED\r\nPARTIES\nIn order to prepare this Regulation, the\r\nCommission has consulted specialist stakeholders on a number of occasions. The\r\nobjective of the proposal is, largely, to use the opportunity offered by the\r\nLisbon Treaty to modernise Eurojust by giving it an improved management\r\nstructure that reduces the administrative burden currently placed on the\r\nCollege and allows it to focus on its core mission.\nOn 18 October 2012 the Commission organised\r\na consultative meeting with Member State experts, representatives of the\r\nCouncil Secretariat, the European Parliament and Eurojust to discuss issues\r\nrelated to a possible reform under Article 85 TFUE. The issues included\r\nstrengthened governance, parliamentary involvement at European and national\r\nlevel and possible additional powers, as well as links with the development of\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). The meeting generally supported\r\nimproving Eurojust's governance structure and efficiency.\nEurojust has also participated directly in\r\nthe consultation process and provided its input through contributions and\r\nmeetings with the Commission. In addition, discussions on the reform have taken\r\nplace in the framework of different Seminars such as the Strategic Seminar\r\n\"Eurojust and the Lisbon Treaty. Towards more effective action\"\r\n(Bruges 20-22 September 2010) and the Eurojust-ERA Conference \u201c10 Years of\r\nEurojust: Operational Achievements and Future Challenges\u201d, which took place in\r\nThe Hague on 12 and 13 November 2012. In addition, Eurojust's future was\r\ndiscussed at the special informal meeting of the Council at the occasion of\r\nEurojust's tenth anniversary, in February 2012.\nThe views of\r\nstakeholders were also collected through the \"Study\r\non the strengthening of Eurojust\"[5],\r\nordered by the Commission, which provided a good overview of the existing\r\nissues and presented several policy alternatives to address these. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis\nArticle 85 TFEU provides the legal basis\r\nfor the proposal. It prescribes the use of a Regulation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality \nThere is a need for EU action because the measures\r\nforeseen have an intrinsic EU dimension, as they imply the creation of an\r\nentity whose mission is to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween national judicial authorities in relation to serious crime affecting\r\ntwo or more Member States or requiring a prosecution on common bases. This\r\nobjective can only be achieved at Union level, in accordance with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve this objective.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanation of the proposal\r\nby chapters\nThe main objectives of the proposals are:\n\u00b7                        \r\nto increase Eurojust's efficiency through\r\nproviding it with a new governance structure;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto improve Eurojust's operational effectiveness\r\nthrough homogeneously defining the status and powers of National Members;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto provide for a role for the European\r\nParliament and national Parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities\r\nin line with the Lisbon Treaty;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto bring Eurojust's legal framework in line with\r\nthe Common Approach, whilst fully respecting its special role regarding the\r\ncoordination of on-going criminal investigations;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto ensure that Eurojust can cooperate closely\r\nwith the European Public Prosecutor's Office, once this is established.\n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I Objectives and\r\ntasks\nThis chapter regulates the setting up of the\r\nEuropean Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) as the legal\r\nsuccessor of Eurojust as established by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA. It also\r\ndefines its tasks and competence. The latter is autonomously defined in the\r\ndraft Regulation by means of an Annex.\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II: Structure and\r\norganisation of Eurojust \nThis chapter contains some of the main\r\nelements of the reform. \nSection II is devoted to Eurojust's national\r\nmembers. The reform maintains their link to their Member State of origin but at\r\nthe same time explicitly lists the operational powers they shall all have. This\r\nwill allow them to cooperate with each other and with national authorities in a\r\nmore effective way.\nSections III, IV and V set up the new structure\r\nof Eurojust by respectively regulating the College, the Executive Board and the\r\nAdministrative Director. Eurojust's governance is improved by clearly\r\ndistinguishing between two compositions of the College, depending on whether it\r\nexercises operational or management functions. The former refer to the core\r\nbusiness of Eurojust in supporting and coordinating national investigations.\r\nThe latter are related for example to the adoption of the agency's work\r\nprogramme, annual budget or the Annual report. A new organ, the Executive\r\nBoard, is set up to prepare the College's management decisions and to directly\r\nassume some administrative tasks. The Commission is represented in the College\r\nwhen it exercises its management functions and in the Executive Board. Finally,\r\nthe appointment procedure, responsibilities and tasks of the Administrative\r\nDirector are clearly spelled out.\nThis introduces a double degree of\r\ngovernance as foreseen in the Common Approach whilst maintaining Eurojust's\r\nspecial nature and safeguarding its independence. It is also cost- effective,\r\nand contributes to Eurojust's efficiency, as national members will be assisted\r\nin budgetary and administrative matters, which will allow them to focus on\r\ntheir operational tasks.\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III: Operational\r\nmatters \nThis chapter maintains existing mechanisms\r\nfor the operational effectiveness of Eurojust, including the On-call\r\nCoordination (OCC), the Eurojust National Coordination System (ENCS), the\r\nexchanges of information and follow-up to Eurojust's requests. The architecture\r\nof the Eurojust Case Management System remains the same. \n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV: Processing of\r\nInformation\nThis chapter contains a reference to\r\nRegulation 45/2001[6]\r\nas the applicable regime for the processing of all personal data at Eurojust. In\r\naddition, the Regulation particularises and complements Regulation 45/2001 as\r\nfar as operational personal data are concerned, respecting the specificity of\r\njudicial cooperation activities while taking into account the need for\r\nconsistency and compatibility with the relevant data protection principles. Restrictions\r\non the processing of personal data continue to be possible. \nThe chapter also aligns the provisions on\r\nthe rights of the data subjects with Regulation 45/2001 and takes into account\r\nthe standards of protection foreseen in the data protection reform package,\r\nadopted by the Commission in January 2012. Furthermore, the chapter foresees an\r\nimportant change in the supervision mechanism. It establishes the\r\nresponsibilities of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) as regards\r\nthe monitoring of all personal data processing at Eurojust. The EDPS will take\r\nover the tasks of the Joint Supervisory Body established under the Eurojust\r\nCouncil Decision.\n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V: Relations with\r\npartners\nThis chapter reflects the importance of\r\npartnership and cooperation between Eurojust and other EU institutions, bodies\r\nand agencies in the fight against crime. This includes firstly the relations\r\nwith the Secretariats of the European Judicial Network, the Joint Investigation\r\nTeams Expert Network and the Genocide Network, which are hosted by Eurojust. It\r\nalso includes a specific provision on relations with the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office.\nSecondly, cooperation with Europol is\r\nparticularly important, especially as regards its role in supplying information\r\nto Eurojust in line with Article 85 TFEU. A specific provision has been\r\nintroduced to spell out the privileged relationship between the two agencies in\r\norder to increase their effectiveness in combating serious forms of\r\ninternational crime within their competence. This includes a mechanism for\r\ncross-checking of their respective information systems and the ensuing exchange\r\nof data. Practical details will be settled by means of an agreement.\nLinks with third countries are very\r\nfrequently detected in serious and organised crime cases, which makes close\r\ncooperation with such countries crucial. The Lisbon Treaty has changed the way\r\nin which the European Union conducts its external relations, and these changes\r\nalso affect the agencies. As a consequence, agencies will no longer be able to\r\nnegotiate international agreements themselves \u2013 such agreements will have to be\r\nestablished in accordance with Article 218 TFEU. However, Eurojust will be able\r\nto conclude working arrangements to enhance cooperation with competent\r\nauthorities of third countries, including by exchanging information. The\r\nvalidity of pre-existing international agreements is maintained.\n3.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI Financial\r\nprovisions\nThese provisions aim to modernise Eurojust's\r\nbudget, its establishment and implementation, presentation of accounts and\r\ndischarge provisions.\n3.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VII Staff\r\nprovisions\nThese provisions reflect the principles of\r\nthe Common Approach while respecting Eurojust's specificities. Eurojust's\r\nhybrid nature and the importance of the operational link between national desks\r\nand their Member States of origin explain that salaries and emoluments of such\r\nstaff are borne by the Member States. Eurojust's Administrative Director is\r\nstill appointed by the College of Eurojust but on the basis of a shortlist\r\ndrawn up by the Commission, following an open and transparent selection\r\nprocedure. This respects the autonomy of the agency whilst guaranteeing a\r\nrigorous evaluation of candidates. A similar procedure is foreseen for\r\ndismissal of the Administrative Director.\n3.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VIII Evaluation and\r\nReporting \nThis chapter aligns Eurojust's legal\r\nframework with the increased democratic legitimacy of Eurojust required by the\r\nLisbon Treaty. It spells out the involvement of the European Parliament and\r\nnational parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities. This is done\r\nin a cost-effective way, on the basis of Eurojust's Annual Report, whilst\r\npreserving Eurojust's operational independence. A periodic overall evaluation\r\nof Eurojust in line with the Common Approach is also provided. \n3.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IX General and\r\nfinal provisions \nThis chapter contains provisions to align the\r\nEurojust Regulation with the Common Approach, as well as those related to the\r\nentry into force of the Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThere\r\nare no cost implications of the governance reform (\"management board\"\r\nback to back with the College) and there are no new tasks foreseen for Eurojust\r\nin this proposal, other than supporting the European Public Prosecutor's Office,\r\nwhich will be done on a zero cost basis.\n2013/0256 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Union Agency for Criminal\r\nJustice Cooperation (Eurojust)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 85 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nAfter consulting the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurojust was set up by\r\nCouncil Decision 2002/187/JHA[7]\r\nas a body of the European Union with legal personality to stimulate and to\r\nimprove coordination and cooperation between competent judicial authorities of\r\nthe Member States, particularly in relation to serious organised crime. Council\r\nDecision 2003/659/JHA[8]\r\nand Council Decision 2009/426/JHA[9]\r\non the strengthening of Eurojust amended Eurojust's legal framework.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 85 of the Treaty\r\nprovides for Eurojust to be governed by a regulation, adopted in accordance\r\nwith the ordinary legislative procedure. It also requires determining\r\narrangements for involving the European Parliament and national Parliaments in\r\nthe evaluation of Eurojust's activities.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 85 of the Treaty also\r\nprovides that Eurojust's mission shall be to support and strengthen\r\ncoordination and cooperation between national investigating and prosecuting\r\nauthorities in relation to serious crime affecting two or more Member States or\r\nrequiring a prosecution on common bases, on the basis of operations conducted\r\nand information supplied by the Member States' authorities and by Europol.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office should be established from Eurojust, this Regulation\r\nincludes the provisions necessary to regulate the relations between Eurojust\r\nand the European Public Prosecutor's Office. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office should have exclusive competence to investigate and\r\nprosecute crimes affecting the Union's financial interests, Eurojust should be\r\nable to support national authorities when they are investigating and prosecuting\r\nthese forms of crime in accordance with the Regulation establishing the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor's Office.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for Eurojust to\r\nfulfil its mission and develop all its potential in the fight against serious\r\ncross-border crime, its operational functions should be strengthened by\r\nreducing the administrative workload of national members, and its European\r\ndimension enhanced through the Commission's participation in the management of\r\nthe agency and the increased involvement of the European Parliament and\r\nnational Parliaments in the evaluation of its activities.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, Council Decision\r\n2002/187/JHA should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation determining\r\narrangements for parliamentary involvement, modernising its structure and\r\nsimplifying Eurojust's current legal framework, whilst maintaining those\r\nelements that have proven to be efficient in its operation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by\r\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The forms of serious crime\r\naffecting two or more Member States for which Eurojust is competent should be\r\nlaid down. In addition, cases which do not involve two or more Member States,\r\nbut which require a prosecution on common bases, should be defined. Such cases\r\nshould include investigations and prosecutions affecting only one Member State\r\nand a third State, as well as cases affecting only one Member State and the\r\nUnion.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When exercising its\r\noperational functions in relation to concrete criminal cases, at the request of\r\ncompetent authorities of Member States or on its own initiative, Eurojust\r\nshould act either through one or more of the national members or as a College.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure Eurojust can\r\nappropriately support and coordinate cross-border investigations, it is\r\nnecessary that all national members have the same operational powers in order\r\nto cooperate between themselves and with national authorities in a more\r\neffective way. National members should be granted those powers that allow\r\nEurojust to appropriately achieve its mission. These powers should include accessing\r\nrelevant information in national public registers, issuing and executing mutual\r\nassistance and recognition requests, directly contacting and exchanging information\r\nwith competent authorities, participating in joint investigation teams and, in\r\nagreement with the competent national authority or in case of urgency, ordering\r\ninvestigative measures and controlled deliveries.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to provide\r\nEurojust with an administrative and management structure that allows it to\r\nperform its tasks more effectively and respects the principles applicable to\r\nUnion agencies whilst maintaining Eurojust's special characteristics and\r\nsafeguarding its independence in the exercise of its operational functions. To this\r\nend, the functions of the national members, the College and the Administrative\r\nDirector should be clarified and an Executive Board established.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions should be laid down\r\nto clearly distinguish between the operational and the management functions of\r\nthe College, reducing the administrative burden on national members to the\r\nminimum so that the focus is put on Eurojust's operational work. The management\r\ntasks of the College should include in particular the adoption of Eurojust's\r\nwork programmes, budget, annual activity report, appropriate financial rules,\r\nand working arrangements with partners. It should exercise the power of\r\nappointing authority towards staff of the agency including the Administrative\r\nDirector.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To improve Eurojust's\r\ngovernance and streamline procedures, an Executive Board should be established\r\nto assist the College in its management functions and to allow for streamlined\r\ndecision-making on non-operational and strategic issues. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\r\nrepresented in the College when it exercises its management functions and in\r\nthe Executive Board, to ensure non-operational supervision and strategic\r\nguidance of Eurojust. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure an\r\nefficient day-to-day administration of Eurojust, the Administrative Director\r\nshould be its legal representative and manager, accountable to the College and\r\nthe Executive Board. The Administrative Director should prepare and implement\r\nthe decisions of the College and the Executive Board. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The setting up of an\r\nOn-Call Coordination (OCC) within Eurojust is necessary to make Eurojust\r\navailable around the clock and to enable it to intervene in urgent cases. It\r\nshould be the responsibility of each Member State to ensure that their representatives\r\nin the OCC are able to act on a 24-hour/7-day basis.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurojust national\r\ncoordination systems should be set up in the Member States to coordinate the\r\nwork carried out by the national correspondents for Eurojust, the national\r\ncorrespondent for Eurojust for terrorism matters, the national correspondent\r\nfor the European Judicial Network and up to three other contact points, as well\r\nas representatives in the Network for Joint Investigation Teams and of the\r\nnetworks set up by Council Decision 2002/494/JHA of 13 June 2002 setting up a\r\nEuropean network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for\r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes[10], Council Decision 2007/845/JHA\r\nof 6 December 2007 concerning cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices of the\r\nMember States in the field of tracing and identification of proceeds from, or\r\nother property related to crime[11]\r\nand by Council Decision 2008/852/JHA of 24 October 2008 on a contact-point\r\nnetwork against corruption[12].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of stimulating\r\nand strengthening coordination and cooperation between national investigating\r\nand prosecuting authorities it is crucial that Eurojust receives relevant\r\ninformation from national authorities necessary for the performance of its\r\ntasks. To this end, national competent authorities should inform their national\r\nmembers of the setting up and results of joint investigation teams, of cases\r\nunder the competence of Eurojust directly involving at least three Member\r\nStates and for which requests or decisions on judicial cooperation have been\r\ntransmitted to at least two Member States, as well as, under certain\r\ncircumstances, information on conflicts of jurisdiction, controlled deliveries\r\nand repeated difficulties in judicial cooperation.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst the processing of\r\npersonal data at Eurojust falls under the scope of Regulation (EC) 45/2001 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the\r\nprotection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the\r\nCommunity institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[13], the processing of personal\r\ndata by the Member State's authorities and the transfer of such data to\r\nEurojust are covered by the Council of Europe Convention 108 [to be replaced by\r\nthe relevant Directive in force at the moment of adoption].\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Eurojust transfers\r\npersonal data to an authority of a third country or to an international\r\norganisation or Interpol by virtue of an international agreement concluded\r\npursuant to Article 218 of the Treaty the adequate safeguards adduced with\r\nrespect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of\r\nindividuals have to ensure that the data protection provisions of this\r\nRegulation are complied with.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurojust should be\r\nauthorised to process certain personal data on persons who, under the national\r\nlegislation of the Member States concerned, are suspected of having committed\r\nor having taken part in a criminal offence in respect of which Eurojust is\r\ncompetent, or who have been convicted of such an offence. It is not intended\r\nthat Eurojust carry out an automated comparison of DNA profiles or\r\nfingerprints.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eurojust should be given\r\nthe opportunity to extend the deadlines for storage of personal data, subject\r\nto observance of the purpose limitation principle applicable to processing of\r\npersonal data in the context of all activities of Eurojust, in order to achieve\r\nits objectives.

Article\r\n85 TFEU provides for Eurojust to be governed by a Regulation, adopted in\r\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Its mission is to support\r\nand strengthen coordination and cooperation between national investigating and\r\nprosecuting authorities relating to serious crime affecting two or more Member\r\nStates of the European Union.

It also plays a major role in fighting cross-border crime in the EU\r\nas an effective facilitator of judicial co-operation whose assistance is\r\nincreasingly sought by national practitioners. The expected effects include:\n1. Eurojust's operational work\nEurojust supports and strengthens judicial cooperation in criminal\r\nmatters. National members, acting individually or as a College, intervene in\r\nconcrete criminal cases, where national authorities need enhanced coordination\r\nor need to overcome difficulties in the practical use of judicial cooperation\r\nand mutual recognition instruments. Eurojust has helped to bridge the EU's wide\r\nvariety of legal systems and traditions and to foster mutual trust, which is\r\nthe cornerstone of mutual recognition instruments by rapidly solving linguistic\r\nor legal problems or identifying competent authorities in other countries. \n2. Eurojust centre of judicial expertise for effective action\r\nagainst serious cross-border crime\nEurojust plays a major role in the fight against cross-border crime.\r\nEurojust organises coordination meetings, where national authorities come\r\ntogether to agree on a common approach to investigations, prepare assistance\r\nrequests, solve or anticipate answers to legal questions or decide upon\r\nsimultaneous operations. Eurojust is involved in the setting up and\r\nparticipation in JITs (Joint Investigation Teams), providing support to Member\r\nStates.\n3. Eurojust's cooperation with partners\nEurojust cooperates with other agencies, in particular Europol, OLAF\r\nas well as with 3rd States and hosts the Secretariats of the European Judicial\r\nNetwork, the Joint Investigation Teams Expert Network and the Genocide Network,\r\nin accordance with the Council Decision.\n4. Eurojust's relations with the European Public Prosecutor's Office\nIn accordance with Article 86 TFEU, the European Public Prosecutor's\r\nOffice must be established \"from Eurojust\". This proposal therefore\r\nalso aims to regulate the relations between Eurojust and the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office. The administrative support to the EPPO will be provided on\r\na zero cost basis.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nIn accordance with the Roadmap for the implementation of the Common\r\nApproach on agencies, the Commission is developing guidelines for the\r\ndefinition of key performance indicators for the Agencies. This is expected to\r\nbe concluded in 2013.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nIn the short run Eurojust is expected to continue conducting its\r\ncore activities, notably those directly related to supporting and strengthening\r\ncoordination and cooperation between national investigating and prosecuting\r\nauthorities in cases of serious cross-border crime. The flow of information and\r\nlink between national authorities and Eurojust are bound to be strengthened.\nIn the medium term, Eurojust's structure, operation, tasks and\r\nparliamentary oversight will be strengthened through this proposal in\r\naccordance with Article 85 TFEU. There are also requirements linked to Article\r\n86 TFEU and the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office from\r\nEurojust: Eurojust will be required to provide administrative support services\r\nto the European Public Prosecutor's Office. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe added value of the action developed by Eurojust: facilitating\r\njudicial cooperation between national authorities of Member States and\r\nenhancing coordination to fight organised crime more effectively, has an\r\nintrinsically EU dimension and can only be achieved at EU level.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from similar\r\nexperiences in the past\nEurojust's annual reports confirm that there is an on-going need for\r\nEU and international coordination and support in the area of cross-border\r\nserious crime. The past decade has seen an explosion of organised crime, such\r\nas drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, terrorism and cybercrime,\r\nincluding child pornography. A new criminal landscape is emerging, marked\r\nincreasingly by highly mobile and flexible groups operating in multiple\r\njurisdictions and criminal sectors, and aided, in particular, by widespread,\r\nillicit use of the Internet. Member States cannot effectively combat these at\r\nnational level, so coordination and assistance become paramount. Eurojust is\r\nthe only EU agency that supports national judicial authorities to appropriately\r\ninvestigate and prosecute these cases.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe reinforcement of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a\r\ncrucial part of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. Eurojust's\r\nmission in facilitating coordination and cooperation is developed in the\r\ncontext of other legal instruments in the area such as the 2000 MLA Convention,\r\nthe Council Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant or the Council\r\nFramework Decision on conflicts of jurisdiction. Synergies with the rest of JHA\r\nagencies, in particular Europol, and the need to avoid duplication of tasks and\r\nenhance cooperation are to be borne in mind. Clear synergies will also be part\r\nof the cooperation between Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor's\r\noffice.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\nx Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[27] \nDirect management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\nby its departments, including by its staff in\r\nthe Union delegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \nX Indirect management by\r\ndelegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\nX bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of\r\nthe Financial Regulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments \nThis\r\nlegislative proposal aims at modernising the legal framework of Eurojust and\r\nstreamlining its functioning. \nIt has been\r\ndrafted with a spirit of budget neutrality. As a consequence, the financial\r\nprogramming of Eurojust which has been prepared for the period 2014-2020\r\nadopted by the Commission in July 2013 is valid for this legislative proposal.\nHowever,\r\nthere is a new element introduced by this Regulation which concerns the\r\nrelations with the European Public Prosecutor's office: as defined in this\r\nRegulation Eurojust would provide administrative support structures to the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor's Office, including finances, human resources, security and\r\nIT.\nIn\r\nparallel, Eurojust would not work anymore on the offences affecting the EU's\r\nfinancial interests which represent between 5 to 10% of the current caseload. Consequently\r\nposts can be moved within the agency to cover the support to the EPPO function.\r\n\nTherefore, the\r\nfinancial impact of this proposal is budget neutral and does not change the\r\ntotal of the posts mentioned in the financial programming for the period\r\n2014-2020.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nEach year the President of the Eurojust, on behalf of the College,\r\nshall forward the Annual report to the European Parliament on the work carried\r\nout by Eurojust, as well as information on working arrangements concluded with\r\nthird parties, and the annual report of the European Data Protection\r\nSupervisor.\nAn external independent evaluation of the implementation of the\r\nRegulation and the activities of Eurojust shall be commissioned by the\r\nCommission within five years after the Regulation takes effect, and every five\r\nyears thereafter.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nNo specific risks in management and control systems were identified\r\nat this stage.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\r\n\nEurojust is subject to administrative controls including budgetary\r\ncontrol, internal audit, annual reports by the European Court of Auditors and\r\nthe annual discharge for the execution of the EU budget. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nSpecify existing or\r\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nIn order to combat fraud, corruption and other\r\nunlawful activities, the provisions of Regulations (EC) N. 1073/1999 shall\r\napply without restrictions to the Agency. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Heading\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
