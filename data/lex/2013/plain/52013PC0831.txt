By letter dated 14\nOctober 2013, the Commission notified Poland that it had all the information\nnecessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nArticle 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC\nprovides that a taxable person is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on\npurchases made for the purpose of his taxed transactions. Paragraph 1\npoint (a) of Article 26 of that Directive requires the use of goods\nforming part of the assets of a business for non-business purposes to be a\nsupply of services for a consideration if the VAT on the purchase of those goods\nwas eligible for deduction. \nIn the case of motor vehicles, this system can\nbe difficult to apply for a number of reasons, notably because it is difficult\nto identify accurately the split between business and non-business use. Where\nrecords are kept, they add an additional burden to both the business and the\nadministration in maintaining and checking them. The number of vehicles\nconcerned means that even small-scale individual evasion has the capacity to\ngrow into significant sums.\nAs an alternative to the system set out in\nthe Directive, Poland has requested that it is allowed to limit the initial\ndeduction to a set percentage and in turn relieve businesses from accounting\nfor VAT on the private use. This has the benefit of simplifying the system for\nall concerned and ensuring that a percentage of the tax, which might have\notherwise been evaded, is collected.\nThe percentage restriction requested is\n50%. This is based on Poland's own assessment and, under the terms of the\nproposal, would be reviewed upon any request by Poland for extension beyond\n2016.\nPoland is currently authorised on the basis\nof Council Implementing Decision 2010/581/EU[1]\nto restrict to 60 % the right to deduct VAT on the purchase, intra-Community\nacquisition, import, hire or lease of certain motor vehicles other than\npassenger cars, up to a maximum of PLN 6 000. That Decision shall\nexpire on 31 December 2013.\nThe new restriction to the right of\ndeduction will apply as from 1 January 2014 to motor vehicles used by\na taxable person not exclusively for business purposes. However, certain types\nof motor vehicles would be excluded from that restriction and would therefore\nbe subject to the normal rules, namely any vehicle with more than 9 seats\n(including the driver's) and with a total maximum weight of more than 3 500 kilograms.\nThis mainly restricts the field of application to passenger cars, vans,\npick-ups and motorbikes.\nThe restriction also applies to VAT charged\non any expenditure, including purchase of fuel, related to motor vehicles\ncovered by this special measure, provided that the expenditure is not entirely\nrelated to the taxable persons\u2019 business, which is e.g. the case with the\ninstallation of taximeters.\nDerogations are normally granted for a\nlimited time as to allow an assessment whether the special measure is\nappropriate and effective. Any extension should therefore be limited in time in\norder to assess whether the conditions, on which the derogation is based, would\nstill be valid. Poland has requested authorisation to apply the special measure\nsubject to this proposal until 31 December 2018. \nIt is however common practice to grant a\nthree year period in similar cases (see e.g. Council Implementing Decisions\n2012/232/EU[2]\nand 2013/191/EU[3]).\nTherefore, it is proposed that this decision shall expire by the end of 2016\nand to request Poland to present a report by 1 April 2016 including a\nreview of the percentage restriction applied in case a further extension would\nbe envisaged beyond 2016.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\nproposal\nArticle 176 of Directive 2006/112/EC\nstipulates that the Council shall determine the expenditure on which the VAT is\nnot deductible. Until such time, it authorises Member States to maintain exclusions,\nwhich were in place on 1 January 1979. There are therefore a number\nof \"stand still\" provisions restricting the right to deduct in\nrelation to motor vehicles.\nIn 2004, the Commission made a proposal to\n- inter alia - establish rules on which categories of expenditure may be\nsubject to a restriction on the right to deduct (COM(2004) 728 final[4]). The Council has not yet\nreached an agreement on that proposal.\nConsistency\nwith other policies and objectives of the Union \nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposal is designed to counter VAT\nevasion and to simplify the procedure for charging tax and has, therefore, a\npotential positive impact for both businesses and administrations. The solution\nhas been identified by Poland as a suitable measure and is comparable to other\npast and present derogations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal aims to authorise Poland to\napply a measure derogating from Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC so as to\nrestrict the right of a taxable person to deduct VAT on the purchase, hire,\nrent or lease of certain motorised road vehicles and expenditure related\nthereto when the vehicle is not used exclusively for business purposes and the\nexpenditure is not entirely related to the taxable person\u2019s business. Where the\nright to deduct has been limited, a derogation from point (a) of\nparagraph 1 of Article 26 of Directive 2006/112/EC will relieve the\ntaxable person from accounting for tax on the non-business use of that vehicle.\nThe measure is restricted to vehicles under a certain seating capacity and\nunder a certain total weight.\nThe restriction is set at a flat rate of\n50%. This rate and the necessity for the derogating measures are to be reviewed\nand reported on by Poland upon any request for an extension. The Decision will apply\nuntil the earlier of the date specified in the Decision or the date on which\nUnion rules come into force governing restrictions on the right to deduct in\nthis area.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of Council Directive\n2006/112/EC.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle as this Decision concerns an authorisation granted to\na Member State on its own request and does not constitute any obligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Implementing Decision.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason(s):\nUnder Article 395 of Council Directive\n2006/112/EC, a derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible upon\nauthorisation of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the\nCommission. A Council Implementing Decision is the most suitable instrument\nsince it can be addressed to an individual Member State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal will not adversely affect the European\nUnion\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThe proposal includes a review clause and a\nsunset clause.\n2013/0411 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising Poland to introduce measures derogating\nfrom Articles 26(1)(a) and 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of\nvalue added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Directive\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[5], and in particular paragraph 1\nof Article 395 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered with\nthe Commission on 18 June 2013, Poland requested authorisation to\nintroduce special measures concerning certain motorised road vehicles and\nexpenditure related thereto, derogating from those provisions laid down in\nDirective 2006/112/EC which govern a taxable person's right to deduct VAT paid on\nthe purchase of goods and services and those which require tax to be accounted\nfor on business assets used for non-business purposes.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nsecond subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Article 395 of Directive\n2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request\nmade by Poland by letter dated 10 October 2013. By letter dated 14 October 2013,\nthe Commission notified Poland that it had all the information necessary to\nconsider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 168 of\nDirective 2006/112/EC establishes a taxable person's right to deduct VAT\ncharged on supplies of goods and services received by him for the purposes of\nhis taxed transactions. Point (a) of paragraph 1 of Article 26\nof that Directive contains a requirement to account for VAT when a business\nasset is put to use for the private purposes of the taxable person or his staff\nor, more generally, for purposes other than those of his business.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measure requested by\nPoland deviates from those provisions so as to restrict the right to deduct VAT\non the purchase, hire, rent or lease of certain motorised road vehicles and\nexpenditure related thereto and to relieve the taxable person from accounting\nfor VAT on the non-business use of vehicles covered by the restriction.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-business use of motor\nvehicles is difficult to identify accurately and even where it is possible, the\nmechanism for doing so is often burdensome. Under the requested measures, the\namount of VAT on expenditure eligible for deduction concerning motor vehicles,\nwhich are not used entirely for business purposes should, with some exceptions,\nbe set at a flat percentage rate. Based on currently available information, Poland believes that a rate of 50% is justifiable. At the same time, to avoid double\ntaxation, the requirement for accounting for VAT on the non-business use of a\nmotor vehicle should be suspended where it has been subject to this\nrestriction. These measures can be justified by the need to simplify the\nprocedure for charging VAT and to prevent evasion through incorrect record\nkeeping and false tax declaration.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The restriction to the\nright of deduction under the special measures should apply to VAT paid on the\npurchase, intra-Community acquisition, importation, hire or leasing of\nspecified motorised road vehicles and on expenditure related thereto, including\nthe purchase of fuel.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain types of motor\nvehicles should be excluded from the scope of the special measures as - due to\ntheir nature or the type of business they are used for - any non-business use\nis considered as negligible. Therefore, the special measures should not apply\nto vehicles with more than 9 seats (including the driver's) and with a\ntotal maximum weight of more than 3 500 kilograms. In addition, the\nrestriction to the right of deduction shall not apply to VAT charged on any\nexpenditure that is entirely related to the taxable person\u2019s business.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These derogating measures\nshould be limited in time to allow for an evaluation of their effectiveness and\nof the appropriate percentage, since the proposed percentage is based on\ninitial findings regarding business use.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Poland considers a further extension of the derogating measures beyond 2016 is necessary, a report\non the application of the measures in question, which includes a review of the\npercentage applied, should be submitted to the Commission together with the\nextension request no later than 1 April 2016.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2004, the\nCommission adopted a proposal[6]\nfor a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC, now Directive\n2006/112/EC that includes the harmonisation of the categories of expenses for\nwhich exclusions from the right of deduction may apply. Under that proposal,\nexclusions from the right to deduct could be applied to motorised road\nvehicles. The derogating measures provided for in this Decision should expire\non the date of the entry into force of such an amending Directive, if that date\nis earlier than the date of expiry provided for in this Decision.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation will only\nhave a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax collected at the stage of\nfinal consumption and will not adversely affect the European Union\u2019s own\nresources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 168 of\nDirective 2006/112/EC, Poland is hereby authorised to limit to 50% the right to\ndeduct the VAT on the purchase, intra-Community acquisition, importation, hire\nor leasing of motorised road vehicles as well as the VAT charged on expenditure\nrelated to those vehicles, where the vehicle is not entirely used for business\npurposes.\nThe restriction set out in the first subparagraph\nshall not apply to motor vehicles with a total maximum weight of more than\n3 500 kilograms or motor vehicles with more than nine seats including\nthe driver's seat.\nThe restriction set out in the first subparagraph\nshall not apply to VAT charged on any expenditure that is entirely related to\nthe taxable person\u2019s business.\nArticle 2\nBy way of derogation from point (a) of\nparagraph 1 of Article 26 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Poland is\nauthorised not to treat as a supply of services for consideration the private\nuse by a taxable person or his staff or, more generally, for purposes other\nthan those of his business, of a vehicle to which the restriction referred to\nin Article 1 of this Decision applies.\nArticle 3\n1. This Decision shall take effect on the\nday of its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply as of\n1 January 2014. It shall expire on the date of entry into force of\nUnion rules determining the expenditure relating to motorised road vehicles\nthat is not eligible for full deduction of VAT, or on 31 December 2016,\nwhichever is the earlier.\n2. Any request for the extension of the\nmeasures provided for in this Decision shall be submitted to the Commission no\nlater than 1 April 2016. Such request shall be accompanied by a\nreport which includes a review of the percentage restriction applied on the\nright to deduct VAT on the basis of this Decision.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of   Poland.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision of 27 September 2010 authorising\nthe Republic of Poland to introduce a special measure derogating from Article\n26(1)(a) and Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value\nadded tax, OJ L 256, 30.9.2010, p. 24\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision of 26 April 2012\nauthorising Romania to apply measures derogating from Article 26(1)(a) and\nArticle 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, OJ\nL 117, 1.5.2012, p. 7\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision of 22 April 2013 authorising\nLatvia to introduce a special measure derogating from point (a) of Article\n26(1) and Articles 168 and 168a of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system\nof value added tax, OJ L 113, 25.4.2013, p. 11\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2004/com2004_0728en01.pdf\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347 11.12.2006, p.1.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM (2004) 728 final (OJ C 24, 29.1.2005, p.10)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
