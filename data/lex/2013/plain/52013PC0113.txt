The Treaty\nconcerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union[1] was signed by all Member States\nof the European Union and the Republic of Croatia at Brussels on 9 December\n2011. Article 3(3) of the Treaty of Accession provides that it shall enter into\nforce on 1 July 2013 provided that all the instruments of ratification have\nbeen deposited before that date.\nArticle 3(4) of the Treaty of Accession of the Republic of Croatia enables the institutions of the Union to adopt before accession measures\nreferred to, inter alia, in Article 50 of the Act concerning the conditions of\naccession of the Republic of Croatia[2].\nThese measures shall enter into force only subject to and on the date of the\nentry into force of the Treaty of Accession.\nArticle 50 of the Act of Accession provides that where acts of the institutions adopted prior to\naccession require adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary\nadaptations have not been provided for in that Act or its Annexes, the Council\nor the Commission (if the original acts were adopted by the Commission) shall\nadopt the necessary acts. \nThe present proposal covers Directive\n2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 October 2012 on\nenergy efficiency which requires technical adaptation by reason of the\naccession of Croatia. \nThe energy consumption figures for 2020 given\nin the energy efficiency Directive cover the EU27. With the accession of Croatia, the energy consumption figures are updated to take into account 28 countries. As\nthis is based on the same underlying energy model figures, this can be\nconsidered a technical adaptation. \nThe present proposal remains outside the\npackage of proposals COM(2013) 51\nto COM(2013) 63 which the Commission transmitted to the Council on 8 February 2013.\nThe package of proposals COM(2013) 51 to COM(2013) 63 covered\nonly technical adaptations to the acquis which were published in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union up to and including 1 September 2012.\nDirective 2012/27/EU[3] requires Member States to set\nindicative national energy efficiency targets, and in so doing the Member\nStates should take into account the Union's 2020 energy consumption[4]. Due to the accession of Croatia it is necessary to technically adapt the projected energy consumption figures for\nthe European Union in 2020 to reflect the EU 28. Projections\nmade in 2007 showed a primary energy consumption in 2020 of 1842 Mtoe for the\n27 Member States of the EU. The same projections show a primary energy\nconsumption in 2020 of 1853 Mtoe for the EU 28 including Croatia. A 20 % reduction results in 1483 Mtoe in 2020, i.e. a reduction of 370 Mtoe as\ncompared to projections. This purely technical adaptation is necessary to allow\nDirective 2012/27/EU to be applicable in Croatia.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs this proposal is of a purely technical\nnature and does not involve any political choices, consultations with\ninterested parties or impact assessments would not have made sense.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article 50\nof the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia.\nThe principles of subsidiarity and\nproportionality are fully respected. The action of the Union is necessary under\nthe principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 (3) TEU) because it concerns technical\nadaptations to legal acts which were enacted by the Union. The proposal\nrespects the principle of proportionality (Article 5 (4) TEU) because it does\nnot go beyond what is necessary to reach the objective pursued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no budgetary implications. \n2013/0068 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nadapting Directive 2012/27/EU on energy\nefficiency, by reason of the accession of Croatia\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Treaty of Accession of\nthe Republic of Croatia, and in particular Article 3(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of\nthe Republic of Croatia, and in particular Article 50 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 50 of\nthe Act of Accession, where acts of the institutions adopted prior to accession\nrequire adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary adaptations have\nnot been provided for in the Act of Accession or its Annexes, the Council,\nacting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall, to this\nend, adopt the necessary acts, if the original act was not adopted by the\nCommission.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2012/27/EU[5] of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency and amending Directives\n2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC requires\nMember States to set indicative national energy efficiency targets, and in so\ndoing the Member States should take into account the Union's 2020 energy\nconsumption[6].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the accession of Croatia it is necessary to technically adapt the projected energy consumption figures for\nthe European Union in 2020 to reflect the EU 28.
