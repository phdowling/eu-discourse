Specifically, the authorisation concerned an agreement between\r\nFrance, acting for Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, and the Union that provided, for that\r\nterritory, for the application of the Union legislation on taxation of savings\r\nand administrative cooperation in the field of taxation.\nThe negotiating directives annexed to the\r\nCouncil\u2019s decision laid down, in particular, that:\n- the objective was to conclude an agreement\r\nproviding for the application to Saint\u2011Barth\u00e9lemy of the mechanisms of\r\nCouncil Directive 77/799/EEC[1]\r\nand Council Directive 2011/16/EU[2]\r\non administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and of Council Directive\r\n2003/48/EC[3]\r\non taxation of savings income. To do this, further legislative developments in\r\nthese areas should be taken into account so that the arrangements applicable to\r\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy would be equivalent to those applicable in mainland France; \n- the agreement had to cover the arrangements\r\nprovided for in the Directives referred to above. On the question of the\r\ntaxation of savings, it had to cover interest payments, as defined in\r\nArticle 6 of Council Directive 2003/48/EC and any amendments, made by paying\r\nagents established in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy to beneficial owners resident in the EU;\n- the agreement was to be concluded for an\r\nindefinite period of time.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES\nActing on this authorisation, the European\r\nCommission drew up a draft agreement, on which negotiations were conducted with\r\nFrance in 2012 and early 2013.\nThe draft agreement was also discussed in the\r\nEU Council\u2019s Working Party on Tax Questions and no Member State entered any\r\nreservation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for this proposal is provided\r\nby Articles 113 and 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, in conjunction with Article 218(5) and (8) second subparagraph. The\r\nsubstantive legal basis is provided by Articles 113 and 115 TFEU. In\r\nfact, the measure is designed to extend the mechanisms of Directives 2011/16/EU\r\nand 2003/48/EC, which are based on these two articles, to relations between the\r\nMember States and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy. \nAccording to Article 1 of\r\nthe agreement, its purpose is to ensure the application to Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy of\r\nthe tax provisions of:\n- Council Directive 2011/16/EU, which repealed\r\nDirective 77/799/EEC from 1 January 2013, \n- Council Directive 2003/48/EC,\n- and any related acts.\nThe provisions of Article 1(3)\r\nand Article 2 render the agreement dynamic. It covers not\r\nonly future amendments to the two Directives but also any current or future\r\ndelegated and implementing acts[4].\r\nThis is needed to ensure identical treatment at all times in situations within\r\nthe European Union and between the Member States and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.\nArticle 3 provides that the competent authorities are central liaison\r\noffices, liaison departments and competent officials so as to ensure\r\nconsistency with any national measures transposing Council Directives\r\n2011/16/EU and 2003/48/EC which have been taken, or will be taken, by Member\r\nStates.\nStatistics and information concerning the\r\napplication of the agreement to the collectivity of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy will be\r\nsubmitted to the Commission by France (Article 4).\nProvision is made for the settlement of\r\ndisputes as follows:\n- a mutual agreement procedure between the\r\ncompetent authorities of only the Member States concerned where implementation\r\nor interpretation of the agreement leads to problems or raises issues between\r\nthese competent authorities (Article 5). The European\r\nCommission will be informed of the results of this conciliation procedure,\r\nafter which it must inform the other Member States. Where there are issues of\r\ninterpretation, the European Commission may take part in the consultations at\r\nthe request of any of the competent authorities;\n- in the event of a dispute between the parties\r\non the interpretation or application of the agreement, they must meet with the\r\nCommission before any referral to the Court of Justice (Article 6).\r\nThe Court has sole jurisdiction to judge such disputes.\nThe formalities for the agreement\u2019s entry into\r\nforce are set out in Article 7.\nIn keeping with the negotiating directives, Article 8\r\nprovides that the agreement is concluded for an indefinite period, offering the\r\nparties the possibility of termination through diplomatic channels.\n2013/0270 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signature, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, of the agreement between the European Union and the French\r\nRepublic concerning the application to the collectivity of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy of\r\nUnion legislation on the taxation of savings and administrative cooperation in\r\nthe field of taxation\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nfunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 113 and 115, in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(5) and (8), second paragraph thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the terms of\r\nEuropean Council Decision 2010/718/EU of 29 October 2010 amending the\r\nstatus of the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy with regard to the European Union[5], the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy\r\nceased to be an outermost region of the Union with effect from 1 January 2012\r\nand gained the status of overseas country or territory referred to in Part Four\r\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
