Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be\nan overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of\nArticles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January\n2014.\nThis proposal takes account of requests made\nby the French authorities, to have the Union acquis amended through specific\nmeasures applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as fisheries and animal\nhealth. \nThe examination of the situation regarding\nMayotte has revealed that it is necessary to protect the sensitive biological\nsituation of its waters and therefore to include the waters around Mayotte\nwithin the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998\nfor the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the\nprotection of juveniles of marine organism. . In certain respects, France needs additional time to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte. This\ngoes in particular to the registering and control obligations in the area of\nfisheries, to the extent it concerns certain vessels dispersed around the\nisland and not associated to a specific landing site. \nIn the area of animal health, it appears\njustified to grant additional time to comply with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down\nhealth rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended\nfor human consumption and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, since Mayotte\nhas currently no industrial capacity for the processing of animal by-products. \nIn the interest of simplicity and speediness,\nit has been considered expedient not to resort to individual proposals for each\nof the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle the amendments to\nseveral acts in a single proposal. The amendments proposed in the present\ndocument all relate to Regulations and fall under the ordinary legislative\nprocedure (Articles 289(1) and 294 TFEU). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission has not used an impact assessment. However, when\nexamining the various issues and in particular the requests made by France, it had contacts with representatives of national and regional authorities in order\nto better evaluate the grounds of the specific measures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nIn accordance with Article 43(2) TFEU, the European Parliament and\nthe Council are empowered to define the provisions necessary for the pursuit of\nthe objectives of the common fisheries policy. \nUnder this legal basis, it is proposed to amend four Council\nRegulations in the areas of fisheries, having regard to the particular\nsituation of Mayotte as summarised above and set out in detail in the draft\nrecitals:\n- Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30\nMarch 1998 in order to include the waters around Mayotte and to prohibit the\nuse of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the area\nwithin 24 miles from the baselines of the island in order to preserve the\nshoals of large migratory fish in the vicinity of the island of Mayotte;\n- Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17\nDecember 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and\naquaculture products\n- Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of\n20 December 2002 in order to introduce specific measures with respect to the\nfleet register and the access regime; \n- Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 of 30\nMarch 2004 in order to introduce the development plan presented by France to\nthe Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) as a reference for the capacity of the\nfleet registered in the ports of Mayotte and to allow France to increase its\nfleet up to the objectives of the said development plan;\n- Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of\n20 November 2009 in order to provide for transitional measures and temporary\nderogations from certain rules concerning the control of fishing vessels in\nview of progressively comply with all the Union control obligations and\nobjectives of that Regulation.\nPursuant to Article 168(4)(b) TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council\nare entitled to adopt measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which\nhave as their direct objective the protection of public health. \nUnder this legal basis, it is proposed to modify Regulation (EC) No\n1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 in\norder to grant France a transitional period of five years with regard to Mayotte, allowing it to establish the infrastructure necessary for the identification,\nhandling, transport, treatment and disposal of animal by-products. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no impact on the budget of\nthe European Union.\n2013/0191 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending certain Regulations in the field\nof fisheries and animal health by reason of the change of status of Mayotte\nwith regard to the Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and Article\n168(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2012/419/EU[3], the European Council amended\nthe status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014.\nTherefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory to\nbecome an outermost region within the meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU.\nUnion law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. It is\nappropriate to provide for certain specific measures justified by the\nparticular situation of Mayotte in a number of areas.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the field of fisheries\nand animal health, the following Regulations should be amended. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Council\nRegulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery\nresources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine\norganism[4],\nthe waters around Mayotte should be included within the scope of that\nRegulation and the use of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish\ninside the area within 24 miles from the baselines of the island should be\nprohibited in order to preserve the shoals of large migratory fish in the\nvicinity of the island of Mayotte.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Council\nRegulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of\nthe markets in fishery and aquaculture products[5],\nin view of the very fragmented and under-developed marketing schemes of\nMayotte, the application of the rules on the labelling of fishery products\nwould impose on retailers a burden that is disproportionate to the information\nthat will be transmitted to the consumer. It is therefore appropriate to\nprovide for a temporary derogation from the rules concerning the labelling of\nfishery products offered for retail sale to the final consumer in Mayotte. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Council\nRegulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and\nsustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries\nPolicy[6],\nspecific measures should be introduced with respect to the fleet register and\nthe access regime.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, an important part\nof the fleet flying the flag of France and operating from the French Department\nof Mayotte is composed by vessels of less than 9 meters which are dispersed\naround the island, have no specific landing sites and still need to be\nidentified, measured and equipped with minimum safety implements in order to be\nincluded in the register of Union fishing vessels; as a consequence, France\nwill not be able to complete this register until 31 December 2016. France should, however, install a provisional fleet register guaranteeing minimum\nidentification of the vessels of this segment in order to avoid proliferation\nof informal fishing vessels.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, it is necessary\nfor the protection of the sensitive biological situation of the waters around Mayotte and the preservation of the local economy of that island, having regard to its\nstructural, social and economic situation, to limit certain fishing activities\nin those waters to vessels registered in the ports of that island.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Council\nRegulation (EC) No 639/2004 of 30 March 2004 on the management of fishing\nfleets registered in the Community outermost regions[7], a particular feature of Mayotte is that no objective has been set for its fleet under Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002\nwhich refers to the Multiannual Guidance Programme 1997-2002. From the\npoint of view of conservation of fish resources, it is appropriate to freeze\nthe fishing capacity of the fleets at current levels, especially for the\nsegment of large vessels with a great fishing capacity. However, for smaller\nvessels, in view of the fact that France presented to the Indian Ocean Tuna\nCommission (IOTC) a development plan indicating the expected evolution of the\nfleet based in Mayotte, to which no IOTC contracting party, including the\nUnion, has objected, it is appropriate to use the objectives of that plan as\nreference levels for the capacity of the fleet registered in the ports of\nMayotte and to allow France to increase its fleet up to the objectives of its\ndevelopment plan.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Regulation (EC)\nNo 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009\nlaying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not\nintended for human consumption and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002[8], it should be noted that Mayotte has no industrial capacity for the processing of animal by-products. It is\ntherefore appropriate to allow France a period of five years in order to\nestablish the infrastructure necessary for the identification, handling,\ntransport, treatment and disposal of animal by-products in Mayotte in full\ncompliance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community\ncontrol system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries\npolicy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No\n811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No\n388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No\n1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC)\nNo 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006[9]\n, it appears that France will not be in a position to comply with all Union\ncontrol obligations for the segment \"Mayotte. Pelagic and demersal\nspecies. Length < 9m\" of the fleet of Mayotte by the date on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region. The vessels of that segment, dispersed around the\nisland, have no specific landing sites and still need to be identified. In\naddition, it is necessary to train fishermen and controllers and to set up the\nappropriate administrative and physical infrastructure. It is therefore\nnecessary to provide for a temporary derogation from certain rules concerning\nthe control of fishing vessels and their characteristics, their activities at\nsea, their gear and their catches at all stages from the vessel to the market\nin respect of that segment of the fleet. However, in order to attain at least\nsome of the most important objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, France should establish a national control system allowing it to control and monitor the activities\nof that segment of the fleet and to comply with the international reporting\nobligations of the Union.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulations (EC) No 850/98,\n(EC) No 104/2000, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 639/2004, (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC)\nNo 1224/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 850/98\nRegulation (EC) No 850/98 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)                   \nIn Article 2(1), point (h) is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\"(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Region 8:\nAll waters off the coasts of the French\ndepartments of R\u00e9union and Mayotte that come under the sovereignty or\njurisdiction of France.\";\n(2)                   \nThe following Article 34a is inserted after\nArticle 34:\n\"Article 34a\nRestrictions on fishing activities in\nthe 24-mile zone around the island of Mayotte\nVessels shall be prohibited from using any\npurse-seine on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the areas within 24\nmiles of the coasts of the island of Mayotte, measured from the baselines from\nwhich territorial waters are measured.\"\nArticle 2\nAmendment to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000\nIn Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No\n104/2000, the following paragraph 3a is inserted after paragraph 3:\n\"3a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until 16 December 2016,\nparagraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to products offered for retail sale to\nthe final consumer in Mayotte.\"\nArticle 3\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002\nRegulation (EC) No 2371/2002 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)                   \nIn Article 15, the following paragraphs 5 and 6\nare added:\n\u201c5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from paragraph 1,\n France shall be exempted until 31 December 2016 from the obligation to include\nin its register of Union fishing vessels those vessels which are less than 9\nmeters in overall length and operate from Mayotte. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until 31 December 2016, France shall keep a provisional register of fishing vessels which are less than 9 meters in overall\nlength and operate from Mayotte. That register shall contain, for each vessel,\nat least its name, its overall length and an identification code.\u201d\n(2)                   \nThe following Article 18a is inserted after\nArticle 18:\n\"Article 18a\nMayotte\nBy way of derogation from Article 17, in\nthe waters up to 100 nautical miles from the baselines of Mayotte, France may\nrestrict fishing to fishing vessels registered in the ports of Mayotte, either\nin the register of Union vessels or in the provisional register referred to in\nArticle 15(6), except for Union vessels that, within the two years preceding 1\nJanuary 2014, fished in those waters for at least 40 days insofar as they do\nnot exceed the fishing effort traditionally exerted.\"\nArticle 4\nAmendment to Regulation (EC) No 639/2004\nIn Regulation (EC) No 639/2004, the\nfollowing Article 1a is inserted after Article 1:\n\u201cArticle 1a\nFleet of Mayotte\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\nArticle 1(1)(a), the reference levels for fishing vessels registered in the\nports of Mayotte, either in the register of Union vessels or in the provisional\nregister referred to in Article 15(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, shall be\nthe capacity of that fleet at 31 December 2013. \nHowever, for fishing vessels which are between\n8 and 12 meters in overall length and use longlines and fishing vessels\nwhich are less than 9 meters in overall length, the reference level shall be\nthe capacity foreseen in the development plan presented by France to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission on 7 January 2011.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from\nArticle 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, France shall be authorised to\nintroduce new capacity in the fleet segments defined for fishing vessels which\nare between 8 and 12 meters in overall length and use longlines and fishing\nvessels which are less than 9 meters in overall length without the withdrawal\nof an equivalent capacity.\u201d\nArticle 5\nAmendment to Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009\nIn Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, Article 56\nis replaced by the following: \n\"Article 56 \nEntry into force \nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal\nof the European Union. \nIt shall apply from 4 March 2011. \nHowever, Article 4 shall apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2019.
