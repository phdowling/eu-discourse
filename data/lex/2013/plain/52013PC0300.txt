NECA\nprovisions will enter into force in 2016, and will apply only to ships built\nafter that date entering a NECA.\nAs part of the NECA submission preparation,\nHELCOM performed a comprehensive analysis to estimate NOx emissions from ships\noperating in the Baltic and their impact.\nThe designation of the Baltic Sea as a NECA\nis expected to result in a reduction of 16% of NOx emissions from shipping in\n2020 and 46% in 2030. It is expected that all ships will meet NECA requirements\nin the Baltic only around 2040-50, with a third equipped by 2030. The costs and\nbenefits of the Baltic Sea NECA will therefore accrue gradually, due to the\nrelatively slow replacement rate of ships, which varies by vessel type. \nThe Baltic NECA will be an important\ncontribution to the reduction of air pollution, especially as several Member\nStates in the Baltic Sea region do not meet the emission standards set by the\nAmbient Air Quality Directive. It will in addition result in health benefits and\nreduced eutrophication, one of the major environmental challenges faced by the Baltic Sea, as well as a diminished acidification and ozone formation.\nInvestment costs are mitigated due to some ship-owners\nhaving already opted to equip their new ships with NECA compliant engines to\nenable their ships to enter the North American NECA. In these cases, only\nadditional operating costs arise, and will result a in a gradual increase, until\n2040-50, of costs of maritime transport in the Baltic Sea. \nFurther information on the costs and\nbenefits of the Baltic Sea NECA for the EU stems from the Impact Assessment\naccompanying the Commission's 2010 proposal for the revision of Directive\n1999/32 as regards sulphur content in marine fuels[1].\nAccording to this document, benefits associated with full IMO compliance are at\nleast between \u20ac3 and \u20ac13 for every \u20ac1 spent[2].\nThe benefit/cost ratio associated with the designation\nof the Baltic Sea as Emission Control Area is considered highly favourable. \nAvailable technologies to reduce NOx\nemissions from shipping are exhaust gas recycling (EGR), LNG and specific\ncatalytic reduction (SCR). \n2. Developments to Date\nIn 2010, the Ministerial meeting of the\nHelsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic\nSea Area (HELCOM) decided to \"work towards submitting, preferably by 2011,\na joint proposal by the Baltic Sea countries to the IMO applying for a NOx\nEmission Control Area (NECA) for the Baltic Sea\". \nIn its meeting of 9-10 March 2011, the\nBaltic Marine Environment Protection Commission agreed that the Baltic Sea should be designated as a NECA. It noted however that some parties were not yet\nready to take an immediate decision.\nIn its meeting of 6-7 March 2012, the\nBaltic Marine Environment Protection Commission agreed that the NECA\napplication prepared in HELCOM fulfilled the IMO criteria. \nIn their meeting of 14-15 June 2012 the\nHeads of Delegation of HELCOM stressed that the only decision remaining was the\ntiming of the submission to IMO.\nIn their meeting on 3-4 December 2012, the\nHeads of Delegation of HELCOM decided to organise a stakeholders meeting on the\nBaltic NECA application on 4 March 2013. They agreed that the final date of\nsubmission to IMO was to be taken prior to the October 2013 Ministerial\nMeeting. They agreed to report to the Ministers accordingly. A stakeholder\nmeeting specifically targeted at the Baltic Sea shipping industry took place on\nMarch 4, 2013.\nOnce the date of submission has been agreed\nin HELCOM, the NECA submission will be transmitted for adoption to the IMO\nMarine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) by Baltic riparian States. IMO\nwill then examine whether the requirements of a NOx Control Area under Annex VI\nof MARPOL are fulfilled. If so, the Baltic NECA will be agreed. However, no\nsubstantive discussion will take place at MEPC.\n3. EU POSITION\nThe EU has supported in principle the\ndesignation of the Baltic Sea as a NECA, as agreed in the Council Shipping\nWorking Party of 7 November 2011. The Working Party also considered that the\ndesignation of the Baltic Sea as a NECA was the most cost efficient measure to\nreduce NOx emissions, to meet ambient air quality standards and good\nenvironmental status regarding eutrophication as required under the Marine\nStrategy Framework Directive. It noted the request by the Shipping Working\nParty of 8th November 2010 for a detailed impact assessment,\nrecognised that the further developed draft IMO submission for designing the\nBaltic Sea as a NECA included some elements on the risk of modal backshift but that\nin principle, a cost benefit analysis is not required by IMO when applying for\nan emission Control Area and that the economic analysis made in the application\nwas sufficient to meet IMO requirements. On 17 October 2012, the shipping\nWorking Party also took note of the progress on the Baltic Sea NECA and further\nnoted that in case that IMO designates the Baltic Sea as a NECA, the Commission\nwill assess the need to transpose this provision into EU legislation, and that\nthis decision process might require further impact analysis.\nIt is now necessary for the Council to\nadopt the position to be expressed by the EU on the date at which the Baltic\nNECA submission will be transmitted to the MEPC, in line with article 218 (9)\nTFEU, before the next meeting of the HELCOM Heads of Delegation on 17 June\n2013.\nThe applicable IMO rules[3] foresee that NECA rules will\napply as of 2016, independent of the date of submission of a proposal to\ndesignate an area as NECA. A rapid submission is therefore in the interest of the\nshipping industry and engine manufacturers, which need sufficient lead time to\nadapt and avoid possible higher retrofitting costs. .\nIn view of the above, the Union should\nsupport the submission to IMO of the HELCOM proposal to designate the Baltic\nSea as an Emission Control Area for Nitrogen Oxide, by Baltic Sea riparian\nstates at the latest by the 66th meeting of the IMO Marine Environment\nProtection Committee in March 2014. It is therefore necessary for the Council\nto also adopt the Union's position to be expressed by the EU Member States in\nIMO, in line with Article 218(9) TFEU.\n2013/0153 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken in\nHELCOM and IMO concerning the designation on the Baltic Sea as Nitrogen Oxyde\nEmissions Control Area (NECA)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 191,\nin conjunction with Article 218 (9), thereof,\nHaving regard to the\nproposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International Maritime\nOrganisation (IMO) and its International Convention for\nthe Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL, Annex VI) provide for the possibility\nto designate, at the request of the riparian states concerned, emission control\nareas (NECAs) in order to prevent, reduce and control emissions of Nitrogen\nOxide (NOx) from ships.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is a\nparty to the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the\nBaltic Sea Area (HELCOM) which is the forum discussing the submission of a\nproposal for the Baltic Sea as NOx Emissions Control Area to IMO. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preparatory work has been\nundertaken under the auspices of HELCOM with regard to a draft submission to\nthe IMO proposing the designation of a NECA in the Baltic Sea. Once the date of\na NECA submission has been agreed in HELCOM, it will be transmitted for\nadoption to the IMO Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) by the Baltic\nriparian states. IMO will then examine whether the requirements of a NOx\nControl Area under Annex VI of MARPOL are fulfilled. If so, the Baltic NECA\nwill be agreed. However, no substantive discussion will take place at MEPC.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU ambient air quality\ndirective 2008/50/EC and the NEC directive (2001/81/EC) set emission standards\nfor air pollutants. In particular, directive 2001/81/EC provides that the\nCommission and Member States, as appropriate, shall, without prejudice to\nArticle 218 of the TFEU, pursue bilateral and multilateral cooperation with\nthird countries and relevant international organisations such as the International\nMaritime Organization (IMO) with the aim of improving the basis for the\nfacilitation of emission reductions.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The HELCOM Baltic Sea\nMinisterial Declaration of 2010 agreed to designate the Baltic Sea NECA,\npreferably by 2011. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Shipping Working Party\nof 8th November 2010 requested a detailed impact assessment as it recognised\nthat the draft IMO submission for designing the Baltic Sea as a NECA included\nsome elements on the risk of modal backshift. However, it acknowledged that a\ncost benefit analysis similar to preparatory work for future EU legislation is\nnot required by IMO when applying for an Emission Control Area and that the\neconomic analysis made in the application was sufficient to meet IMO\nrequirements.In its meeting of 9-10 March 2011, the Baltic Marine Environment\nProtection Commission agreed that the Baltic Sea should be designated as a\nNECA. It noted however that some parties were not yet ready to take an\nimmediate decision.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its meeting of 6-7\nMarch 2012, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission agreed that the\nNECA application prepared in HELCOM fulfilled the IMO criteria. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In their meeting of 14-15\nJune 2012 the Heads of Delegation of HELCOM stressed that the only decision\nremaining was the timing of the submission to IMO.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In their meeting of 3-4\nDecember 2012, the Heads of Delegation of HELCOM agreed that the final date of\nsubmission to IMO was to be taken prior to the October 2013 Ministerial\nMeeting. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the decision is taken in\nHELCOM to submit a proposal to IMO to designate the Baltic Sea as an Emission\nControl Area for Nitrogen Oxide, the EU Member States should support the\nproposed designation of the Baltic Sea as an Emission control Area for Nitrogen\nOxide.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMO Tier III obligations\nfor NECA will enter into force as of 2016, it is important to give economic\noperators sufficient time to adapt.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position to be taken by the European\nUnion in HELCOM shall be to support the submission by the Baltic riparian\nStates to IMO of the HELCOM proposal to designate the Baltic Sea as an Emission\nControl Area for Nitrogen Oxide, at the latest by the 66th meeting of the IMO\nMarine Environment Protection Committee. \nArticle\n2\nFollowing adoption of\nthe decision in HELCOM referred to in Article 1, it shall be presented and\nsupported in the IMO by the Member States acting jointly in the interest of the\nEuropean Union\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SEC (2011) 919\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An ongoing study by DG ENV currently estimates cost\nbenefit ratios for the Baltic NECA in a range of \u20ac2.3 to \u20ac8.6 for every \u20ac1\nspent.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMO Revised MARPOL Annex VI, regulation 13.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
