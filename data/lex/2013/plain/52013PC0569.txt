The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed.   \n 3)      Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 19 June 2012, the Commission initiated an expiry review concerning the anti-dumping duties on imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand. The review was initiated following a substantiated request lodged by the Association Europ\u00e9enne des Transformateurs de Ma\u00efx Doux (AETMD) representing more than 50 % of the Union production of sweetcorn. The review investigation established a likelihood of continuation of dumping and recurrence of injury should the measures expire. It was further established that the continuation of measures would not be against the interest of the Union. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in order to prolong the existing measures, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 18 September 2013 at the latest. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n   || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n   || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instrument: Regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not foresee alternative options. \n 4)      Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0274 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\r\nimports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) and in particular Articles 9 and 11(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures in force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council, following an\r\nanti-dumping investigation ('the original investigation'), by Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 682/2007[2], imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain\r\nprepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels currently falling within CN codes ex\r\n2001 90 30 and ex 2005 80 00 originating in Thailand ('the definitive\r\nanti-dumping measures'). The measures took the form of an ad valorem\r\nduty ranging between 3,1 % and 12,9 %.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 954/2008[3] amended Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 with regard to the rate of duty\r\nimposed on one company and on \u2018all other companies\u2019. The amended duties range\r\nbetween 3,1 % and 14,3 %. Imports from two Thai exporting producers from whom\r\nundertakings had been accepted by Commission Decision 2007/424/EC[4] were exempted from the duty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council, by Regulation\r\n(EC) No 847/2009[5], considered that price undertakings with fixed minimum import\r\nprices were no longer appropriate to counteract the injurious effect of\r\ndumping. Consequently, the accepted undertakings were withdrawn and the undertaking\r\noffers by 10 other Thai exporting producers were rejected. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for an expiry review\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nthe publication of a notice of impending expiry[6] of the\r\ndefinitive anti-dumping measures in force, the Commission received on 19 March\r\n2012 a request for the initiation of an expiry review of these measures\r\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. The request was lodged by the Association Europ\u00e9enne des Transformateurs de Ma\u00efs Doux (AETMD)\r\n(\u2018the complainant\u2019) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of\r\nthe total Union production of prepared or preserved sweetcorn, in this case more than 50 %.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was based on\r\nthe grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a\r\ncontinuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation of an expiry review\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined, after\r\nconsulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the\r\ninitiation of an expiry review, the Commission announced on 19 June 2012,\r\nby a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union[7] ('the Notice of initiation'), the initiation of an expiry review\r\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period and\r\nperiod considered\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of a\r\ncontinuation of dumping covered the period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March\r\n2012 ('the review investigation period' or 'RIP'). The examination of the trends\r\nrelevant for the assessment of the likelihood of a continuation of injury covered\r\nthe period from 1 January 2008 to the end of the review investigation period ('the\r\nperiod considered').\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the proceeding\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\r\nadvised the applicants, the other known EU producers, the exporting producers\r\nin Thailand, the unrelated importers, the users known to be concerned, and the representatives\r\nof the exporting country of the initiation of the expiry review. Interested\r\nparties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to\r\nrequest a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of initiation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties,\r\nwho so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should\r\nbe heard, were granted a hearing. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent large number of exporting producers in Thailand and unrelated importers in the Union involved in the investigation, sampling was envisaged\r\nin the Notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic\r\nRegulation. In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would\r\nbe necessary and, if so, to select a sample, the above parties were requested\r\nto make themselves known to the Commission within 15 days of the initiation of\r\nthe review and to provide the Commission with the information requested in the\r\nNotice of Initiation. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regard to the selection\r\nof the sample of the exporting producers in Thailand, the Commission received\r\ncomplete information from 17 exporting producers, out of which 9 had exports to\r\nthe European Union during the RIP. It was decided to select a sample of 3\r\nexporting producers whose combined exports represented 90 % of the total\r\nquantities exported to the EU by the co-operating exporting producers during\r\nthe RIP.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that only one reply\r\nhas been received from an unrelated importer, sampling was not applied to\r\nunrelated importers. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the large number of Union producers involved in this\r\nproceeding, the Notice of initiation announced that the Commission had\r\nprovisionally selected a sample of Union producers for the determination of\r\ninjury in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. That\r\npre-selection had been made by using the information available to the\r\nCommission at initiation stage and it was based on the producers\u2019 sales volume,\r\nproduction volume and geographical location in the Union. The proposed sample\r\ncorresponds to the largest representative volume of production which could be\r\nreasonably investigated within the time available, representing 58 % of the\r\ntotal production of the Union industry. In addition, the proposed sample is\r\nrepresentative in terms of geographical location of the companies as it covers\r\nthree different Member States. EU producers have been consulted about the\r\nproposed sample on the date of publication of the Notice of initiation. Given\r\nthat no additional producers came forward and no comments were received on the\r\nsample, the proposed sample has been confirmed.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\r\ninterested parties claimed that the sample of Union producers has only been\r\nselected among applicants and that an effort should have been made to sample\r\nproducers outside the group of applicants.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\r\nall known EU producers, both applicants as well as non-applicants, have been\r\ninvited to co-operate. Ten Union producers, both applicants and non-applicants,\r\nhave submitted sampling information. As explained in recital (13), the selected\r\nsample corresponds to the largest representative volume of production which\r\ncould be reasonably investigated within the time available, representing 58 %\r\nof the total production of the Union industry, and the Commission considers\r\nthat it is representative in terms of geographical location, irrespective of\r\nwhether the producers are applicant or not. Therefore, the claim is rejected. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\r\nverified all the information deemed necessary for a determination of the\r\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping, resulting injury and of\r\nthe Union interest. To this end, the Commission sent questionnaires to the\r\nexporting producers and Union producers selected in the sample and to the\r\nunrelated importer. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the\r\nfollowing companies:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Producers in the Union:\n\u2013              \r\nBonduelle Conserve International SAS, Renescure, France,\n\u2013              \r\nCompagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Conserve France SA, Theix, France\n\u2013              \r\nCompagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Conserve Hungary, Debrecen, Hungary\n\u2013              \r\nConserve Italia SCA, San Lazzaro di Savena, Italy;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exporting\r\nproducers in Thailand:\n\u2013              \r\nAgri Sol., Ltd., Pathumthani City\n\u2013              \r\nLampang Food Products co, Ltd., Bangkok\n\u2013              \r\nSun Sweet Co., Ltd., Chiang Mai City,\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties, who\r\nso requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be\r\nheard, were granted a hearing. \nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND\r\nLIKE PRODUCT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nproduct concerned is sweetcorn (Zea mays var.\r\nsaccharata) in kernels, prepared or preserved by vinegar or acetic acid,\r\nnot frozen, currently falling within CN code ex 2001 90\r\n30, and sweetcorn (Zea mays var. saccharata) in\r\nkernels prepared or preserved otherwise than by vinegar or acetic acid, not frozen, other than products of heading 2006, currently falling within CN code ex 2005 80 00, originating in Thailand. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ninvestigation has shown that, despite differences in the preservations, the\r\ndifferent types of the product concerned all share the same basic biological\r\nand chemical characteristics and are basically used for the same purposes. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\r\ninterested parties claimed that the CN codes for sweet corn do not only\r\nrepresent the product concerned, but include considerable quantities of canned\r\nbabycorn which is not produced by the EU and which is not the like product. They\r\nsuggest that the Commission may have included babycorn it its data.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\r\nthe investigation has been focused exclusively on the product under measures, which\r\nexcludes babycorn, by using corresponding TARIC codes as a basis for analysis.\r\nTherefore, the claim is rejected as factually incorrect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nsweetcorn produced and sold in the Union by the Union industry and the sweetcorn\r\nproduced and sold in Thailand were found to have essentially the same physical and chemical characteristics\r\nand the same basic uses of the sweetcorn produced in Thailand and sold for\r\nexport to the Union. They are therefore considered to be alike within the\r\nmeaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIKELIHOOD OF\r\nCONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the\r\nexisting measures would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of\r\ndumping. \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\r\nabove, in view of the potentially large number of exporting producers which\r\nexpressed their willingness to cooperate, sampling was foreseen in the notice\r\nof initiation. A sample of three exporting producers, representing around 90 %\r\nof total exports among the exporting producers that expressed their willingness\r\nto cooperate, was selected for the determination of the likelihood of a continuation\r\nor recurrence of dumping. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nthe combined export quantities of the three sampled exporting producers\r\naccounted for around 25 % of all exports from Thailand to the European Union\r\nduring the RIP, information from other sources such as the request for the\r\nreview and available trade statistics on exports (from the Thai Customs) and on\r\nimports (from Eurostat) had to be used in order to assess the likelihood of a continuation\r\nor recurrence of dumping\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sales\r\nto traders in Thailand, where the goods were destined for unknown export\r\ndestinations, have not been included in the determination of the dumping\r\nmargin.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nin the original investigation, it has been found that certain exporting\r\nproducers source parts of their sales of the product concerned from external\r\nsuppliers. For the purpose of the investigation, sales of the product concerned\r\nwhich have not been manufactured by the exporting producers themselves have not\r\nbeen taken into account when determining their respective dumping margins. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during the RIP\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the Normal Value\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 2(2), first sentence, of the basic Regulation, for the\r\ndetermination of normal value, it was first established, for each of the three\r\nexporting producers, whether their total domestic sales of the like product\r\nduring the RIP were representative in comparison to their total export sales to\r\nthe European Union, i.e. if sales volumes of the like product intended for\r\ndomestic consumption represented 5 % or more of their exports of the product\r\nconcerned to the European Union.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ndomestic sales of the like product were found to be representative for one of\r\nthe three sampled companies.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nwas subsequently examined whether the types of the like product sold by this\r\ncompany and intended for domestic consumption were identical or directly\r\ncomparable to the types for export to the Union. For each of the those types,\r\nit was established whether sales of the like product intended for domestic\r\nconsumption were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2)\r\nof the basic Regulation. Sales intended for domestic consumption were\r\nsufficiently representative when they represented 5 % or more of the total\r\nsales volume of the comparable type exported to the European Union.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nwas found that, for this company, only one of the types of the like product\r\nwere directly comparable to the type exported to the European Union. Moreover,\r\nthis particular type was also sold in sufficiently representative quantities on\r\nthe domestic market.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nwas subsequently examined whether the product type for the company referred to\r\nin the previous recital was sold in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to\r\nArticle 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing the\r\nproportion of profitable domestic sales to independent customers for the\r\nproduct type concerned.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nwas found that more than 80 % of the volume of sales intended for domestic\r\nconsumption was profitable and in accordance with Article 2(4), all\r\ntransactions for this particular type were used for determining the normal\r\nvalue.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the type of the product concerned where the domestic sales were\r\nrepresentative and made in the ordinary course of trade, normal value was\r\nestablished on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of\r\nall the domestic sales of that type during the RIP.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe remaining two exporting producers whose sales on the domestic market were\r\nnot considered to be representative (one of which did not sell the like product\r\nfor domestic consumption at all) and for the third exporting producer whose\r\noverall sales were considered to be representative but where for a number of\r\ntypes of the like product, the quantities sold on the domestic market were not\r\nconsidered to be representative, the normal value had to be constructed\r\npursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnormal value was constructed by adding the cost of manufacturing for each\r\nproduct type exported to the European Union and a reasonable amount for\r\nselling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) and for profits.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation, for the two\r\nexporting producers who had sales intended for domestic consumption \u2013 at\r\nquantities below or above 5% of their respective sales quantities to the\r\nEuropean Union \u2013 the SG & A and the profit margin were taken from the\r\nrespective company\u2019s sales under the ordinary course of trade on the domestic\r\nmarket. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe third exporting producer which did not sell the like product for domestic\r\nconsumption, in accordance with Article 2(6)(a) of the basic Regulation, the\r\nSG&A and profit used for this third exporting producer constituted the\r\nweighted average of the SG&A and profit for the other two other exporting\r\nproducers referred to in the preceding recital. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\r\ninterested parties disagreed with the methodology explained in (37), i.e. the\r\nuse of profit for the purpose of constructing a normal value when this profit\r\nis based on domestic sales transactions at volumes below 5% of sales quantities\r\nto the European Union. It considers that, when domestic sales transactions are\r\nnot considered to be in sufficient quantities to be representative, then the\r\nprofit from these transactions should neither be used.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\r\nthe same methodology has been used in the original investigation, and in the\r\nabsence of changed circumstances, the Commission considers that this\r\nmethodology is still valid for the purpose of this proceeding.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the Export price\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\r\nsales of the sampled exporting producers were made directly to unrelated\r\ncustomers in the European Union. The sales price was thus established in\r\naccordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of prices\r\npaid or payable by these independent customers in the European Union.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison and adjustments\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price was made on an\r\nex-works basis. In order to ensure a fair comparison account was taken of\r\ndifferences which affect price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10)\r\nof the basic Regulation.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allowances\r\nfor differences in transport costs, insurance costs, handling and loading\r\ncosts, commissions and bank charges were granted when applicable and duly\r\njustified.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\r\nin accordance with Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation and pursuant to the\r\nmethodology applied in the original investigation, allowances were made for\r\ndifference in the level of trade for those exporting producers whose sales on\r\nthe domestic market is carrying its own brand, but whose sales to the European\r\nUnion is under a retailers brand. The adjustment level \u2013 calculated in the form\r\nof a reduction of the profit margin used when constructing the normal value as\r\nreferred to in recital (33) - has been estimated on the basis of the\r\nrelationship of the profit margins obtained by the Union industry on their own\r\nbranded products and on all products. The profit margin was hence reduced by between\r\n20% and 50 %..\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\r\ninterested parties considered that the domestic market in Thailand and the European market cannot be compared, as the size of the market differs and\r\nthe fact that Thai producers sell under their own brand on the domestic market.\r\n\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis first recalled that in Recital (22), it was established that sweet corn sold\r\non the Thai domestic market and sweet corn sold for exports to the European\r\nmarket are alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of\r\nthe basic Regulation.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, due to the\r\ndifferences in the level of trade, an adjustment to the profit margin \u2013 a downward\r\nadjustment by between 20% and 50 % of the profit margin generated from domestic, own-brand sales \u2013 was\r\nmade. This also follows the methodology used in the original investigation.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping during the RIP\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\nthe basis of the above, the dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the free-at-Union-frontier price, before duty,\r\nwere found to be between 8 % and 44 %.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports should\r\nmeasures be repealed\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity of the exporting\r\nproducers\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The production of sweetcorn\r\nis dependent on the access of freshly harvested corn that is delivered to the\r\ncanning factory directly after harvest. The freshly harvested corn should be\r\ncanned within 24 hours after harvest and thus the capacity to produce the\r\nproduct concerned is directly linked to the availability of freshly harvested\r\ncorn.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Thailand, the harvest season is around 9-10 months\r\na year, encompassing 2 harvests per year. When assessing the available\r\ntechnical capacity to manufacture, season-related raw material constraints must\r\nbe included in the analysis.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three exporting\r\nproducers that were included in the sample had a combined technical capacity of\r\nbetween 130 000 \u2011 150 000 tonnes. The actual utilization rate\r\nof available technical capacity varied between 50 % \u2013 80 %.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties argued\r\nthat, while acknowledging the methodology used in curtailing the technical\r\ncapacity with accessibility of raw materials, the available spare capacity was\r\nexaggerated.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As already stressed in Recital\r\n(50), technical capacity cannot be fully utilized due to the seasonal\r\nunavailability of freshly harvested sweet corn. Still, the investigation has\r\nshown that capacity utilisation figures of 80% and above are achieved by some\r\nsampled producers, while for other sampled producers the capacity utilisation\r\nwas much lower. Since all producers have a comparable access to raw materials,\r\nthis lower capacity utilisation cannot only be explained by the seasonal\r\nunavailability of freshly harvested sweet corn.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to information\r\nprovided by the Thai Food Processors Association, the total export quantity of\r\nThailand to the rest of the world steadily increased by around 20% during the\r\nperiod considered, reaching a volume of 150 000 \u2013 200 000 tonnes\r\nduring the RIP. This shows that the quantities of available sweet corn can and effectively\r\ndo increase steadily when additional quantities are needed by exporting\r\nproducers. In this respect, it is noted that the total production of yellow\r\ncorn ranged from 4,1 million \u2013 4,5 million tonnes in Thailand during the period considered. While it is acknowledged that the production cannot\r\nbe switched from yellow corn to sweet corn on a 1:1 basis, the sheer magnitude\r\nof the difference in production volumes makes it clear that even a small shift\r\nin the production quantities from yellow corn to sweetcorn can have a substantial\r\nimpact on the total sweetcorn production in Thailand.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\r\nestablished that the three sampled producers could produce an additional\r\nquantity of around 40 000 \u2013 60 000 tonnes per year ('effective spare\r\ncapacity'), which is around 2 to 3 times the total exports from Thailand of the\r\nproduct concerned to the EU.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effective spare\r\ncapacity of the sampled producers alone can therefore be considered\r\nsignificant. In addition, there are another 15 known producers of the product\r\nconcerned in Thailand, which similarly have access to the vast production of\r\nsweet corn in Thailand.. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From information collected\r\nfrom other sources, i.e.\n\u2013     \r\ninformation collected from exporting producers\u2019\r\ninternet presentations, \n\u2013     \r\ninformation collected in relation to the\r\nsampling exercise, and \n\u2013     \r\ninformation collected under the data-base set up\r\nunder Article 14(6) of the basic Regulation, \nit can be concluded that at least two major\r\nexporting producers, one of which co-operated in the review investigation but\r\nwas not selected for the sample (and hence did not supply any detailed\r\ninformation in this regard), have a combined capacity of between 50.000 \u2013\r\n100.000 tonnes.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there is no\r\nevidence to suggest that the level of consumption on the Thai domestic market\r\nor third country markets would increase which could absorb increased production\r\nif spare capacity of the Thai producers is used. In particular, the Thai\r\ndomestic market is tiny, and on average only accounted for 1% \u2011 2% of\r\ntotal sales of all sampled Thai producers. This confirms that any additional\r\nproduction of sweet corn will be exported outside Thailand.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union market\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\r\ncomparing the export prices of the product concerned to the European Union with\r\nthe prices charged for the like product on the domestic market, two facts have\r\nemerged: on the domestic market the prices are relatively high (due to\r\nown-brand sales) and the volumes are relatively small as compared to the export\r\nsales. On this basis, there is no apparent risk of trade diversion from sales\r\non the domestic market to sales to the European Union should measures be\r\nrepealed. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When comparing the export\r\nprices of the product concerned to the European Union with the prices charged\r\nfor the like product on third country markets, it emerges that for the 3\r\nsampled exporting producers prices to the European Union are \u2013 on average \u2013 14\r\n% higher. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trade\r\nStatistics from the Thai Customs also confirms this finding. After conversion\r\nof the logistical weight (can + corn + liquid) reported into canned net weight\r\n(corn + liquid) following the methodology in the application for the review,\r\nthe prices per kg charged to the European Union are \u2013 on average \u2013 5 % higher\r\nthan to third countries.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While\r\nseveral parties have expressed doubts that a price difference of 5% or 14% is\r\nbe significant enough to result in a trade diversion to the EU, the\r\ninvestigation has shown that this is indeed likely in the sweetcorn market. In\r\nthe present proceeding, one Thai company (Karn Corn) previously obtained a duty\r\nrate which is 8% \u2011 10% lower than that of most other Thai exporters. This\r\nadvantage of 8% \u2011 10% was however sufficient to increase their share in\r\nThai exports to the EU seven times between the IP of the original investigation\r\nand the RIP of the current investigation.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, despite the\r\nanti-dumping duty of 3,1% in force, Karn Corn more than doubled their export\r\nquantities to the EU since the imposition of the anti-dumping duties. This\r\nshows the attractiveness of the EU market compared to other markets even in the\r\ncase of a small price differential.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\nconclude, whereas the risk for trade diversion from the domestic market to the\r\nUnion market is rather limited due to the existence of own-brand sales on the\r\nformer, there is a significant risk for trade diversion from sales to third\r\ncountries to the Union market due to the higher prices prevailing on the\r\nlatter.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties argued\r\nthat the prices on the European market are comparably less attractive when\r\ncomparing with prices in other countries such as Japan. Thus, the risk for\r\ntrade diversion should measures be repealed would be exaggerated.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that sales\r\nto third countries are treated as a group and the conclusion drawn in Recital (63)\r\nis based on prices to all third countries on average. It is fully acknowledged\r\nthat, within this group to third countries, there are countries to which export\r\nprices are higher, and there are other third countries which carry lower export\r\nprices. Obviously, the lower the export price, the higher the risk for trade\r\ndiversion should measures lapse.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, one interested\r\nparty argued that contractual links with importers in third countries will not\r\nmake an easy switch between customers in different countries.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While contractual links\r\nbetween exporting producers in Thailand and importers in various third\r\ncountries may exist and are upheld in the short term, there is no evidence to\r\nsuggest that these contractual obligations could not be phased out as to enable\r\nsales to markets with higher prices such as the European Union.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, interested parties\r\nclaimed that exports to some third countries such as South Korea cannot be\r\ncompared, as the product mix (e.g. size of cans) and sales conditions (e.g. shipping\r\nterms) may be different.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\r\noutcome of the comparisons in Recitals (58) \u2013 (60) are indicators of\r\ndifferences in export prices to all third countries. The impact of any\r\nissue concerning Thai exports to a small number of markets on the overall\r\ncomparison is therefore by nature limited. In addition, since Thai export data\r\nis recorded on an FOB basis, the impact of any difference in shipping terms or\r\nshipping cost is limited to the cost of domestic freight inside Thailand and can therefore only be insignificant.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\r\nevidence suggesting that the average price to all third countries is not comparable\r\nwith the export price to the European Union, the conclusion drawn in Recital (63)\r\nis valid.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the\r\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears likely that\r\nshould the measure be repealed the relatively higher price level on the\r\nEuropean Union market will attract significant volumes of the product concerned\r\nthat are currently sold at lower prices to third countries.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exporting producers of Thailand have continued their dumping practised during the RIP.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the available\r\nspare capacity in Thailand and the fact that prices of the European Union\r\nmarket are considerably higher than on third country markets brings to the\r\nconclusion that there is a risk for increases in the exports of the product\r\nconcerned should measures be repealed.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To conclude, there is a\r\nstrong likelihood for continuation of dumping should measures be repealed.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITION OF THE UNION\r\nINDUSTRY\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, the like\r\nproduct was manufactured by around 20 producers in the Union. The output of\r\nthese producers (established on the basis of the information collected from the\r\ncooperating producers and for the other Union producers on the data from the review\r\nrequest) is therefore deemed to constitute the Union production within the\r\nmeaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nexplained above under recital (13), due to the large number of Union producers,\r\na sample was selected. For the purpose of the injury analysis, the injury\r\nindicators have been established at the following two levels: \n- The macroeconomic elements (production,\r\ncapacity, sales volume, market share, growth, employment, productivity, average\r\nunit prices and magnitude of dumping margins and recovery from the effects of\r\npast dumping) were assessed, at the level of the whole Union production, on the\r\nbasis of the information collected from the cooperating producers and, for the\r\nother Union producers, an estimation based on the data from the review request\r\nwas used.\n- The analysis of microeconomic elements (stocks,\r\nwages, profitability, return on investments, cash flow, ability to raise\r\ncapital and investments) was carried out for the sampled Union producers on the\r\nbasis of their information.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SITUATION ON THE UNION\r\nMARKET\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption was\r\nestablished on the basis of the sales volumes of the Union industry\u2019s own\r\nproduction destined for the Union market, the import volumes data on the Union\r\nmarket obtained from the 14.6 database and, concerning the other Union\r\nproducers, from information available from the request.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout\r\nthe period considered, the EU consumption has increased by 9 %. While from 2008\r\nto 2009 it decreased by 5 %, in 2010 and in 2011 it increased respectively by 6\r\nand 9 percentage points (i.e. compared to the previous year). Then it more or\r\nless stabilised during the RIP at a level of around\r\n350 000 tonnes. \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Total EU consumption (tonne) || 318 413 || 301 594 || 320 027 || 351 279 || 347 533 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 95 || 101 || 110 || 109 \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country concerned\n(a) Volume \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The volume of imports of\r\nthe product concerned from the country concerned into the Union decreased by 43 %,\r\nfrom around 38 000 tonnes in 2008 to around 22 000 tonnes in the RIP. It\r\ndecreased by 15 % in 2009, by a further 20 percentage points in 2010 and\r\nanother 11 percentage points in 2011, before slightly increasing again by 3\r\npercentage points in the RIP. \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Volume of imports from Thailand || 38 443 || 32 616 || 24 941 || 20 710 || 21 856 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 85 || 65 || 54 || 57 \n Market share of imports from Thailand || 12% || 11% || 8% || 6% || 6% \n Price imports from Thailand (\u20ac/tonne) || 835 || 887 || 806 || 775 || 807 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 106 || 96 || 93 || 97 \nSource: 14.6 database\n(b) Market\r\nshare \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncorresponding market share held by Thai exporters on the Union market in the\r\ncountry concerned gradually decreased by around 50 % or 6 percentage\r\npoints during the period considered, from 12 % in 2008 to 6 % in the RIP.\r\nIn detail, the Thai market share decreased from 12% in 2008 to 11% in 2009 to 8\r\n% in 2010 and to 6 % in 2011/RIP.\n(c) Prices\n(i) Price\r\nevolution \n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Between\r\n2008 and the RIP, the average price of imports of the product concerned\r\noriginating in the country concerned declined by 3 %, from 835 EUR/tonne\r\nin 2008 to 807 EUR/tonne in the RIP. Specifically, prices increased by 6 %\r\nin 2008 before decreasing by 10 percentage points in 2010 and by a further 3\r\npercentage points in 2011. From 2011 to the RIP, these prices increased again\r\nby 4 percentage points. \n(ii) Price\r\nundercutting \n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A price comparison for similar product types was made\r\nbetween the exporting producers' and the Union industry's selling prices in the\r\nUnion. To this end, the\r\nUnion industry\u2019s ex-works prices net of all rebates and taxes have been\r\ncompared with the CIF Union frontier prices of exporting producers of the\r\ncountry concerned, duly adjusted for conventional duties, unloading and customs\r\nclearance costs. The comparison showed that during the RIP the prices of the product\r\nconcerned originating in the country concerned sold in the Union were overall\r\nhigher than the Union industry's prices. Also, based on\r\nimport statistics (14.6 database), there was no undercutting margin for all\r\nThai imports into the EU (for both cooperating exporters as well as\r\nnon-co-operators, regardless of the product mix).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation of the Union industry\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant\r\nto Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined all relevant\r\neconomic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the Union\r\nindustry.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nmarket is inter alia characterized by the existence of two sales\r\nchannels, i.e. sales under the producer's own brand and sales under retailer's\r\nbrand. Sales under the first channel, as compared to the second channel, will\r\nusually trigger higher selling costs intended notably for marketing and\r\nadvertising, and will also command higher selling prices. \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation evidenced that all imports from the\r\nco-operating Thai exporters pertained to the second channel, i.e. the\r\nretailer's brand channel. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to\r\ndistinguish in the injury analysis between Union industry's sales under its own\r\nbrand and under the retailer's brand wherever relevant, as dumped imports compete\r\nin the first place with Union industry's like products sold under the\r\nretailer's brand. This distinction was made in particular for the determination\r\nof sales volumes, sales prices and profitability. However, for the sake of\r\ncompleteness, totals (including both own brand and retailer's brand) are also\r\nshown and commented in the tables below. During the RIP, Union industry's sales\r\nunder the retailer's brand accounted for around 70 % of the total Union\r\nindustry\u2019s sales volume and around 60 % of their sales value.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that in the Union sweetcorn is only processed during the summer months, a number of injury indicators\r\nare virtually identical for 2011 and the RIP (1 April 2011 to 30 March 2012).\r\nThis applies in particular to production and production capacity. \n3.1.

Indeed the performance on the retailer-branded segment\r\nwhich is in direct competition with the Thai imports is poor in terms of\r\nprofitability. Sales prices of the Union industry in this market segment\r\ndecreased by 3 % over the period considered, whereas production costs increased\r\nby about 10 % over the same period. Clearly, the Union industry has not been in\r\na position to recover its costs which resulted in significant losses. Given the\r\nimportance of the retailer\u2019s brand in the Union industry\u2019s sweetcorn business\r\n(representing 70% of its total sales volume and 60% of its total sales value)\r\nthis has weighted on the overall profitability. Thus, no actual recovery from\r\nthe past dumping could be established and it is considered that the Union\r\nindustry remains vulnerable to the injurious effects of any dumped imports in\r\nthe Union market.\n3.2. Microeconomic elements\n(a) Stocks \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of closing stocks\r\nof the Union industry has been continuously decreasing over the period\r\nconsidered. It decreased by 2 % in 2009, by 27 percentage points in 2010,\r\nby 2 percentage points in 2011 and further by 24 percentage points during the\r\nRIP. However, it should be noted that the level of inventories is not a\r\nmeaningful indicator of injury for this particular industry. The high level of\r\ninventories at the end of each year is linked to the fact that the harvest and\r\nthe canning typically end in October each year. Stocks are therefore goods awaiting\r\ndispatching during the period November to July. \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n Closing stock (tonne) || 193 834 || 189 741 || 136 703 || 133 884 || 88 108 \n Index (2008=100) || 100 || 98 || 71 || 69 || 45 \nSource: Investigation\n(b) Wages \n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 Between 2008 and the RIP,\r\nthe labour costs decreased by 7 %.

The decline is thus less steep than for sales under retailer's brand\r\nalone. The decrease in profitability is explained\r\nby the fact that sales prices over the period considered decreased by 3% whereas\r\nproduction costs (predominantly unprocessed sweetcorn and cans) increased by 5%\r\nover the same period. Clearly, the Union industry has not been in a position to\r\npass on the increased production cost to its customers. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 The return on investments\r\n(\u2018ROI\u2019), expressed as the profit (for both own and retailer's brand) as a\r\npercentage of the net book value of investments, broadly followed the profitability\r\ntrend.

Return on\r\ninvestment declined, the production volume decreased by 8 %, production capacity\r\ndecreased by 9 %, and employment decreased by 11 %. With respect to lower\r\nproduction levels we need to note that the yield of the crops in 2008 was\r\nbetter than expected and led to higher output for the Union industry in the\r\nsame year. During the same period, imports from Thailand (which are primarily\r\ninvoiced in USD) became more attractive because of a weaker USD. This increase\r\nin (both European as well as Thai) sweetcorn supply coincided with the economic\r\nand financial crisis in the EU which had an impact on consumption. As a result,\r\nthe increased EU production could not be entirely sold on the EU market. This\r\nled to a reduced production level and de-stocking in the following years but\r\ncannot explain fully the injury suffered.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 The profitability of the\r\nUnion industry\u2019s sales of sweetcorn (both own and retailer\u2019s brand) decreased significantly\r\nover the period considered. The retailer-branded segment, where the EU industry\r\nhas to face competition from the Thai imports, is clearly loss-making\r\n(profitability declined from a profit of more than 5 % in 2008 to a loss\r\nof more than 5 % during the RIP). The EU producers decreased their sales prices\r\non the Union market by 3 % and managed to re-gain market share at the expense\r\nof their profitability. The industry needs the retailer-branded sales as there\r\nis no sufficient demand for own brand and given that the retailer-branded sales\r\nrepresent around 60 % of the total sales value, the overall profitability\r\ndecreased from 8,5 % to 1,6 % over the period considered. \n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Some indicators suggest that\r\nthanks to the measures in place the industry regained its position. The volume\r\nof Thai imports and their corresponding market share nearly halved, from 12 %\r\nin 2008 to only 6 % in the RIP. The Union industry\u2019s market share increased\r\nfrom 83 % in 2008 to 90 % in the RIP. Moreover, during the RIP, the average\r\nprices of the Thai imports did not undercut those of the Union industry, but at\r\nthe same time they have prevented the Union industry from passing on cost\r\nincreases to customers. Also other indicators marked positive development. Capacity\r\nutilisation increased by 2 % over the period considered and was rather high at\r\n77 % during the RIP. The volume of the Union industry's retailer-branded sales,\r\nwhich are in direct competition with Thai imports, increased by 31% and total\r\nsales for both segments combined increased by 19 %. Investment increased by 64 %.\r\nThese factors suggest that the industry was able to recover. However, it was\r\nnot able to reach satisfactory profitability levels to maintain a substantial\r\nmarket share on a market where only EU industry and Thai imports compete\r\n(imports from other third countries are dispersed and insignificant). \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 The competition situation on\r\nthe EU market is indeed delicate. On the one hand, for one part of the market \u2013\r\nthe own-branded segment \u2013 the EU industry does not face outside competition.\r\nThe negotiating power of brand owners vis-\u00e0-vis retailers is strong. Indeed,\r\nthey are price-setters. The market is also consolidated with the four sampled\r\nproducers holding 54 % market share. On the other hand, the retailers have an\r\nupper hand in the segment of private brands. Due to outside competition and\r\ncompetition within the Union, prices are constantly under pressure. As a\r\nresult, it is more difficult for EU producers to pass on production cost\r\nincreases (predominantly sweetcorn or cans) to their customers (production\r\ncosts of the Union industry have increased by 5 % over the period considered)\r\ndue to the price pressure exercised by Thai imports. \n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly,\r\nthe Union industry has been able to increase its market share by favouring\r\nvolumes over prices. On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that for a\r\nmajority of its sweetcorn business (the retailer\u2019s brand) it has not been able\r\nto recover its costs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the situation of the Union\r\nindustry is still vulnerable and fragile.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties have\r\ncommented that the Union industry has recovered given that a number of\r\nindicators have improved and in particular in view of the Union industry\u2019s high\r\nmarket share and the negative undercutting. \n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recognised that the\r\ninjury picture of the Union industry is mixed. The anti-dumping measures have\r\npartially achieved their objective by removing some of the injury suffered by\r\nthe Union industry as a consequence of dumped imports from Thailand. However, on balance, in particular taking into account the low and decreasing\r\nprofitability, the situation of the Union industry is still fragile.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Negative undercutting and a\r\nstrong market share of the Union industry do not automatically point to lack of\r\ninjury. The situation of continued dumped imports from Thailand (with dumping margins of up to 44%) has resulted in price suppression on the EU\r\nmarket. The Union industry, in an attempt to regain lost market share, has kept\r\nprices down which has resulted in a deterioration of profitability. \n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\r\nthat the injury assessment should be based on the Union industry\u2019s overall\r\nperformance and not on the performance of one segment of the market.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the original\r\ninvestigation, the injury assessment has been based on the Union industry\u2019s\r\noverall performance (own brand + retailer\u2019s brand) as well as, for a number of\r\ninjury indicators (profitability, sales volume and sales prices) on the\r\nretailer\u2019s brand. There are no changed circumstances which would justify a\r\ndeviation from this methodology, which remains valid for assessing the\r\nsituation of the EU industry. As mentioned in recitals (84) and (85), the\r\nsweetcorn market is still characterised by the existence of two sales channels\r\nand all imports from the co-operating Thai exporters pertained to the\r\nretailer\u2019s brand channel.. In addition, even if only the Union industry\u2019s\r\noverall performance would be taken into account, it would, in view of the low\r\nand decreasing profitability, not alter the conclusion that the Union industry\r\nis in a fragile situation. Based on the above considerations, the claim is\r\nrejected. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 Two interested parties\r\nclaimed that the inability of the Union industry may well result from\r\ncompetition within the EU.\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 However, the situation on\r\nthe EU market with regard to competition is not fundamentally different from\r\nthe situation in the period considered in the original investigation (existence\r\nof two sales channels, around 20 EU producers). Nevertheless, in 2002, before\r\nThai exports started to enter the EU market at dumped prices, the Union\r\nindustry has achieved a profit level of more than 20% overall (own brand + retailer\u2019s\r\nbrand) and 17% on the retailer\u2019s brand. This demonstrates that competition in\r\nthe EU is not preventing the Union industry from achieving healthy profit\r\nmargins. It is rather the continued presence of dumped imports and the\r\nresulting price suppression that prevents the Union industry from increasing\r\nits prices. \nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE\r\nOF INJURY\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\r\ntrends, it appears that the anti-dumping measures have partially achieved their\r\nintended result of removing injury suffered by the Union producers. On the\r\nother hand, as evidenced by the negative development of a number of injury\r\nindicators, the industry is still in a vulnerable and fragile situation. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned above, Thai exporters do have the spare capacity to increase their\r\nexports very rapidly. In addition, Thai trade statistics confirm that Thailand has exported around 140 000 tons to third\r\ncountries in 2011, which is about 7 times the Thai export volume to the EU. Given\r\nthe more lucrative prices on the EU market compared to some third country\r\nmarkets, it is likely that significant quantities currently exported to these\r\ncountries will be re-directed to the EU market in case the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures would be allowed to lapse. Such an abrupt development was already\r\nobserved in the original investigation, when the market share of EU imports\r\nfrom Thailand nearly doubled in only three years, i.e. from 6,8% in 2002 to\r\n12,7% in 2005. \n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, on the basis of\r\nthe above, it can be concluded that there is a likelihood of recurrence of\r\ninjury in case the measures were repealed. \n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\r\nhave expressed doubts about the conclusion of likelihood of recurrence of\r\ninjury. It is claimed in particular that a 5% price difference between the EU and\r\nthird country markets is too small to re-direct sweetcorn exports to the EU\r\nmarket. This argument is already addressed in recital (61) above. In addition,\r\nit is claimed that sweetcorn is not a commodity which could easily be switched\r\nbetween markets. This argument has however not been substantiated, and does not\r\ncorrespond to the findings of this investigation\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 Although the likelihood of\r\nrecurrence of injury is a prospective assessment, it is based on the facts\r\nmentioned in recital (121). Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with article\r\n21 of the basic Regulation it was examined whether the maintenance of the\r\nexisting anti-dumping measures would be against the interest of the Union as a whole. The determination of the Union interest was based on an appreciation of\r\nall the various interests involved. All interested parties were given the\r\nopportunity to make their views known pursuant of Article 21(2) of the basic\r\nRegulation.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest\r\nof the Union industry\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned above, the Union industry is still in a somewhat fragile and\r\nvulnerable situation. It would use the relief of a continuation of the measures\r\nto increase its sales prices (in particular for the retailer\u2019s brand) in order\r\nto recover its increased production costs. This would allow the industry to\r\nimprove its financial situation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest\r\nof the retailers and consumers\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 Cooperation has been sought\r\nfrom more than 40 importers/retailers and two consumer/trading organisations.\r\nOnly one retailer has cooperated. Its imports represented a small fraction of\r\nthe total imports from Thailand during the RIP. The share of its\r\nsweet-corn-related turnover was negligible compared to its total turnover. In\r\naddition, the re-sales of sweetcorn generated a very high profit during the\r\nRIP. These factors suggest that retailers would not be disproportionately\r\naffected, even if measures were to be extended.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, a number\r\nof trade associations made submissions and attended a hearing. They claim that\r\nanti-dumping measures should be discontinued due to the low and decreasing\r\nmarket share of Thai imports coinciding with the high and increasing market\r\nshare of the Union industry. \n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 As far as consumers are\r\nconcerned, the average spending in sweetcorn per household is very limited, up\r\nto 5\u20ac per year. Taking into account the moderate level of the current measures,\r\nthe effects of the continued imposition of measures would likely be negligible for\r\nthe consumers. \n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the above and\r\ngiven the overall low degree of co-operation, it is therefore considered that the\r\nsituation of retailers and of consumers in the Union is unlikely to be\r\nsubstantially affected by the proposed measures.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk\r\nof supply shortages / competition on the EU market\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 It should first be recalled\r\nthat the aim of anti-dumping measures is not to stop access into the Union for\r\nimports on which the measures are imposed, but to eliminate the impact of\r\ndistorted market conditions arising from the continued presence of dumped\r\nimports.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 The EU consumption increased\r\nby 9 % during the RIP, reaching around 350 000 tonnes. The Union industry\u2019s\r\ncapacity has continuously exceeded EU demand over the period considered,\r\nreaching a level of around 440 000 tonnes in the RIP. There is sufficient\r\ncompetition between the EU producers. Operating at a capacity utilisation rate\r\nof 77 % during the RIP, it appears that the Union industry has the spare\r\ncapacity to increase its production further in case of increased demand.\r\nImports from other third countries, notably USA and PRC can also satisfy part\r\nof the demand. As mentioned above, it should be pointed out that the\r\nanti-dumping measures are not intended to stop the imports from Thailand into the EU. Taking into account the low level of the measures, it is expected\r\nthat the Thai imports will continue to account for a certain share on the EU\r\nmarket. \n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above\r\nconsiderations, it cannot be concluded that maintaining the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures would likely result in a shortage of supply on the EU market or a\r\nrestriction of competition on the EU market.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\r\non Union interest\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, it\r\nappears that the negative effects of continuation of measures would be limited\r\nand in any case not disproportionate to the benefits of the prolongation of\r\nmeasures for the Union industry. \nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\r\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\r\nrecommend that the existing measures be maintained. They were also granted a period\r\nto submit comments subsequent to that disclosure. The submissions and comments\r\nwere duly taken into consideration where warranted. \n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\r\nthat, as provided for by Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping\r\nmeasures applicable to imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in\r\nkernels originating in Thailand should be maintained. It is recalled that these\r\nmeasures consist of an ad valorem duty at different rates.\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 The individual company\r\nanti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation are solely applicable to\r\nimports of the product concerned produced by these companies and thus by the\r\nspecific legal entities mentioned. Imports of the product concerned\r\nmanufactured by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative\r\npart of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities related\r\nto those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be\r\nsubject to the duty rate applicable to 'all other companies'. \n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\r\napplication of these individual anti-dumping duty rates (e.g. following a\r\nchange in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production\r\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[8]\r\nforthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the\r\ncompany\u2019s activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated\r\nwith, for instance, that name change or that change in the production and sales\r\nentities. If appropriate, the Regulation will then be amended accordingly by\r\nupdating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates,\nHAS\r\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive anti-dumping duty\r\nis hereby imposed on imports of sweetcorn (Zea mays\r\nvar. saccharata) in kernels, prepared or preserved by vinegar or acetic\r\nacid, not frozen, currently falling within CN code ex 2001 90 30 (TARIC code\r\n2001 90 30 10) and sweetcorn (Zea\r\nmays var. saccharata) in kernels prepared or preserved otherwise than by\r\nvinegar or acetic acid, not frozen, other than products\r\nof heading 2006, currently falling\r\nwithin CN code ex 2005 80 00 (TARIC code 2005\r\n80 00 10), originating in Thailand. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive\r\nanti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price, before\r\nduty, of the products described in paragraph 1 and produced by the companies\r\nbelow shall be as follows:\n Company || Anti-Dumping duty (%) || TARIC Additional Code \n Karn Corn Co Ltd, 68 Moo 7 Tambol Saentor, Thamaka, Kanchanaburi 71130, Thailand || 3,1 || A789 \n Kuiburi Fruit Canning Co., Ltd, 236 Krung Thon Muang Kaew Building, Sirindhorn Rd., Bangplad, Bangkok 10700, Thailand || 14,3 || A890 \n Malee Sampran Public Co., Ltd, Abico Bldg. 401/1 Phaholyothin Rd., Lumlookka, Pathumthani 12130, Thailand || 12,8 || A790 \n River Kwai International Food Industry Co., Ltd, 52 Thaniya Plaza, 21st Floor, Silom Rd., Bangrak, Bangkok 10500 , Thailand || 12,8 || A791 \n Sun Sweet Co., Ltd, 9 M. 1, Sanpatong, Chiang Mai 50120, Thailand || 11,1 || A792 \n Manufacturers listed in the Annex I || 12,9 || A793 \n All other companies || 14,3 || A999 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unless otherwise specified, the\r\nprovisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.\nArticle\r\n2\nArticle 1(2) may be\r\namended by adding the new exporting producer to the cooperating companies not\r\nincluded in the sample and thus subject to the weighted average duty rate of\r\n12,9 % where any new exporting producer in Thailand provides sufficient\r\nevidence to the Commission that: \na) it did not export to\r\nthe Union the product described in Article 1(1) during the review investigation\r\nperiod (1 April 2011 to 30 March 2012); \nb) it is not related to\r\nany of the exporters or producers in Thailand which are subject to the measures\r\nimposed by this Regulation; and \nc) it has actually exported to the Union\r\nthe product concerned after the review investigation period or it has entered\r\ninto an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to\r\nthe Union.\nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX I\nList of the cooperating manufacturers\r\nreferred to in Article 1(2) under TARIC additional code A793:\n Name || Address \n Agro-On (Thailand) Co., Ltd. || 50/499-500 Moo 6 Baan Mai, Pakkret, Monthaburi 11120, Thailand \n B.N.H.
