The Commission considers that other items\r\non the agenda of the Ministerial Council do not require guidance for a statement\r\nby the European Union, as referred to in the Working methods with respect to\r\nthe preparation of meetings of the Energy Community Ministerial Council agreed\r\nbetween the services of the Commission and the Council (14623/07).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DRAFT ANNOTATED AGENDA\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary matters (under A\r\npoints, without discussion)\nApproval of the financial management for\r\n2012. The Commission shall approve the Director\u2019s\r\nfinancial discharge for 2012 on the basis of the Audit Report of 31 December\r\n2012, the Budget Committee Report on Audit for 2012 and the Director\u2019s Report\r\non Execution of the Budget.\nApproval of the budget and financial\r\ncontributions for the period 2014 \u2013 2015. The Commission\r\nshall approve the budget for 2014-2015, subject to the approval of the\r\ncorresponding appropriations by the budget authority for both years. This\r\nbudget is consistent with the Commission\u2019s proposal, adopted by Commission\r\nDecision of 29 May 2013 (SEC(2013) 3061 final).\nThe total budget shall not exceed \u20ac3,448,810\r\nin 2014 and \u20ac3,517,786 in 2015. These amounts represent an increase (3.2 % and\r\n5.2 %) compared with the budget approved for 2013. The budgetary assumptions\r\ncontained in the draft budget prepared by the Secretariat justify the increased\r\nbudget by reference e.g. to the extended activities of the Energy Community\r\nactivities and to the increased responsibilities of its bodies, and in\r\nparticular the Secretariat.\nThe European Commission shall also agree to\r\nthe amendments to Annex IV of the Energy Community Treaty, which details the\r\nbudget contributions from the European Union and from each Contracting Party. Upon\r\naccession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union, its financial\r\ncontribution to the budget of the Energy Community (0,40%) shall be covered by\r\nthe European Union.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of the Energy\r\nCommunity Work Programme for 2014-2015 (under A points, without discussion)\nThe European Commission shall approve the\r\nEnergy Community Work Programme for 2014-2015, as proposed by the Secretariat and\r\nendorsed by the Permanent High Level Group (PHLG) on 19 June 2013.\nThis Work Programme represents the\r\ncontinuation of the work carried out in the past and covers all areas of\r\nactivity.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation of the Energy\r\nEfficiency Directive\nTo date, the Energy Community acquis\r\nincludes Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on\r\nenergy end-use efficiency and energy services, Directive 2010/31/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings and\r\nDirective 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the\r\nindication by labeling and standard product information of the consumption of\r\nenergy and other resources by energy-related products, as well as eight\r\nimplementing Regulations.\nDirective 2012/27/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency amends\r\ni.a. Directive 2010/30/EU and repeals i.a. Directive 2006/32/EC. The evolution\r\nof the EU legislation on energy efficiency has been discussed in the former\r\nEnergy Efficiency Task Force and its successor, the Energy Efficiency\r\nCoordination Group, which agreed on the desirability for the Contracting\r\nParties to start implementing Directive 2012/27/EU at an early stage.\nThe draft Recommendation on the agenda of\r\nthe Ministerial Council represents a first step towards a future binding\r\ndecision and describes the tasks to be undertaken by the Contracting Parties.\r\nThis approach is similar to the one followed in the past for Directive\r\n2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The\r\ndraft Recommendation includes some adaptations proposed by the Energy Community\r\nSecretariat, to allow the Contracting Parties to gradually implement the\r\nrequirements of the Directive. At the meeting of the Permanent High Level Group\r\nof 19 June 2013, it was clarified that these adaptations shall not prejudge the\r\ncontent of a future binding decision. The draft Recommendation clearly\r\nindicates that the various obligations to be met eventually by the Contracting\r\nParties are identical to those set in Directive 2012/27/EU.\nThe Commission shall support the adoption.\r\nThe Recommendation being based on Title II of the Treaty, the European Union\r\nshall not vote.\n2.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large\r\ncombustion plants / Industrial emissions Directives\nIn its report to the Ministerial Council in\r\nBudva, last year, the Environmental Task Force pointed out the difficulties\r\nfaced by the Contracting Parties and the need for allowing some flexibility in\r\nthe implementation of Directive 2001/80/EC on the reduction of emissions from\r\nlarge combustion plants, which will soon be repealed and replaced by Directive\r\n2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and\r\ncontrol). On this base, the Commission submitted to the Ministerial Council a proposal\r\nfor a Decision on the implementation of Directive 2001/80/EC and on the\r\nimplementation of Chapter III, Annex V and Article 72(3)-(4) of Directive\r\n2010/75/EU and amending Article 16 and Annex II of the Treaty. \nThe Commission proposal was discussed at\r\nthe meeting of the PHLG on 19 June 2013, where a majority of Contracting\r\nParties asked for changes to the Commission proposal as to introducing the\r\npossibility to \"opt-out\" certain plants and the modification of\r\ncertain dates related to the application of a National Emission Reduction Plan.\r\nAs regards Directive 2010/75/EU, there was general consensus on the 2018\r\ndeadline for new plants, while the proposed 2022 deadline for existing plants\r\nwas considered too early.\nThe Environmental Task Force will be meeting\r\nearly September for an in-depth discussion, in the light of the results of an\r\non-going study. The PHLG agreed to continue and conclude its discussions on\r\nthis issue at its meeting in October, the day before the Ministerial Council.\nThe Commission shall support the decisions\r\non the agenda, as follows:\n- Large combustion plants Directive (LCP\r\nDirective) \u2013 (adaptations to Directive 2001/80/EC): this decision is based on\r\nTitle II of the Treaty, and as stipulated in Article 80, each Contracting Party\r\nshall have one vote. Thus, the European Union, which is not a Contracting\r\nParty, shall not vote, however, under Article 79 of the Treaty, the European\r\nCommission may alter or withdraw its proposal at any time during the procedure that\r\nis leading to the adoption of the measures. The Commission shall agree on\r\nmodifications of the reference period for the national emission reduction plan (NERP)\r\n(ending in 2012 instead of 2010) and on a modification of the definition of\r\n\u201cexisting plant\u201d (reference date: 1 January 1993 instead of 1 July 1987). The\r\nCommission shall also agree on one of the following options, both of which aim\r\nto provide certain flexibility to Contracting Parties to meet the required\r\ntargets: \n(i) the modification of the provisions\r\nrelated to the NERP by allowing a linearly decreasing ceiling to be set between\r\n2018 and the date of entry into effect of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)\r\nlimits. In 2018, total emissions of plants included in the NERP shall not\r\nexceed emissions equivalent with the LCP Directive limits by more than 25%. In\r\nthe final year of the NERP, total emissions shall be equivalent with those that\r\nwould have been achieved by applying the IED limits on a plant-by-plant basis. \n(ii) the possibility to \"opt-out\"\r\ncertain plants, with the restriction that this option shall not apply to plants\r\nfor which a date for closure prior to 1 January 2018 has been agreed by the\r\nrelevant authorities in their bilateral relations with the European Union\r\nand/or international donors. The Commission shall ask for introducing in the\r\nMinisterial Council Decision a provision stating that the exemption shall be\r\nauthorised, upon reasoned request of the Contracting Party, by the Ministerial\r\nCouncil in a decision approved by majority of its Members, which must include a\r\nvote in favour by the European Union.\n- Industrial Emissions Directive (adoption\r\nof Directive 2010/75/EU): the Commission shall support the adoption of this\r\nDirective by the Energy Community, with an implementation deadline not later\r\nthan 1 January 2024 for existing plants. The Commission shall agree to the\r\namendment of Article 16 and Annex II of the Treaty, based on the negotiating\r\nmandate granted by the Council on dd/mm/2013.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implementation\r\nof the Treaty\nThe Commission shall welcome the annual\r\nimplementation report and the assessment made by the Secretariat of Contracting\r\nParties' compliance with the Energy Community acquis. Ministers are expected to\r\nreport about recent national developments, mainly from the legislative point of\r\nview. The Commission should steer the debate and focus on the achievement of\r\nthe Energy Community main goal, which is setting up open, transparent and\r\ncompetitive national energy markets that can be integrated regionally, with the\r\naim of creating a pan-European energy market.\nConcerning the reasoned request in case\r\nECS-8/11 against Bosnia and Herzegovina, submitted by the Secretariat pursuant\r\nto Article 90 of the Treaty establishing the Energy Community, the Commission\r\nshall agree to a Ministerial Council Decision declaring the breach by this\r\nContracting Party of the relevant provisions of the Energy Community acquis\r\non gas (\"second package\"), as requested by the Secretariat. \nIf, in the light of the opinion that will\r\nbe issued by the Advisory Committee on Dispute Settlement, the Commission considers\r\nthat there are doubts about the existence of the alleged breaches, it shall ask\r\nthat the Ministerial Council decides on this by written procedure at a later\r\ndate, and in any case by 30th November, to allow for enough time for\r\nfixing an agreed EU position, based on a thorough assessment of the file by the\r\nLegal Services of the European Commission and of the European Council.\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Energy Strategy \u2013 Projects of\r\nEnergy Community Interest (PECIs)\nThe Commission shall approve the list of\r\nPECIs as proposed by the Energy Strategy Task Force and endorsed by the PHLG at\r\nits meeting on 19 June 2013. It shall invite Contracting Parties to take all\r\nthe necessary steps to facilitate a swift implementation of these projects. In\r\nthis respect, it shall welcome the regulatory investment incentives proposed by\r\nthe Energy Community Regulatory Board and shall support its endorsement by the\r\nMinisterial Council, emphasizing the need for enhanced cooperation among\r\nnational regulators. It shall clarify that the proposed incentives \u2013 to be\r\nlisted as an annex to the Ministerial Council conclusions \u2013 are not exhaustive\r\nand might be reviewed in the light of the on-going discussions in the European\r\nUnion.\nThe Commission shall take note of the fact\r\nthat other projects presented as candidate PECIs were declared eligible to be\r\nassessed by the Task Force and have their own merits, despite the fact that\r\nthey were not included in the PECI list.\nThe Commission shall agree to invite the\r\nSecretariat to review the implementation progress of each PECI, and to invite\r\nthe ECRB to review the impacts of regulatory (non)cooperation on the project\r\ndevelopment. The results of both actions are to be reported to the Ministerial\r\nCouncil in October 2014. Should this review show that no visible progress has\r\nbeen made in a given project for reasons that are attributable to the project\r\npromoter's responsibility, the Ministerial Council shall consider revoking the\r\nPECI label. The Commission shall agree that in case the PECI list proves to be\r\nan efficient tool to boost the project development, the list will be updated\r\nevery 2-3 years.\n2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Energy Community Treaty after\r\n2016\nThe Commission shall participate in the\r\nMinisterial debate along the lines of the 2011 Commission Report on the Energy\r\nCommunity[1]\r\nand of the Conclusions of the EU Council on strengthening the external\r\ndimension of the EU policy.[2]\nThe Commission shall approve the extension\r\nof the duration of the Energy Community Treaty for an additional period of 10\r\nyears, based on Article 97 of the same Treaty. The decision requires unanimity\r\nof the Parties (eight Contracting Parties and the European Union). Should the\r\nunanimity not be reached, the Treaty may continue to apply between those\r\nParties who voted in favour of extension, provided that their number amounted\r\nto at least two thirds of the Parties.\nThe Commission shall approve the setting up\r\nof a High Level Reflection Group mandated to assess the functioning of the\r\nTreaty and to propose potential improvements to this international organisation,\r\nincluding, as the case may be, amendments to the Treaty. The Group shall report\r\nregularly to the PHLG and present its conclusions at the meeting of the\r\nMinisterial Council in October 2014 in Kiev.\n2.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other decisions (under A\r\npoints, without discussion)\nThe Commission will approve the following\r\ndecisions:\n- Amendments to Procedural Act\r\n2006/01/MC-EnC (Rules of Procedure of the Ministerial Council), introducing the\r\nadoption of a biennial work-programme, in line with the biennial budget.\n- Outline of a Social Strategy, following\r\nthe conclusions of the Social Forum in 2012 and 2013.\nThe Commission shall support the adoption\r\nby the Energy Community of Commission Regulation (EU) No 147/2013 of 13\r\nFebruary 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council, on energy statistics, as regards the implementation of\r\nupdates for the monthly and annual energy statistics in the Energy Community.\r\nThe Decision being based on Title II of the Treaty, the European Union shall not\r\nvote.\nThe Commission will also endorse the\r\nconclusions of the meetings of the PHLG held since the 2012 Ministerial\r\nCouncil. \n2013/0301 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non establishing the European Union\r\nposition within the Ministerial Council of the Energy Community (Belgrade, 24th\r\nOctober 2013) \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 194 and 218,\r\nparagraph 9, thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2006/500/EC\r\nof 29 May 2006 on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy\r\nCommunity Treaty,[3]\r\nand in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: \nArticle 1\nIn view of the 11th meeting of the\r\nMinisterial Council of the Energy Community to be held in Belgrade on 24th\r\nOctober 2013, the position of the European Union regarding the issues falling\r\nunder the scope of Article 218, paragraph 9, of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union is set out in the Annex to this Decision.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX \r\nEuropean Union Position\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\r\napproves: \n\u00b7                        \r\nthe financial discharge of the Director of the\r\nEnergy Community Secretariat for 2012;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe Budget for 2014-2015, subject to approval by\r\nthe budget authority of the corresponding appropriations for both years;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe Energy Community Work Programme for 2014-2015;\n\u00b7                        \r\nthe amendments to Annex IV of the Energy\r\nCommunity Treaty, concerning the contributions of the parties to the Energy\r\nCommunity Budget, and in particular the increase of the EU contribution by\r\n0,40%, corresponding to the current contribution paid by Croatia;\n\u00b7                        \r\namendments to Article 16 and Annex II of the\r\nEnergy Community Treaty, in line with Council Decision of dd/mm/2013,\r\nauthorising the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the European Union\r\namendments to the Energy Community Treaty;\n\u00b7                        \r\na Ministerial Council Decision declaring the\r\nbreach by Bosnia & Herzegovina of provisions of the Energy Community acquis\r\non gas, identified by the Secretariat in its reasoned request, to the extent\r\nthat the alleged breach is confirmed by the Advisory Committee on Dispute\r\nSettlement in its opinion.
