This chemical element has therefore been recognised as a substance of global concern by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) since 2003\n1\n and is, at EU level, subject to a comprehensive set of control measures under the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury (\u201cthe Strategy\u201d) adopted in 2005\n2\n.\n\n\nBased on the policy approach defined in the Strategy, the EU has asked since 2005 for the negotiation of a global, legally binding instrument on mercury under the auspices of UNEP. Mercury is persistent and mercury emissions into the air are subject to long-range atmospheric transport, deposition all over the world and accumulation in the food chain, in particular in fish. Measures limited to the geographical area of the EU alone are therefore not sufficient to tackle the global mercury problem.\n\n\nThe agreed overall EU position (Council Conclusions of December 2008) called for a comprehensive mercury instrument, covering actions to reduce the supply of mercury; reduce the demand for mercury in products and processes; reduce international trade in mercury; reduce atmospheric emissions of mercury; achieve environmentally sound management of mercury-containing wastes; find environmentally sound storage solutions for mercury; address remediation of existing contaminated sites; and, increase knowledge. The Council stressed the importance of continuing to participate actively in negotiations on all elements of the future global mercury convention in its Conclusions of June 2012.\n\n\nBy Decision of the Governing Council GC 25/5 in February 2009, UNEP installed an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) and gave it a similarly broad mandate for a comprehensive global legally binding instrument on mercury.\n\n\nBased on this mandate, five INCs were held: INC-1 in Stockholm in June 2010, INC-2 in the town of Chiba, Japan, in January 2011, INC-3 in Nairobi, Kenya, in November 2011, INC-4 from 27 June to 2 July 2012 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and finally INC-5 in Geneva from 13 to 18 January 2013.\n\n\nOn 14 December 2010, the Council authorised the Commission to participate, on behalf of the EU, as regards matters falling within the Union's competence and in respect of which the Union has adopted rules, in the negotiations on a legally binding instrument on mercury, in consultation with a special committee of representatives of Member\u00a0States, and in accordance with the negotiating directives set out in the Addendum to this\u00a0authorisation. \n\n\nINC-5 came to closure as planned by agreeing to the text of a comprehensive global legally binding instrument to tackle mercury, as the Minamata Convention on Mercury, thereby fulfilling the mandate given by UNEP GC Decision 25/5 to conclude the negotiation process prior to the 27th Regular Session of the UNEP Governing Council (Nairobi, 18-22 February 2013).\n\n\nThe Union was a key driver for the conduct of this negotiating process and took an active part in the outcome which is within the limits of the negotiating directives addressed to the Commission.\n\n\nThe 27th session of the UNEP Governing Council welcomed the completion of the negotiation process and requested\u00a0the Executive Director to convene a conference of plenipotentiaries for the purpose of adopting the convention and of opening it for signature.\n\n\nThe new convention on mercury will be opened for signature at a Diplomatic Conference to be held in Kumamoto (Japan), 7-11 October 2013. It will be named \"Minamata Convention on Mercury\", after the town near Kumamoto where the worst ever case of mercury pollution took place in the years 1950.\n\n\nThe content of the convention on mercury is in line with the overall EU position, as agreed by Council in 2008 and confirmed in 2012.\n\n\nIn view of the above, it is appropriate for a representative of the European Union to sign, subject to subsequent conclusions, the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\n\n2013/0168 (NLE)\n\n\nProposal for a\n\n\nCOUNCIL DECISION\n\n\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Minamata Convention on Mercury\n\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\n\n\n\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\n\nWhereas:\n\n\n(1)Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic for the health of humans, animals and plants and is subject to regulation within the EU designed to protect human health and the environment.\n\n\n(2)The Governing Council of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) requested in 2009 the Executive Director to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee with the mandate to prepare a global legally binding instrument on mercury, with the goal of completing its work prior to the twenty-seventh regular session of the Governing Council in 2013.\n\n\n(3)In December 2010, the Council authorised the Commission to participate, on behalf of the Union, as regards matters falling within the Union's competence and in respect of which the  has adopted rules, in the negotiations on a legally binding instrument on mercury, in accordance with the negotiating directives\u00a0set out in the Addendum to this\u00a0authorisation.\n\n\n(4)The negotiation process was successfully completed, as initially planned, at the fifth session of the intergovernmental negotiating committee that took place in  from 13 to 18 January 2013.\n\n\n(5)The \u00a0was a key driver for the conduct of this negotiating process and took an active part in the outcome which is within the limits of the negotiating directives addressed to the Commission.\n\n\n(6)The Council, in its 3233rd\u00a0session on 21 March 2013, welcomed the outcome of the negotiation process.\n\n\n(7)The global legally binding instrument on mercury will be opened for signature at a Diplomatic Conference taking place in  () from 7 to 11 October 2013, as the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\n\n(8)Therefore, the\u00a0Convention should be signed on behalf of the , subject to its conclusion at a later date,\n\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \n\n\nArticle 1\n\n\nThe signing of the Minamata Convention on Mercury is hereby approved on behalf of the Union, subject to the conclusion of the said Convention.\n\n\nThe text of the Convention to be signed is attached to this Decision.\n\n\nArticle 2\n\n\nThe Council Secretariat General shall establish the instrument of full powers to sign the Convention, subject to its conclusion, for the person indicated by the negotiator of the Convention.\n\n\nArticle 3\n\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\n\n\nDone at Brussels, \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President\n\n\n\nANNEX \n\n\n(text of the Minamata Convention on Mercury)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nUNEP Governing Council Decision 23/9\n\n\n\n(2)\nCOM(2005)20 final, 28.1.2005; revised by COM(2010)723 final, 7.12.2010\n\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
