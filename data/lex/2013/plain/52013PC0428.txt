In this context, ensuring a smooth\nimplementation of the European Fisheries Fund programmes is of particular\nimportance for investment in the fisheries sector. \nProgramme implementation is often challenging,\nnot least as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from fiscal consolidation.\nThis is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most\naffected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under an\nadjustment programme. To date, seven countries have received financial\nassistance and have agreed a macro-economic adjustment programme with the\nCommission. These countries are Cyprus, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, hereafter called \"programme countries\". Hungary, Romania and   Latvia are no longer under an adjustment programme.\nTo ensure that these Member States (and any\nother Member State which may benefit from such assistance programmes in the\nfuture) continue to implement the fisheries policy programmes on the ground and\ncontinue to disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains\nprovisions that would allow the Commission to make increased payments to these\ncountries for the period they are under the support mechanisms, without\nmodifying their overall allocation under the fisheries policy for the period\n2007-2013. This will provide additional financial resources to the Member\nStates at a critical juncture and will facilitate the continued implementation\nof programmes on the ground.\n\u00b7     \nGeneral context and provisions in force in\nthe policy sphere of the proposal\nArticles 76 and 77 of Regulation (EC) No\n1198/2006, hereinafter Regulation, provides that the interim payments and the\nfinal balance shall be calculated by applying the co-financing rate for each\npriority axis laid down by the Commission decision adopting the operational\nprogramme concerned. It also provides for the application of an increased\nco-financing rate for programme countries. This provision currently applies\nuntil 31 December 2013.\n\u00b7     \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is consistent with other proposals\nand initiatives adopted by the Commission as a response to the financial\ncrisis.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF INTEREST\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\u00b7     \nConsultation of interested parties\nThere was no consultation of external\nstakeholders\n\u00b7     \nProcurement and use of expertise\nUse of external expertise has not been\nnecessary.\n\u00b7     \nImpact analysis\nThe proposal would allow the Commission to top\nup payments to programme countries until the end of the 2007-2013 period. The\nincrease will be an amount calculated by applying ten percentage points top-up\nto the co-financing rates applicable to the priority axes of the programmes to\nthe newly certified expenditure submitted during the period in question until\nthe ceiling for payments is reached. \nThe total financial allocation for the period\nfrom the Fund to the countries and the programmes in question will not change.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the\nproposal\n\u00b7     \nSummary of the proposed measures\nIt is proposed to modify article 77a of the\nRegulation to allow the Commission to continue, until the end of the\neligibility period of the 2007-2013 operational programmes, to reimburse the\nnewly declared expenditure by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10\npercentage points top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority\naxis.\nThe contribution from the fund to the priority\naxis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission\ndecision approving the operational programme.\n\u00b7     \nLegal basis\nThe Regulation defines the rules applicable to\nthe Fund. Based on the principle of shared management between the Commission\nand the Member States, this Regulation includes provisions for the programming\nprocess as well as arrangements for programme (including financial) management,\nmonitoring, financial control and evaluation of projects.\n\u00b7     \nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal complies within the subsidiarity\nprinciple to the extent that it seeks to provide increased support through the\nEuropean Fisheries Fund for certain Member States which are experiencing\nserious difficulties, notably with respect to economic growth and financial\nstability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt position, also as\na result of the international economic and financial environment. In this\ncontext, it is necessary to establish at the Union level a temporary mechanism\nwhich allows the Commission to increase the reimbursement on the basis of the\ncertified expenditure under the European Fisheries Fund. \n\u00b7     \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal conforms to the proportionality\nprinciple:\nThe extension of the application of the\nincreased co-financing rates is proportional in relation to the sustained\neconomic crisis and to the other efforts undertaken to help these Member\nStates.\n\u00b7     \nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: amendment of the current\nregulation.\nThe Commission has explored the scope for\nmanoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary, in the\nlight of experience up to now, to propose modifications to the General\nRegulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary impact\nThere is no impact on commitment appropriations\nsince no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the Fund financing\nprovided for in the operational programmes for the 2007-2013 programming\nperiod.\nFor payment appropriations, the proposal\nrelating to the top-up is budget neutral. However, it can result in a higher\nreimbursement to the Member States concerned in 2014, but will be balanced out\nat closure in 2017. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal\nwill imply an increase of payment appropriations (for 2014 of approximately EUR\n10 million) which will be compensated by the end of the programming period.\nTherefore, the total payment appropriations for the whole programming period\nremain unchanged.\n2013/0200 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non amending Council Regulation (EC) No\n1198/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management for\ncertain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with\nrespect to their financial stability\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The unprecedented global\nfinancial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth\nand financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial and\neconomic conditions in several Member States. In particular, certain Member\nStates are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such\ndifficulties, notably with problems in their economic growth and financial\nstability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt position.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Important actions to\ncounterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have been taken pursuant to\nArticles 122(2), 136 and 143 of the Treaty. However, pressure on national\nfinancial resources is increasing and appropiate steps are needed to alleviate\nthat pressure through the maximum and optimal use of the funding from the European\nFisheries Fund. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nmanagement of Union funding, to help accelerate investments in Member States\nand regions and to improve the availability of funding to the economy, Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund[3] was amended by Regulation (EU)\nNo 387/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] to allow the increase of\ninterim and final payments from the European Fisheries Fund by an amount\ncorresponding to ten percentage points above the actual co-financing rate for\neach priority axis for Member States which are facing serious difficulties with\nrespect to their financial stability and request to benefit from that measure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 5 of Article 77a\nof Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 allows for the application of that increased\nco-financing rate up to 31 December 2013. However, since Member States still\nface serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, the\napplication of the increased co-financing rate should not be limited to the end\nof 2013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006\nshould therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the unprecedented\ncrisis, swift adoption of support measures is needed. Therefore it is\nappropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006, paragraph\n5 of Article 77a is deleted.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the\nday of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. \nThis Regulation shall be binding in its\nentirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nProposal for a Regulation of the European\nParliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 as\nregards certain provisions relating to financial management for certain Member\nStates experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to\ntheir financial stability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABM / ABB FRAMEWORK\nPolicy Area(s) concerned and associated\nActivity/Activities:\nMaritime Affairs and Fisheries; ABB activity\n11.06\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGET LINES\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budget lines (operational\nlines and related technical and administrative assistance lines (ex- B.A\nlines)):\nThe proposed new action will be implemented\non the following budget lines:\n\u00b7      11.061200 Convergence (EFF)\n\u00b7      11.0613 Non-convergence (EFF)\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration of the action and\nof the financial impact:\nNone of the\nproposed changes will have a financial impact.
