This decision was taken\nin the wake of the events of 1 April 2010. On that day, on the orders of\nthe Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Antonio Indjai, a group\nof mutinous soldiers arrested Chief of Staff Jos\u00e9 Zamora Induta and the Prime\nMinister of Guinea-Bissau, Mr Gomes Junior. Following the mutiny, General Indjai\nbecame de facto Chief of Staff before being officially appointed on\n25 June 2010 by decree of the President, Mr Bacai Sanha, on a proposal\nfrom the government.\nThe appointment on 8 October 2010 of Rear\u2011Admiral\nBubo Na Tchuto as head of the navy constituted a further setback to good\ngovernance in Guinea-Bissau. Rear-Admiral Na Tchuto played a destabilising role\nin the aftermath of the mutiny of 1 April and is subject to sanctions\nimposed by international partners for his suspected involvement in illegal activities.\nThe European Union regards the mutiny of 1\nApril 2010 and the subsequent appointment of its main instigators to\nhigh-ranking posts in the military hierarchy as a serious and evident breach of\nthe essential elements of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement (respect for\ndemocratic principles) and as a case of special urgency within the meaning of\nArticle 96(2)(b) of the Agreement. A letter was therefore sent to the Guinea\u2011Bissau authorities on 2 February 2011 to invite them to hold\nconsultations.\nThe opening meeting of the consultations\ntook place in Brussels on 29 March 2011.\nIn the course\nof the meeting, the participants were informed of the proposals of the Guinea\u2011Bissau side for progressively ensuring the primacy of civilian authority,\nimproving democratic governance, guaranteeing the safeguarding of\nconstitutional order and the rule of law, and tackling impunity and organised\ncrime.\nThe Guinea-Bissau side undertook, in particular, to:\n\u00b7                        \nconduct and conclude judicial investigations and\nproceedings, with regard to the assassinations in March and June 2009, that are\nfully independent and carried out under appropriate logistical and security\nconditions;\n\u00b7                        \neffectively implement a reform of the security\nsector based on the strategy adopted by the national parliament and the\nlegislative package drawn up with the support of the EU\u2019s Common Security and\nDefence Policy (CSDP) mission;\n\u00b7                        \nensure the appointment to senior posts in the\nmilitary of persons not involved in unconstitutional or illegal conduct or acts\nof violence, in line with the conclusions and recommendations of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) roadmap for security sector reform;\n\u00b7                        \napprove and assist an experts\u2019 mission to\nsupport security sector reform and the protection of political figures, to be\ncarried out with the support of ECOWAS, the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries (CPLP) and/or other partners;\n\u00b7                        \nprepare, adopt and effectively implement\nnational operational plans to implement security sector reform and combat drug\ntrafficking;\n\u00b7                        \nimprove the administrative and financial\nmanagement of civilian and military employees, and measures to combat money\nlaundering.\nThe European\nUnion noted these undertakings in its conclusions of the consultations. It\nurged the representatives of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to carry out\njudicial investigations and proceedings into the events of 1 April 2010, to step\nup efforts to tackle the problem of impunity and to specify a more detailed\ntimetable for implementation of the undertakings in compliance with the\ntimeframe in the ECOWAS roadmap.\nThe European Union decided on 18 July 2011, by Council Decision\n2011/492/EU, to adopt appropriate measures for the fulfilment of these\nundertakings, including a scheme of mutual commitments for the gradual resumption\nof EU cooperation.\nAn Article 96 follow-up mission took place\nin Bissau on 18-20 January 2012. The mission report pointed to an insufficient\ndegree of implementation of the first group of commitments indicated in Council\nDecision 2011/492/EU, which ruled out unblocking the corresponding cooperation\nprogrammes. The report was endorsed by the Council\u2019s Africa Working Group on 15\nFebruary 2012.\nOn 12 April 2012, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by elements of the armed\nforces took place after the first round of the Presidential elections called\nfollowing the death of President Bacai Sanha in January; the acting President\nand the Prime Minister were arrested.\nSince then, ECOWAS has been mediating to broker a solution leading\nto the restoration of democratic order in Guinea-Bissau, but little progress\nhas been achieved to date towards a return to constitutional order.\nBy Council Decision 2012/387/EU of 16 July 2012, Council Decision\n2011/492/EU was extended by one year, until 19 July 2013.\nThe Commission considers it important that Council Decision\n2011/492/EU is not allowed to expire, as it provides a fundamental framework\nfor the promotion of democratic stability in Guinea-Bissau. It is therefore\nproposed that it be further extended until 19 July 2014. \nAfter 31 December 2013, date of expiry of the 10th EDF,\nand before the entry into force of the 11th EDF, the EU commitments\nindicated in the schedule annexed to Council Decision 2011/492/EU would be\nfunded by the bridging facility to be established. \nThe substance of the Decision (i.e. detailed conditionality and EU\nresponses) may require adaptation as the political situation changes, but at\nthis time it is not possible to predict such changes with sufficient accuracy.\nConclusion\nIn the light of the above, the Council is\nrequested to adopt the attached draft proposal for a Council Decision extending\nthe period of application of the appropriate measures with regard to Guinea-Bissau.\n2013/0208 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nextending the period of application of the\nappropriate measures in Decision 2011/492/EU concerning the conclusion of\nconsultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau under Article 96 of the ACP-EC\nPartnership Agreement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States of the other\npart, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[1] (hereinafter referred to as the\n\u2018ACP-EC Partnership Agreement\u2019), as revised at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on 22\nJune 2010[2],\nand in particular Article 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement on\nmeasures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the implementation of\nthe ACP-EC Partnership Agreement[3],\nand in particular Article 3 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\n2011/492/EU, consultations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau under Article 96\nof the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement were concluded and appropriate measures, as\nspecified in the Annex to that Decision, were taken.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\n2012/387/EU, Council Decision 2011/492/EU was extended by one year, until 19\nJuly 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essential elements\ncited in Article 9 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement continue to be violated\nand the current conditions in Guinea-Bissau do not ensure respect for human\nrights, democratic principles and the rule of law.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2011/492/EU should\ntherefore be amended to extend further the period of application of the\nappropriate measures,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nDecision 2011/492/EU is hereby amended as\nfollows:\nArticle 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018This Decision shall enter into force on\nthe date of its adoption.\nIt shall expire on 19 July 2014.\nIt shall be reviewed regularly at least\nonce every six months, preferably in the light of joint monitoring missions by\nthe European External Action Service and the Commission.\u2019\nArticle 2\nThe letter annexed to the present Decision\nshall be sent to the authorities of Guinea-Bissau.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\ndate of its adoption.
