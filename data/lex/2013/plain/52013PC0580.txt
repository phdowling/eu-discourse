Multiannual framework 2007-13\nUnder the multiannual framework 2007-13,\r\nthe General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties was established. Its\r\nkey objective was to ensure effective operational cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, including its consequences, organised crime and general\r\ncrime, to support the provision of intelligence on a European scale and to\r\nstrengthen the prevention of crime and terrorism, in order to promote secure\r\nsocieties based on the rule of law.\nGiven that these objectives had different\r\nlegal bases in the Treaties and fundamentally different legal regimes, the General\r\nProgramme was composed of two different legal instruments. Firstly, Council\r\nDecision 2007/125/JHA established the Specific Programme \u2018Prevention of and Fight\r\nagainst Crime\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018ISEC specific programme\u2019). The specific\r\nprogramme focused on four thematic areas: crime prevention and criminology, law\r\nenforcement, protection and support to witnesses, and protection of victims. Secondly,\r\nCouncil Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom established the Specific Programme \u2018Prevention,\r\nPreparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security-related\r\nrisks\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018CIPS specific programme\u2019). Its general\r\nobjective was to support Member States\u2019 efforts to prevent, prepare for, and\r\nprotect people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other\r\nsecurity-related incidents.\n1.2. Multiannual framework 2014-20\nWithin the comprehensive framework of the\r\nInternal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police\r\ncooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \u2018the ISF-Police\u2019) will provide financial support for police\r\ncooperation, exchange of and access to information, crime prevention and the\r\nfight against cross-border and serious and organised crime, including\r\nterrorism, the protection of people and critical infrastructure against\r\nsecurity-related incidents and the effective management of security-related\r\nrisks and crises.\nConsequently, the ISEC and CIPS specific\r\nprogrammes providing financial support for this policy area under the\r\nmultiannual framework 2007-13 have to be repealed with effect from 1 January\r\n2014, subject to transitional rules.\nAs far as the ISEC specific programme is\r\nconcerned, it is repealed by the Regulation establishing the ISF-Police.\nAs for the CIPS specific programme, it was\r\nnot possible to do the same because its repeal requires a separate legal act,\r\ndue to the different voting rules under its double legal base (EC/Euratom). However,\r\nthe final provision concerning the entry into force of this Decision is drafted\r\nin such a way that the repeal of the CIPS specific programme will coincide with\r\nthe entry into force of the Regulation establishing the ISF-Police as if the\r\nrepeal of the CIPS specific programme was stated in the Regulation establishing\r\nthe ISF-Police itself. Therefore the repeal of the CIPS and ISEC specific programmes\r\nwill be dealt with in exactly the same way.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF

programme be repealed\r\nwith effect from 1 January 2014.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nCouncil Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom was\r\nadopted on the basis of Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community\r\nand Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.\nThe legal basis of this proposal to repeal\r\nthe abovementioned Council Decision is Article 352 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union and Article 203 of the Treaty establishing\r\nthe European Atomic Energy Community.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal does not have any direct\r\nimplication for the EU budget.\n2013/0281 (APP)\nProposal for
