The EU pharmacovigilance legislation for medicinal products\nfor human use has been subject to a major review and an impact assessment that\nled to the adoption of a revised legislation[3]\nin 2010, which strengthens and rationalises the system for safety monitoring of\nmedicines on the European market. This legislation is applicable as of July\n2012. It provides for a number of EU-wide procedures to assess\npharmacovigilance data which may lead to regulatory action. Some additional\namendments to the pharmacovigilance legislation were introduced in 2012\nfollowing the 'Mediator' case[4].\n\nWhilst streamlining the EU-wide\npost-authorisation safety assessment and monitoring of medicines, the revised\npharmacovigilance legislation significantly widened the tasks of the European\nMedicines Agency ('the Agency') with regard to pharmacovigilance, irrespective\nof whether the medicinal products have been authorised via the 'centralised\nprocedure' (in accordance with the Regulation) or via national procedures (in\naccordance with the Directive). The Agency has therefore acquired\npharmacovigilance competences also for nationally authorised medicines, in\naddition to reinforced competences for centrally authorised medicines. \nTo finance these activities, the revised pharmacovigilance\nlegislation provides for fees to be charged to marketing authorisation holders.\nThese fees should be related to pharmacovigilance activities performed at the\nlevel of the EU, notably in the context of the EU-wide assessment procedures.\nThese procedures include scientific assessment carried out by rapporteurs from the\nnational competent authorities of the Member States. These fees are therefore\nnot intended to cover the pharmacovigilance activities of the national\ncompetent authorities performed at national level. Member States may\naccordingly continue to charge fees for the activities performed at national\nlevel which should, however, not overlap with the fees laid down in this legal\nproposal.\nSince the revised pharmacovigilance\nlegislation only concerns medicinal products for human use, this proposal on\nfees for pharmacovigilance only covers these medicinal products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nPublic Consultation\nAs part of the preparation of this legal\nproposal on fees for pharmacovigilance, DG SANCO, in close collaboration with\nthe Agency, drafted a concept paper for public consultation. Given that the\nUnion-wide pharmacovigilance procedures foreseen in the revised\npharmacovigilance legislation are new procedures, the concept paper used\nexisting procedures that were considered sufficiently similar as benchmarks for\nthe new procedures. In addition, a pharmacovigilance service fee to be charged\non an annual basis was considered in the paper, in order to cover those\nactivities of the Agency that benefit industry in general, but for which it is virtually\nimpossible to identify the individual addressee(s).\nThe Commission launched the public\nconsultation on 18 June 2012 with a deadline for replies on 15 September 2012.\nIn total, 85 replies were received (mainly from industry, but also from the Member States and other stakeholders). The summary of the replies to the public consultation\nwas published on the website of DG SANCO on 29 November 2012. In general, the\ncomments were rather negative, notably as regards the amounts proposed for the\nfees. They were considered to be too high and without sufficient justification\nas regards the workload and costs. Grouping of marketing authorisation holders,\nespecially for submitting a single Periodic Safety Update Report, was\nconsidered by many as not applicable in practice. Many respondents questioned\nthe benchmarks that were used and considered that pharmacovigilance fees should\nbe rather based on estimations of the time spent and the associated cost of the\nassessment work. Several industry respondents flagged the risk of possible double\ncharging of the Agency and the Member States, given that many of the competent\nauthorities in the Member States currently charge fees for pharmacovigilance.\nParticular concerns were expressed by small and medium-sized enterprises,\nstating that despite the proposed fee reductions in the concept paper, the\namounts were still too high. Also many responses from industry associations,\nrepresenting products such as generic medicinal products, considered that the\nproposed fee levels would unfairly affect marketing authorisation holders with\na large portfolio of products with well-established safety profiles. \nImpact assessment\nIn line with the above-mentioned comments,\nthe Impact Assessment report that accompanies this proposal considered several\noptions, based on estimation of cost. This new approach is in line with the\nrecommendations of the European Court of Auditors[5] and the European Parliament[6] to base the payment system for\nservices provided by Member States' authorities on costs. \nConsistent with the legal proposal on\npharmacovigilance of 2008 and with the EU legislation on pharmacovigilance, all\noptions of legislative action were based on the assumption that the total cost\nrelated to pharmacovigilance would be covered through fees. Regulation (EU) No\n1235/2010 provides notably for a new wording of article 67(3) of Regulation\n(EC) No 726/2004: 'The Agency\u2019s revenue shall consist of a contribution from\nthe Union and fees paid by undertakings for obtaining and maintaining Union\nmarketing authorisations and for other services provided by the Agency, or by\nthe coordination group as regards the fulfilment of its tasks in accordance\nwith Articles 107c, 107e, 107g, 107k and 107q of Directive 2001/83/EC.\u2019 Recital\n13 notably states that 'It should be ensured that adequate funding is possible\nfor pharmacovigilance activities by empowering the Agency to charge fees to\nmarketing authorisation holders. ' and Recital 24 explains that the new legal\nprovisions 'widen the tasks of the Agency with regard to pharmacovigilance,\nincluding the monitoring of literature cases, the improved use of information\ntechnology tools and the provision of more information to the general public.\nThe Agency should be enabled to fund these activities from fees charged to\nmarketing authorisation holders.'\nThe selected option foresees two separate types\nof fees:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fees for procedures for\nthe assessment of periodic safety update reports, post-authorisation safety\nstudies and pharmacovigilance referrals. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An annual flat fee to be\ncharged to marketing authorisation holders having at least one medicinal\nproduct that is authorised in the EU and registered in the database provided for\nin Article 57(1)(l) of the Regulation. This annual flat fee would cover only\nthe costs of the pharmacovigilance activities of the Agency other than those\nrelated to the above-mentioned procedures. Therefore, it is foreseen that the\nfee revenue from the annual flat fee be retained by the Agency. \nSome fee reductions and fee waivers are\nforeseen in respect of the proposed fees: \n\u00b7      In line with the general EU policy to support small and medium-sized\nenterprises, reductions for medicinal products for which the marketing\nauthorisation holder is a small or medium-sized enterprise would be granted for\nall types of fees. Micro enterprises would be exempted from all fees. The\nreduction rates for small and medium-sized enterprises are based on the\ncomparisons of data of added values per employee in the sector, as a possible\nmeasure of profitability of companies. The proposed contribution of small and\nmedium enterprises to the financing of pharmacovigilance was reduced\naccordingly, whereas micro-enterprises should be entirely exempt from the\nobligation to pay pharmacovigilance fees. \n\u00b7      Moreover, certain fee reductions reflect the risk-based approach of\nthe pharmacovigilance legislation acknowledging the differences in the safety\nprofile of new and more established medicinal products for which time has\nallowed to collect data. A reduction of the annual flat fee is therefore proposed\nfor authorised generic, homeopathic and herbal medicinal products and for\nmedicinal products authorised on grounds of well-established medical use. However,\nwhere these medicinal products are included in the Union-wide pharmacovigilance\nprocedures, the full fees for procedures would apply. Registered homeopathic\nand herbal medicinal products would be exempted from all fees. \n\u00b7      Finally, as marketing authorisation holders for medicinal products\nauthorised under the Regulation currently pay an annual fee to the Agency for\nmaintenance of the authorisation including pharmacovigilance activities covered\nby the proposed fee, these marketing authorisations would be exempted from the\nannual flat fee in order to avoid double charging.\nMarketing authorisation holders would be\ncharged as follows: \n\u00b7      Marketing authorisation holders having at least one product involved\nin a Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedure would be charged a fee for procedures,\n\u00b7      Marketing authorisation holders in the EU[7], with the exceptions explained\nabove, would be charged the annual flat fee.\nTherefore, marketing authorisation holders\nthat are not involved in any EU procedure would only pay the annual flat fee\ncomponent, with the above-mentioned exceptions.\nThe criteria that were identified as the\nmost decisive in analysing the impact of options were fairness, proportionality\nand transparency of the overall pharmacovigilance fee system, including the\nadequacy of the relation between the work carried out and the type and level of\nfee. Other important criteria considered within the analysis were the stability\nand the simplicity of the Agency pharmacovigilance fee-system. \nUnder the selected option, fees are\nproportionate to the workload and the costs, but cannot be entirely predictable\nby the inherent nature of the pharmacovigilance activities. In order to avoid\nextreme cases and to allow for a readable, applicable and usable legislative\ntext, it is proposed that procedure-based fees generate an average fee revenue\nthat is based on the average estimated cost of each procedure.\nA combination of procedure-based fees and an\nannual flat fee has been considered to be the most transparent, cost-based, activity-based\nand proportionate way of setting the new fees, in order to cover the cost under\nthe new pharmacovigilance legislation. This analysis was carried out in the\nlight of a strong preference expressed by stakeholders for a policy approach\nbased on fairness and transparency. With this approach, the products being part\nof a pharmacovigilance procedure at EU level will contribute to the financing\nof the cost of the procedure. This is also in line with the risk-based approach\nof the pharmacovigilance legislation. At the same time, the cost of general\npharmacovigilance activities of the Agency, and only that part of its total\npharmacovigilance cost, would be recouped through the annual flat fee charged to\nmarketing authorisation holders who benefit overall from the EU\npharmacovigilance system. These activities of the Agency relate notably to the\ninformation technology systems, safety data management and literature\nmonitoring.\nIn order to have a fair system, it was\nconsidered necessary to identify a single, chargeable unit as there are\ndifferent ways in the EU of assigning authorisation numbers to and counting medicinal\nproducts. To facilitate adverse reaction reporting and signal detection, it is\nnecessary to describe medicinal products with maximum precision in order to\ntake account of differences in strength, pharmaceutical forms, routes of\nadministration etc. Therefore, the Agency has set up the structure of the\ndatabase described in Article 57(2) of the Regulation to neutralise these\ndifferences by means of individual entries. These entries have been chosen as a\nchargeable unit.\nRemuneration of Member States\nauthorities acting as rapporteurs\nIn line with the above-mentioned\nrecommendations of the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament, it\nis proposed that rapporteurs from the national competent authorities of the\nMember States be remunerated according to a fixed scale based on estimations of\ncost. The amount of remuneration is based on the average procedure costs as\nestimated for each type of procedure. Where fee reductions apply, the\nremuneration of the Member States will be adjusted accordingly, including\nreductions for small and medium-sized enterprises which are in line with the\npolicy of the Union to support small and medium-sized enterprises.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe Agency is a European decentralised Agency\nestablished under the Regulation and hence the decision on its funding and\ncharging of fees is to be taken at the EU level. The new pharmacovigilance\nlegislation provides a legal base for the Agency to charge fees for\npharmacovigilance. Hence, only the Union can act to enable the Agency to charge\nfees for pharmacovigilance.\nOnly pharmacovigilance activities that are\nperformed at EU level and involving the Agency are covered by this proposal. As\nregards pharmacovigilance activities remaining at national level, the EU is not\ncompetent and Member States may still continue charging national fees\naccordingly.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal does not go beyond what is\nnecessary to achieve the general objective pursued, i.e. to introduce fees in\norder to allow the proper implementation of the pharmacovigilance legislation\nthat is applicable since July 2012.\nLegal basis\nThe proposed Regulation is, like the EU\npharmacovigilance legislation based on a dual legal basis: Article 114 and\nArticle 168(4)(c) TFEU. The proposed Regulation is based on Article 114 TFEU as\ndifferences between national legislative, regulatory and administrative\nprovisions on medicinal products tend to hinder intra-Union trade and therefore\ndirectly affect the operation of the internal market. This Regulation ensures\nthe availability of the necessary financial resources to apply the stream-lined\nUnion procedures for the assessment of serious safety issues for nationally\nauthorised products, which have been introduced amongst other things to prevent\nor eliminate obstacles that could result from parallel procedures at national\nlevel. Thereby this Regulation contributes to the well-functioning of the\ninternal market and the common post-marketing surveillance of medicinal\nproducts.\nIn addition, the proposed Regulation is\nbased on Article 168(4)(c) TFEU as it aims at supporting the goal of setting\nhigh standards of quality and safety of medicinal products. According to\nArticles 168(4) and 4(2)(k) TFEU this Union competence is \u2013 like Article 114\nTFEU - a shared competence which is exercised with the adoption of the proposed\nRegulation.\nThe proposed Regulation aims at setting\nhigh standards of quality and safety for medicinal products as it ensures the\navailability of sufficient financial resources to perform the pharmacovigilance\nactivities that are necessary to guarantee that high standards are maintained\nonce the product is authorised.\nArticle 168(4)(c) TFEU cannot serve as sole\nlegal basis, but needs to be complemented with the legal basis of Article 114\nTFEU as it, as set out above, pursues equally as object the establishment and\nfunctioning of the internal market, and the setting of high standards of\nquality and safety for medicinal products.\nChoice of the legal instrument\nSince the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union became applicable, all legislative procedures are normally based\non the previous 'co-decision procedure' involving both the Council and the\nEuropean Parliament. Therefore, for legal certainty, it is proposed to create\nfor pharmacovigilance fees a new Regulation of the Council and the European\nParliament, which will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure (Article\n294 of the TFEU). \nThe adoption of a proposal for a Regulation\non pharmacovigilance fees is aimed at allowing the Agency to have adequate\nfunding in order to properly implement the already applicable pharmacovigilance\nlegislation. \nThe existing Council Regulation (EC) No\n297/95[8]\nof 10 February 1995 on fees payable to the Agency would continue to apply,\nwhereas the proposed Regulation would apply to pharmacovigilance fees for\nactivities laid down in the applicable pharmacovigilance legislation. The two\nlegal instruments would be complementary.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nConsistent with the legal proposal on\npharmacovigilance of 2008 and with the Pharmacovigilance legislation adopted in\n2010, according to which the Agency should be enabled to fund pharmacovigilance\nactivities from fees charged to marketing authorisation holders (see section on\nImpact Assessment), all options of legislative action, including the option\nwhich underpins this proposal, were based on the assumption that the costs\nrelated to pharmacovigilance would be covered through fees. \nTherefore, no impact on the EU general\nbudget is foreseen in the accompanying financial statement of this proposal.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe\nproposed act is of relevance to the EEA.\n2013/0222 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non fees payable to the European Medicines\nAgency for the conduct of pharmacovigilance activities in respect of medicinal\nproducts for human use\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article\n168(4)(c) thereof\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[9],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[10],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative\nprocedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The revenues of the European\nMedicines Agency (hereinafter \u2018the Agency\u2019) consist of a contribution from the\nUnion and fees paid by undertakings for obtaining and maintaining Union\nmarketing authorisations and for other services referred to in Article 67(3) of\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31\nMarch 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and\nsupervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing\na European Medicines Agency[11].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions on pharmacovigilance\nrelating to medicinal products of human use laid down in Regulation (EC) No\n726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for\nhuman use[12]\nwere amended by Directive 2010/84/EU of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 15 December 2010 amending, as regards pharmacovigilance,\nDirective 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for\nhuman use[13],\nRegulation (EU) No 1235/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n15 December 2010 amending, as regards pharmacovigilance of medicinal\nproducts for human use, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community\nprocedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for\nhuman and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency, and\nRegulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products[14], Directive 2012/26/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 amending\nDirective 2001/83/EC as regards pharmacovigilance[15] and Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 amending\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004 as regards pharmacovigilance[16]. Those amendments only cover medicinal\nproducts for human use. Those amendments provide for new pharmacovigilance tasks\nfor the Agency including Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedures, the\nmonitoring of literature cases, the improved information technology tools and\nthe provision of more information to the general public. Furthermore, the\npharmacovigilance legislation stipulates that the Agency should be enabled to\nfund those activities from fees charged to marketing authorisation holders. New\ncategories of fees should therefore be created to cover the new and specific\ntasks of the Agency.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enable the\nAgency to charge fees for those new pharmacovigilance tasks, a Regulation\nshould be adopted. The fees provided for in this Regulation should be\napplicable without prejudice to the fees laid down in Council Regulation (EC)\nNo 297/95 of 10 February 1995 on fees payable to the Agency [17]as that Regulation covers fees\nfor activities of the Agency in respect of medicinal products authorised under\nRegulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should be\nbased on the double legal basis of Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It aims at financing\npharmacovigilance activities that contribute to achieving an internal market as\nregards medicinal products for human use, taking as a base a high level of\nprotection of health. At the same time, the Regulation provides financial\nresources supporting the activities to address common safety concerns in order\nto maintain high standards of quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal\nproducts for human use. Both objectives are being pursued simultaneously and\nare inseparably linked, so that one is not secondary to another.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The structure and amounts\nof the fees for pharmacovigilance collected by the Agency as well as the rules\nfor payment should be established. The structure of the fees should be as simple\nas possible to apply in order to minimise the related administrative burden.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nline with the Joint Statement of\nthe European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission of 19\nJuly 2012 on the Common Approach on decentralised agencies, for bodies for\nwhich the revenue is constituted by fees and charges in addition to the Union\ncontribution, fees should be set at a level such as to avoid a deficit or a\nsignificant accumulation of surplus and be revised when this is not the case. Therefore, the fees set out in this Regulation should be based on\nan evaluation of the Agency\u2019s estimations and forecasts as regards its workload\nand related costs and on the basis of an evaluation of the costs of the work\ncarried out by the competent authorities of the Member States acting as\nrapporteurs in accordance with Articles 61(6), 62(1) of Regulation (EC) No\n726/2004 and Articles 107e 107q and 107j of Directive 2001/83/EC.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fees referred to in this\nRegulation should be transparent, fair and proportionate to the work carried\nout.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should only\nrefer to fees which are to be levied by the Agency, whereas the competence to\ndecide on possible fees levied by the competent authorities of the Member\nStates should remain with the Member States. Marketing authorisation\nholders should not be charged twice for the same pharmacovigilance activity. Member\nStates should therefore not levy fees for the activities which are covered by\nthis Regulation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of\npredictability and clarity, the amounts of the fees should be established in\neuro.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two different types of fees\nshould be levied under this Regulation in order to take account of the\ndiversity of tasks of the Agency and of the rapporteurs. Firstly, fees for the\npharmacovigilance procedures carried out at Union level should be charged to\nthose marketing authorisation holders whose medicinal products are part of the\nprocedure. Those procedures relate to the assessment of periodic safety update\nreports, assessment of post-authorisation safety studies and assessments in the\ncontext of referrals initiated as a result of pharmacovigilance data. Secondly,\nan annual flat fee should be charged for other pharmacovigilance activities\ncarried out by the Agency that benefit marketing authorisation holders overall.\nThose activities relate to information technology, notably maintenance of the\n'Eudravigilance' database referred to in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No\n726/2004, signal detection and monitoring of selected medical literature. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marketing authorisation\nholders for medicinal products authorised under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004\nalready pay an annual fee to the Agency for the maintenance of their\nauthorisations, which includes pharmacovigilance activities that are covered by\nthe annual flat fee established by this Regulation. In order to avoid double charging\nfor those pharmacovigilance activities of the Agency, the annual flat fee\nestablished by this Regulation should not be charged for marketing\nauthorisations granted under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The work carried out at Union\nlevel in respect of the assessment of non-interventional post-authorisation\nsafety studies imposed by an authority and of which the protocol has been\nendorsed by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, involves the\nsupervision of these studies, starting from the assessment of the draft\nprotocol, and is not limited to the assessment of the final study reports. Therefore,\nthe fee levied for this procedure in respect of studies that have been\nfinalised should cover all the work relating to the study. In order to avoid\ndouble charging, marketing authorisation holders who are charged the fee for the\nassessment of non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies imposed by\nan authority, should be exempted from any other fee charged by a competent\nauthority for the submission of those studies.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rapporteurs rely for their\nassessment on the scientific evaluation and resources of national marketing\nauthorisation bodies, whilst it is the responsibility of the Agency to coordinate\nthe existing scientific resources put at its disposal by the Member States. In\nview of that and to ensure adequate resources for the scientific assessments\nrelating to the Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedures, the Agency should\nremunerate the scientific assessment services provided by the rapporteurs appointed\nby Member States as members of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee referred\nto in Article 56(1)(aa) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or, where relevant, by\nrapporteurs in the coordination group referred to in Article 27 of Directive 2001/83/EC.\nThe level of remuneration for the work carried out by those rapporteurs should\nbe based on average estimations of the workload involved and should be taken\ninto account in setting the level of the fees for Union-wide pharmacovigilance\nprocedures. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fees should be levied on a\nfair basis on all marketing authorisation holders. Therefore, a single\nchargeable unit should be established irrespective of the procedure under which\nthe medicinal product has been authorised, either under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004\nor under Directive 2001/83/EC and the way in which authorisation numbers are\nassigned by the Member States. The individual entries corresponding to authorisations in the database referred to in Article\n57(1)(l) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 based on information from the\nlist of all medicinal products for human use authorised in the Union referred\nto in Article 57(2) thereof meet this\nobjective.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the policy of\nthe Union to support small and medium-sized enterprises, reduced fees should\napply to small and medium-sized enterprises within the meaning of Commission\nRecommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro,\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises[18].\nConsistent with this policy, micro enterprises within the meaning of that\nRecommendation should be exempted from all fees under this Regulation. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generic medicinal products,\nmedicinal products authorised under the provisions relating to well-established\nmedicinal use, authorised homeopathic medicinal products and authorised herbal\nmedicinal products should be subject to a reduced annual flat fee as those\nproducts generally have a well-established safety profile. However, in cases\nwhere these products are part of any of the Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedures,\nthe full fee should be charged in view of the work involved. As the legislation\non pharmacovigilance encourages the conduct of joint post authorisation safety\nstudies, marketing authorisation holders should share the applicable fee in case\na joint study is submitted.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Homeopathic and herbal\nmedicinal products registered in accordance with Article 14 and Article 16a of\nDirective 2001/83/EC should be excluded from this Regulation as the pharmacovigilance\nactivities for these products are carried out by the Member States.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\ndisproportionate administrative workload for the Agency, reductions and\nexemptions provided for in this Regulation should apply on the basis of a\ndeclaration of the marketing authorisation holder that claims to be entitled to\nthe reduction or the exemption.

It is of particular importance that the\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nRegulation, namely to ensure adequate funding of pharmacovigilance activities\ncarried out at the level of the Union, cannot sufficiently be achieved by the\nMember States and can, by reason of the scale of the measure, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve that objective.\nFor reasons of predictability, legal certainty and proportionality, the annual\nflat fee should be levied for the first time by 31 January or by 1 July,\ndepending on the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The fees for union-wide\npharmacovigilance procedures should be levied for the first time after a reasonable\ntime period, following the entry into force of this Regulation, has elapsed. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply to fees for pharmacovigilance activities relating to medicinal products\nfor human use authorised in the Union under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and\nDirective 2001/83/EC which shall be levied by the European Medicines Agency\n(hereinafter the \u2018Agency\u2019) on marketing authorisation holders. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation determines\nthe activities performed at Union level for which fees are due, the amounts and\nthe rules of payment of those fees and the level of remuneration of the\nrapporteurs.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Micro enterprises within the\nmeaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC shall be exempted from any fee under this\nRegulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fees provided for in\nthis Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the fees laid down in Council\nRegulation (EC) No 297/95[20].\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Chargeable unit' means each\nindividual entry in the database referred to in Article 57(1)(l) of Regulation\n(EC) No 726/2004 based on information from the list of all medicinal products\nfor human use authorised in the Union referred to in Article 57(2) thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Medium enterprise\u2019 means a medium-sized enterprise\nwithin the meaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Small enterprise\u2019 means a small enterprise within the\nmeaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC;\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u2018Micro enterprise\u2019 means\na micro enterprise within the meaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC.\nArticle 3\nTypes\nof fees\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fees for pharmacovigilance\nactivities shall consist of the following:\n(a)         \nfees for Union-wide procedures as provided for\nin Articles 4, 5 and 6 (hereinafter 'fees for procedures');\n(b)         \nan annual flat fee as provided for in Article 7.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a fee is levied by\nthe Agency in accordance with paragraph 1(a), the Agency shall remunerate the rapporteur\nin the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee appointed by the Member\nState or the rapporteur in the coordination group (hereinafter 'the\nrapporteur') for the work they carry out for the Agency or the coordination\ngroup.

Cost estimations and\ncalculations in this Annex are based on this principle and,\ntherefore, the proposed measures are not expected to have any financial impact\non the budget of the Union.\nThe cost estimations comprise cost of the Agency\nactivities and cost of rapporteurs' assessment activities. The amounts to be\nrespectively retained by the Agency and paid to rapporteurs where assessment\nhas taken place are estimated accordingly.\nAmounts that are proposed for remuneration\nof rapporteurs are based on the estimated average cost of assessment work in\nthe context of the pharmacovigilance procedures of the Union.\nThe costing table provides four general\nheadings of cost:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Periodic Safety Update\nReports assessment (procedural cost, both for the Agency and rapporteurs of\nMember States)\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Post Authorisation Safety\nStudy assessment (procedural cost, both for the Agency and rapporteurs of\nMember States)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pharmacovigilance (Safety)\nReferral (procedural cost, both for the Agency and rapporteurs of Member States)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other cost: non-procedural\ncost, only incurred by the Agency. This heading includes ICT systems (e.g.\nEudraVigilance database, repository of periodic safety update reports),\nliterature monitoring, ADR ('adverse drug reaction': reports on adverse effects\nof medicines) management and signal detection and risk management, within the scope\nof the Agency's responsibilities.\nRemuneration of rapporteurs of Member\nStates is foreseen for work provided with respect to headings (1), (2) and (3),\ni.e. for the three Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedures. These three\nprocedures will entail procedure-based fees, calculated based on cost\nestimation of the Agency's and rapporteurs' activities.\nAs regards the EMA's cost in heading\n'Other', it is proposed to recoup this cost through an annual flat fee to be\ncharged to marketing authorisation holders for authorised products registered by\nthe Agency based on the list referred to in Article 57(2) of Regulation EC No\n726/2004, using chargeable units as defined in the proposed Regulation. Cost\nestimations under this heading (4) include only costs of the Agency, whereas\nMember States may continue charging national fees to cover costs at national\nlevel.\nPeriodic Safety Update Reports\nassessment\nThe estimated number of periodic safety\nupdate reports assessment procedures expected by the Agency is 600 per year.\nThe total estimated cost related to these assessments is \u20ac 11,3 m per year\n(\u20ac 3,4 m Agency cost and \u20ac 7,9 m rapporteur remuneration). The\naverage cost for the proposed procedure-related fee is \u20ac 19 500 per\nprocedure[39].\nThe average part of the cost on which the proposed rapporteur remuneration is\nbased is \u20ac 13 100 per procedure.\nPost-Authorisation Safety Study\nassessment\nThe estimated number of post-authorisation\nsafety study assessments expected by the Agency is 35 per year. The total\nestimated cost related to these assessments is \u20ac 1,5 m per year\n(\u20ac 0,9 m Agency cost and \u20ac 0,6 m rapporteur remuneration).\nThe average cost on which the proposed procedure-related fee is based is\n\u20ac 43 000 per procedure. The average part of the cost on which the proposed\nrapporteur remuneration is based is \u20ac 18 200 per procedure. \nPharmacovigilance Referral assessment\nThe estimated number of Pharmacovigilance\nReferral assessments expected by the Agency is 40 per year. The total estimated\ncost related to these assessments is \u20ac 6,7 m per year (\u20ac 4,9 m\nAgency cost and \u20ac 1,8 m rapporteur remuneration). The average cost on\nwhich the proposed procedure-related fee is based is \u20ac 168 600 per procedure.\nThe average part of the cost on which the proposed rapporteur remuneration is\nbased is \u20ac 45 100 per procedure.\nMechanism of charging the fee for procedures\nfor periodic safety update reports, post-authorisation safety studies and pharmacovigilance\nreferrals\nFor periodic\nsafety update reports and pharmacovigilance referral procedures, the fee will\nbe divided among marketing authorisation holders involved in the procedure by\ncharging them proportionately to the respective number of marketing\nauthorisations (chargeable units) held by each marketing authorisation holder.\nFor post-authorisation safety study procedures, the fee is proposed to be\ndivided among all marketing authorisation holders having the obligation to\nproduce the study by charging equal parts to each marketing authorisation\nholder. Further division of the cost may take place between marketing authorisation\nholders which have taken part in the study.\nFurthermore, the\namount charged to marketing authorisation holders that are small and\nmedium-sized enterprises will be reduced to 60% and marketing authorisation\nholders that are micro-enterprises will not be charged any fee.\nMechanism of\nremunerating rapporteurs \nRapporteurs'\nremuneration is included in the calculation of the fee for each Union-wide\npharmacovigilance procedure. Full rapporteur remuneration is based on estimated\naverage cost per procedure. The applicable rapporteur remuneration follows the\nsame pattern as the actual fee revenue per procedure, i.e. a reduced fee revenue\nentails a proportionately reduced rapporteur remuneration.\nOther pharmacovigilance activities of\nthe Agency\nThis heading of estimated cost of the\nAgency is taken into account in the calculations of the annual flat fee charged\nto all marketing authorisation holders with respect to their marketing\nauthorisations (chargeable units, as recorded by the Agency based on the list\nlaid down in Article 57(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004). Marketing\nauthorisations of centrally authorised products are not subject to this fee, as\nthey are already charged an annual fee, in accordance with Council Regulation\n(EC) No 297/95, which is assumed to cover non-procedure related\npharmacovigilance activities for those products.\nThe total estimated cost for the Agency under\nthis heading is \u20ac 19,1 m. Calculations in the impact assessment based\non this figure led to a proposed amount for the full flat fee of \u20ac 60 per\nmarketing authorisation, that should be counted in a consistent way for all marketing\nauthorisation holders based on chargeable units. It is proposed that marketing\nauthorisation holders that are small and medium-sized enterprises pay 60% of\nthe full fee and that micro-enterprises be exempted from the payment of the annual\nflat fee. Furthermore, a fee reduction of 20% is proposed for marketing\nauthorisation holders for medicinal products referred to in Article 10(1) and\nArticle 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as well as for authorised herbal medicinal\nproducts and authorised homeopathic medicinal products. \nWorkload and cost estimation tables\nSummary table of overall cost estimations\n Activities || EMA || Rapporteurs / NCA || Total \n Union-wide pharmacovigilance procedures \n PSUR assessment || \u20ac3 435 671 || \u20ac7 857 374 || \u20ac11 293 045 \n PASS assessment || \u20ac866 456 || \u20ac636 778 || \u20ac1 503 234 \n Pharmacovigilance referrals assessment || \u20ac4 887 616 || \u20ac1 803 405 || \u20ac6 691 021 \n Subtotal procedures || \u20ac9 189 743 || \u20ac10 297 557 || \u20ac19 487 300 \n Other pharmacovigilance activities of the EMA \n Other || \u20ac18 825 914 || \u20ac232 606 || \u20ac19 058 520 \n Grand total || \u20ac28 015 657 || \u20ac10 530 163 || \u20ac38 545 820 \n1.
