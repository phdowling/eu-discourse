Both the 2002 Association Agreement\n(which entered into force on 1 April 2006) and the European Neighbourhood\nPolicy (ENP) Action Plan, adopted in 2007 for a period of five years,\ncontributed significantly in developing the bilateral relations. Over the\nyears, cooperation between Lebanon and the European Union has been good and\ngrown closer, leading to a strong and constructive partnership.\nWithin this\nframework, EU-Lebanon relations have recently intensified, with a number of\nworking meetings of Subcommittees, resumption of the activities of the Association\nCommittee, and most recently the Association Council meeting in October 2012.\nThrough active participation and fruitful exchanges, Lebanon has confirmed its\ndetermination to be a strong partner within the European Neighbourhood Policy\n(ENP). On the EU side, the Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions of July 2012\nreaffirmed \"the importance the EU attaches to strengthening its\npartnership with Lebanon in the framework of the European Neighbourhood\nPolicy\". In the FAC Conclusions of November 2012 the EU encouraged Lebanon to pursue its reform process and confirmed it was \"looking forward to a reinforced\ncooperation with Lebanon as outlined in the new ENP Action Plan currently under\nadoption\".\nThe validity of the\nfirst EU-Lebanon ENP Action Plan expired in January 2012 and was extended by an\nexchange of letters between Commissioner \u0160tefan F\u00fcle, responsible for\nEnlargement and the ENP, and Nicolas Nahhas, Lebanon's Minister of Economy and\nTrade, for a period of one year or until a new Action Plan is adopted.\nThe May 2011 Joint\nCommunication by the High Representative and the Commission to the Parliament\nand the Council, entitled A new response to a changing neighbourhood: A\nreview of European Neighbourhood Policy, outlined a new approach which aims\nat a higher level of differentiation, allowing for each partner to develop its\nlinks with the EU based on its own aspirations, needs and capacities, but also\non mutual accountability and the degree of commitment to the universal values\nof human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as the capacity to implement\njointly agreed priorities. As outlined in the above-mentioned Communication,\nthe EU will aim for a more simplified and coherent policy and programme network\nthrough focusing ENP Action Plans and EU assistance on a smaller number of\npriorities, backed with more precise benchmarks.\nThis second Action\nPlan clearly outlines the priority objectives for EU-Lebanon partnership and\nelaborates specific benchmarks, indicators, timelines and possible EU\ninterventions for each of them. \nThe\nEuropean External Action Service engaged in exploratory contacts with Lebanon in the spring of 2012. They were followed by drafting of the new Action Plan in\nclose cooperation with Commission services and Member States in several rounds\nof consultations, leading to a draft prepared for negotiations. After a\nnegotiation round in Beirut in August 2012, the draft was further amended in\ncooperation with Commission and Member States partners. In the aftermath of the\nAssociation Council in October 2012, the EU and Lebanon reached a political\nagreement on the draft, subject to outstanding procedures.\nThe second\nEU-Lebanon ENP Action Plan shall be the essential reference tool that will specifically\nguide the EU's bilateral relations with Lebanon in the coming years. The ENP\nwill continue to act as a catalyst and a single policy framework, based inter\nalia on partnership and joint ownership, as well as performance-driven\ndifferentiation and tailor-made assistance.\nThe Commission and\nthe High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR)\nattach the text of a joint proposal for a Council Decision on the Union\nposition within the EU-Lebanon Association Council with regard to the adoption\nof a Recommendation on the implementation of the second Action Plan, as set out\nin Annex.\nThe Commission and the HR therefore

2013-2015\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\nLebanon and the\nEuropean Union are bound by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement in\nforce since 2006. However, their contractual relations are significantly\nlonger, dating back to the Trade and Technical Cooperation Agreement of 1965.\nThroughout this history, cooperation between Lebanon and the European Union has\nbeen good and progressively intensifying. Both parties share the commitment to\ndemocracy and human rights, as stated in the Association Agreement, as well as\nmany common political and economic interests. On this basis they wish to\nfurther develop and strengthen their partnership.\nThe recent consecutive governments of Lebanon have stated their commitment to political and economic reforms through legislation,\nadjustment of policies and improvements of public administration. They\nemphasised their attachment to the principles enshrined in the Lebanese\nconstitution and later agreements, including Lebanon's sovereignty,\nindependence, democratic set-up, fundamental freedoms, equality of all\ncitizens, and unity in the nation's territory, people and institutions. They\nalso assured of their respect for international resolutions. The adherence to\nthese principles, as well as the reform efforts based on them, enjoy the full\nsupport and encouragement by the European Union.\nA new neighbourhood policy\nIn the face of the historical changes in\nthe southern neighbourhood, the European Union has developed a new approach. It\naims at providing responses best suited to rapid developments in the\nneighbouring countries, including the need to initiate or continue deep and\nsubstantial reforms, to establish and consolidate healthy democracies, to\nsupport sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and to manage cross-border\nimplications. Lebanon contributed to the analysis that led the EU to develop\nthis approach.\nThis revised European Neighbourhood Policy\n(ENP) is based on mutual accountability and a shared commitment to the universal\nvalues of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It establishes a higher\nlevel of differentiation and determines the level of EU support according to\nthe ambitions of the partner countries in terms of their rapprochement with the\nEU, their specific needs and available capacities, their progress in the\nimplementation of reforms and in strengthening democracy and the rule of law,\nand their respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It further gives\nthe possibility to translate the strengthening of relations into greater\neconomic integration, increased mobility and a closer political cooperation in\nthe areas of governance, security, conflict resolution and coordination in\ninternational fora in matters of common interest.\nThe new approach to neighbourhood policy\naims to: (a) provide increased assistance to partners who engage in\ndeepening democracy and respect for the rule of law, human rights and\nfundamental freedoms; (b) support the development of a sustainable and\ninclusive economy that reduces social and regional inequalities, creates jobs and\nimproves living standards of the population; and (c) establish a closer\npartnership with the peoples and civil societies of the partner countries.\nThe new Action Plan\nIn light of the higher mutual ambitions in\nthe given context, there are the right conditions for Lebanon and the EU to move ahead to the next stage of their relationship. This second EU\u2011Lebanon\nENP Action Plan is a political document building up on the provisions of the\nAssociation Agreement that identify areas of cooperation. To give this Action\nPlan a more operational character, the parties agree to focus on a limited\nnumber of jointly identified priority objectives. These are defined below with\nthe help of benchmarks and indicators, which outline the specific milestones\nleading to the achievement of each priority objective and the data or\nparticular steps that allow measuring progress, respectively. Timelines\nindicate periods of implementation. The definition of each priority objective\nincludes possible EU interventions in terms of cooperation, assistance offered\nor resources mobilised (where reference is made to existing instruments, it is\nunderstood to relate also to next-generation, i.e. post-2013, instruments). Future\nEU-Lebanon financial cooperation and assistance will be programmed in coherence\nwith this Action Plan. Further objectives are set out in the annex, which\ncovers the areas of cooperation foreseen in the Association Agreement and\nfunctions as the reference document for its implementation. \nThe Action Plan shall have an initial\nduration of three years.\nTo ensure the best possible implementation\nas well as to establish the link between the progress toward the priority\nobjectives defined above and the assistance provided, regular monitoring and\nassessment will be conducted by the Association Committee and the sub-committees established under the Association Agreement, and by means of Progress Reports of each party.\nIf the parties identify the need they may, while acting in agreement, decide to\nadjust the Action Plan for the forthcoming year(s) as appropriate. When the\ndate of expiry approaches, the parties will assess the overall level of\nimplementation of this Action Plan. Based on such assessment they may decide to\nextend the duration by one year, and subsequently upon the expiry of such an\nextension by a further year in each step. The responsibility for taking the\naforementioned decisions lies with the Association Council.\nThe draft Action Plan will be submitted to\nthe EU-Lebanon Association Council for endorsement.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Priorities\nfor Action\nList of priorities\nA...........
