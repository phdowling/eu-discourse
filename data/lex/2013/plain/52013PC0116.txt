By letter registered on 5 November 2012 the Czech Republic completed its initial request by agreeing to certain additions mentioned in the\nPolish request. In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the\nCommission informed the other Member States by letters dated 5 December 2012 of\nthe requests made by the Czech Republic and Poland. By letter dated 10 December\n2012, the Commission notified the Czech Republic and Poland that it had all the\ninformation necessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nWith a view to facilitate road transport\nbetween the Czech Republic and Poland, and to regulate the construction and\nmaintenance of road infrastructure on the Czech-Polish state border, both\nstates have agreed to enter into an Agreement on the construction and maintenance\nof bridges and the maintenance of common road sections on the Czech-Polish\nState border. This draft agreement contains simplification measures which\nderogate from the VAT Directive as regards the principle of territoriality.\nAccording to the draft agreement, the Czech Republic and Poland would each become responsible for the maintenance of the border\nbridges and common road sections in accordance with the division of\nresponsibilities set out in Annex A of the agreement. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland would each become responsible for the construction and subsequent maintenance of the\nborder bridges in accordance with the division of responsibilities set out in\nAnnex B of the agreement. \nFor VAT purposes, in respect of the supply\nof goods or services and intra-Community acquisitions of goods intended for the\nconstruction or maintenance of the border bridges and common road sections\nunder Annexes A and B of the agreement, the bridges and common road sections in\nquestion as well as their construction sites shall be considered as being on\nthe territory of the state which is responsible for their construction or maintenance\nas laid down under Annexes A and B of the agreement. \nUnder the normal rules, the principle of\nterritoriality laid down in the VAT Directive would require supplies of goods\nand services, as well as intra-Community acquisitions of goods carried out in\nthe Czech Republic to be subject to Czech VAT. Likewise, supplies of goods and\nservices as well as intra-Community acquisitions of goods carried out in Poland would be subject to Polish VAT. Applying these provisions would imply breaking down\noperations according to the territory in which each part of the works was\ncarried out.\nThe Czech Republic and Poland consider that applying these rules would involve major tax complications for the\nbusinesses responsible for the work in question. They consider the tax\nprovisions in the draft agreement which is subject to the present request for\nderogation as justified in order to ease the administrative burden on those\nbusinesses. The Commission agrees that, in this case, uniform taxation of the construction\nand maintenance will represent a simplification which will make it easier for\nthe businesses concerned to apply the tax rules than would be the case if the\nnormal tax rules were applied.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\nproposal\nThe Council has on several occasions\nauthorised Member States to derogate from the territoriality principle with\nregard to transport infrastructure projects in frontier areas.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposed Decision aims at simplifying\nthe procedure for charging VAT in relation to the construction and maintenance\nof bridges and common road sections between the Czech Republic and Poland and has therefore a potential positive economic impact.\nHowever, because of the narrow scope of the\nderogation, the impact will in any case be limited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for the Czech Republic and\nPoland to derogate from the territorial application of VAT as regards to the\nconstruction and maintenance of border bridges and common road sections.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union's budget.\n2013/0069 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising the Czech Republic and Poland to apply special measures derogating from Article 5 of Directive\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[1], and in particular Article\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letters registered with\nthe Commission on 26 September 2011 and 5 November 2012 the Czech Republic and on\n8 June 2012 Poland requested authorisation to apply special measures for\nderogation from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC in relation to the construction\nand maintenance of border bridges and common road sections between the two Member\nStates.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member\nStates by letter dated 5 December 2012 of the requests made by the Czech Republic and by Poland. By letter dated 10 December 2012, the Commission notified the Czech Republic and Poland that it had all the information necessary to consider the requests. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the special\nmeasures is that with respect to the supply of goods or services and\nintra-Community acquisition of goods intended for the maintenance of border\nbridges and common road sections listed in Annex I and for the construction and\nsubsequent maintenance of border bridges listed in Annex II, the bridges and\ncommon road sections, as well as their construction sites, should be regarded\nas being entirely within the territory either of the Czech Republic or of\nPoland in accordance with an Agreement to be concluded between them on the\nconstruction and maintenance of bridges and maintenance of common road sections\non the Czech \u2013 Polish State border.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of special\nmeasures, it would be necessary, for each supply of goods or services and intra-Community\nacquisition of goods, to ascertain whether the place of taxation was the Czech Republic or Poland. Work at a border bridge and common road section carried out within the\nterritory of the Czech Republic would be subject to value added tax in the Czech Republic while that carried out within Poland's territory would be subject to value added\ntax in Poland.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the\nderogation is therefore to simplify the procedure for collecting the tax with\nrespect to the construction and maintenance of the border bridges and common\nroad sections in question.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no adverse\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nSubject to the entry into force of an\nAgreement to be concluded between the Czech Republic and Poland on the\nmaintenance of bridges and common road sections on the Czech \u2013 Polish State\nborder, as referred to in Annex I to this Decision, and on the construction and\nsubsequent maintenance of bridges on the Czech \u2013 Polish State border, as\nreferred to in Annex II to this Decision, the Czech Republic and Poland are\nhereby authorised to apply, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3, measures\nderogating from Directive 2006/112/EC in relation to the construction and\nmaintenance of those border bridges and common road sections, all of which are partly\nwithin the territory of the Czech Republic and partly within the territory of\nPoland.\nArticle 2\nBy way of derogation from Article 5 of\nDirective 2006/112/EC, the border bridges and common road sections for the\nconstruction or maintenance of which the Czech Republic is responsible, and,\nwhere appropriate, the corresponding construction site, insofar as they are\nwithin Poland's territory, shall be deemed to be part of the territory of the\nCzech Republic for the purposes of the supply of goods and services and\nintra-Community acquisition of goods intended for the construction or\nmaintenance of those bridges and common road sections.\nArticle 3\nBy way of derogation from Article 5 of\nDirective 2006/112/EC, the border bridges and common road sections for the\nconstruction or maintenance of which Poland is responsible, and, where\nappropriate, the corresponding construction site, insofar as they are within\nthe territory of the Czech Republic, shall be deemed to be part of Poland\u2019s\nterritory for
