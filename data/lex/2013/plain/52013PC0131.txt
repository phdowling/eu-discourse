The aim of the Convention is to protect human health and the environment\nfrom persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Convention provides a framework,\nbased on the precautionary principle, for elimination of production, use,\nimport and export of currently twenty-two priority POPs, their safe handling and\ndisposal and elimination or reduction of releases of certain unintentional\nPOPs.\nRegulation (EC) No 850/2004 on persistent\norganic pollutants[2]\nimplements in Union law the commitments set out in the Convention and in the\nProtocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (the Protocol), approved by Council Decision\n259/2004/EC[3].\nArticle 8(1) of the Convention stipulates\nthat any Party may submit a proposal to the Secretariat for listing a chemical\nin Annexes A, B or C to the Convention which will then be reviewed by the\nPersistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POP RC) following Article 8(3)\nand (4). The proposal shall contain the information specified in Annex D. The\nprocedure for the adoption of amendments to Annexes is governed by Article 22\nof the Convention.\nAccording to available scientific\ninformation and review reports as well as taking due account of the screening\ncriteria laid down in Annex D to the Convention, dicofol exhibit characteristics\nof POPs.\nDicofol has not been included[4] as active substances in Annex I\nto Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning\nthe placing of plant protection products on the market[5]. Moreover,\ndicofol has not been included[6]\nin Annex I or IA to Directive 98/8/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of\nbiocidal products on the market[7].\nTherefore, the placing on the market and use of the\nsubstance has already ceased or has been severely reduced in the EU.\nIn 2008, on the basis of Risk Profile and\nSummary Report for Dicofol[8]\nprepared by the Netherlands, the EU nominated dicofol for listing as a POP\nunder the Protocol. Furthermore, dicofol has been assessed by POP RC as a\npotential alternative to endosulfan. On the basis of this assessment POP RC\nconsiders that dicofol meets the criteria of Annex D to the Convention and\ntherefore could be considered as a POP.\nIt cannot be excluded that dicofol is still\nproduced, used or significantly unintentionally emitted in other countries. Due\nto the potential for long-range environmental transport of this chemical, the\nmeasures taken nationally or at the Union level are not sufficient to safeguard\nthe high level of protection of the environment and human health and wider international\naction is necessary.\nWith a view to the next POP RC meeting in\nOctober 2013, it is appropriate that the Commission submit on behalf of the Union a proposal for the listing of dicofol for inclusion in Annex A to the Secretariat of\nthe Stockholm Convention. This constitutes a position to be adopted on the Union's behalf for the purpose of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n2013/0073 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the submission, on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, of a proposal for the listing of additional chemicals in Annex\nA to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 191(1), in\nconjunction with Article 218(9) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union ratified the\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Convention) on 16\nNovember 2004 by Council Decision 2006/507/EC of 14 October 2004 concerning the\nconclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Stockholm Convention on\nPersistent Organic Pollutants[9].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a Party to the\nConvention, the Union may make proposals for amendment of the Annexes to the\nConvention. Annex A to the Convention lists persistent organic pollutants (POPs)\nto be eliminated.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to available\nscientific information and review reports as well as taking due account of the\nscreening criteria laid down in Annex D to the Convention, dicofol exhibits\ncharacteristics of POPs. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dicofol was nominated by\nthe EU as a potential POP under the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on\nLong-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. Furthermore, according to the\npreliminary assessment by the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee,\nundertaken in the context of identification of alternatives to endosulfan,\ndicofol meets the criteria laid down in Annex D to the Convention.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The placing on the market\nand use of dicofol has already ceased in the Union. It cannot be excluded that the\nsubstance is still produced, used or significantly unintentionally emitted in third\ncountries.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the potential for\nlong-range environmental transport of dicofol, the measures taken nationally or\nat Union level are not sufficient to safeguard the high level of protection of\nthe environment and human health and wider international action is necessary.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union should therefore\nsubmit a proposal to the Secretariat of the Convention for the listing of\ndicofol in Annex A to the Convention,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1. The Union shall submit a proposal for\nthe listing of dicofol (CAS number: 115-32-2) in Annex A to the Stockholm\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Convention):\n2. The Commission shall communicate the\nproposal on behalf of the Union to the Secretariat of the Convention with all\nthe information required under Annex D to the Convention.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its\nadoption. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 209, 31.7.2006, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 7.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 81, 19.3.2004, p. 35.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Decision (2008/764/EC) of 30 September\n2008 concerning the non-inclusion of dicofol in Annex I to Council Directive\n91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products\ncontaining that substance (OJ L 262, 1.10.2008, p. 40).\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December\n2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referenced in Article\n16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nconcerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325,\n11.12.2007, p. 3).\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p 1.\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Available at: http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/TaskForce/popsxg/2008/Dicofol_RA%20dossier_proposal%20for%20submission%20to%20UNECE%20POP%20protocol.pdf.\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 209, 31.7.2006, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
