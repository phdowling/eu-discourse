It delivers a long awaited update\nof the protection of audiovisual performers at international level and\nmodernizes this protection by recognising performers' rights in the digital\nenvironment. In doing so it fills a gap in the protection of performers' rights\nthat had been left open since 1996 when the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\nTreaty (hereinafter WPPT) was adopted. \nThe WPPT, which the European Union acceded\nto in 2000, provided for an international protection of the rights of authors\nand certain holders of related rights that, for the first time, took into\naccount the economic and technological developments of the digital environment.\nHowever, no agreement could be reached at that time to include in the scope of\nthese instruments the protection of performers with regard to their\nperformances fixed in audiovisual works (the WPPT only covers the rights of\nperformers in relation to their performances in phonograms). \nA Diplomatic Conference was held in Geneva from 7 to 20 December 2000 but WIPO Members could not agree on the text of a new\nTreaty. The failure of the 2000 Diplomatic Conference suspended the works for\nmore than ten years. In June 2011 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and\nRelated Rights (22nd session) reached a provisional agreement on the main issue\nremained unsolved in 2000, the provision on transfer of performers' rights to\nproducers of audiovisual works. Further to that the General Assembly of WIPO\ndecided, at its 40th session in October 2011, to reconvene the Diplomatic Conference\nthat had been suspended in 2000. The reconvened Diplomatic Conference took\nplace in Beijing from 20 to 26 June 2012 and led to the adoption of the Treaty\non 24 June 2012.\nThe Commission was authorised by the\nCouncil to conduct negotiations in view of adoption of an instrument for the\nprotection of performers' rights in their audio-visual performances by a\nDecision of 7 November 2000. On 18 June 2012 the Council updated the\nnegotiations directives attached to the Decision to take into account the changes\nin the EU copyright acquis after 2000 (the adoption of the 2001/29\nDirective on Copyright in the Information Society) and to acknowledge the\nreconvention of the Diplomatic Conference in Beijing from 20 to 26 June 2012.\nThe Beijing Diplomatic Conference adopted\nthe Treaty on 24 June 2012.\nThe European Union signed the final act of\nthe Diplomatic Conference at the closing of the Diplomatic Conference. The\nEuropean Parliament was informed of the outcome of the Diplomatic Conference at\nthe meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs on 9 July 2012.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe European Union has played a very active\nrole in shaping the provisions of the Beijing Treaty, so as to ensure that\naudiovisual performers enjoy a level of protection consistent with the EU acquis,\nand that European audiovisual performers can benefit at international level\nfrom the same level of protection they enjoy under EU legislation. Indeed, the\nmajority of issues covered by the Treaty are already harmonised at EU level.\nMany of the provisions of the Beijing\nTreaty are modelled upon the 1996 WPPT and by and large the two treaties follow\nthe same structure. The beneficiaries of the protection under the Beijing\nTreaty are performers who are nationals of the signatories of the Treaty, or\nwho have their habitual residence in one of signatory countries.\nThe protection is granted on the basis of\nnational treatment which means that every country treats performers (nationals\nof another country), with regard to the exclusive rights and the right to\nequitable remuneration granted in the Treaty, in the same way as it treats its\nown nationals. The scope of national treatment can be limited as regards\ncertain rights on the basis of the specific provisions of the Treaty.\nThe Treaty provides that independently of\neconomic rights, and even after the transfer of those rights, the performers\nshall have certain moral rights as regards live performances or performances\nfixed in audiovisual fixations. \nAs concerns economic rights, the Treaty\ngrants performers exclusive rights with respect to their unfixed and fixed\nperformances. \nWith regard to unfixed performances,\nperformers enjoy the right to authorise the broadcasting and communication to\nthe public of their unfixed performances as well as to authorise the fixation\nof their unfixed performances. \nWith regard to performances fixed in\naudiovisual fixations, performers enjoy the right to authorise their direct or\nindirect reproduction, their distribution, and the commercial rental to the\npublic of the original and copies of the performances (even after authorising\ntheir distribution). \nPerformers enjoy the exclusive right of\nauthorizing the making available to the public of their performances (e.g. the\non-line downloading of a film incorporating their performance). Finally the\nTreaty grants performers the right to authorise the broadcasting and\ncommunication to the public of their performances. Contracting Parties are\nentitled to replace this right by a right to equitable remuneration or to\nderogate from this right entirely. \nAs regards the transfer or rights,\nContracting Parties are given full flexibility to organise it. They may decide\nfor instance that, once a performer has consented to the fixation of a\nperformance, his exclusive rights are transferred to the producers, unless a\ncontract between a performer and a producer states differently. In any event,\nthe provision does not impose on Contracting Parties any obligation to provide\nfor an automatic transfer. \nIn line with the WPPT, the Beijing Treaty specifies\nthat national legislation may provide for the same kinds of limitations or\nexceptions with regard to the protection of performers as it provides for in\nconnection with the protection of copyright in literary and artistic works, in\ncompliance with the so called \"three step test\". Similarly to the\nWPPT, the new Treaty also requires Contracting Parties to provide adequate\nlegal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of\ntechnological protection measures used by performers in connection with the\nexercise of their rights and adequate and effective legal remedies against the\nremoval or alteration of electronic rights management information attached to a\nperformance fixed in an audio-visual fixation. Finally, the term of protection\nis at least 50 years after the fixation of the audiovisual performance. \nThe last part of the Treaty consists of the\nusual administrative and procedural provisions, also in this case largely\ninspired by the corresponding provisions of the WPPT.\nThe Treaty also includes a number of agreed\nstatements, some of which (relationship of the Treaty with WPPT and TRIPS,\ndefinition of performer, technological protection measures in relation to\nlimitations and exceptions) were the subject of specific negotiations during\nthe 2012 Diplomatic Conference. \nArticle 23 of the Beijing Treaty provides\nthat the European Union may become party to the Treaty \"having made the\ndeclaration\", during the Diplomatic Conference, that it is competent in\nrespect of, and has its own legislation binding on all its Member States on\nmatters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly authorized, in\naccordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the Treaty. As the\nCommission had been duly authorised by the Council to negotiate, and as\nreflection of this authorisation, the European Union made this declaration at\nthe Beijing Diplomatic Conference. As a next step the Treaty should be signed\nby the European Union pursuant to a decision of the Council based on Article\n218(5) TFEU. \nThe Commission has judged the results of\nthe negotiations to be satisfactory and requests the Council to authorise the\nsignature, on behalf of the European Union, of the WIPO Beijing Treaty on\nAudiovisual Performances adopted in Beijing on 24 June 2012.\n2013/0065 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the signing, on behalf of the European\nUnion, of the WIPO Treaty on Audiovisual Performances\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 in conjunction\nwith 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 7 November 2000 the\nCouncil authorised the Commission to negotiate in the context of the World\nIntellectual Property Organisation to ensure participation of the European\nCommunity in the Diplomatic Conference held in Geneva from 7 to 20 December\n2000 with the aim to draw up an instrument to protect performers' rights in\ntheir audiovisual performances.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The negotiations were\nsuccessfully concluded at a reconvened Diplomatic Conference held in Beijing from 20 to 26 June 2012 and the WIPO Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances\nwas adopted on 24 June 2012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty establishes a\nset of new international rules in the area of neighbouring rights which aim at\nensuring the adequate protection and remuneration of audiovisual performers.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty shall be open\nfor signature by any eligible party for one year after its adoption.
