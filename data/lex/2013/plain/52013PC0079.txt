In each meeting session new\namendments to existing UNECE Regulations or Global Technical Regulations are\nadopted in order to allow for technical progress. Prior to each WP29 meeting\nthese amendments were adopted by one of the six working groups (GRs) that are\nactive under WP29.\nSubsequently in a WP29 meeting the final\nvote for adoption of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda takes place,\nprovided the quorum is reached and there is a qualified majority among contracting\nparties. The EU is contracting party to 2 Agreements (1958 and 1998 Agreements)\nunder WP29 and votes on behalf of the Member States. A Council Decision,\nreferred to as \"mega decision\" containing the list of amendments,\nsupplements and corrigenda, is prepared each time and permits the Commission to\nvote on behalf of Member States in each WP29 meeting.\nThis Council Decision defines the Union's\nposition in the voting of the amendments, supplements and corrigenda submitted\nfor vote in the March 2013 WP29 meeting that takes place on 12 to 15 March 2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Technical Committee Motor Vehicles was\nconsulted on 06 February 2013 and the comments from Member State experts were\ntaken into account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal defines the Union's position\nin the voting of the amendments to UNECE Regulations Nos 3, 6, 7, 13, 19, 37,\n43, 45, 46, 48, 51, 53, 60, 67, 69, 77, 87, 91, 106, 109, 117, 118, 119, 121,\n128 and 129, and of Corrigendum 1 to Global Technical Regulation No. 12 of the\nUNECE.\n\u00b7                        \nLegal basis\nIn order to adapt for the specificities of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the previously used legal\nbases referred to in recitals 1 and 2 have been replaced by a direct reference\nto Article 218(9).\n\u00b7                        \nSubsidiarity principle\nThe vote in favour of international\ninstruments like draft UNECE Regulations and Global Technical Regulations and\ntheir incorporation into the Union system for the type-approval of motor\nvehicles can only be done by the Union. This does not only prevent\nfragmentation of the Internal Market, but also ensures equal health and safety\nstandards across the Union. It also offers advantages of economies of scale:\nproducts can be made for the whole Union market and even the international\nmarket, instead of being customised to obtain national type-approval for every\nsingle Member State.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\nMarket while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\nThe use of a Council Decision is considered\nto be appropriate as in line with the requirements of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n2013/0050 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the\nEuropean Union within the relevant Committees of the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe regarding the adaptation to technical progress of\nRegulations Nos 3, 6, 7, 13, 19, 37, 43, 45, 46, 48, 51, 53, 60, 67, 69, 77,\n87, 91, 106, 109, 117, 118, 119, 121, 128 and 129, and regarding the adaptation\nto technical progress of Global Technical Regulation No 12 of the United\nNations Economic Commission for Europe\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article 218(9)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\n97/836/EC[3]\nof 27 November 1997 the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations\nEconomic Commission for Europe (\u201cUNECE\u201d) concerning the adoption of uniform\ntechnical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be\nfitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal\nrecognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u201cRevised\n1958 Agreement\u201d );\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2000/125/EC[4] of 31 January 2000 the Union acceded\nto the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations\nfor wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on\nwheeled vehicles (Parallel Agreement);\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/46/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a\nframework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of\nsystems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles\n(Framework Directive)[5]\nreplaced the Member States\u2019 approval systems with a Union approval\nprocedure, establishing a harmonised framework containing the administrative\nprovisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems,\ncomponents and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UNECE\nRegulations in the EU vehicle type-approval system, either as requirements for\ntype-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of\nDirective 2007/46/EC, UNECE Regulations have increasingly replaced Union\nlegislation in the framework of EU vehicle type-approval.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In
