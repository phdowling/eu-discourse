These measures shall\nenter into force only subject to and on the date of the entry into force of the\nTreaty of Accession.\nArticle 50 of the Act concerning the conditions\nof accession affirms that where acts of the institutions adopted prior to\naccession require adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary\nadaptations have not been provided for in this Act or its Annexes, the Council\nor the Commission (if the original acts were adopted by the Commission) shall\nadopt the necessary acts.\nRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of\nplant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC\nand 91/414/EEC[3]\nprovides for the division of the Union in zones with comparable agricultural,\nplant health and environmental conditions in order to facilitate the mutual\nrecognition of plant protection products. Annex I of that Regulation lists each\n  Member State in the Northern, the Central or the Southern zone for the\nauthorisation of plant protection products.\nThe present proposal aims at adding Croatia in the Southern zone in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\nCroatia should be added to the list of Member\nStates in the Southern zone of Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1107/2009 due to\nthe fact that on the whole the agricultural, plant health and environmental\nconditions specific to Croatia are comparable to those of the countries already\nplaced in the Southern zone, i.e. Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus,\nMalta, and Portugal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs this proposal is of technical nature and\ndoes not involve any political choices, consultations with interested parties\nor impact assessments would not have made sense.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article 50\nof the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia.\nThe principles of subsidiarity and\nproportionality are fully respected.\nThe action of the Union is necessary under the\nprinciple of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5(3) TEU as it concerns\ntechnical adaptations to a legal act adopted by the Union. The proposal\nrespects the principle of proportionality stated in Article 5(4) TEU because it\ndoes not go beyond what is necessary to reach the objective pursued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal has no budgetary implications.\n2013/0047 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council by reason of the accession of Croatia \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty of Accession of\nCroatia, and in particular Article 3(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of\nCroatia, and in particular Article 50 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to Regulation (EC)\nNo 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009\nconcerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing\nCouncil Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC[4]\ndefines zones composed of Member States with comparable agricultural, plant\nhealth and environmental (including climatic) conditions, in particular in\norder to facilitate the examination of applications and granting of\nauthorisations of plant protection products in the Union and the mutual\nrecognition of authorisations.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the accession\nof Croatia to the Union, it is necessary to add Croatia to the Southern zone\nsince the agricultural, plant health and environmental conditions in Croatia are comparable to those in Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to Regulation (EC)\nNo 1107/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: \nArticle 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is\namended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force subject\nto and on the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of\nCroatia.\nThis\nRegulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all\nMember States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX\nAnnex I to\nRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is replaced by the following:\n'ANNEX I\nDefinition of zones for the authorisation of plant protection\nproducts as referred to in Article 3(17)\nZone A \u2014 North\nThe following Member States belong to this\nzone:\nDenmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden\nZone B \u2014 Centre\nThe following Member States belong to this\nzone:\nBelgium, Czech Republic,  Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, United Kingdom\nZone C \u2014 South\nThe following Member States belong to this\nzone:\nBulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal'\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 112, 24.4.2012, p. 10.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 112, 24.4.2012, p. 21.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
