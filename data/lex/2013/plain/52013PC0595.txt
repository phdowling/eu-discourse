It has been\r\nimplemented by Dir.2008/106/EC, amended by Dir. 2012/35/EU.\nThe objective of the STCW-F Convention is\r\nto ensure that personnel on board fishing vessels are qualified (as proven by\r\nan official certificate) and fit for the job (following medical examination),\r\nso that potential threats to safety of life and/or property at sea or to the\r\nmarine environment are minimised during operations on board sea-going vessels.\r\nThe Convention requires that personnel possess a minimum knowledge in specific\r\nmatters and have performed duties on board a vessel during a minimum period of\r\ntime.\nAn aim of the Convention is also to achieve\r\nand maintain a level playing field in the fisheries sector by fostering\r\nvocational education. Fishing vessel personnel's professional competences shall\r\nbe certified in accordance with the Convention.\nThe provisions are mandatory only for\r\nvessels of 24 metres and over in length and of 750kw propulsion power or over\r\nand concerns skippers, officers, engineer officers and radio operators.\r\nGovernments are however encouraged to establish training for deck-hands on\r\nvessels of 24 metres and over in length, while basic safety training is\r\ncompulsory for all fishing vessel personnel.\nPursuant to the right of freedom of\r\nmovement of workers, in matters of professional qualifications, Dir.2005/36/EC\r\nsets clear rules on mutual recognition between Member States under the\r\nso-called \"general system of recognition\".\nThe Directive applies to EU nationals\r\nwishing to pursue a profession in another Member State where this profession is\r\nregulated. The general system of recognition requires a comparison of the\r\nprofessional qualifications of the jobseeker, including relevant professional\r\nexperience, with the ones required in the host Member State. The comparison\r\nshall be carried out within strict deadlines. Only in case of substantial\r\ndifferences, may the host Member State impose compensatory measures, which can\r\ntake the form of an aptitude test or an adaption period.\nThe Directive applies to all regulated\r\nprofessions except where, for a given profession and in accordance of the\r\nprinciple of lex specialis, other specific rules directly related to the\r\nrecognition of professional qualifications are laid down by a separate piece of\r\nlegislation under EU law.\nProfessional activities related to the\r\nSTCW-F Convention are regulated in most of the Member States.\nThe STCW-F Convention does not lay down a\r\nsystem of recognition of professional qualifications similar to the one\r\nestablished by Dir.2005/36/EC. On the contrary, the STCW-F Convention does not\r\nadmit the use of certificates issued by States that are not party to the\r\nConvention. However, Member States are under the obligation to comply with EU\r\nlaw, namely to the provisions contained in Dir. 2005/36/EC.\nIn accordance with the AETR case law of the\r\nCourt of Justice on external competence, the Member States are not allowed to\r\nratify the STCW-F Convention without European Union authorisation as the\r\nprovisions concerning the recognition of regulated professions pursed by EU\r\nnationals on board fishing vessels affect the exercise of the European Union's\r\nexclusive competence in this area.\nAs regards those Member States that have\r\nalready ratified the Convention before the entry into force of the proposed\r\nDecision, they are required to deposit with the IMO Secretary-General a statement\r\nwhereby they acknowledge that EU law shall prevail in case of conflict in\r\nrelations between Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nConsultation of interested parties\nThe Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee for Sea-Fishing\r\nhas encouraged the Commission to take initiatives aimed at the swift\r\nimplementation of the STCW-F Convention.\nPromoting the ratification and enforcement\r\nof other international standards as regards living and working conditions in\r\nthe fishing sector, such as the ILO (International Labour Organisation) Work in\r\nfishing Convention (n\u00b0188) is in line with activities of the Sectoral Social Dialogue\r\nCommittee for Sea-Fishing and the European Commission. The objective of\r\nConvention C n\u00b0188 is to ensure that fishers have decent working conditions.\nThe Commission is currently assessing the\r\nrequest from the EU Social Partners in the sea-fisheries sector to implement\r\ntheir Agreement of 8 May 2013 concerning the transposition of the provisions of\r\nILO C 188, pursuant to Article 155 TFEU. \nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact Assessment\nNot relevant.\nTherefore, there is no need to consider\r\nseveral options.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nIn view of the fact that competence for\r\nrecognition of professional qualifications lies with the European Union, Member\r\nStates cannot ratify the Convention without European Union authorisation. The\r\nCommission proposes that the Council should authorise Member States to ratify\r\nthe STCW-F Convention in the interest of the European Union.\nThe authorisation to the Member States\r\nshall be granted on condition that they formulate a reservation when depositing\r\ntheir instrument of ratification to the effect that European Union law shall\r\ncontinue to be applied in their mutual relations.\nThose Member States that have already\r\nratified the Convention, shall submit a statement to the Secretary-General of\r\nIMO whereby they state that Union law relating to recognition of professional\r\nqualifications applies in relations between Member States. \nThe proposed Decision will therefore enable\r\nand encourage Member States to take all the necessary steps for ratification\r\nwithout further delay.\nLegal basis\nArticle 43(2), 46, 53(1) and 62 in\r\nconjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) TFEU.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. Therefore the subsidiarity principle does not fully\r\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons.\nNot relevant.\nNot relevant.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision\nOther means would not be adequate.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implications for the\r\nCommunity budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nDetailed explanation of the proposal\nNot relevant.\n2013/0285 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Member States to sign and/or\r\nratify, in the interest of the European Union, the International Convention on\r\nStandards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel\r\nPersonnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), 46, 53(1)\r\nand 62 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) thereof, \nHaving regards to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention of the\r\nInternational Maritime Organisation on Standards of Training, Certification and\r\nWatch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (hereinafter referred to as the\r\n'IMO' and 'the Convention' respectively), was adopted on 7 July 1995 at the\r\nInternational Conference convened by the IMO in London at which delegations of\r\n22 attending Member States voted in favour of its adoption;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention represents\r\na major contribution to the fishing sector at international level in promoting\r\nsafety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment\r\nand it is therefore desirable that its provisions should be implemented as soon\r\nas possible;\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fishing at sea is one of\r\nthe most hazardous professions and thus appropriate training and qualifications\r\nare an essential means by which to cut the number of accidents. A safer working\r\nenvironment will make fishing vessel personnel jobs more attractive in the\r\ninterest of the European fishing industry, as pursued by the Common Fisheries\r\nPolicy. The Convention specifically aims at the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment, which is an objective of the Common Fisheries Policy; \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of\r\nFisheries Partnership Agreements with third countries, it is important that\r\ncrew on board vessels flying the flag of an EU Member State, possess\r\nappropriate professional qualifications as proven by accepted certificates so\r\nthat recruitment under the conditions laid down in the Agreements is made\r\neasier;\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament,\r\nthe Council and the Commission are promoting safety at sea and safety at work\r\nas well as enhancement of the professional qualifications for workers on board\r\nfishing vessels. The EU financially supports training in the fishing sector,\r\nnamely through the Fisheries Fund;\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some articles of the\r\nConvention fall within the exclusive competence of the Union as regards the rules\r\nof the Union on the recognition of professional qualifications held by certain\r\ncategories of fishing vessel personnel and affect the Treaty provisions and secondary\r\nUnion legislation, in particular Directive 2005/36/EC of 7 September 2005 on\r\nthe recognition of professional qualifications[1],\r\nas in force;\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union cannot ratify\r\nthe Convention as it is not party to the IMO and the Convention does not\r\ncontain a clause allowing a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is\r\nconstituted by sovereign States and has competence over certain matters\r\ngoverned by the Convention to be able to sign, accept, approve or accede to the\r\nConvention;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some Member States have\r\nnot yet signed the Convention while others have already ratified it and\r\ndeposited the instrument of ratification. It is in the interest of the\r\nCommon Fisheries Policy that those Member States that have not signed or\r\nratified the Convention yet do so speedily;\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the conditions laid\r\ndown in this Decision, the Member States, which are bound by Union law rules on\r\nthe recognition of professional qualifications, shall therefore be authorised to\r\nsign and ratify the Convention, as the case may be, in the interest of the Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION\nArticle 1\nThe Member States are authorised to sign\r\nand/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training,\r\nCertification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the\r\nInternational Maritime Organisation, adopted on 7 July 1995, for the parts\r\nfalling under the European Union's competence.\nThe authorisation referred to in paragraph\r\n1 is conditional upon the deposit by the Member State at the moment of the\r\nsignature of the Convention and/or when depositing the instrument of\r\nratification with the IMO Secretary-General of the reservation that Union law\r\nrelating to recognition of professional qualifications applies in relations\r\nbetween Member States.\nArticle 2\nThe Member States that have already\r\nratified the Convention prior to the entry into force of the present Decision,\r\nwithout formulating a reservation, shall deposit a declaration whereby they\r\nacknowledge that Union law relating to recognition of professional\r\nqualifications applies in relations between the Member States. \nArticle 3\nThe Member States shall make efforts to take\r\nthe necessary steps to deposit their instrument of ratification of the\r\nConvention with the Secretary-General of the International Maritime\r\nOrganisation as soon as possible, preferably before 31 December 2013. The\r\nCouncil will review the progress of the ratification in January 2014.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision shall apply from the day of\r\nits publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\r\nStates.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 255, 30.09.2005, p. 22.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
