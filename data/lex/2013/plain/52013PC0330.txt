The Commission will also make sure that the maturity at\nwhich the refinancing operations are made caters for the proper management of\nthe margin under the EU Own Resources ceiling, including the redemption profile\nof the EU bonds. The refinancing operations are expected to take place from\n2016 and all costs incurred by the EU in concluding and carrying out each\noperation will be borne by Portugal.\nIt should be noted that this decision also\naims at improving borrowing conditions for the sovereign as well as generating positive\nspill-over effects for the private sector. These effects are beneficial for\nboth creditor and debtor countries and therefore contribute to the stability of\nthe euro area.\nTaking into account the above factors, the\nCommission considers that the changes consisting in the extension of the\naverage maturity of the EFSM loan to Portugal are conducive to securing the\nprogramme's objectives.\n2013/0171 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU\non granting Union financial assistance to Portugal\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No\n407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation\nmechanism[1],\nand in particular Article 3(2) thereof.\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with Article 3(9)\nof Council Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU, the Commission, together with the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and in liaison with the European Central Bank\n(ECB), has conducted the seventh review of the authorities' progress on the\nimplementation of the agreed measures between 25 February and 14 March.\nSubsequently between 14 and 17 April 2013 and between 8 and 11 May 2013\nadditional assessment of some fiscal measures was carried out.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An extension of the\nmaximum average maturity of the EU loans would be beneficial as it would\nsupport Portugal's efforts to regain full market access and successfully exit\nthe programme. In order to take full benefit from the extension of the maximum\naverage maturity of the EU loan, the Commission should be authorised to extend\nthe maturity of instalments and tranches.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Real GDP fell by 3.2\npercent in 2012 after an unexpectedly large contraction of economic activity\nand employment in the final quarter of the year. These developments required a\ndownward revision of the economic outlook: real GDP is now forecast to contract\nby 2.3 percent in 2013 due to the more negative carry-over from 2012, stronger\ncontraction in domestic consumption on the back of higher than previously\nanticipated unemployment and a weaker outlook for external demand. The economic\nrecovery is also forecast to be more muted than previously expected with real\nGDP forecast to bottom out in the second half of the year and to grow in 2014 at\nan annual average rate of 0.6 percent; real GDP growth in 2015 is expected to\nreach 1.5 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to peak at 18\u00bd percent of\nthe labour force in 2014. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general government\ndeficit reached 6.4 percent of GDP in 2012, which is above the programme target\nof 5 percent of GDP. The headline deficit was affected by a number of large\none-off operations, the budgetary impact of which was not known at the previous\nreview. The operations include the capital injection into the state-owned bank\nCGD (0.5 percent of GDP), the re-routing through\nthe government of the conversion into equity of shareholder loans of Parp\u00fablica to SAGESTAMO, two companies outside the\ngeneral government perimeter (0.5 percent of GDP) and the impairments\nassociated with the transfer of assets from BPN (0.1 percent of GDP). In addition, following an advice by Eurostat the revenues\nfrom the sale of the operating concession for the major airports in Portugal\nwas treated as equity withdrawal and hence not impacting the general government\nbalance, contrary to what the government had foreseen in the budget (0.7\npercent of GDP). Excluding the impact of these one-off factors from the\nheadline balance, the general government deficit would have amounted to 4.7 percent of GDP, below the target. Confining the\ndeficit to this level was challenging as the macro-economically driven\nunderperformance of revenues had to be compensated by higher-than-budgeted\nsavings, in particular in the public wage bill, intermediate consumption and\nappropriations for new investment projects\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the fiscal effort\nin 2012, measured by the improvement in the structural balance, reached 2.4\npercent of GDP and is in line with the Council Recommendation of 9 October 2012\nto bring an end to the situation of an excessive government deficit in Portugal. The improvement in the structural primary balance was even higher at 2.7 percent\nof GDP.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the developments\nin 2012, the new 2013 budgetary baseline assumes that revenue shortfalls and\nincreased social transfers in kind are carried over whereas a large part of the\nexpenditure savings in the last quarter of 2012 are considered non-permanent,\nleading to a negative carry-over of about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2013.\nFurthermore, the significant deterioration in the macro-economic outlook in 2013\nlowered the budgetary baseline by another 0.5 percent of GDP. In view of these\ndevelopments, the budgetary targets for the period 2013-2015 as specified at\nthe fifth review of the programme (4.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2.5 percent\nof GDP in 2014) are no longer feasible. As the deviation is assessed to be\nessentially outside the control of the government, a revision of the budgetary\nadjustment seems appropriate. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The deficit targets have\ntherefore been adjusted to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013, 4.0 percent of GDP in\n2014 and 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015. This fiscal path has been recalibrated so\nas to maintain a structural primary adjustment of close to 9 percent over the\nperiod 2011-2015, while allowing the operation of automatic stabilizers and\ntaking into consideration financing and debt constraints as well as the social\ncosts of the adjustment. Even under the revised targets a sizable amount of consolidation\nmeasures of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2 percent of GDP in 2014 will be\nnecessary. A range of structural spending and revenue measures underpin the\nenvisaged adjustment over the programme period. The consolidation path is\nexpected to continue beyond the programme period so as to bring the deficit\nclearly below the 3 percent threshold by 2015.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 2013 Budget Law included\ndiscretionary measures of a structural nature worth slightly more than 3\npercent of GDP, after accounting for the reinstatement of one of the two bonus\npayments for public workers and 1.1 times of the two bonus payments for pensioners\nthat had been cut in 2012. On April 5, however, the Constitutional Court ruled\nagainst some of the 2013 budget provisions, including the remaining cut of one\nbonus payment for public workers, 0.9 times of the bonus payment for pensioners\nand a new surcharge on unemployment and sick leave benefits, thereby creating a\nbudgetary gap of 0.8 percent of GDP. To close this gap and to underpin the\nrequired fiscal adjustment in 2014 and 2015, the government adopted in the\ncourse of April and May a package of permanent expenditure-reducing measures\nwith a cumulative yield of EUR 4.7 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP over\n2013-2014, of which measures worth 0.8 percent of GDP are frontloaded into\n2013. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also as a consequence of\nthe full reinstatement of the two bonus payments for public workers and\npensioners, revenue increases account for more than two thirds of the overall\nfiscal consolidation effort in 2013 while expenditure cuts account for less\nthan one third, contrary to original intentions to focus the consolidation on\nexpenditure.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2013, revenue measures\ninclude a restructuring of the personal income tax; a\nsurcharge of 3.5 percent on the part of taxable income exceeding the minimum\nwage; a solidarity surcharge on the highest levels of income; the broadening of\nthe tax base and other revenue-raising changes in corporate taxation; higher\nexcises on tobacco, alcohol and natural gas; a broadening of the property tax\nbase after the revaluation of properties and an extraordinary solidarity\ncontribution on pensions to cope with ageing-related sustainability challenges. On the expenditure side, the measures envisage a sizeable\nreduction in the public sector wage bill by optimising the allocation of\nresources and resizing the public sector work force and by reducing over-time\npayments, fringe benefits and compensations during extraordinary leave. Other\nexpenditure-saving measures include the continuation of rationalisation efforts\nin the health sector; the streamlining of social\nbenefits and better targeting of social support; the reduction\nof intermediate consumption across line ministries; savings from the\nrenegotiation of Public-Private-Partnership contracts and from further\nrestructuring efforts in state-owned enterprises. Some of the envisaged savings\nwill result from a frontloading of the measures which have been devised in the\nframework of the public expenditure review (PER). \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst the former measures\nare of a permanent nature, the government will also adopt non-permanent\nmeasures including a front-loading of revenues from the\nEU Funds, inter alia through the transfer of\nCohesion Fund resources from less mature projects to more advanced ones, and a\nfurther reduction in capital expenditure (Polis programme).\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On top of some of the\nconsolidation measures included in the supplementary budget, all other\nlegislative changes and legislative proposals required to implement the reforms\nlinked to the PER will be adopted by the Government or submitted to the\nParliament, as the case may be, by the end of the legislative session in\nmid-July 2013.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For 2014, the fiscal\nadjustment will proceed on the basis of the PER which the government has\nundertaken over the past months and includes permanent expenditure-reducing\nmeasures of 2 percent of GDP in 2014. The main impact of the PER measures will\nbe along three main axes: (1) reduction of the public sector wage bill; (2)\nreduction of pension benefits and (3) sectoral expenditure cuts across line\nministries and programmes. The PER measures are part of a wider effort to\nreform the state with the objective of increasing equity and efficiency in the\nprovision of social transfers and public services. The reduction in the wage\nbill in 2014 aims at reducing the size of the public-sector work force while\nshifting its composition towards higher-skilled employees, aligning the public\nsector work rules with those of the private sector and making the remuneration\npolicy more transparent and merit-based. Specific reforms include the\ntransformation of the Special Mobility Scheme into a Requalification Programme,\naligning public sector working hours with those in the private sector (i.e.\nincrease from 35 to 40 hours work week), introduction of a bank of hours,\nreduction in holiday entitlements, the implementation of a voluntary redundancy\nscheme (which is estimated to generate one-time upfront cost of about\n0.3 percent of GDP) and the introduction of a single wage and supplement\nscale. A comprehensive pension reform will generate another important part of\nthe savings and will be based on equity principles and income progressivity,\nthereby protecting the lowest pensions. Specifically, the reforms will aim at\nreducing the current differences between the civil servants' system (CGA) and\nthe general system, increasing the statutory retirement age by changes to the\nsustainability factor and introducing \u2013 if strictly needed \u2013 a progressive\nsustainability contribution. Finally, savings in intermediate consumption and\nexpenditure programmes across line ministries will be stepped up.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of political and\nlegal risks in the implementation process, some of the PER measures may be\nreplaced by others of equivalent size and quality during the ongoing\nconsultation process with social and political partners.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The budgetary adjustment\nprocess is flanked by a range of fiscal structural measures to enhance control\nover government expenditure and improve revenue collection. In particular, a\ncomprehensive reform of the budgetary framework, including at central, regional\nand local government levels, is bringing it in line with best practices in\nbudgetary procedures and management. The new commitment control system is\nshowing results but implementation needs to be monitored closely to ensure that\ncommitments are in line with funding. Reforms in the public administration will\ncontinue with an important rationalisation of public employment and public\nentities. Progress in the reform agenda of the revenue administration continues\nand the authorities are enhancing monitoring and strengthening revenue\ncompliance. The renegotiation of Public-Private-Partnerships has started and\nsignificant savings are projected for 2013 and beyond. State-owned enterprises\nreached operational balance on average by the end of 2012 and additional\nefficiency seeking reforms are foreseen to further improve the results. Reforms\nin the health care sector are producing significant savings and implementation\nis continuing broadly in line with targets.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Commission's\ncurrent projections for nominal GDP growth (-1.0 percent in 2013, 1.6 percent\nin 2014 and 3.3 percent in 2015) and the general government deficit of 5.5\npercent of GDP in 2013, 4.0 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2.5 percent of GDP in\n2015, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to develop as follows: 122.9 percent\nof GDP in 2013, 124.2 percent of GDP in 2014 and 123.1 percent of GDP in\n2015. Hence, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be placed on a downward path after\n2014, assuming further progress in the reduction of the deficit. Debt dynamics\nare affected by several below-the-line operations, including sizeable\nacquisitions of financial assets, notably for possible bank recapitalisation\nand financing to state-owned enterprises and differences between accrued and\ncash interest payments. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2012, the bank capital augmentation\nexercise was completed and allowed the participating banks\nto meet the EBA regulatory capital buffers as well as the end-of-year 10\npercent Core Tier 1 programme target. The\nindicative loan-to-deposit target of 120 percent by 2014 is likely to be met,\nwith some banks already below this threshold. Efforts to diversify the sources\nof funding for the corporate sector are being strengthened. The scope for\nimproving the performance and governance of existing government-sponsored\ncredit lines is being assessed.\nThe banks' recovery plans are being analysed and\nresolution plans prepared. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further progress has been\nmade in implementing growth- and competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms.\nIn addition to strengthening active labour market policies, the authorities\nhave adopted a comprehensive labour market reform. With a view to promoting\nlabour market flexibility and job creation, the new legal framework reduces severance\npayments, eases condition of fair dismissals, increases working time flexibility,\nenlarges possibilities for bargaining at firm level and\nrevises the unemployment insurance benefits system to increase incentives for a\nrapid return to work, while guaranteeing a sufficient level of protection. The implementation of the action plans on secondary school and\nvocational training is overall progressing as scheduled.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the\nServices Directive aiming at reducing barriers to entry and boost competition\nand economic activity by facilitating access for new entrants to the market in\nthe different economic regimes is proceeding at good pace. A Framework Law to\nset the main principles of the functioning of the most important National\nRegulator Authorities (NRA), including their endowment with strong independence\nand autonomy is to be submitted to the Parliament. Significant progress has\nbeen made in the transposition of the Third Energy Package and the electricity\ntariff debt reduction to ensure the sustainability of the system is on-going. Licensing\nprocedures and other administrative burdens are being simplified in different\neconomic sectors such as environment and territorial planning, agriculture and\nrural development, industry, tourism or geology.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive reform of\nthe housing rental market has entered into force in November 2012 which should\nmake the housing market more dynamic. Reforms of the judicial system are\nadvancing according to the agreed schedule. Progress has been achieved on the\nreduction of backlog cases and broader reforms such as the geographical\nreorganisation of the court districts and the reform of the Code of Civil\nProcedure.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1 of Implementing\nDecision 2011/344/EU is amended as follows:\n(a)                   \nParagraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181. The Union shall make available to Portugal a loan amounting to a maximum of EUR 26 billion, with a maximum average maturity\nof 19.5 years. The maturity of individual tranches of the loan facility may be\nof up to 30 years.\u2019\n(b)                   \nThe following paragraph is added:\n\u20189. At the request of Portugal, the Commission may extend the maturity of an instalment or a tranche, provided\nthat the maximum average maturity as set out in paragraph 1 is respected. The\nCommission may refinance all or part of its borrowing for that purpose. Any amounts\nborrowed in advance shall be kept on an account with the ECB that the\nCommission has opened for the administration of the financial assistance.\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3 of Implementing\nDecision 2011/344/EU is amended as follows:\n(a)                   \nParagraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u20183. The general government deficit shall\nnot exceed 5.9 percent of GDP in 2011, 5.0 percent of GDP in 2012,\n5.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and 4 percent of GDP in 2014. For the\ncalculation of this deficit, the possible budgetary costs of bank support\nmeasures in the context of the Portuguese Government\u2019s financial sector\nstrategy shall not be taken into account. The budgetary consolidation shall be\nachieved by means of high-quality permanent measures and minimising the impact\non vulnerable groups.\n4. Portugal shall adopt the measures\nspecified in paragraphs 5 to 8 before the end of the indicated year, with exact\ndeadlines for the years 2011-2014 being specified in the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding. Portugal shall stand ready to take additional consolidation\nmeasures to achieve the deficit targets throughout the Programme period.\u2019\n(b)                   \nParagraphs 7 to 9 are replaced by the following:\n\u20187. Portugal shall adopt the following\nmeasures during 2013, in line with specifications in the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding:\n(a)         \nThe general government deficit shall not exceed\n5.5 percent of GDP in 2013. The consolidation measures included in the\n2013 budget, including in the supplementary budget to be adopted by end-May, shall\nbe implemented throughout the year. Revenue-raising measures include a reform\nof the personal income tax that simplifies the tax structure, broadens the tax\nbase through the elimination of some tax benefits and increases the average tax\nrate, while preserving progressivity; a broadening of the corporate income tax\nbase; an increase in excise taxes and in recurrent property taxation and a\nextraordinary solidarity contribution on pensions. Expenditure-saving measures\ninclude a rationalisation of public administration, education, health care and\nsocial benefits; a reduction of the wage bill by decreasing permanent and\ntemporary staff and reducing overtime pay; a lowering of operational and\ncapital expenditures by state-owened enterprises; renegotiations of contracts\nwith public-private partnerships; and cutbacks in intermediate consumption\nacross line ministries; \n(b)         \nSome of the measures derived from the public\nexpenditure review shall be frontloaded to 2013. These mainly consist in a\nfurther reduction in public employment through the transformation of the Special\nMobility Scheme into a Requalification programme, the convergence of public and\nprivate sector working rules, especially by raising working hours in the public\nsector from 35 to 40 hours per week, the increase of public employees'\ncontributions to the special health insurance schemes and the reduction of\nfringe benefits. Rationalisation efforts across line ministries shall be\ndeepened beyond the original budget plans and social spending shall be further streamlined.\nIn addition, the above-mentioned permanent measures should be complemented by\ntemporary measures, to be replaced by permanent ones in 2014, consisting in\nparticular in a front-loading of revenue from the EU\nFunds and a further reduction in capital expenditure\n(Polis programme);\n(c)         \nOn top of some of the consolidation measures\nincluded in the supplementary budget, all other legislative changes and\nlegislative proposals required to implement the reforms linked to the PER shall\nbe adopted by the Government or submitted to the Parliament, as the case may\nbe, by the end of the legislative session in mid-July 2013;\n(d)         \nPortugal shall continue\nimplementing its privatisation programme;\n(e)         \nPortugal shall\ncoordinate the exchange of information across levels of government to\nfacilitate revenue forecasting for the 2014 budgets of the Autonomous Regions\nand the local authorities;\n(f)           \nPortugal shall deepen\nthe use of shared services in public administration;\n(g)         \nPortugal shall reduce\nthe number of local branches of line ministries (e.g. tax, social security,\njustice) by merging them in citizens' shops and developing further the\ne-administration over the duration of the programme;\n(h)         \nPortugal shall continue\nthe reorganisation and rationalisation of the hospital network through\nspecialisation, concentration and downsizing of hospital services, joint\nmanagement and joint operation of hospitals. Finalise the implementation of the\naction plan by the end of 2013;\n(i)           \nWith the support of internationally-reputed\nexperts and following the adoption of the amendments to the New Urban Lease Act\nLaw 6/2006 and the Decree Law which simplifies the administrative procedure for\nrenovation, Portugal shall undertake a comprehensive review of the functioning\nof the housing market;\n(j)           \nPortugal shall develop a\nnationwide land registration system to allow a more equal distribution of\nbenefits and costs in the execution of urban planning;\n(k)         \nPortugal shall implement the measures set out in\nits action plans to improve the quality of secondary and vocational education\nand training, in particular the management tool to analyse, monitor and assess\nthe results and impacts of education and training policies shall be made fully\noperational and the professional schools of reference shall be established;\n(l)           \nPortugal shall complete\nthe adoption of the outstanding sectorial amendments necessary to fully\nimplement the Services Directive;\n(m)       \nPortugal shall implement\ntargeted measures to achieve steady reduction of the backlogged enforcement\ncases in view of resolving the backlog of court cases;\n(n)         \nPortugal shall submit to\nParliament Framework Law on the main National Regulatory Authorities in order\nto guarantee their full independence and financial, administrative and\nmanagement autonomy;\n(o)         \nPortugal shall improve the business environment\nby completing pending reforms on the reduction of administrative burden [fully\noperational Point of Single Contact (PSC) and 'Zero Authorisation' projects]\nand by carrying out further simplification of existing licensing procedures,\nregulations and other administrative burdens in the economy which are a major\nobstacle for the development of economic activities; \n(p)         \nPortugal shall complete\nthe reform of the ports' governance system, including the overhaul of port\noperation concessions;\n(q)         \nPortugal shall implement\nthe measures enhancing the functioning of the transport system;\n(r)          \nPortugal shall implement\nthe measures eliminating the energy tariff debt and fully transpose the Third\nEU Energy Package;\n(s)          \nPortugal shall ensure that the new legal and\ninstitutional PPP framework is applied and the PPP road contracts continue to\nbe renegotiated in line with the strategic plan presented by the government and with the regulatory\nframework revision, in order to obtain substantial fiscal gains, particularly\nin 2013;\n(t)           \nPortugal shall continue\nto focus on measures to combat tax fraud and evasion and strengthen taxpayers'\ncompliance.\n(u)         \nPortugal shall introduce\nadjustments to the severance payments regime in accordance with the provisions\nof the Memorandum of Understanding;\n(v)         \nPortugal shall promote\nwage developments consistent with the objectives of fostering job creation and\nimproving firms\u2019 competitiveness with a view to correcting macroeconomic\nimbalances. Over the Programme period, any increase in minimum wages shall take\nplace only if justified by economic and labour market developments;\n(w)       \nPortugal shall continue\nto improve the effectiveness of its active labour market policies in line with\nthe results of the assessment report and the action plan to improve the\nfunctioning of the public employment services.\n8. The general government deficit shall not\nexceed 4.0 percent of GDP in 2014. To achieve this objective Portugal shall implement the expenditure-reducing measures that were prepared in the\nframework of the public expenditure review. Overall, the amount of these\nmeasures shall add up to 2 percent of GDP in 2014 and shall include the\nreduction in the wage bill aimed at reducing the size of the public-sector work\nforce while changing its composition towards higher-skilled employees; further\nconvergence of public and private sector work rules, i.e. increase in working\nhours, introduction of a bank of hours, reduction in holiday entitlements; the\nimplementation of a voluntary redundancy scheme; a reduction of the current\ndifferences between the civil servants' pension regime (CGA) and the general\npension system; an increase in the statutory retirement age; and \u2013 if strictly\nneeded \u2013 a progressive sustainability contribution on pensions. Furthermore,\nsavings in intermediate consumption and expenditure programs across line\nministries shall be stepped up. Some of the measures may be partly or fully replaced\nby others of equivalent size and quality.\n9. With a view to restoring confidence in\nthe financial sector, Portugal shall aim to maintain an adequate level of\ncapital in its banking sector and ensure an orderly deleveraging process in\ncompliance with the deadlines set in the Memorandum of Understanding.
