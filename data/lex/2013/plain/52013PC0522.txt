The instrument is generally meeting its\r\nobjectives well but is considered not to be sufficiently responsive and visible\r\nand as far as certain criteria for its activation are concerned too complicated\r\nand not sufficiently clear.\nIn 2005 the Commission presented a proposal\r\nfor a new EUSF Regulation[2].\r\nWhile the proposal was favourably received by the European Parliament[3] it was not adopted in the\r\nCouncil. The Commission officially withdrew the proposal in June 2012.\nIn October 2011 the Commission presented a\r\nCommunication on the Future of the Solidarity Fund[4] which contains an evaluation of\r\nthe operations of the current instrument and proposes options for improving its\r\nfunctioning. An analysis of the current policy was also included in a separate\r\nchapter to the EUSF annual report for 2008[5].\nThis proposal is situated in the context of\r\nthe new Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020.\nMoreover, the proposal complements the\r\nrecent common proposal of the Commission and the High Representative for\r\nimplementing arrangements of the Solidarity Clause enshrined in Article 222\r\nTFEU[6] which underlines the role of\r\nthe Solidarity Fund as one of the key Union instruments in applying this\r\nprovision of the Treaty.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATION\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES\nThe Communication of October 2011 served as a basis for discussions with the Member States and the\r\nEuropean Parliament and other stakeholders.\nThe European Economic and Social Committee\r\nand the European Parliament adopted reports that very broadly shared the\r\nanalysis of the Communication and supported the ideas presented by the\r\nCommission for improving the Fund through a number of adjustments to the\r\nRegulation.[7][8]\nMember States expressed their views in\r\nmeetings of the COCOF and Structural Actions Working Party of the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Substance of the Proposal\nThe main objective of the proposal is to\r\nimprove the functioning of the existing Solidarity Fund instrument by making it\r\nquicker to respond and more visible to citizens, simpler to use and its\r\nprovisions clearer. This is to be achieved by a limited number of technical\r\nadjustments to the Regulation. The principles of the instrument remain\r\nunchanged as do its financing method outside the multiannual financial\r\nframework (MFF) and the likely level of spending.\nThe proposal contains those adjustments to\r\nthe EUSF-Regulation that were discussed in the 2011 Communication on the Future\r\nof the Solidarity Fund:\n\u00b7                        \r\nA clear definition of the scope of the EUSF\r\nlimited to natural disasters including man-made disaster that are the direct\r\nconsequence of a natural disaster (cascading effects). This will eliminate\r\nexisting legal uncertainties about the scope and thus avoid that applications\r\nare presented which do not meet the conditions.\n\u00b7                        \r\nA new and simple single criterion for the\r\nexceptional mobilisation of the EUSF for so-called extraordinary regional\r\ndisasters based on a GDP-related threshold. As demonstrated in the 2011\r\nCommunication the lack of clarity under the current provisions about the\r\nconditions for exceptionally mobilising the EUSF will be eliminated by setting\r\nthe damage threshold for regional disasters at 1.5% of GDP at NUTS 2 level.\r\nThis will considerably simplify and speed up the preparation of applications by\r\neligible States and their assessment by the Commission. At the same time it\r\nwill significantly reduce the number of rejected applications as applicants\r\nwill know from the outset whether the criterion is met. The rate of 1,5% of\r\nregional GDP is proposed as the new threshold because a detailed analysis of\r\npast applications has shown that it will lead to almost identical results as in\r\nthe past while achieving considerable simplification and considerably help\r\nspeeding up decision-making and paying out grants.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe introduction of the possibility to make rapid\r\nadvance payments upon request of the affected Member State, limited to 10% of\r\nthe expected amount of the financial aid capped at EUR 30 million. Recoveries from\r\nthe Member States from the Solidarity Fund and from the Cohesion Instruments\r\n(ERDF and Cohesion Fund) up to a maximum annual amount should be made available\r\nto the Solidarity Fund as assigned revenue in order to make committments for\r\nadvance payments available in the Union budget. In addition to including a\r\nspecific provision in the Solidarity Fund Regulation this will also require\r\nincluding a provision in the Common Provisions Regulation[9] relating to the Cohesion Policy\r\nFunds and in the transitional provisions relating to the current programming\r\nperiod. It is envisaged that the Commission will present an amending proposal to\r\nbe adopted at the same time as the present proposal.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe inclusion of a specific provision for slowly\r\nunfolding disasters such as drought. Defining the start of such disasters as\r\nthe date at which the public authorities took the first counter-measures will\r\neliminate legal difficulties stemming from the current obligation to submit\r\napplications within 10 weeks of the date of the first damage.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe introduction of certain provisions\r\nencouraging more effective disaster prevention, including full implementation\r\nof relevant Union legislation on prevention, the use of available Union funding\r\nfor related investments and improved reporting on these actions. In the event\r\nthat a disaster of the same nature as one for which the Fund was previously\r\nmobilised should occur and Union legislation has not been complied with, the\r\nCommission will seriously consider rejecting a new application or granting a\r\nreduced amount of aid only.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe merger of the decision awarding the aid and\r\nthe implementation agreements into a single act. This administrative measure\r\nwill help to speed up the processing of applications inside the Commission and\r\ntherefore allow paying out aid more rapidly.\nThe recommendations of the performance\r\naudit report of the European Court of Auditors on the financial aid to Italy\r\nfor the L'Aquila earthquake[10]\r\nare taken into account by including a clearer definition of the terms\r\n\"temporary accommodation\" and \"immediate emergency\r\noperations\" as well as a provision on revenue generation.\nMoreover, a number of further elements were\r\nincluded in the proposal, such as a specific provision on the eligibility of\r\nVAT and the exclusion of Technical Assistance, a provision requiring respect\r\nfor the Union acquis, a revised provision to avoid double financing, extended\r\nex-post reporting on prevention measures and a provision on the use of the Euro\r\nand its conversion into national currencies.\nLastly, a number of modifications are\r\nintroduced to bring the Regulation in line with the Financial Regulation as\r\namended in 2012. This concerns not only terminology but in particular certain rules\r\nand obligations in relation the implementation of the Fund by Member States\r\nunder the principle of shared management and by eligible candidate countries\r\n(countries negotiating the accession to the Union) under the principle of\r\nindirect management. In order not to put at risk the objectives of the Fund,\r\ni.e. to make financial assistance available as quickly as possible after the\r\noccurrence of a major disaster, it is however necessary to derogate from\r\ncertain provisions of the Financial Regulation, in particular as concerns the\r\nnormally time-consuming process of designating the implementing authorities,\r\nincluding those for audit and control, as well as regarding the timing of\r\nannual reporting.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of this proposal is Article\r\n175 third subparagraph and Article 212 second paragraph of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union which corresponds with the legal base of the\r\ncurrent Regulation. Recourse to Article 212 is necessary to include non-Member\r\nStates that are in the process of negotiating their accession to the EU.\nWhile the Solidarity Fund is to be seen as\r\none of the Union instruments for the implementation of the Solidarity Clause\r\nenshrined in Article 222 TFEU the latter is not appropriate as legal basis for\r\nthe Fund. Article 222 is reserved for the most serious of crisis situations\r\nwhereas the criteria for the activation of the Solidarity Fund are defined in a\r\nway leading to the use of the Fund several times each year. Under the\r\nlegislative procedure foreseen by Article 222 the European Parliament is\r\ninformed but not actively involved; this is not in line with the provisions of\r\nthe Fund fully involving the Parliament in raising the appropriations for\r\nSolidarity Fund financial aid. Moreover, the Solidarity Fund includes certain\r\nnon-Member States not covered by Article 222.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal respects the subsidiarity\r\nprinciple and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of\r\nthe Solidarity Fund as established in 2002. The current Solidarity Fund\r\nRegulation itself is based on the subsidiarity principle. Accordingly, the Fund\r\nintervenes only in cases where the capacity of a disaster-stricken country to\r\ndeal with the situation alone reaches its limits. The objective is not to deal\r\nwith disasters at EU level but to grant affected countries financial aid to\r\nhelp them bear the financial burden inflicted on them as a consequence of a\r\nnatural disaster The proposal does not touch on these constituent principle nor\r\ndoes it change the eligibility criteria for disasters to be accepted.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal respects the proportionality\r\nprinciple. It does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives\r\nalready lead down in the current instrument.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposal takes account of the Multi-annual\r\nFinancial Framework 2014 \u2013 2020 which foresees maintaining the current mechanism\r\nwhereby the necessary budgetary resources for awarding financial aid are raised\r\nover and above the MFF ceilings by a decision of the budget authority within a\r\nmaximum annual allocation of EUR 500 million (2011 prices).\nThe decision to express the maximum annual\r\nallocation of the Fund in 2011 prices (instead of current prices) is mirrored in\r\nthe proposal by applying the same basis to the amount of\r\nEUR 3 billion which is one of the two damage threshold for defining\r\n'major disasters'. The other threshold defined as 0.6% of gross national income\r\nis not affected.\nIn cases where an advance has been paid its\r\namount will be taken into account when the final contribution from the Fund is\r\npaid out.\n2013/0248 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article\r\n175 and Article 212(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nEconomic and Social Committee([11]),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions([12]),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishes the European Union\r\nSolidarity Fund ('the Fund')[13].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nUnion should continue to show solidarity with the countries currently\r\nnegotiating their accession. The inclusion of those countries in the scope of\r\nthis Regulation entails recourse to Article 212 of the Treaty as a legal basis.\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission should be in a position to decide rapidly on committing specific\r\nfinancial resources and mobilising them as quickly as possible. Administrative\r\nprocedures should be adjusted accordingly and confined to the minimum\r\nnecessary. To this end, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission\r\nhave concluded on [dd/mm/yyyy] an Inter-Institutional Agreement on the\r\nfinancing of the Fund, on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary\r\nprocedure. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The terminology and\r\nprocedures under Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 should be aligned with the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\r\n966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on\r\nthe financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing\r\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[14].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ndefinition of a natural disaster, which determines the scope of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 2012/2002, should be unambiguous. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Damage\r\ncaused by other types of disaster that through a cascading effect are the\r\ndirect consequence of a natural disaster should, for the purposes of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 2012/2002, be considered to be part of the direct damage caused by that\r\nnatural disaster.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to codify the established practice and to ensure equal treatment of\r\napplications it should be specified that contributions from the Fund are to be\r\nawarded in respect of direct damage only. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\n'major natural disaster' within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 should\r\nbe defined as having caused direct damage above a threshold expressed in\r\nfinancial terms and should be expressed in prices of a reference year, or as a\r\npercentage of the gross national income (GNI) of the State concerned.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to better take into account the specific nature of those disasters which,\r\nalthough important, do not reach the minimum scale required to benefit from a\r\ncontribution from the Fund, the criteria for regional disasters should be determined\r\nbased on the damage calculable by reference to regional gross domestic product (GDP).\r\nThose criteria should be determined in a clear and simple manner in order to\r\nreduce the possibility of applications being submitted which do not meet the\r\nrequirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe purposes of determining direct damage, data with a harmonised format, provided\r\nby EUROSTAT, should be used in order to allow an equitable treatment of\r\napplications. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nFund should contribute to the restoration of infrastructure to working order,\r\nto the cleaning up of disaster\u2011stricken zones and to the costs of the rescue services\r\nand for temporary accommodation for the population concerned during the whole implementation\r\nperiod. The time-span during which the accommodation of people made homeless by\r\nthe disaster may be considered temporary should also be defined.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nprovisions of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 should be aligned with the general Union\r\nfunding policy in relation to value added tax. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nshould also be specified that eligible operations should not include\r\nexpenditure for technical assistance.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to exclude that beneficiary States make a net profit from the\r\nintervention of the Fund, the conditions under which operations financed by the\r\nFund may generate revenue should be specified.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain\r\ntypes of natural disaster, such as droughts, are developing over a longer\r\nperiod of time before their disastrous effects are felt. Provision should be\r\nmade to allow the use of the Fund also in such cases.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to ensure\r\nthat the eligible States make the requisite efforts to prevent disasters from\r\noccurring and to mitigate their effects, including by full implementation of\r\nrelevant Union legislation on disaster risk prevention and\r\nmanagement and the use of available Union funding for relevant\r\ninvestments. Provision should therefore be made that a failure\r\nof the Member State to comply with relevant Union\r\nlegislation on disaster risk prevention and management, after\r\nhaving received a contribution from the Fund for an earlier natural disaster, may\r\nresult in the rejection of the application or a reduction\r\nof the amount of contribution in the event of a further application for a\r\ndisaster of the same nature.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\r\nStates may require financial support in response to a disaster more rapidly\r\nthan is possible through the normal procedure. For this purpose, it is\r\nappropriate to provide for the possibility of making an advance payment upon\r\nrequest by the Member State concerned shortly after the application for a\r\ncontribution from the Fund has been submitted to the Commission. The advance\r\nshould not exceed a certain amount and it should be accounted for when the\r\nfinal amount of the contribution is paid out. Moreover, amounts from the Fund and from the European Regional Development Fund\r\nand the Cohesion Fund recovered from the Member States should, up to a certain maximum\r\namount, be considered as internal assigned revenue in order to make commitments\r\nfor advance payments available in the Union budget. The payment of an advance\r\nshould not prejudge the final decision on the mobilisation of the Fund.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Administrative\r\nprocedures leading up to the payment of a contribution should be as simple and\r\ntime-efficient as possible. For Member States, detailed provisions on the implementation\r\nof the contribution from the Fund should therefore be contained in the implementing\r\ndecisions awarding that contribution. However, for beneficiary States which are\r\nnot yet Member States of the Union, separate implementation agreements should\r\nbe maintained for legal reasons. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 has introduced changes in shared and indirect\r\nmanagement, including specific reporting requirements which should be taken\r\ninto account. Reporting obligations should reflect the short implementation\r\nperiod of the Fund operations. The procedures for the designation of the bodies\r\nresponsible for the management and control of the Union funds should reflect\r\nthe nature of the instrument and not delay the payment of the contribution from\r\nthe Fund. It is therefore necessary to derogate from Regulation (EU, Euratom)\r\nNo 966/2012.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision\r\nshould be made to avoid double financing of operations financed by the Fund with\r\nother financial instruments of the Union or international legal instruments\r\nrelating to the compensation of specific damage.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Declaring\r\nexpenditure that countries have made from a contribution from the Fund should\r\nbe as simple as possible. A single exchange rate should therefore be used\r\nthroughout the implementation of the contribution for countries that are not\r\nmembers of the euro area.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No\r\n2012/2002 with respect to awarding the contribution from\r\nthe Fund, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions governing\r\nthe protection of financial interests of the Union should be made more specific\r\nso as to clearly identify measures for the prevention, detection and\r\ninvestigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or\r\nincorrectly used.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\r\nthis Regulation, namely to ensure Union-wide solidarity action to support a\r\ndisaster stricken State, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States on\r\nan ad-hoc basis and can therefore, by reason of applying a systematic, regular\r\nand equitable method of granting financial support involving all Member States\r\naccording to their capacity, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may\r\nadopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\r\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EC) No 2012/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\nHAVE\r\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 2012/2002 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 2 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the request of a Member State or\r\ncountry involved in accession negotiations with the Union, assistance from the\r\nFund may be mobilised when serious repercussions on living conditions, the\r\nnatural environment or the economy occur in one or more regions of that State or\r\ncountry as a consequence of a major or regional natural disaster having taken\r\nplace on the territory of the same State or country, a neighbouring Member\r\nState or a neighbouring country involved in accession negotiations with the\r\nUnion (hereinafter referred to as \u2018eligible State\u2019). Direct damage caused by a\r\nman-made disaster that is the direct consequence of a natural disaster shall be\r\nregarded as part of the direct damage caused by that natural disaster. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this Regulation, a\r\n\u2018major natural disaster\u2019 shall mean any natural disaster resulting, in a Member\r\nState or a country involved in accession negotiations with the Union, in direct\r\ndamage estimated either at over EUR 3 000 000 000 in 2011 prices,\r\nor more than 0,6 % of its gross national income (GNI).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this Regulation, a\r\n\u2018regional natural disaster\u2019 shall mean any natural disaster resulting, in a\r\nregion of a Member State or a country involved in accession negotiations with\r\nthe Union at NUTS 2 level, in direct damage in excess of 1,5 % of the region's\r\ngross domestic product (GDP).

The objective is not to deal with\r\ndisasters at EU level but to grant affected countries financial assistance to\r\nhelp them bear the financial burden inflicted on them as a consequence of a\r\nnatural disaster.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nTo respond to request from eligible countries\r\n(Member States and countries negotiating their accession to the EU) for financial\r\nassistance following natural disasters\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThis proposal is situated in the context of the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the years\r\n2014-2020.\nMoreover, the proposal complements the recent\r\ncommon proposal of the Commission and the High Representative for implementing\r\narrangements of the Solidarity Clause enshrined in Article 222 TFEU[20] which underlines the role of the Solidarity\r\nFund as one of the key Union instruments in applying this provision of the\r\nTreaty.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe introduction of clearer criteria and\r\nsimpler procedures as well as the possibility of an advance payment in order to\r\nprovide a faster reaction\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe Fund complements other EU instruments in\r\nthe field of risk prevention, mitigation and rapid response (in particular\r\nCohesion Policy instruments and the Civil Protection Mechanism)\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[21] \nFor the 2013 budget: not applicable\n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[22]\r\n\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\r\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\r\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\r\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nFrom the 2014 budget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments \nCountries eligible to the Fund are:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States to which the\r\nprinciples of shared management apply.

Before paying out a contribution from\r\nthe Fund to an eligible State\r\nthat is not a Member State, the Commission will conclude a delegation agreement\r\nwith that State laying down detailed provisions for the implementation of the\r\ncontribution from the Fund in accordance with the\r\nFinancial Regulation and comparable to those applicable to Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nThe established monitoring system is not\r\nmodified by this proposal and is based on a system of shared management for Member\r\nStates and indirect management for eligible candidate countries with comparable\r\nobligations. It is adapted to the short implementation period (1 year) and the\r\nspecificity of the instrument in replying to emergency situations. A final report is required on the implementation of the\r\ncontribution from the Fund within six months after the\r\nexpiry of the one-year period. This report has to give details on the\r\nimplementation system adopted, including audit and control work as well as a\r\ncomplete presentation of operations. In addition, the designated body will have\r\nto comply with the reporting requirements under Articles 59(5) or 60(5) as\r\nappropriate, for the whole period of implementation of the operation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThe beneficiary state sends a request which is\r\nappraised by the Commission. If the request fulfils the conditions, a 10%\r\nadvance will be paid. Closure is done based on the final report, at which time\r\nthe 10% advance will also be cleared. Advances will be paid based on a specific\r\ntechnique introduced in the Structural Funds regulation using recoveries from\r\nthe ERDF and Cohesion Fund. The proposed architecture is an evolution of the\r\ncurrent situation.\nThe recommendations of the performance audit\r\nreport of the European Court of Auditors on the financial aid to Italy for the\r\nL'Aquila earthquake[23]\r\nare taken into account by including a clearer definition of the terms\r\n\"temporary accommodation\" and \"immediate emergency\r\noperations\" as well as a provision on revenue generation. \nMoreover, a number of further elements were\r\nincluded in the proposal, such as a specific provision on the eligibility of\r\nVAT and the exclusion of Technical Assistance, a provision requiring respect\r\nfor the Union acquis, a revised provision to avoid double financing,\r\nextended ex-post reporting on prevention measures and a provision on the use of\r\nthe Euro and its conversion into national currencies.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nThe annex to each decision shall provide\r\ndetailed provisions for the implementation of the contribution from the Fund.\r\nFor non-Member States these provisions will be laid down in the delegation\r\nagreement. There is no change compared with current Regulation. The body will\r\nbe designated by the beneficiary state. The\r\ncontribution from the Fund to a Member State shall be implemented within the\r\nframework of shared management between the Member States and the Commission, in\r\naccordance with the Financial Regulation. A contribution from the Fund to\r\nStates that are not yet a member of the Union shall be implemented within the\r\nframework of indirect management.\nWithout prejudice to the Commission's\r\nresponsibility for implementing the general budget of the European Union,\r\nbeneficiary States shall take responsibility in the first instance for the\r\nmanagement of actions supported by the Fund and the financial control of the\r\nactions. To that end, they shall verify that management and control\r\narrangements have been set up and are being implemented in such a way as to\r\nensure that Union funds are being used efficiently and correctly, in accordance\r\nwith the principles of sound financial management; verify that the financed\r\nactions have been properly carried out; and ensure that expenditure funded is\r\nbased on verifiable supporting documents, and is correct and regular. \nThe Commission shall take every step necessary\r\nto verify that the actions financed are carried out in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of sound financial management. It is the responsibility of the beneficiary\r\nState to ensure that it has effectively functioning management and control\r\nsystems. The Commission shall satisfy itself that such systems are in place.\r\nWithout prejudice to the powers of the Court of Auditors or the checks carried\r\nout by the beneficiary State in accordance with national laws, regulations and\r\nadministrative provisions, Commission officials or servants may carry out\r\non-the-spot checks, on the actions financed by the Fund. The Commission shall\r\ngive notice to the applicant beneficiary State with a view to obtaining all the\r\nassistance necessary. Officials or servants of the beneficiary State concerned\r\nmay take part in such checks. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error \nA new and simple single criterion for the\r\nexceptional mobilisation of the EUSF for so-called extraordinary regional\r\ndisasters based on a GDP-related threshold. As demonstrated in the 2011\r\nCommunication the lack of clarity under the current provisions about the\r\nconditions for exceptionally mobilising the EUSF will be eliminated by setting\r\nthe damage threshold for regional disasters at 1.5% of GDP at NUTS 2 level.\r\nThis will considerably simplify and speed up the preparation of applications by\r\neligible States and their assessment by the Commission. At the same time it\r\nwill significantly reduce the number of rejected applications as applicants\r\nwill know from the outset whether the criterion is met. This should reduce the\r\ncost of controls. \nAudits carried out by the Commission and the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors have not given rise to issues which would prevent\r\nfrom having a reasonable assurance on the use of the Fund in the past. The\r\noverall estimated error rate is below the materiality threshold of 2%.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nPrimary responsibility for taking appropriate\r\nmeasures against fraud and irregularities lies with the beneficiary State which\r\nhas to appoint an audit body and, if necessary require the recovery of irregular\r\nspending. A summary of the audits and controls carried out during the\r\nimplementation period should be submitted to the Commission in accordance with\r\nthe Financial Regulation. Audits can be carried out at any time by Commission\r\nauditors, the Court of Auditors or OLAF.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [\u2026]Heading\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
