In accordance with Directive 2000/53/EC[2], appropriate provisions have\r\nbeen laid down to ensure that type-approved vehicles belonging to category M1,\r\nand those belonging to category N1, may be put on the market only if they are\r\nreusable and/or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by mass and are reusable and/or\r\nrecoverable to a minimum of 95 % by mass.\nWith the adoption of the draft UNECE\r\nRegulation on uniform provisions concerning the recyclability of motor vehicles,\r\nan important step forward will be taken in terms of technical and market\r\nharmonisation and the removal of possible trade barriers regarding the\r\nrecyclability, reusability and recovery of parts, equipment and resources from\r\nend-of-life vehicles as Members States within the EU may take the text over as\r\nreference when setting up their national legislations.\nHence it is now envisaged for the Union to\r\nvote in favour of the related draft UNECE Regulation on uniform provisions\r\nconcerning the recyclability of motor vehicles in order to have common\r\nharmonised requirements at international level which will facilitate\r\ninternational trade. This will enable European companies to follow one set of\r\nrequirements recognised worldwide, i.e. in the countries Contracting Parties to\r\nthe Revised 1958 UNECE Agreement.\n\u00b7                        \r\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nThe requirements for the type approval of\r\nmotor vehicles with regard to their reusability, recyclability and\r\nrecoverability are currently addressed at the EU level by Directive 2005/64/EC.\r\nDirective 2005/64/EC is based on Directive 2000/53/EC, which sets-out the\r\ntechnical requirements for end-of-life vehicles. Both EU directives provide the\r\nlegislative basis for the harmonisation of requirements for end-of-life\r\nvehicles at the EU level. There is currently no UNECE legislation providing\r\nharmonisation at the international level.\n\u00b7                        \r\nConsistency with the other policies and\r\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is in line with the objectives\r\nof Directives 2005/64/EC and 2000/53/EC and is therefore consistent with the EU\r\nhealth, safety and environmental objectives and with the EU objective of\r\nproviding for a high level of environmental protection throughout the territory\r\nof the Union. Additionally, the proposal is in line with Framework Directive\r\n2007/46/EC[3]\r\nand the objective to make progress towards the international harmonisation of the\r\nlegislation for the type approval of motor vehicles. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n In developing the proposal, the European Commission has participated in the UNECE Working Group on Pollution and Energy (GRPE), where representatives of stakeholders as well as MS have met and has bilaterally consulted stakeholders and stakeholder organisations. In the course of the drafting of the new regulation, key aspects of the text were discussed in the 63rd, 64th and 65th sessions of GRPE. \u00b7                         Impact assessment The provisions of the UNECE regulation on uniform provisions concerning the recyclability of motor vehicles have been entirely based on the requirements and provisions of Directives 2005/64/EC and 2000/53/EC and can be considered as complementary to the Framework Directive 2007/46/EC on the type-approval of motor vehicles. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal will enable the Union,\r\nrepresented by the Commission, to vote in favour of the draft UNECE Regulation on\r\nuniform provisions concerning the recyclability of motor vehicles.\n\u00b7                        \r\nLegal basis\nTaking into consideration the object and\r\ncontent of the Council Decision, the legal bases are Articles 114 and 218(9)\r\nTFEU. The procedure to be followed for the adoption of the Council Decision is\r\nthe one laid down in Article 4(2) of Council Decision 97/836/EC.\n\u00b7                        \r\nSubsidiarity principle\nDirective 2000/53/EC sets out the technical\r\nrequirements for the recyclability, reusability and recoverability for\r\nend-of-life vehicles. Additionally, Directive 2005/64/EC sets out the\r\nrequirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their\r\nreusability, recyclability and recoverability and leaves to the judgement of MS\r\nthe decision on the precise measures to be taken in order to comply with the\r\nabovementioned requirements. In this respect, the recyclability of motor\r\nvehicles and the treatment of end-of-life vehicles may play a fundamental role in\r\nstrengthening EU objectives related to health, safety and environmental protection,\r\nthus realising the EU objective of providing for a high level of environmental\r\nprotection throughout the territory of the Union.\nGiven the background above, and according\r\nto the subsidiarity principle, it is appropriate for the EU to vote in favour\r\nto the UNECE Regulation on uniform provisions concerning the recyclability of\r\nmotor vehicles, while respecting the capacity of MS to decide whether the\r\nRegulation should be applied, at their respective national levels for the mandatory\r\ntype-approval of motor-vehicles with respect to their recyclability, or for other\r\npurposes. However, and without prejudice of the faculty of MS to decide within\r\nthe scope of their competences, the basic rules of the 1958 Agreement shall\r\napply to the whole of the EU and in the same manner to all MS. \nThe proposal therefore complies with the\r\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \r\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\r\nMarket while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection.\n\u00b7                        \r\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\nThe use of a Council Decision is considered\r\nto be appropriate as in line with the requirements of Article 218(9) TFEU.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nUnion budget.\n2013/0336 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the Union\r\nin the Administrative Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope
