The\nHague Service Convention simplifies the method of transmission of judicial and\nextrajudicial documents. The main channel of transmission, in lieu of consular\nand diplomatic channels, is through a Central Authority, who shall serve the\ndocuments or shall arrange to have them served. The Convention also provides\nfor several alternative methods of transmission (e.g. postal channels). It also\naims to establish a system which, to extent possible, brings actual notice of\nthe document to be served to the recipient in sufficient time to enable him to\ndefend himself. Furthermore, the Convention facilitates proof that the service\nhas been affected abroad, by mean of certificates contained in a uniform model.\n\nThe Hague Service Convention falls within the exclusive external competence of the European Union\nfollowing the adoption of the Union internal rules on service of documents in\nthe Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000, repealed by\nthe Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member\nStates of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No\n1348/2000[1]. Consequently, the Member States cannot conclude\nthe Hague Service Convention without being authorized to do so.\n24 Member States had acceded to the Hague Service Convention before the adoption\nof EU legislation. The remaining Member States which have to be authorised to\naccede to the convention are Austria and Malta[2].\n\nThe Commission therefore proposes that the\nCouncil authorizes Austria and Malta to accede to the Hague Service Convention in the interest of the European Union. The Convention does not have a clause allowing the EU itself to\naccede. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Importance\nof accession to the Hague Service Convention \nThe\nHague Service Convention, improving the transmission of judicial and\nextrajudicial documents abroad is particularly important for the European Union\nand its Member States because it facilitates judicial\ncooperation in cross-border litigation in relations with the third states,\nparties to the Convention. The Convention is broadly\nratified, counting 67 Contracting States at the moment.\nAustria and Malta have expressed their\ninterest in acceding to the Hague Service Convention.\nTheir\naccession to the Convention would correspond with the policy commitment of\nacceding to the instruments of the Hague Conference on Private International\nLaw, where there is an EU interest, undertaken by the EU when it became a\nmember of the Hague Conference in 2007.\nFurthermore,\nthe EU in its external relations has been promoting the accession of third\ncountries to the Hague Service Convention as an efficient and reliable system\nfor the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents. It would be consistent\nwith this approach that all the Member States of the EU itself are Contracting\nStates to the Convention.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn the relevant working party in the\nCouncil Austria and Malta have confirmed their interest in acceding to the Hague Service Convention. The Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private\nInternational Law has conveyed interest of third countries Party to the\nConvention to extend it to all EU Member States. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competence\nof the EU with respect to the Hague Service Convention\nIn\naccordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion and the case law[3]\nof the European Court of Justice, the matter of service of judicial and\nextrajudicial documents falls into the exclusive external competence of the\nEuropean Union, because of the adoption of internal Union legislation by means of\nRegulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member\nStates of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. The Member States therefore no longer have the right to contract\nobligations with third countries which affect these rules. \nIn\nparticular, Article 3(2) TFEU provides that the Union has exclusive competence\nfor the conclusion of an international agreement in so far as its conclusion\nmay affect common rules or alter their scope. Under this rule, in accordance\nwith the case law, an agreement falls within the EU's exclusive competence when\nit can be demonstrated that the subject matter of the agreement falls within\nthe scope of internal common rules, or within an area already largely covered\nby such rules, or rules have been adopted in areas falling outside common\npolicies and, in particular, in areas where there are harmonising measures,\nregardless of whether there is or is not a contradiction between those common\nrules and the agreement.\nRegulation\n(EC) No 1393/2007 applies to civil and commercial matters\nwhen it is necessary to transmit judicial or extrajudicial documents for\nservice from one Member State to another. Agencies designated by the Member\nStates are responsible for transmitting and receiving documents. The Regulation sets up a system that reflects the one provided for by the Hague Service Convention, therefore the subject matter of the Hague Service Convention\nclearly falls within the scope of the EU internal legislation. Consequently,\nthe European Union has exclusive competence over the Hague Service Convention.\nFurthermore,\nthe Union has already exercised its external competence in the matter of\nservice of documents by concluding international agreement with Denmark on the service of documents[4].\n\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Authorization\nof the Member States\nSince\nthe Hague Service Convention has no Regional Economic Organization clause, it\nis not possible for the European Union to become a Contracting Party to the\nConvention. It is therefore necessary for the Union to exercise its powers\nthrough its Member States and thus authorise the Member States concerned to\naccede to the Hague Service Convention in the interest of the Union. There are\nseveral precedents in the area of civil justice, the most recent one is\nevidenced by the Council Decision 2008/431/EC authorising\ncertain Member States to ratify, or accede to, in the interest of the European\nCommunity, the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law,\nRecognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility\nand Measures for the Protection of Children and authorising certain Member\nStates to make a declaration on the application of the relevant internal rules\nof Community law[5].\nThe\nHague Service Convention provides for a possibility for the Contracting States\nto make declarations with regard to a number of its provisions, e.g. Article\n8(2), Article 10, Article 15(2), Article 16(3). The EU Member States,\nContracting States to the Convention, entered various declarations. The\nsituation is not uniform: e. g. a number of Member States entered declaration\non Article 8(2) granting diplomatic and consular agents the power to serve\ndocuments on their own national only, while some others opposed only to methods\nof transmission provided in Article 10. Declarations pursuant to Article 16(3)\nproviding for application for relief are different e.g. as concerns the time\nlimit to fill the application. Against this backdrop, it is not reasonable to require\nthe Member States concerned to make uniform declaration(s), if any. In\nconclusion, the Member States concerned should, when acceding to the\nConvention, make all appropriate declarations allowed under its provisions that\nthey deem necessary. The text of such declarations should be attached to the\nCouncil decision though.\n2013/0177 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorizing Austria and Malta to accede to\nthe Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and\nExtrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters in the interest of the\nEuropean Union\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2) and 218(6)(a)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[6],\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Hague Convention of 15\nNovember 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in\nCivil or Commercial Matters (hereinafter referred to as the \"Hague Service\nConvention\") simplifies methods of transmission of judicial and\nextrajudicial documents between the Contracting States. It thus facilitates judicial cooperation in\ncross-border civil and commercial litigation. The Hague\nService Convention has been broadly ratified globally. Promotion of the\naccession by third states to the Hague Service Convention is a part of the EU\nexternal policy in the area of civil justice.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union has\nexclusive external competence with regard to the Hague Service Convention\ninsofar as its provisions affect the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No\n1393/2007 of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 November 2007 on the\nservice in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil\nor commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1348/2000[7].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Hague Service\nConvention is not open to participation by regional organizations. As a result,\nthe European Union is not in a position to accede to the Convention. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the Hague\nService Convention is important for the European Union interests, the Council\nshould authorize the Member States which had not concluded the Hague Service\nConvention before adoption of the Union measures to accede to the Convention in\nthe interest of the European Union, subject to the conditions laid down in this\nDecision. The Member States to which this decision is addressed are Austria and Malta. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nHague Service Convention provides for a possibility for the Contracting States\nto make declarations with regard to a number of its provisions. Accordingly, Austria and Malta should, when acceding to the Convention, make all appropriate declarations allowed\nunder its provisions that they deem necessary. The text of such declarations\nshould be attached to this Decision. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Kingdom and\nIreland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and\nextrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents),\nand repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000[8] and are\ntherefore taking part in the adoption of this Decision.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nArticles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the\nTreaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not\nbound by it or subject to its application,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1. Without prejudice to the European Union\u2019s\npowers, Austria and Malta shall accede to the Hague\nConvention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and\nExtrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters in\nthe interest of the European Union.\n2.\nThe text of the Hague Service Convention is attached to this Decision as Annex\nI.\nArticle 2\n1. When acceding to the Hague Service Convention, Austria and Malta shall make the appropriate declarations allowed under the\nprovisions of the Convention. \n2. The text of the declarations is attached to\nthis Decision as Annex II.\nArticle 3\n1. Member States concerned shall take the\nnecessary steps to deposit their instruments of accession to the Hague Service\nConvention within a reasonable time and, if possible, before 31 December 2014.\n2. Member\nStates concerned shall inform the Council and the Commission, before 1 July\n2014, of the prospective date of conclusion of their accession procedures.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nArticle 5\nWhen acceding to the Hague Service Convention, Austria and Malta shall inform the Permanent Bureau of\n  the Hague Conference on Private International Law in writing that accession\nhas taken place in accordance with this Decision.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision\nis addressed to Austria and Malta in accordance with the Treaties.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX I\nCONVENTION ON THE SERVICE ABROAD OF\nJUDICIAL AND EXTRAJUDICIAL DOCUMENTS IN CIVIL OR COMMERCIAL MATTERS\n(Concluded 15 November 1965)\nThe\nStates signatory to the present Convention,\nDesiring\nto create appropriate means to ensure that judicial and extrajudicial documents\nto be served abroad shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in\nsufficient time,\nDesiring\nto improve the organisation of mutual judicial assistance for that purpose by\nsimplifying and expediting the procedure,\nHave\nresolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the\nfollowing provisions:\nArticle 1\nThe\npresent Convention shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters,\nwhere there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for\nservice abroad.\nThis\nConvention shall not apply where the address of the person to be served with\nthe document is not known.\nCHAPTER I \u2013 JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS\nArticle 2\nEach\n  Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority which will undertake to\nreceive requests for service coming from other Contracting States and to\nproceed in conformity with the provisions of Articles 3 to 6.\nEach\nState shall organise the Central Authority in conformity with its own law.\nArticle 3\nThe\nauthority or judicial officer competent under the law of the State in which the\ndocuments originate shall forward to the Central Authority of the State\naddressed a request conforming to the model annexed to the present Convention,\nwithout any requirement of legalisation or other equivalent formality.\nThe\ndocument to be served or a copy thereof shall be annexed to the request.
