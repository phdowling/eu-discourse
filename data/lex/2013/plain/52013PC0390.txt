The Protocol on the excessive deficit\nprocedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the\nimplementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009[2] lays down detailed rules and\ndefinitions for the application of the provisions\nof the said Protocol.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article\n126(5) TFEU, if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it shall address an opinion to the Member State concerned and the Council accordingly. Having taken into account its report in accordance\nwith Article 126(3) TFEU and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and\nFinancial Committee in accordance with Article 126(4) TFEU, the Commission\nconcluded that an excessive deficit exists in Malta. The Commission therefore\naddressed such an opinion to Malta and informed the Council on 29 May 2013[3].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 126(6) TFEU states\nthat the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether\nan excessive deficit exists. In the case of Malta, this overall assessment\nleads to the following conclusions.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to data notified\nby the Maltese authorities in April 2013, the general government deficit in Malta reached 3.3% of GDP in 2012, thus exceeding the 3%-of-GDP reference value. The\nCommission report under Article 126(3) TFEU considers that the deficit was\nclose to the 3%-of-GDP reference value, but the excess over the reference value\ncould not be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the\nStability and Growth Pact. In particular, it does not result from a severe\neconomic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.\nIn 2010 and 2011, real GDP growth was, on average, above 2% annually, higher\nthan potential growth. Preliminary GDP data published by the national\nstatistics office on 11 March 2013 show that economic growth slowed down in\n2012, but remained positive at 0.8%. The positive output gap in 2011 is\nestimated to have turned slightly negative in 2012. The planned excess over the\nreference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission\n2013 spring forecast, the deficit would increase to 3.7% of GDP in 2013 and\nreach 3.6% of GDP in 2014. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not\nfulfilled.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notified data also show\nthat the general government gross debt stood at 72.1% of GDP in 2012, above the\n60%-of-GDP reference value. The Commission 2013 spring forecast projects the\ndebt ratio to increase to 74.9% of GDP in 2014. Following the abrogation of the\nEDP in December 2012, Malta benefitted from a three-year transition period to\ncomply with the debt reduction benchmark, starting in 2012. In 2012, Malta did not make sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt reduction\nbenchmark, as its structural deficit worsened whereas it was required to\nimprove it. It can therefore be concluded that the debt criterion of the Treaty\nis not fulfilled.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nline with the provisions in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, the\nCommission also analysed in its report \u201crelevant factors\u201d. As specified in the\nStability and Growth Pact, for countries with a debt ratio above 60% of GDP\n(like Malta), these factors can only be taken into account in the steps leading\nto the decision on the existence of an excessive deficit, when assessing\ncompliance on the basis of the deficit criterion, if the general government\ndeficit remains close to the reference value and its excess over the reference\nvalue is temporary, which is not the case for Malta[4].\nAt the same time, such factors have been taken into account when assessing the\nbreach of the debt criterion, but they do not seem to question the decision on\nthe existence of an excessive deficit either. In particular, progress towards\ncompliance with the debt reduction benchmark has been assessed in light of the\ndebt- and deficit-increasing impact of financial assistance to Euro Area Member\nStates. For Malta, the cumulative impact of Greek loan facility, EFSF\ndisbursements, capital contributions to the ESM, and operations under Greek\nprogramme over the period 2011-2014 would be 3.9% of GDP on debt, and 0.1% of\nGDP on deficit. When taking into account the impact of these operations, the\nstructural effort for 2012 required for Malta to comply with the debt criterion\nwould have been lower, but still well above the structural effort actually\nimplemented by Malta in 2012. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nFrom an overall\nassessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Malta.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision is\naddressed to the Republic of Malta.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 6.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 145, 10.6.2009, p. 1-9.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All EDP-related documents for\n  Malta can be found on the following website:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/deficit/countries/malta_en.htm.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 2.4 of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1467/97.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
