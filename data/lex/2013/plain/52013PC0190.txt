This list shall be sent without delay to the national body responsible\nfor supervising fishing, and to the EU.\nThe EU shall\nforward a copy of the provisional list to the vessel owner or to the consignee.\nIf the EU offices are closed, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire may send the provisional list\ndirectly to the vessel owner or their consignee. Vessels shall be authorised to\nfish as soon as they are included on the provisional list. Vessels must keep a\ncopy of the provisional list on board until their fishing authorisation is\nissued.\n5. Issue\nof licences\nLicences for\nall vessels shall be issued to vessel owners or their representatives via the\nDelegation of the European Union to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, within 21 working days\nof receipt of all the documents referred to in point 2 above by the Ministry\nresponsible for fisheries in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nLicences shall\nbe valid for one year and are renewable. They shall be issued for the period\nfrom 1 July to 30 June of the following year. \n6. List\nof vessels authorised to fish \nOnce the\nlicence is issued, the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire shall immediately draw up the\nfinal list of vessels authorised to fish in the Ivorian zone. This list shall\nbe sent immediately to the national body responsible for monitoring fishing and\nto the EU and shall replace the provisional list referred to above.\n7.\nLicence transfer\nLicences shall\nbe issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable. However, at the\nrequest of the EU and where force majeure is proven, e.g. in the event of the\nloss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a serious technical\nfailure, the licence of the initial vessel shall be replaced by a new licence\nfor another vessel of the same fishing category, as referred to in Article 1 of\nthe Protocol, with no further fee due. In this case, the calculation of the\ncatch levels to determine whether an additional payment should be made shall\ntake account of the sum of the total catches of the two vessels.\nThe owner of\nthe first vessel, or his or her representative, shall return the cancelled\nlicence to the Ministry responsible for fisheries in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire via the\nEU Delegation. \nThe new licence\nshall take effect on the day that the vessel\u2019s owner returns the cancelled\nlicence to the Ministry responsible for fisheries in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The EU\nDelegation to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire shall be informed of the licence transfer.\n8.\nKeeping a licence on board\nThe licence\nmust be held on board at all times.

This\nstatement shall be sent simultaneously to the Ministry responsible for\nfisheries in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and to the vessel owners via the Member States.\n6. Where the final statement is greater\nthan the flat-rate fee paid to obtain the fishing authorisation, the vessel\nowner shall pay the outstanding balance to the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire within\n45 days unless he/she contests the payment.\n7. However, if\nthe amount of the final statement is lower than the advance referred to in\npoint 2 of this Section, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable to the\nvessel owner.\nCHAPTER IV\nCatch reporting arrangements\n1. Fishing log\nThe master of an EU vessel fishing under\nthe Agreement shall keep a fishing logbook, for which the model for each\ncategory of fishing is included in Appendix 3 of this Annex. \nThe fishing logbook shall be completed by\nthe master for each day the vessel is present in the Ivorian fishing zone. \nEach day the master shall record in the\nfishing logbook the quantity of each species, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code,\ncaught and kept on board, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where\nnecessary, the number of individual fish. For each main species, the master\nshall also mention the bad catch. Where applicable, the master shall also\nrecord each day in the fishing logbook the quantities of each species thrown\nback into the sea, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary,\nthe number of individual fish.\nThe fishing logbook shall be filled in\nlegibly, in block capitals, and signed by the master. \nThe master shall be responsible for the\naccuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook.\n2.

They shall be forwarded to the European Union as soon as they\nhave been drawn up and every quarter thereafter where they have been updated.\n1.3. The\ncompetent authority shall inform the vessel owners concerned, or their\nrepresentatives, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board\ntheir vessel at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before\nthe observer\u2019s planned embarkation date.\n2. The time\nspent on board by the observer shall be one fishing trip. However, at the\nexpress request of the competent Ivorian authorities, this embarkation may be\nspread over several trips according to the average duration of trip for a\nparticular vessel. This request shall be made by the competent authority when\nthe name of the observer appointed to board the vessel in question is notified.\n3. The\nconditions under which the observer is are taken on board shall be agreed\nbetween the vessel owner or his/her representative and the competent authority.\n4. The\nobservers shall be taken on board at a port chosen by the vessel owner at the\nbeginning of the first voyage in Ivorian waters after notification of the list\nof designated vessels.\n5. Within two\nweeks and giving ten days' notice, the vessel owners concerned shall make known\nat which ports in the subregion and on what dates they intend to take observers\non board. \n6. If the\nobserver is taken on board in a country outside the subregion, his/her travel\ncosts shall be borne by the vessel owner.

Malfunction of the communication\nsystem\nThe Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire shall ensure\nthe compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag\nState and inform the EU immediately of any malfunction as regards the\ncommunication and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a\ntechnical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any\npossible dispute arising. \nThe master shall be considered to be\nresponsible for any proven manipulation of a vessel\u2019s VMS system aimed at\ndisturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringements\nshall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Ivorian legislation in\nforce.\n5. Revision of the frequency of\nposition messages\nOn the basis of documentary evidence\nproving an infringement, the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire may ask the FMC of the\nflag State, copying in the EU, to reduce the interval for sending position\nmessages from a vessel to every thirty minutes for a set period of\ninvestigation. That documentary evidence must be sent immediately by the\nRepublic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to the flag State FMC and the EU. The FMC of the flag\nState shall immediately send the position messages to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire at the new\nfrequency. \nWhen the period of investigation ends, the\nRepublic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire shall immediately inform the FMC of the flag State\nand the EU and subsequently inform them of any follow-up.\nChapter X\nInfringements\n1. Handling of infringements\nAny infringement committed by an EU vessel\nholding a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Annex must be\nmentioned in an inspection report.

Detention of a vessel \u2013\ninformation meeting\nAny EU vessel having committed an\ninfringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel\nis at sea, to return to an Ivorian port.\nThe Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire shall notify\nthe EU within 24 hours of any detention of an EU vessel holding a licence. This\nnotification shall be accompanied by documentary evidence of the infringement. \nBefore taking any measure against the\nvessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed\nat protecting evidence, the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire shall organise, at the\nrequest of the EU, within one working day of notification of the detention of\nthe vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel\nbeing detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A\nrepresentative of the flag State of the vessel may attend this information\nmeeting. \n3.\nPenalties for infringements - compromise procedure\nThe penalty for the infringement shall be\nset by the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire according to the provisions of the\nnational legislation in force.\nWhere settling the infringement involves\nlegal proceedings, before these are launched, and provided that the\ninfringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be\nundertaken between the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the vessel owner or\nhis/her representative in order to determine the terms and level of the\nsanction. A representative of the flag State of the vessel and of the EU may\nparticipate in this compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish\nat the latest three days after the notification of the detention of the vessel.\n4.

Every EU vessel fishing under this\nProtocol must be equipped with a working electronic recording and reporting\nsystem, hereinafter referred to as an ERS system (ERS - Electronic Reporting\nSystem), capable of recording and transmitting the data on the fishing\nactivities, throughout the period the vessel is present in Ivorian waters. An\nEU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS system, or whose ERS system is not\nworking, is not authorised to begin a fishing operation in Ivorian waters.\n2. The flag State and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire shall\nboth ensure that their national fisheries monitoring centres (FMCs) are\nequipped with the necessary IT equipment and software for automatically\ntransmitting the ERS data in the XML format available on http://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm\nand saving the ERS data for at least three years. Any amendment or update of\nthe format must be identified and dated and enter into force after a 6-month\nperiod.\n3. The ERS data shall be transmitted using\nthe electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on\nbehalf of the EU.\n4. The Parties shall ensure that the ERS\ndata are registered sequentially.\n5. The flag Member State and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nshall ensure that their FMCs exchange the relevant names, e-mail addresses and\ntelephone and fax numbers. Any later changes to this data shall be communicated\nwithout delay.\nTransmission of ERS data\n6. All EU vessels fishing under this\nProtocol:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. shall keep an electronic\nlogbook for each day they are in Ivorian waters. Each species shall be\nidentified by its FAO alpha 3 code, in kilograms of live weight or, if\nnecessary, the number of individual fish;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. shall communicate the\nquantities held on board for each of the species identified on the fishing\nauthorisation, on each entry into and departure from Ivorian waters, the\nprovisions of Chapter VII notwithstanding; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c. shall record the catches\nmade in Ivorian waters by species and for each haul, identifying the quantities\ncaught and the discarded catches. For the species identified on the fishing\nauthorisation, the master must also indicate the absence of catches; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 d. shall record by species the\nquantities transhipped or unloaded, notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter\nV;\ne. shall send the ERS data electronically\nto the FMC of its flag State before 23:59 UTC.\n7. The master is responsible for the\naccuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent. \n8. The flag State shall ensure that its FMC\nsends the ERS data to the Ivorian FMC immediately in accordance with the procedures\nand format indicated in paragraph 2. \n9. The Ivorian FMC:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. shall process all the ERS\ndata in a confidential manner;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. shall send the ERS data to\nthe FMC of the vessel's flag State within 48 hours of each transhipment and/or\nunloading operation. \nTechnical failure\n10. The flag State of an EU vessel shall ensure that the master, the\nowner, or his representative, is informed immediately of any technical failure\nof the ERS system installed on his vessel.\n11. In the event of a technical failure of\nthe ERS system, the master or the owner shall ensure that the ERS system is\nrepaired or replaced within a period of one month of the breakdown. \n12. Every EU vessel fishing with a\ndefective ERS system shall send the ERS data to the FMC of its flag State before\n23:59 UTC by any other available electronic means of communication.\nNon-receipt of ERS data\n13. The Ivorian FMC shall notify the FMC of the competent flag State and\nthe EU without delay of any interruption in the transmission of ERS data from\nan EU vessel fishing under this Protocol. \n14. Following receipt of this notification, the FMC of the flag State\nshall immediately identify the reasons for which the ERS data could not be sent\nand take the appropriate measures to resolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately inform\nthe Ivorian FMC and the EU of the causes identified and the corresponding\ncorrective measures. \n15. The missing ERS data shall be sent by\nthe FMC of the flag State to the Ivorian FMC without delay.\n16. In the event of the Ivorian FMC not working, the EU shall send C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire the aggregate ERS data of the EU vessels which had been fishing in its\nwaters, on a monthly basis.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on\n24 September 2012. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 48, 22.2.2008.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 118, 6.5.2008.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
