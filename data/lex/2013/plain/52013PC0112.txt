(\"the applicant\"), an exporting producer in\nTaiwan (\"the country concerned\") of certain polyethylene\nterephthalate.\nThe investigation did not find dumping for the transactions of the\napplicant made in the review investigation period.\nTherefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached\nproposal for a Regulation in order to repeal the existing measures for the\napplicant, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion by 17 April 2013 at the latest.\nUpon entry into force of the proposed regulation, the registration\nof imports imposed by Regulation (EU) No 653/2012 should cease without any\nretroactive levying of the anti-dumping duties. \nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on\nprotection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European\nCommunity.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European\nUnion. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the\nfollowing reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic\nRegulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon\nthe Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic\noperators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the\nproposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the following reason:\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0067 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 192/2007\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyethylene\nterephthalate originating, inter alia, in Taiwan following a \"new\nexporter\" review pursuant to Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[4]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEASURES IN FORCE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No\n2604/2000[5]\nthe Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain\npolyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the\nRepublic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand pursuant to Article 5 of the basic\nRegulation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following an expiry review\npursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation\n(EC) No 192/2007[6],\ndecided that the above mentioned measures should be maintained. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By notice, published in\nthe Official Journal of the European Union on 24 February 2012[7], the Commission initiated\nanother expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation of the\nabove measures.

The request was lodged by Lealea Enterprise Co.,\nLtd ('the applicant'), an exporting producer in Taiwan ('the country\nconcerned').\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant claimed that\nit did not export the product concerned to the Union during the period of\ninvestigation, i.e. the period from 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 ('the\noriginal investigation period').\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the applicant\nclaimed that it was not related to any of the exporting producers of the\nproduct concerned which are subject to the above-mentioned anti- dumping\nmeasures.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant further\nclaimed that it had begun exporting the product concerned to the Union after\nthe end of the original investigation period.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INITIATION OF A NEW EXPORTER\nREVIEW\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission examined\nthe prima facie evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it\nsufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article\n11(4) of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and\nafter the Union industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment,\nthe Commission initiated, by Regulation (EU) No 653/2012[8], a review of Regulation (EC) No\n192/2007 with regard to the applicant.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Regulation\n(EU) No 653/2012, the anti-dumping duty of certain polyethylene terephthalate\nimposed by Regulation (EC) No 192/2007 was repealed with regard to imports of\nthe product concerned produced and sold for export to the Union by the\napplicant. Simultaneously, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation,\ncustoms authorities were directed to take appropriate steps to register such\nimports.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nproduct concerned is polyethylene terephthalate ('PET') having a viscosity\nnumber of 78 ml/g or higher, according to ISO (International Organization for\nStandardization) standard 1628-5, originating in Taiwan, currently falling\nwithin CN code 3907 60 20 ('the product concerned').\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PARTIES CONCERNED\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the Union industry, the applicant and the representatives of the\nexporting country of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were\ngiven the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to be heard.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent an\nanti-dumping questionnaire to the applicant and its related companies and\nreceived a reply within the deadline set for that purpose.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought to\nverify all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of the new\nexporter status and dumping and verification visits were carried out at the\npremises of the applicant in Taiwan.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REVIEW INVESTIGATION PERIOD\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review investigation\nperiod of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2012 (\u2018the\nreview investigation period\u2019 or \u2018RIP\u2019).\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF THE\nINVESTIGATION\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'NEW EXPORTER' QUALIFICATION\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthat the company had not exported the product concerned during the original\nperiod of investigation and that it had started to export it to the Union after\nthis period.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While quantities exported\nwere limited, they were nevertheless found sufficient to establish a reliable\ndumping margin. They followed a pattern in terms of shipment size and turnover\nper client which was comparable to the behaviour of the applicant on third\ncountry markets.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the other\nconditions for the recognition of a new exporter status, the company was able\nto demonstrate that it did not have any links, direct or indirect, with any of\nthe Taiwanese exporting producers subject to the anti-dumping measures in force\nwith regard to the product concerned.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it is\nconfirmed that the company should be considered a \u2018new exporter\u2019 in accordance\nwith Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation and thus an individual margin should\nbe determined for it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\nNormal value\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant produces the\nproduct concerned and sells it domestically and on export markets. The\napplicant sells directly to all markets.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative\nwhen the total domestic sales volume was at least 5% of the total export sales\nvolume to the Union. The Commission established that the applicant exported a\nsingle product type to the Union and that the same product type was sold\ndomestically by the applicant in overall representative volumes. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An examination was also\nmade by the Commission as to whether the sales of the product concerned sold\ndomestically in representative quantities could be regarded as having been made\nin the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic\nRegulation. This was done by establishing the proportion of profitable domestic\nsales to independent customers. As it was found that there were sufficient sales\nin the ordinary course of trade, normal value was based on the actual domestic\nprice. \nExport price\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned was\nexported directly to independent customers in the Union. Therefore, the export\nprice was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation,\ni.e. on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable.\nComparison\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The normal value and the\nexport prices were compared on an ex-works basis.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of ensuring\na fair comparison between normal value and export price, due allowance in the\nform of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in\naccordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. Adjustments for\ninsurance, handling, loading and ancillary expenses and credit costs were\ngranted in all cases where they were found to be reasonable, accurate and\nsupported by verified evidence.\nDumping margin\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 2(11)\nof the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on the basis of a\ncomparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices\nof all exports transactions to the Union. As there were a limited number of\nexports to the Union, the individual export prices to the Union were also\ncompared to the weighted average normal value of the months in which each\nexport occurred. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In both cases these\ncomparisons showed the existence of a de minimis dumping for the\napplicant that exported to the Union in the RIP.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AMENDMENT OF MEASURES\nBEING REVIEWED\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndumping margin with regard to the applicant, established for the RIP, was at de\nminimis level. It is therefore proposed that a duty of 0 EUR/tonne which is\nbased on the de minimis dumping margin be imposed and that Regulation\n(EC) No 192/2007 be accordingly amended. \nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REGISTRATION\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above\nfindings, the registration of imports imposed by Regulation (EU) No 653/2012\nshould cease without any retroactive levying of the anti-dumping duties.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE AND DURATION\nOF THE MEASURES\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nparties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on\nthe basis of which it was intended to impose an anti-dumping duty of 0\nEUR/tonne on imports of the product concerned from the applicant and to amend\nRegulation (EC) No 192/2007 accordingly.
