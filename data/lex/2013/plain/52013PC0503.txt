The\r\nRegulation already foresees the possibility for the Council to review the\r\nscope, governance, funding and duration of the Joint Undertaking on the basis\r\nof progress made in the development phase. As it is necessary to continue\r\nresearch and innovation on air traffic management (ATM) beyond 2016, and in\r\nparticular, the coordinated approach in ATM research and innovation in the\r\ncontext of the SES to achieve the performance targets there defined, this\r\nlegislative proposal seeks to extend the duration of the Joint Undertaking\r\nbeyond 2016. The multiannual funding for the new activities highlighted in the\r\nATM Master Plan from 2014 to 2020 under the Union\u2019s new financial framework[3] is part of Horizon 2020[4]. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED MEASURE\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Context\nThe SES legislative\r\nframework consists of four Basic Regulations[5]. The four Regulations\r\nadopted in 2004 (the SES I Package) have been revised and extended in 2009 with\r\nRegulation (EC) n\u00b0 1070/2009[6]\r\naiming at increasing the overall performance of the air traffic management\r\nsystem in Europe (the SES II Package).\nThis framework also includes more than 20\r\nImplementing Rules and Union Specifications (\"technical standards\")\r\nadopted by the European Commission starting from 2005 in view of ensuring\r\ninteroperability of technologies and systems.\nSES focuses on performance through\r\ninstitutional changes and the regulatory framework but also includes a major\r\ntechnological pillar, the SESAR project. \nThe ATM Master Plan is the agreed roadmap\r\nthat links ATM research and innovation activities with deployment scenarios contributing\r\nto the achievement of the SES performance objectives through the modernisation\r\nof ATM technologies and procedures. \nThe coordination and interaction between\r\ndevelopment and deployment is essential for the success of the SESAR project\r\nand for the full implementation of the SES. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current activities\nThe SJU is responsible for coordinating and\r\nmanaging the R&I activities of the SESAR project in accordance with the ATM\r\nMaster Plan. It is also responsible for executing and maintaining the ATM\r\nMaster Plan. The most recent version of the ATM Master Plan, approved in 2012,\r\nidentifies the \"Essential Operational Changes\" that need to be\r\nimplemented in three main steps to lead to the full deployment of the new SESAR\r\nconcept by 2030:\n\u2013                        \r\nStep 1 \u2013 time based operations - concentrates on\r\nunlocking latent capability particularly by improving information sharing to\r\noptimize network effects. \n\u2013                        \r\nStep 2 \u2013 trajectory based operations - develops\r\nthe System Wide Information Management (SWIM) and initial trajectory management\r\nconcepts to increase efficiency. \n\u2013                        \r\nStep 3 \u2013 performance based improvements - will\r\nintroduce a full and integrated trajectory management with new separation modes\r\nto achieve the long term political goal of SES.\nThe agreed and current work programme of\r\nthe SJU covers Step 1 and, considering the maturity level of technology and\r\noperations, a large portion of Step 2 of the ATM Master Plan. In this respect, the SJU progress reports confirm that Step 1 and approximately 70%\r\nto 80% of Step 2 are expected to be delivered by the end of 2016. Moreover,\r\nalthough the current SJU work programme broadly covers the full R&I cycle,\r\nit mainly focusses on pre-industrial developments. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evaluation\r\nof the SJU\nIn December 2011, the Commission stated its\r\nintention to carry out the necessary assessments and consultations in view of\r\nextending the SJU beyond 2016[7].\r\n\nThe following assessments and consultations\r\nhave also examined whether there was a need to more substantially review the\r\nSJU regulation, e.g. to extend its scope of activities and possibly to modify\r\nits governance. \nThe SJU mid-term evaluation[8] revealed that the SJU performed\r\nwell, both in terms of setting up and building its organisation as well as\r\nconducting its designated tasks, i.e. coordinating and managing the\r\nR&D activities in order to achieve SESAR's objectives.\nThe SJU\u2019s sound financial management has\r\nalso been confirmed by the reports on the annual accounts[9]. \nVarious consultations, including a public\r\nconsultation led by the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Mobility and\r\nTransport (DG MOVE), show that support for an extension of the SJU is\r\nunanimous. The consultation process and the annual activity reports of the SJU\r\nalso show that the SJU is on track with its activities and delivering according\r\nto the ATM Master Plan. \nThe current scope of the SJU allows it to\r\ncover all R&D activities in the Union aiming to modernise ATM in Europe. The SJU has carried out activities addressing the whole ATM research and\r\ndevelopment (R&D) lifecycle, including long term ATM research. The\r\nconsultations confirmed that there is no need to change the scope of the SJU,\r\nalthough it may be necessary to slightly adjust the focus of its activities\r\nwithin that scope. In addition, no formal distinction can be made between each\r\nphase of the ATM innovation cycle, as they mutually interact. Hence, there is\r\nno need to change the SJU scope.\nAs far as the SJU membership process and\r\ngovernance are concerned, there is no evidence that changes are necessary.\r\nThese processes are sufficiently open and transparent to accommodate any\r\nadjustments that may be necessary in an extended SJU.\nA stronger focus on delivering deployable\r\nresults has already been taken into account in its current management and will\r\nbe further developed in the next two years.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nnext phase\nThe deployment of the SESAR concept still\r\nrequires coordinated development and validation activities to complete Step 2\r\nand to fully address Step 3 of the ATM Master Plan.\nFurthermore, now that the deployment\r\nprocess is about to be launched, the balance of resources allocated to the\r\ndifferent phases of the R&I cycle could be reviewed to keep innovative\r\nideas flowing in. In particular, more efforts could be put into exploratory research. Large scale\r\ndemonstration activities focused on performance benefits, on conducting\r\nintegrated and coordinated advanced validation and on demonstration activities\r\nshowing readiness for deployment and for operational and/or technological\r\ntransition will now be set up.\nA future programme set from 2014 and\r\noperating for up to 10 years cannot be fixed once at the outset, provisions\r\nwill need to be made to allow\r\npromising results from exploratory research to evolve in applied research,\r\ndevelopment and preparation for deployment thus accommodating an evolution of\r\nthe topics contributing to the SES.\nThe SJU will draw up its multiannual work\r\nprogramme to complete Step 2 and address Step 3 of the ATM Master Plan\r\nfollowing the prescriptions laid out in the Statutes annexed to Regulation (EC)\r\n219/2007 (Article 16) and submit it for approval to its Administrative Board\r\n(Article 5). \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EX ANTE EVALUATION\nAn ex-ante evaluation has been carried out\r\nand is attached to this proposal (document SEC(2013)xxx). It confirms the\r\nusefulness and efficiency of an extension of the SJU under Horizon 2020 to\r\nreach the SES performance objectives.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article\r\n187 TFEU, formerly Article 171 of the Treaty establishing the European\r\nCommunity, which has served as legal basis for Regulation 219/2007.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nIn the light of the above, the Commission\r\nproposes to provide again for a multiannual financial envelope to be imputed\r\ninto the Union budget for the period from 1 January 2014 to\r\n31 December 2020 coinciding with the new multiannual financial framework.\r\nIn accordance with the Commission package of June 2011 \"A Budget for\r\nEurope 2020\" and the current practice the amount should be taken from the\r\nbudget line 'Achieving a resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and\r\nseamless European transport system'. The Commission thus proposes earmarking an\r\namount of up to EUR 600 million[10]\r\n(including EFTA contribution) for the reference period. This amount is indicative\r\nbecause it is subject to the negotiations currently on-going on the\r\nMulti-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 and to negotiations\r\nwith private partners. The SJU activities cover the ATM Master Plan. Taking\r\ninto consideration the level of maturity, the current Programme is focused to deliver\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Time Based Operations and largely Step 2 \u2013 Trajectory Based Operations\r\nof the ATM Master Plan. The activities to be carried out under the 2014-2020\r\nMulti Financial Framework cover the highest maturity level of Step 2, for which\r\nthe technology and operations are expected to be available by 2016, and the\r\nfull scope of Step 3 \u2013 Performance based operations of the ATM Master Plan. The\r\nSJU\u2019s work programme financed under the Union\u2019s 2007-2013 financial perspectives\r\nis proceeding and managed to be completing its activities by 31.12.16, while new\r\nactivities will be phasing in from 2014 onwards. This will allow the current\r\nMembers willing to continue participating in the SESAR project, to maintain the\r\nneeded level of resources for the new work programme starting in 2014 without interrupting\r\ntheir activities. Details are provided in the attached legislative financial\r\nstatement and the ex-ante evaluation. The annual amounts should be authorised\r\nby the Budgetary Authority in accordance with the budgetary procedure.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTENT OF THE PROPOSAL \nIn order to extend the duration of the SJU,\r\nit is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) 219/2007, as follows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 1, paragraph 2 is modified in order to\r\nextend the duration of the SJU until 31 December 2024. As the ATM Master Plan\r\nhas been endorsed by the Council, it is no longer necessary to refer to it.\n(2)                   \r\nArticle 1, paragraph 3 is deleted as the ATM\r\nMaster Plan has been communicated to the European Parliament. \n(3)                   \r\nArticle 1, paragraph 5, 5th indent is\r\nmodified to clearly entitle the SESAR JU to award grants to its Members and\r\nother participants, considering Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation.\n(4)                   \r\nArticle 2a, paragraph 5 is adapted by removing\r\nthe limitation of 8 years on the employment contracts of temporary agents and\r\ncontract agents, which could hinder the continuity of the employment of\r\nexperienced staff for a body having a limited duration. For the same reason,\r\nthe limitation of employment contracts to a fixed period renewable once and for\r\na fixed period only was abandoned. Article 2a (5) already establishes a\r\nlimitation: the period of engagement cannot exceed the duration of the Joint\r\nUndertaking. In any case, the provisions of the Staff Regulations of Officials\r\nof the European Union, the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the\r\nEuropean Union and the related rules for application shall apply.\n(5)                   \r\nArticle 4, paragraph 2, first sentence, the new amount\r\nof the EU contribution of up to EUR 600 million[11] (including EFTA contribution) for\r\nthe 2014-2020 financial framework under Horizon 2020 is included.\n(6)                   \r\nArticle 4, paragraph 3 is adapted in order to\r\nreflect the extension of the Joint Undertaking.\n(7)                   \r\nArticle 4a, paragraph 1 is amended to reflect\r\nthe new Framework Financial Regulation.\n(8)                   \r\nArticle 4a, paragraph 2 is deleted as the provisions\r\nit offered are covered by the general reference to the new Framework Financial\r\nRegulation.\n(9)                   \r\nArticle 7, first sentence is modified to comply\r\nwith Horizon 2020 evaluation rules.\nThe proposal\r\nalso contains three transitional provisions: \n(1)                   \r\nArticle 2 that limits the mandate of the\r\nExecutive Director in place on 1.1.2009 to 31 December 2016 to ensure coherence\r\nwith Article 3 of the amending Regulation No 1361/2008.\n(2)                   \r\nArticle 3 terminates by 31 December 2016 the\r\nmembership of the current members of the Joint Undertaking who do not\r\ncontribute to activities that will be financed by Horizon 2020 under the 2014-2020\r\nfinancial framework. This provision aims to prevent \u201csleeping partners\u201d in the\r\nJoint Undertaking.\n(3)                   \r\nArticle 4 terminates the SJU activities financed\r\nunder the 7th Framework Programme for research by 31st\r\nDecember 2016, except for the project management activities related to the\r\nclosing down.\nThe Annex of the SJU Regulation, which contains\r\nthe Statutes of the SJU, is amended as follows:\n(1)                   \r\nIn Article 5, paragraph 1(m) has been modified\r\nto clearly specify that the SJU may award grants to implement the ATM Master\r\nPlan, considering the Rules for participation laid down in Horizon 2020.\n(2)                   \r\nIn paragraph 2(a), the number of the\r\nAdministrative Board meetings per year has been changed from four to three. The\r\nexperience over the past years has shown that three mandatory meetings per year\r\nare sufficient to deal with the ordinary administration of the SJU and allows\r\nthe Board to fulfil its obligations. Moreover, preparing these meetings, within\r\nthe relatively short interval between them, increases the administrative\r\nburden. Furthermore, additional meetings of the Board can be organised if\r\nneeded.\n(3)                   \r\nArticle 6, paragraph 1, is modified to clarify\r\nthe SJU procedure of awarding grants, considering the Rules for participation\r\nlaid down in Horizon 2020. \u00a0\n(4)                   \r\nIn Article 7, paragraph 2 has been adapted to\r\nchange the term of office of the Executive Director from 3 years into 5 years, renewable\r\nonce. This change avoids that the term of office of the Executive Director\r\ncomes to an end at the end of the duration of the SJU. Such a situation would\r\nbe difficult to manage from the point of view of continuity. Moreover, at that\r\ntime the most of the programme of the SJU would be already close to be\r\nfinalised, which might lead to a lack of attractiveness of such a vacancy for\r\nsuitable candidates. \n(5)                   \r\nArticle 10, paragraphs 2 and 3 are modified to\r\nclarify that the SJU awards grants, considering the Rules for participation\r\nlaid down in Horizon 2020.\u00a0 \n(6)                   \r\nArticle 13, paragraph 2 is modified in\r\naccordance with Article 8(4) of the 2013 Financial Regulation, interest\r\ngenerated by the Union contribution is only due to the Union where provided for\r\nin the delegation agreement.\n(7)                   \r\nArticle 16, paragraph 1, now includes a\r\nreference to the financial framework referred to in Article 4(2). This\r\nmodification aims to distinguish activities of the SJU\u2019s work programme funded\r\nunder the 2007-2013 financial perspectives from those funded under the\r\n2014-2020 financial framework. This differentiation is important for the period\r\n2014-2016 during which activities under the previous work programme and the new\r\none are carried out simultaneously.\n(8)                   \r\nArticle 17 has been modified to take into\r\naccount the standard provision on the protection of the Union financial\r\ninterests and the 2013 Financial Regulation, in particular its Article 60.\nFinally, the Regulation has been adapted to\r\nArticle 291 of the Lisbon Treaty on implementing acts.\n2013/0237 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 on\r\nthe establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European\r\nair traffic management system (SESAR) as regards the extension of the Joint\r\nUndertaking until 2024\r\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 187 and 188\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[12],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[13],\n\u00a0\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Single European Sky\r\nAir Traffic Management Research and Development project (the 'SESAR project') aims to\r\nmodernise the air traffic management ('ATM') in Europe and represents the technological pillar of the Single European Sky. It aims by 2030\r\nto provide the Union with a high performance air traffic control infrastructure\r\nwhich will enable the safe and environmentally friendly development of air\r\ntransport. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The SESAR project\r\ncomprises three interrelated, continuous and evolving collaborative processes:\r\nthe definition of the content and priorities, the development of new\r\ntechnological systems, components and operational procedures of the SESAR\r\nconcept and the deployment plans of the next generation of ATM systems\r\ncontributing to the achievement of the Single European Sky performance targets.\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first phase of the\r\ndefinition process ran from 2004 to 2008 and delivered the first edition of the\r\nEuropean ATM Master plan (the 'ATM\r\nMaster Plan').

The main task of the SJU is to manage research and innovation\r\n(research, development and validation activities) of the SESAR programme by\r\ncombining the funding provided by its public and private sector members. The\r\nSESAR programme, through its definition, development and deployment processes,\r\nwill deliver a new and global interoperable concept of ATM to the benefits of\r\naircraft operators, air navigation service providers, airports, passengers and\r\ncompetitiveness of the European economy.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nSJU has developed performance indicators which are\r\npublished annually and monitored by the Administrative Board, such as:\n\u2022Release(s) achievement \n\u2022Measurement of the actual consumption effort by partners\n\u2022 Status of completion against the ATM Master Plan\n\u2022 General status of independencies between projects\n\u2022 Status of issues and relevance of action plans\n\u2022 Number of SESAR research prototypes or operational\r\nprocedures that have reached the maturity phase\n\u2022 qualitative assessment of the Projects and overall\r\nProgramme through Control Gates\nFurthermore, the indicators of results and impact set out\r\nin the Horizon 2020 - Framework Programme for Research and Innovation specific\r\nobjective of the societal challenges \u201cSmart, Green and Integrated Transport\u201d\r\nare monitored and annually reported by the Administrative Board to the\r\nCommission.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nAllow continuity of the development process during which SJU is\r\nmandated to conclude multiannual contracts and make the necessary budgetary\r\nplanning in accordance with the principles laid down in the framework of the\r\nFinancial Regulation for the EU bodies.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nEU action is clearly justified in the context of the SES policy and\r\nregulations, the general objective being to eliminate internal market barriers\r\nin the skies. Prior to the SES policy, progress towards efficiency, cost\r\neffectiveness, positive environmental impact, etc. in aviation had been slow,\r\nwhich was partly attributed to an unsystematic approach. Consequently, as SES\r\npolicy is as valid now as it was when first set up, the leading role of the EU\r\nwithin the SES policy is as essential today as it was then. \nEqually, Member States or private stakeholders would not be able, by\r\nthemselves to leverage and pool together resources, coordinate and steer at EU\r\nlevel research and development activities towards deployment of the SESAR\r\nconcept, and actively involve stakeholders. Furthermore, the involvement of the\r\nEU will guarantee that the Commission represents the public interest and has\r\nthe institutional responsibility to drive the process of implementing the SES\r\nexercising regulatory and oversight functions. The Commission\u2019s leading role in\r\nbringing the aviation stakeholders to cooperate and rationalise their resources\r\nfor modernising ATM, while preserving their driving role, will allow better use\r\nof EU and private resources. This will also guarantee coherence of the\r\nmodernisation of the European ATM system and fair competition on the ATM\r\nmarket. EU intervention in the development of SESAR technologies and\r\nprocedures will ensure that the EU ATM infrastructure is more strongly driven\r\nby European objectives and network benefits.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nProgress, achievement and lessons learnt are evidenced by the\r\nMid-Term Evaluation of the SJU (2010). In accordance with Article 7 of the\r\nRegulation 219/2007, the Commission evaluated the implementation of the\r\nregulation after three years and concluded that the SJU performed well both in\r\nterms of setting up and building its organisation as well as conducting its\r\ndesignated tasks. More specifically, the evaluation assessed the SJU's\r\neffectiveness as high as the SJU has produced the required outputs and results,\r\ne.g. organising and coordinating activities in accordance with the ATM Master\r\nPlan and the management of funding, the mobilising of funds, the involvement of\r\nstakeholders, the involvement of SMEs, the organising of technical work\r\navoiding fragmentation. Moreover, the SJU\u2019s sound financial management has also\r\nbeen confirmed by the Court of Auditors on the reports on the SJU annual\r\naccounts.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe proposal is coherent with SES policy and legislation, in\r\nparticular with the SJU founding regulation 219/2007 on which the European\r\nParliament and the Council came to an agreement. The proposal aims at extending\r\nSJU beyond 31.12.2016 thereby to ensure the achievement of the SES and the ATM\r\nrelated objectives of Horizon 2020.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 01.01.2014\r\nto 31.12.2024\n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020 for the\r\ncommitment appropriations and from 2014 to 2024 for payment appropriations.\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[24] \nFor 2013 budget\nNOT APPLICABLE\n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the European Union[25] \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\r\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\r\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\r\n\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\r\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\r\n\"Comments\" section.\nFrom 2014 budget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission through:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States:\nX Indirect management by entrusting\r\nbudget implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 international organisations and their agencies (please specify);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\nX\u00a0 bodies referred to in Articles 208 FR;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by private law with\u00a0 a public service mission to\r\nthe extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and identified in the relevant basic act.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nAll EU bodies work under a strict monitoring system involving\r\ninternal audit capability, the Administrative Board, the audit service of the\r\nCommission, mid-term and ex-post evaluations (every three years, the Commission\r\nevaluates the implementation of the regulation and results obtained, a final\r\nevaluation is also planned), the annual report from the Court of Auditors and\r\nthe Budgetary Authority, the SJU annual release, annual working programmes and\r\nannual reports.
