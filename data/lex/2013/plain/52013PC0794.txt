Furthermore, the\r\nRegulation aimed at facilitating enforcement by eliminating the need for\r\nintermediate proceedings (exequatur) to enable recognition and enforcement\r\nin other Member States than the country where the judgment was given. \nThe Regulation introduced an alternative\r\nprocedure, in addition to the procedures existing under the laws of the Member\r\nStates, for cross-border cases concerning claims which do not exceed EUR 2 000.\r\nThe Regulation is applied in the EU (except in Denmark) as of 1 January 2009. The procedure is in principle a\r\nwritten procedure on the basis of standard forms and is governed by strict\r\ndeadlines. Representation by a lawyer is not mandatory and the use of\r\nelectronic means of communication is encouraged. Furthermore, the unsuccessful\r\nparty only has to bear the costs of the proceedings of the successful party to\r\nthe extent that they are proportionate to the claim. The\r\nprocedure is available for use by both consumers and businesses doing\r\ncross-border transactions in the EU as a means of improving access to justice\r\nand enforcement of their rights.\nArticle 28 of the Regulation requires the\r\nCommission to present by 1 January 2014 to the European Parliament, the Council\r\nand the European Economic and Social Committee a detailed report on the\r\noperation of this Regulation, including in particular the EUR 2 000 threshold.\r\nThe report should be accompanied, if appropriate, by proposals for amendments.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Need for a revision of the\r\nEuropean Small Claims Procedure\nAt a time where the\r\nEuropean Union is facing the biggest economic crisis in its history, improving\r\nthe efficiency of justice in the European Union has become an important factor\r\nin supporting the economic activity[2].\r\nOne of the measures promoting the efficiency of justice in the EU is the\r\nrevision of the Regulation establishing a European\r\nSmall Claims Procedure. \nThe Regulation was adopted in recognition\r\nof the fact that the problems of\r\ninefficient litigation of small claims are amplified\r\nwhen claims of low value are made across the borders of the EU Member States.\r\nAdditional problems arise in such situations, such as the unfamiliarity of the\r\nparties with the foreign laws and procedures of the foreign courts, the\r\nincreased need for translation and interpretation, and the need to travel\r\nabroad for oral hearings. With the increase in\r\ncross-border trade in the EU in the recent years and the further increase\r\nexpected in the years to come, the need to provide for efficient redress\r\nmechanisms as a means of supporting the economic activity will become even more\r\nacute.\nBy providing for\r\nstandard forms and free assistance for the parties in filling in the forms, the procedure enables courts to process applications entirely by\r\nmeans of a written procedure, removing the need to travel for oral hearings -\r\nexcept in exceptional circumstances where a judgment cannot be given on the\r\nbasis of written evidence - as well as the need to be represented by a lawyer.\r\nThe Regulation also encourages the courts and tribunals to use distance means\r\nof communication for accepting claim forms and for organising oral hearings.\r\nFinally, the resulting judgment circulates freely among\r\nMember States, without the need for any additional intermediate proceedings\r\nnecessary to enable recognition and enforcement[3]. \nHowever, despite the benefits it could\r\nbring in terms of reducing the costs and time of litigating cross-border\r\nclaims, the procedure is still little known and remains under-used several\r\nyears after the entry into application of the Regulation. The European\r\nParliament affirmed in a 2011 Resolution[4] that more needs to be done in\r\nterms of legal certainty, language barriers and transparency of proceedings. It\r\ncalled on the Commission to\r\ntake steps to ensure that consumers and businesses are made more aware and make\r\nuse of existing legislative instruments, such as the ESCP. Consumer and\r\nbusiness stakeholders have also raised the fact that the Regulation should be\r\nfurther improved to benefit consumers and businesses, in particular SMEs.\r\nMember States have also identified certain shortcomings in the current\r\nRegulation which should be addressed.\nThe problems are\r\narising mainly from the deficiencies in the current rules, such as the limited\r\nscope of application in terms of low threshold as well as cross-border\r\ncoverage, and a procedure that is still too cumbersome, costly and lengthy and which\r\ndoes not reflect the technological progress achieved in the Member States'\r\njustice systems since the adoption of the Regulation. Even where problems are\r\nrelated to the poor implementation of the current rules \u2013 as is the case to a\r\ncertain extent with the problem of the lack of transparency - it must be\r\nacknowledged that the rules of the Regulation are not always clear. In order to\r\naddress the problem of lack of awareness, the European\r\nCommission launched already several actions, for example a series of thematic\r\nseminars in the Member States to\r\ninform SMEs about this procedure, the publication of a practice guide and the\r\ndistribution of teaching modules to train European entrepreneurs on this\r\nsubject.\nThe Commission identified the revision of\r\nthe Regulation in the 2013 EU Citizenship Report[5] as one of the actions to strengthen the\r\nrights of Union citizens, by facilitating\r\nthe settling of disputes regarding purchases made in another Member State. The initiative is also included in the European Consumer Agenda[6] as a means of improving\r\nenforcement of consumer rights. Moreover, the\r\nmodernisation of the Regulation supports the EU's current political priorities\r\nto promote economic recovery and sustainable growth, by advancing more\r\nefficient, simplified court procedures and by making them more accessible to\r\nSMEs.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Need for revision of\r\nArticle 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2006 \nIn the context of the European order for\r\npayment procedure, a statement of opposition entered by the defendant leads to\r\nan automatic continuation of proceedings under ordinary civil procedures. Since\r\nthe European Small Claims Procedure has been put in place however, this\r\nrestriction is no longer justified in respect of claims falling within the\r\nscope of Regulation 861/2007. \nTherefore, it should be clarified in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1896/2006 that where a dispute falls within the scope of the\r\nEuropean Small Claims Procedure, this procedure should also be available to a\r\nparty in a European Order for Payment Procedure who has lodged a statement of\r\nopposition to a European order for payment. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission has carried out several consultations\r\nto gather information about the current application of the Regulation as well\r\nas of the possible elements of its revision. The results gave useful policy\r\nindication of the positions of the stakeholders and the Member States and were\r\ntaken into account throughout the IA process. \nA Eurobarometer survey to assess\r\nawareness, expectations and experiences of the European citizens with regard to\r\nthe application of the Regulation was carried out in November-December 2012[7]. According to the survey, 71%\r\nof consumer claims are currently within the \u20ac2,000 threshold set up by the\r\nRegulation. The average minimum amount for which consumers are willing to\r\nlitigate in another Member State is \u20ac786. 12% of the respondents were aware of the existence of the ESCP,\r\nwith 1% of all respondents declaring that they already used the procedure. 69%\r\nof those who already used the ESCP were satisfied. 97% of all respondents who\r\ntook businesses to court and won within last 2 years (both domestically and\r\ncross-border) had their judgements enforced successfully. The most important\r\nfactors which would encourage citizens to go to court are: the possibility to\r\ncarry out proceedings in writing without appearing in the court (33%), carrying\r\nout the proceedings without instructing a lawyer (26%), carrying out the\r\nproceedings on-line (20%) and using their own language (24%). \nA web-based public consultation was carried\r\nout between 9 March and 10 June 2013. The consultation gathered views on the\r\npossible improvements and further simplification which could further enhance\r\nthe benefits of the ESCP, in particular for the consumers and SMEs. 80\r\nresponses were received from a broad range of stakeholders, such as consumer\r\nand business associations, judges, lawyers and academics. The results[8] of the consultation show that\r\n66% of respondents support an extension of the threshold up to \u20ac10,000, 63% are in favour of using electronic\r\nmeans in the course of the procedure and 71% support the idea of courts being\r\nequipped with videoconferencing or other electronic communication equipment. Only 28% of respondents thought that free of charge assistance is\r\nprovided by the Member States.\nA detailed questionnaire on the\r\noperation and practical application of the Regulation was sent to the Member\r\nStates at the beginning of April 2013 and to the European Judicial Network .\r\nThe questions sought to gather data about the number of cases using the ESCP in\r\nthe Member States, the use of electronic means of communication used in court\r\nproceedings, the existence and modalities of assistance to citizens in completing\r\nthe forms, procedural deadlines, hearing and evidence, costs of proceedings and\r\nthe need for increasing the threshold for eligible small claims. The deadline\r\nfor answers was 15 May 2013. In total, 20 Member States have sent their replies[9]. \nThe European Judicial Network has on\r\nseveral occasions discussed the application of the European Small Claims\r\nProcedure, the measures to be taken to raise awareness of its existence and\r\noperation as well as the possible elements of its revision. At the meeting of 17\r\nMay 2011, some Member States noted that the ESCP was not used in practice to\r\nits full potential and that procedural improvements as well as awareness\r\nraising measures should be taken. A working group was created and mandated to\r\ndraft a Practice Guide on the ESCP for the benefit of legal practitioners. At the\r\nmeeting of 29/30 May 2013, several aspects amenable to review were discussed\r\nsuch as an increase of the threshold, the use of electronic means of\r\ncommunication between courts and parties, the establishment of EU minimum\r\nstandards for the conduct of the procedure such as: the availability of\r\nvideoconferencing to carry out oral hearings and the transparency of court fees\r\ncalculation and payment and the assistance to the users of the procedure,\r\nincluding legal representation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main elements of the\r\nproposed action\nThe main elements of the proposed revision\r\nare:\n\u00b7              \r\nExtension of the scope of the Regulation to cross-border\r\nclaims up to EUR 10,000;\n\u00b7              \r\nExtension of the definition of cross-border\r\ncases; \n\u00b7              \r\nImproving the use of electronic communication,\r\nincluding for service of certain documents; \n\u00b7              \r\nImposing an obligation on courts to use\r\nvideoconferencing, teleconferencing and other means of distance communication\r\nfor the conduct of oral hearings and taking of evidence; \n\u00b7              \r\nProviding a maximum limitation on court fees\r\ncharged for the procedure;\n\u00b7              \r\nProviding for an obligation on the Member States\r\nto put in place distance means of payment of court fees;\n\u00b7              \r\nLimiting the requirement to translate Form D,\r\ncontaining the Certificate of enforcement, to only the substance of the\r\njudgment;\n\u00b7              \r\nImposing information obligations on the Member States in respect of court fees, methods of payment of court fees and the\r\navailability of assistance in filling in the forms. \n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extension of the scope of\r\nthe Regulation to cross-border claims up to EUR 10 000\nThe threshold of EUR 2,000 limits the scope\r\nof the Regulation. While this is less important for consumers, since most of\r\ntheir claims do not exceed EUR 2,000, it severely limits the availability of\r\nthe procedure for SMEs. Only 20% of business claims are below EUR 2 000, while\r\nclaims between EUR 2,000 and EUR 10,000 amount to approximately 30% of all\r\ncross-border business claims.\n45% of companies which experience a cross-border\r\ndispute do not go to court because the costs of proceedings are\r\ndisproportionate to the value of the claims, while 27% do not go to court\r\nbecause proceedings would take too long. By making the European simplified\r\nprocedure available also to cross-border claims with a value between EUR 2,000\r\nand EUR 10,000, the costs and length of litigation in such cases will be considerably\r\nreduced. \nIn recent years, a number of Member States\r\nincreased the scope of their national simplified procedures by raising the\r\nthresholds. This on-going trend testifies to the need to modernise justice\r\nsystems and make them more accessible to citizens by providing simplified,\r\ncost-effective and speedy procedures for more claims of a low value. In this\r\ncontext, the current threshold of EUR 2,000 for the European Small Claims\r\nProcedure must also be raised. \nRaising the current threshold will allow parties\r\nto litigate a substantially bigger number of cases on the basis of the\r\nsimplified European procedure. Due to the increased simplification, the reduction\r\nof costs and length of the proceedings it is to be expected that claims that\r\nwere abandoned and not pursued will be recovered. The main group benefiting\r\nfrom this solution will be SMEs, but consumers will also benefit, since about\r\none fifth of consumer claims exceed EUR 2,000. Both businesses and consumers\r\nwill benefit from the fact that an increased use of the procedure will allow judges,\r\ncourt clerks and lawyers to become more acquainted with the procedure and will conduct\r\nit better and more efficiently.\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extension of the definition\r\nof cross border cases\nThe Regulation currently applies only to\r\ndisputes where at least one of the parties is domiciled or habitually resident\r\nin a Member State other than the Member State of the court or tribunal seized. However,\r\ndisputes involving parties domiciled in the same Member State which have an\r\nimportant cross-border element and could therefore benefit from the European\r\nsimplified procedure are left outside the scope of the Regulation. Examples\r\ninclude cases where:\n\u00b7              \r\nthe place of performance of the contract\r\nis in another Member State, for example a lease contract for a holiday property\r\nsituated in another Member State; or\n\u00b7              \r\nthe place of occurrence of the harmful event is\r\nin another Member State, for example when parties are involved in a car\r\naccident in a border region situated in another Member State; or\n\u00b7              \r\nthe enforcement of the judgment is to\r\ntake place in another Member State, for example when a judgment must be\r\nexecuted on the defendants salary which he receives in another Member State.\nIn particular, where the claimant may choose\r\nunder the provisions of Regulation [(EC) No 44/2001]/[(EU) No 1215/2012]\r\nbetween the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where both him and\r\nthe defendant are domiciled and the jurisdiction of the Member State where for\r\nexample the contract is performed or the harmful event took place, the actual\r\nchoice of the claimant in favour of the courts or tribunals of the Member State\r\nof the common domicile should not have the effect of depriving him of the\r\npossibility to use the European Small Claims Procedure which would otherwise be\r\navailable. \nFurthermore, the current limitation bars\r\napplications under the European Small Claims Procedure lodged before courts of\r\nEU Member States by or against third country residents, while no national\r\nprocedure in Europe is reserved for nationals of the country concerned or for\r\nEU citizens. \nThe amendment would result in making the\r\nEuropean Small Claims Procedure available in all cases with a cross-border\r\nelement, including those involving third countries. This would lead to a\r\nsimplification and reduction of the costs and length of litigating for those\r\ncitizens who could benefit from the European simplified procedure, for example where\r\nexperts need to be heard in the Member State where the contract was performed\r\nor the harmful event took place. Similarly, a judgment given under the European\r\nSmall Claims Procedure would be easier to enforce in another Member State where the procedure which led to the particular judgment is also well-known and\r\ntrusted. \nSince courts have according to Article 4(3)\r\nof the Regulation the power to examine if the grounds for jurisdiction under\r\nthe Regulation are fulfilled, the risk of abuse on the part of claimants is minimal.\r\n\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improving the use of\r\nelectronic means of communication, including for service of documents\nSeveral communications between the parties\r\nand the courts could in principle be carried out by electronic means, which would\r\nsave time and costs with the procedure in cross-border cases, especially where\r\nlong distances are involved. The initial application can already be lodged via\r\nelectronic means where Member States accept this method. However, in those\r\ninstances where documents need to be served on the parties during the procedure[10], the Regulation sets postal\r\nservice with acknowledgement of receipt as the primary method of service. Other\r\nservice methods could be applied only if service by post is not possible. \nNevertheless, electronic service is already\r\nin place in several Member States. The proposal will put postal service and\r\nelectronic service on the same footing, in order to allow these Member States\r\nto make these electronic means available to the parties using the European\r\nSmall Claims Procedure. Simplification, time and cost\r\nsavings would be possible only for litigation in the Member States that decide\r\nto implement electronic service of documents; however it is expected that the\r\nnumber of Member States taking advantage of these technological developments\r\nwill continue to increase. \nFor other, less important communications\r\nbetween the parties and the courts, the proposal will make electronic\r\ncommunication the rule, subject only to the agreement of the parties.\n3.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imposing an obligation on\r\ncourts to use videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other means of distance\r\ncommunication for the conduct of oral hearings and taking of evidence \nThe European Small Claims Procedure is essentially\r\na written procedure. However, in exceptional circumstances, where an oral\r\nhearing or the hearings of an expert or witness are necessary for rendering a\r\njudgment, the court or tribunal may organise an oral hearing. Oral hearings may\r\nbe conducted through videoconferencing or other means of distance communication.\r\nIn practice however, oral hearings are routinely organised and often the\r\nphysical presence of the parties is required, leading to increased travel costs\r\nand delays for the parties. \nThe amendment would first emphasize more\r\nstrongly the exceptional nature of oral hearings in the context of this\r\nsimplified procedure. Second, it would impose an obligation on courts and\r\ntribunals to always make use of distance means of communication such as\r\nvideoconference or teleconference where an oral hearing is held. In order to\r\nsafeguard the rights of the parties, an exception will be made for the party\r\nwho expressly requests to be present in court. \nThis amendment may require Member States to\r\nequip their courts with appropriate communication technology, where such\r\ntechnology is not yet in place. The technological possibilities at the Member\r\nStates' disposal are varied, and include cost efficient Internet facilities.\n3.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Providing a maximum\r\nlimitation on court fees charged for the procedure\nCourt fees are levied up-front when an\r\napplication is lodged. When these court fees are above 10% of the value of the\r\nclaim they are considered to be disproportionate. In such cases, claimants may\r\nbe dissuaded from pursuing their claims. In many Member States, minimum fees\r\nare also put in place to discourage frivolous or abusive litigation. The\r\naverage minimum court fee is \u20ac34.\nThe proposed provision will not harmonise\r\ncourt fees in the Member States. Instead, it would set\r\na maximum cap on court fees for applications under the Regulation, calculated\r\nas a percentage of the value of the claim above which court fees are considered\r\nto be disproportionate to the value of the claim and therefore to impede access\r\nto justice for claimants with small value claims. Setting\r\na maximum limit on court fees for the European Small Claims Procedure would\r\nreduce costs in those Member States where the fees are disproportionate to the\r\nvalue of such claims. This would increase the attractiveness of the procedure\r\nfor claimants. \nFurthermore, the measure allows the Member\r\nStates to maintain a fixed minimum court fee which however should not prohibit\r\naccess to justice for claims of a lower value. The measure is proportionate\r\ngiven the specific nature of cross-border disputes which \u2013 as opposed to\r\ndomestic disputes \u2013 routinely require the claimant to incur additional costs,\r\nsuch as translation costs and, if oral hearings are organised, travel and\r\ninterpretation costs.\n3.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Providing for an obligation\r\non the Member States to put in place on-line means of payment of court fees\nPayment methods concerning court fees differ\r\nacross Member States. Especially when payment in cash or stamps is the only\r\nacceptable means of payment, parties need to incur travel costs or hire a\r\nlawyer in the Member State of the court, which may discourage them from pursuing\r\ntheir claims. Similar problems arise when payment is accepted only by cheques,\r\nwhich are not in general use in many Member States, or only through lawyers.\nThe proposal aims at obliging Member States\r\nto put in place distance means of payment, as a minimum bank transfers and\r\ncredit/debit card on-line payment systems. The overall efficiency of the\r\njudicial system is likely to increase, since parties will experience reduced\r\ntime and cost savings. \n3.1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limiting the requirement to\r\ntranslate the certificate of enforcement in Form D to only the substance of the\r\njudgment\nAt the stage of enforcing a judgment, the\r\nparty seeking enforcement must translate the certificate of enforcement in Form\r\nD by a certified translator into the language(s) of the Member State of enforcement. Only a few Member States accept Form D in other languages than their own.\r\n\nThe obligation to translate Form D imposes\r\nunnecessary costs in that only Section 4.3 of the form (Substance of the\r\njudgment) should need to be translated, as the other fields are already available\r\nin all languages. However, translators often charge for translating the whole\r\nform. For the party wishing to enforce a judgment, the resulting unnecessary\r\ncosts, added to other costs, may act as a disincentive to pursuing a claim or\r\nseeking its enforcement.\nThe amendment will limit the requirement of\r\ntranslation to only the substance of the judgment in point 4.3 of Form D.\n3.1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imposing information\r\nobligations on the Member States in respect of court fees, methods of payment of\r\ncourt fees and the availability of assistance in filling in the forms\nAlthough Member States are currently\r\nrequired to notify the Commission, for the purposes of making the information\r\npublicly available, of competent courts, accepted means\r\nof communication, availability of appeal, accepted languages for enforcement and\r\nenforcement authorities (Article 25), information on court fees and methods of payment of court fees is\r\ncurrently missing. The obligation of cooperation between the Member States in\r\nmaking information on costs available to the public (Article 24) has not\r\nresulted in more transparency on these elements. Furthermore, the obligation of\r\nMember States to provide practical assistance in filling in the forms (Article\r\n11) has in many cases not been implemented. \nImposing an obligation on Member States to\r\ninform the Commission of court fees and methods of payment for the European\r\nSmall Claims Procedure, as well as of the availability of practical assistance\r\nto the parties, and the Commission's obligation to make such information\r\npublicly available would improve transparency and ultimately access to justice.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other technical amendments\nSeveral provisions of Regulation (EC) No\r\n861/2007 can be improved, to take into account the latest developments, such as\r\nthe entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the case law of the Court of\r\nJustice of the European Union.\nFirst, Article 26 and 27 of the Regulation\r\nneed to be brought in line with the new delegation procedure established by\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSecond, Article 18 of the Regulation will\r\nneed to be clarified in order to avoid difficulties in practice similar to\r\nthose raised in a recent request for a preliminary ruling lodged before the\r\nCourt of Justice, in which the Court was called to interpret a similarly\r\nprovision in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2006[11]. The same right to apply for\r\nreview is formulated in a slightly different, but already clearer way, in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 4/2009 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and\r\nenforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance\r\nobligations. There is no reason why these provisions on review, which pursue\r\nexactly the same objective, are formulated differently in the various European\r\nregulations. The proposed revision aims at clarifying the right to apply for a\r\nreview in a manner consistent with Regulation 4/2009. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nRegulation (EC) No 861/2007 was adopted\r\nunder Article 61(c) TEC stipulating that the Council shall adopt measures in\r\nthe field of judicial cooperation in civil matters and Article 67(1) TEC\r\ndefining the legislative procedure to be followed. Following the entry into\r\nforce of the Lisbon Treaty, any revision to Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 will be\r\nbased on Articles 81(2) (a), (c) and (f) TFEU. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe need for EU action has already been\r\nestablished in 2007 when the Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 was adopted. The issue being addressed has transnational\r\naspects, which cannot satisfactorily be dealt with by the Member States\u2019\r\nindividual action. The objective of enhancing the confidence of consumers and\r\nbusinesses, particularly SMEs, in cross-border trade and access to justice in\r\ncross-border disputes cannot be achieved without an amendment of the existing Regulation\r\nto better reflect developments since 2007 and reported short-comings in the\r\napplication of Regulation (EC) No 861/2007. \nNational simplified\r\nprocedures, where they exist, are extremely diverse both\r\nin terms of threshold and the procedural simplification achieved. In the\r\nabsence of uniform EU-wide procedural standards, the additional inherent\r\ncomplexity and cost of pursuing a cross-border claim, resulting from the lack\r\nof familiarity of the parties with a foreign procedural law, the need for\r\ntranslation and interpretation and the need to travel for oral hearings, would amplify the disproportionate costs and\r\nlength of litigation as compared to domestic disputes. Distortions of\r\ncompetition within the internal market due to imbalances with regard to the\r\nfunctioning of the procedural means afforded to claimants/creditors in\r\ndifferent Member States entails the need for EU action that guarantees a\r\nlevel-playing field for creditors and debtors throughout the EU. For example,\r\nin the absence of a revision, the current threshold will continue to leave many\r\nSMEs having a cross-border dispute without access to a simplified and uniform\r\ncourt procedure in all the Member States. Similarly, in the absence of a\r\nEU-wide cap on disproportionate court fees and of a EU-wide possibility to pay\r\ncourt fees via distance means of payment, many creditors would not have access\r\nto courts. \nFurthermore, action at\r\nEU level would produce clear benefits compared to Member States\u2019 action in\r\nterms of effectiveness as the amended Regulation will set up uniform procedural\r\ntools for all cross-border claims within its scope, regardless of where in the\r\nEU the court hearing the case is situated. The revision will improve access to\r\njustice in particular for a large proportion of SME's small claims which are\r\nnow outside the scope of the Regulation, as well as for consumers and SMEs\r\nwhich have cross-border claims outside the current definition of the\r\nRegulation. Furthermore, the revision would make the procedure more efficient\r\nfor all claims within its scope, by making available uniform procedural rules\r\nwhich further simplify and make less costly litigation in cross-border\r\ndisputes. Better access to efficient judicial procedures for more creditors\r\nhaving claims of a small value will un-block the flow of capital, leading to\r\nincreased confidence in cross-border trade and to a better functioning of the\r\ninternal market. \nThe revision will also\r\nfurther simplify the enforcement of judgments, especially for claims above the\r\ncurrent threshold, and create more trust among the courts and enforcement\r\nauthorities who would become familiar with the European Small Claims Procedure.\r\n\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fundamental rights\nAs set out in detail in the Impact\r\nAssessment accompanying this proposal and in accordance with the Union's strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of\r\nthe European Union, all elements of the reform respect the rights set out in\r\nthe European Charter of Fundamental Rights. \nThe right to a fair\r\ntrial (Article 47(2) of the Charter) is guaranteed, since the amendment will\r\nresult in increased access to justice for claims of a small value in all\r\ncross-border cases. Furthermore, procedural safeguards are put in place to\r\nensure that the increased simplification of the procedure achieved by the\r\nproposed amendments does not negatively impact on the rights of the parties. Thus,\r\nelectronic services with an acknowledgement of receipt\r\nwill be used only when parties so agree; an exception to compulsory\r\nvideoconference or teleconference hearing will always be made for the party who\r\nwishes to appear in court; and, for claims above EUR 2,000, courts will not be\r\nable to refuse an oral hearing carried out by distance means of communication if\r\nat least one party requests it.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implications\nThe only implications for the budget of the\r\nEuropean Union resulting from the proposed Regulation consist of the one-off\r\ncosts for the preparation of a report 5 years after the date of application of\r\nthe Regulation. \n2013/0403 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 of\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European\r\nSmall Claims Procedure and Regulation (EC) No 1896/2006 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council of 12 December 2006 creating a European order for payment\r\nprocedure\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n861/2007 of the European Parliament and the Council[13] established the European Small\r\nClaims Procedure. It applies to both to contested and uncontested cross-border\r\ncivil and commercial claims of a value not exceeding EUR 2,000. It also ensured\r\nthat the judgments rendered within this procedure are enforceable without any\r\nintermediate procedure, in particular without the need for a declaration of\r\nenforceability in the Member State of enforcement (abolition of exequatur). The\r\ngeneral aim of the Regulation was to improve access to justice by reducing\r\ncosts and accelerating civil procedure with regard to claims within its scope\r\nfor both consumers and businesses.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\r\n861/2007 instructs the Commission to present by 1 January 2014 to the European\r\nParliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee a\r\ndetailed report reviewing the operation of the European Small Claims Procedure,\r\nincluding the limit of the value of the claim that may be pursued under that procedure.\r\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission's report[14] on the application of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 861/2007 identified the obstacles to the full potential of\r\nthe European Small Claims Procedure to the benefit of consumers and businesses,\r\nin particular Small and Medium Enterprises. The report shows, among others,\r\nthat the low threshold of the current regulation deprives many potential\r\nclaimants having cross-border disputes of the use of a simplified procedure.\r\nFurthermore, several elements of the procedure could be further simplified in\r\norder to reduce costs and time of litigation. The report concludes that these\r\nobstacles could be removed most effectively through an amendment of the\r\nRegulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumers should be able\r\nto use the opportunities given by the single market to the fullest extent, and\r\ntheir confidence should not be limited by the lack of the effective legal\r\nremedies for disputes in which a cross\u2013border element is present. The\r\nimprovements of the European Small Claims Procedure proposed in this Regulation\r\naim at providing the consumers with the means of effective redress, thus\r\ncontribute to the practical enforcement of their rights.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the threshold\r\nup to EUR 10,000 would be particularly beneficial for small and medium\r\nenterprises, which are currently discouraged from considering court action\r\nbecause under national ordinary or simplified procedures the costs of\r\nlitigation are disproportionate to the value of the claim and/or the judicial proceedings\r\nare too lengthy. Raising the threshold would improve access to an effective and\r\ncost efficient judicial remedy for cross-border disputes involving Small and\r\nMedium Enterprises. Increased access to justice would enhance the trust in\r\ncross-border transactions and contribute to the fullest use of the\r\nopportunities offered by the internal market. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Small Claims\r\nProcedure applies to all claims with a cross-border element. This includes\r\ncases where the parties are both domiciled in the same Member State and only the place of performance of the contract, the place where the harmful event\r\ntakes place or the place of enforcement of the judgment is situated in another Member State. In particular, where the claimant may choose under Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n44/2001[15][Regulation\r\n(EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[16]] between the jurisdiction of\r\nthe courts of the Member State where both him and the defendant are domiciled\r\nand the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State where the contract is\r\nperformed or the harmful event took place, the actual choice of the claimant in\r\nfavour of the courts or tribunals of the Member State of the common domicile\r\nshould not have the effect of depriving him of the possibility to use the\r\nEuropean Small Claims Procedure which would otherwise be available.\r\nFurthermore, the European Small Claims Procedure should also be available in\r\ncases lodged before courts of EU Member States by or against third country\r\nresidents.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should apply\r\nonly in cross-border disputes, but nothing should prevent Member States from\r\napplying identical provisions also to purely internal proceedings concerning\r\nclaims of a low value.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Small Claims\r\nProcedure could be further improved by taking advantage of the technological\r\ndevelopments in the field of justice which eliminate geographical distance and\r\nits consequences in terms of high costs and length of proceedings as factors\r\ndiscouraging access to justice. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further reduce the\r\nlength of the procedure, the use of modern communication technology by the\r\nparties and the courts should be further encouraged. Lodging an application under\r\nthe European Small Claims Procedure via electronic means of communication\r\nshould be possible whenever the technology is already in place in the Member\r\nStates. For documents which need to be served on the parties, electronic service\r\nshould be on an equal footing with postal service whenever the technology is in\r\nplace in the Member States. For all other written communications between the\r\nparties and courts or tribunals, electronic means should be preferred to postal\r\nservice. In all cases, the parties should have a choice between electronic\r\nmeans and more traditional means for application, service or communication. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court or tribunal\r\ngiving judgment should serve the judgment on both the claimant and the\r\ndefendant in accordance with the methods provided for in this Regulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Small Claims\r\nProcedure is essentially a written procedure. However, oral hearings may be held\r\nexceptionally where it is not possible to render the judgment on the basis of\r\nthe written evidence provided by the parties. Furthermore, in order to\r\nsafeguard the procedural rights of the parties, an oral hearing should always\r\nbe organised upon the request of at least one of the parties where the value of\r\nthe claim exceeds EUR 2,000. Finally, courts should seek to reach a settlement\r\nbetween the parties and therefore, where the parties declare their willingness\r\nto reach a court settlement, the court should organise an oral hearing for this\r\npurpose. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oral hearings as well as\r\ntaking of evidence by means of hearings of witnesses, experts or parties,\r\nshould be carried out by distance means of communication. This should not\r\naffect the right of a party to the proceedings to appear in court for the oral\r\nhearing. In the context of oral hearings and the taking of evidence, the Member\r\nStates should use modern, distance means of communication enabling persons to\r\nbe heard without the need to travel to the court or tribunal. Where the person\r\nheard is domiciled in a Member State other than the Member State where the court seised is located, oral hearings should be organised in accordance with\r\nthe rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001[17]. Where the party to be heard\r\nis domiciled in the Member State where the court or tribunal with jurisdiction\r\nis located or in a third country, an oral hearing may be held through\r\nvideoconference, teleconference or other appropriate distance communication\r\ntechnology in accordance with national law. A party should always be entitled\r\nto appear in court at an oral hearing if that party so requests. The court or\r\ntribunal should use the simplest and least costly method of taking evidence. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The potential costs of litigation\r\nmay play a role in the claimant's decision to consider court action. Among\r\nother costs, court fees may discourage claimants from taking court action, in\r\nparticular in those Member States where court fees are disproportionate. The court\r\nfees should be proportionate to the value of the claim in order to ensure\r\naccess to justice for cross-border small claims. This Regulation does not aim\r\nat harmonising court fees; instead, it puts in place a maximum limit on court\r\nfees which would make the procedure accessible to a significant proportion of\r\nclaimants, while at the same time allowing Member States wide discretion in\r\nchoosing the method of calculation and the amount of court fees. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The payment of court fees\r\nshould not require the claimant to travel or hire a lawyer for this purpose. As\r\na minimum, bank transfers and credit or debit card on-line payment systems should\r\nbe accepted by all courts and tribunals with jurisdiction in European Small\r\nClaims Procedures.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information about the court\r\nfees and the methods of payment, as well as about the authorities or\r\norganisations competent to give practical assistance in the Member States\r\nshould be made more transparent and easily available on the Internet. The\r\nMember States should provide this information to the Commission, which in turn\r\nshould ensure that it is made publicly available and widely disseminated. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be clarified in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council[18] that where a dispute falls\r\nwithin the scope of the European Small Claims Procedure, this procedure should\r\nalso be available to a party in a European Order for Payment Procedure who has\r\nlodged a statement of opposition to a European order for payment. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To improve the protection\r\nof the defendant, the standard forms contained in Annexes I, II, III and IV to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 861/2007 should contain information about the consequences for\r\nthe defendant if he or she does not object to the claim or does not appear in\r\ncourt, in particular the possibility that a judgment may be given or enforced\r\nagainst the defendant and that liability may be incurred for costs related to\r\nthe court proceedings. The information in the Annexes should reflect the changes\r\nprovided for by this regulation, for example those aimed at facilitating the\r\nuse of distance means of communication between court and tribunals and the\r\nparties.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nrespect of changes to Annexes I, II, III and IV to this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\r\ndelegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission\r\ncarries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at\r\nexpert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts,\r\nshould ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\r\ndocuments to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in\r\nrespect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, [the\r\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland have given notice of their wish to take part in the\r\nadoption and application of this Regulation]/[without prejudice to Article 4 of\r\nthe Protocol, the United Kingdom and Ireland will not participate in the\r\nadoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by it or be subject to its\r\napplication]. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Denmark, in accordance with\r\nArticles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the\r\nTreaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\r\nUnion, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, and is\r\ntherefore neither bound by it nor subject to its application.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulations (EC) No 861/2007\r\nand No 1896/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 861/2007 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 2 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 2\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\r\napply to civil and commercial matters, whatever the nature of the court or\r\ntribunal, where the value of a claim does not exceed EUR 10,000 at the time\r\nwhen the claim form is received by the court or tribunal with jurisdiction,\r\nexcluding all interest, expenses and disbursements.

Action at EU level is necessary to further\r\nimprove and simplify the European procedure and make it available for more\r\ncases, broadening its scope and raising the threshold, for the benefit of\r\nconsumers and SMEs.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\n[\u2026]\nDespite the benefits it could bring in\r\nterms of reducing the costs and time of litigating cross-border claims, the\r\nprocedure is still little known and remains under-used several years after the\r\nentry into application of the Regulation. The European Parliament affirmed in a 2011 Resolution[21]\r\nthat more needs to be done in terms of legal certainty, language barriers and\r\ntransparency of proceedings. It called on the Commission to take steps to ensure that consumers and\r\nbusinesses are made more aware and make use of existing legislative\r\ninstruments, such as the ESCP. Consumer and business stakeholders have also\r\nraised the fact that the Regulation should be further improved to benefit\r\nconsumers and businesses, in particular SMEs. Member States have also\r\nidentified certain shortcomings in the current Regulation which should be\r\naddressed.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\r\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nRegulation (EU) No 1215/2012 (Brussels I recast) aims at harmonising the private\r\ninternational law rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of\r\njudgments in civil and commercial matters. It provides, among others, that\r\n\"a judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised in the other\r\nMember States without any special procedure being required\". Such special\r\nprocedures, which will be abolished as of 10 January 2015 for all civil and\r\ncommercial judgments, are known as \"exequatur\" procedures. \nThe ESCP Regulation is essentially an\r\ninstrument simplifying the procedures for the resolution of disputes of a low\r\nvalue - lodging an application by means of a standard form, conduct of the\r\nprocedure in principle by written means, the hearing of the parties and the\r\ntaking of evidence, the representation of the parties, costs and time limits. \nThe ESCP Regulation also contains rules\r\nabolishing the exequatur procedure for the recognition of judgments given by\r\nthis simplified procedure (Article 20) and in this respect it overlaps with the\r\n  Brussels I recast. However, when it comes to the Certificate of enforcement,\r\nthe ESCP Regulation represents a simplification when compared to the Brussels I recast \u2013 Form D of the ESCP is a simplified version of Annex I of the Brussels I recast. \nAs of 10 January 2015 (date of entry into\r\nforce of the Brussels I recast), the overwhelming majority of the provisions of\r\nthe ESCP Regulation which deal with the procedural simplification, as well as\r\nthose on enforcement in as much as they represent a simplification by\r\ncomparison with Brussels I recast will continue to be a value added of the ESCP.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u00d8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from adoption\r\nof regulation\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) envisaged[22] \n\u00d8 Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[23]\r\n\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\r\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\r\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\r\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\r\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\r\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nA review/report will follow after 5 years.
