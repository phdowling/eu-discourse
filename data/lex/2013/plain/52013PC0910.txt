It\r\nis based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of\r\nstrengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable\r\ngrowth underpinned by financial stability, thereby supporting the achievement\r\nof the Union's objectives for sustainable growth and jobs. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on common\r\nprovisions for monitoring and assessing Draft Budgetary Plans and ensuring the\r\ncorrection of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area sets out\r\nprovisions for enhanced monitoring of budgetary policies in the euro area and\r\nfor ensuring that national budgets are consistent with the economic policy\r\nguidance issued in the context of the SGP and the European Semester. Since\r\npurely budgetary measures might be insufficient to ensure a lasting correction\r\nof the excessive deficit, additional policy measures and structural reforms may\r\nbe required.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 9 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 sets out the modalities for Economic Partnership Programmes,\r\nto be submitted by euro area Member States under an Excessive Deficit\r\nProcedure. Setting out a roadmap of measures to contribute to an effective and\r\ndurable correction of the excessive deficit, the Economic Partnership Programme should detail in particular the main\r\nfiscal-structural reforms, notably those referring to taxation, pension and\r\nhealth systems and budgetary frameworks, which will be instrumental to correct\r\nthe excessive deficit in a lasting manner. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 2 December 2009, the\r\nCouncil adopted a decision according to Article 126(6) of the Treaty, whereby the\r\n  Netherlands is placed in an excessive deficit procedure. The Council adopted\r\na revised recommendation under Article 126(7) on 21 June 2013. In this context,\r\nthe Netherlands was requested to present an Economic Partnership Programme by 1\r\nOctober 2013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 30 September 2013, and\r\nthereby within the time frame established by Article 9(3) and 17(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013, the Netherlands presented to the Commission and to\r\nthe Council an Economic Partnership Programme, setting out in particular fiscal-structural\r\nreforms that aim at ensuring an effective and lasting correction of the\r\nexcessive deficit (CSR 1). The Economic Partnership Programme also includes measures\r\naimed at addressing the wider set of country-specific recommendations addressed\r\nto the Netherlands by the Council on 9 July 2013: a limitation of debts and\r\nrelated financial risks on the house purchasing market; a promotion of turnover\r\nin the house purchasing market, an improvement in the functioning and\r\nallocation of the subsidised rental sector; a promotion of the private rental\r\nsector (CSR 2); the improvement of the financial supervision of the pension\r\nfunds, enabling an improved balance between risks and ambition, also from an\r\nintergenerational perspective; a lowering of the annual accrual rate for\r\noccupational pensions, taking into account the longer accrual period in view of\r\nincreases in the pension age; the improvement of the employability of older\r\nemployees; a revision of the long-term care system (CSR 3); improving labour\r\nforce participation; and promoting labour market transitions (CSR 4). Apart\r\nfrom the additional consolidation measures for 2014 and beyond that have been\r\ntransmitted in the Draft Budgetary Plan of the Netherlands, new measures in the\r\narea of fiscal structural measures listed in the Economic Partnership Programme\r\npertain to a tighter coverage of budgetary rules for subnational layers of\r\ngovernment. Actual\u00a0 measures listed in the Economic Partnership Programme\r\ncovering CSRs 2 to 4 had for a large part already been launched before the\r\nlatest vintage of country specific recommendations were released. \n\u00a0(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fiscal structural\r\nmeasures that the Netherlands plans to implement pertain in particular to the\r\ncodification of fiscal rules, accompanied by a tighter coverage of subnational\r\ngovernments which supports the strengthening of the national fiscal framework.\r\nIn combination with the additional fiscal consolidation measures adopted in the\r\n2014 Draft Budgetary Plan they can be expected to support a sustainable\r\ncorrection of the excessive deficit and the pursuit of the medium-term\r\nobjective of a structural budget balance. \n(7) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to improve\r\nthe functioning of the housing market can be expected to gradually reduce the\r\nsubsidies to debt-financing of house purchases and the default risks the\r\ngovernment is exposed to through the national mortgage guarantee scheme. The\r\nlowering of the transfer tax is costly in terms of foregone fiscal revenue, but\r\nis expected to improve the balance of demand and supply and the allocation of\r\ncapital in the housing market. The most important of these measures were\r\nalready outlined in the National Reform Programme. Overall, they appear to go\r\nin the right direction but need to be followed up and possibly adapted to\r\nensure their adequacy in response to the relevant country specific\r\nrecommendation (CSR 2). \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to improve\r\nthe functioning of pension funds can be expected to reduce fiscal subsidies to\r\nthe system while at the same time supporting the employability of older\r\nworkers. The measures can be expected to improve the efficiency of the\r\nlong-term care system if results materialise as foreseen, thereby contributing\r\nto fiscal sustainability. However, risks remain regarding the details of the\r\nimplementation and their economic and budgetary effects, as well as with\r\nrespect to the impact on actual pension contributions. As the measures are\r\nstill work in progress, a further analysis of the impact of the policy plans\r\nand their contribution to addressing the challenge of fiscal sustainability\r\nwill be needed.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to improve\r\nlabour market participation include changes to the transferability of tax\r\ncredits and reforms of a number of allowances and unemployment benefits.\r\nOverall, these measures can also be expected to have a positive impact on the\r\nbudgetary balance. However, the measures are planned to be phased in slowly,\r\nalso as a result of the agreements with social partners governing their\r\nimplementation. The most important of these measures were already outlined in\r\nthe National Reform Programme. A faster implementation would provide for a\r\nbetter functioning of the labour market and support economic growth,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION: \nThe Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme of the Netherlands presented to the Commission and to the Council on\r\n30 September 2013 includes a broadly adequate set of fiscal-structural reforms,\r\nwhich would be supportive of an effective and lasting correction of the excessive\r\ndeficit. Specifically, the Economic Partnership Programme reiterates the\r\ncommitment to reforms as given in the latest National Reform Programme and\r\nprovides some further details on the implementation of some of these measures\r\nsince its submission and on the timelines for follow-up. The timetable\r\nof the measures planned to address the country-specific recommendation on the\r\nlabour market in particular appears to constitute a protraction of major\r\nreforms in this area. Although detailed information on all measures is given,\r\nthe Economic Partnership Programme lacks information regarding the specific\r\nchallenges and risks during their implementation. The Netherlands is\r\ntherefore invited in the upcoming National Reform and Stability Programmes to\r\nprovide additional information on the implementation of planned reforms and to\r\nensure progress towards meeting the country specific recommendations under the\r\nEuropean Semester. The Commission and the Council will monitor the\r\nimplementation of reforms in the context of the European Semester. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 140, 27.5.2013 p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
