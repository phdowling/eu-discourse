The new Financial Regulation and the Commission\u2019s legislative\r\nproposals regarding external actions under the next Multi-Annual Financial\r\nPerspective (2014-2020) contain a number of elements which require that\r\ntechnical adjustments be made to Annex IV to the ACP-EC\r\nPartnership Agreement.\nThese technical adjustments aim at\r\nintroducing innovations proposed regarding the\r\nimplementation of external financial instruments under\r\nthe Budget, worth extending to the ACP-EU Partnership, however without\r\ncompromising the specific objectives it pursues. It is expected that following\r\nthese adjustments, the implementation of the EDF will become simpler and more\r\nefficient.\nIn particular, the proposed amendments\r\ntarget the rules of nationality and origin (Articles 20 and 22 of Annex IV), as\r\nwell as the regime of preferences (Article 26).\nWhile the revision of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement in 2010\r\nresulted in the participation to grant and procurement\r\nprocedures financed both under Budget and the EDF being\r\nwidely open, the Commission is of the view that some progress could still be\r\nmade in line with the evolving political context. Taking into account the EU\r\ncommitments taken in Busan[1],\r\nAccra[2]\r\nand at the OECD-DAC in Paris in 2010, a harmonised simplification has already\r\nbeen suggested regarding the rules of nationality and origin of external\r\nfinancial instruments under the Budget. While maintaining the core of the\r\ncurrent regime of Annex IV, it is suggested to complement this regime with the\r\nharmonised and simplified rules proposed under the Budget.\nAs an example, it is suggested that\r\nentities of ACP countries become eligible to procurement procedures for\r\nprojects in any developing country. In return for the market gain of ACP\r\ncountries, that the entities of all developing countries, with the exception of\r\nG20 members, would also become eligible for procurement under the EDF.\nAs regards the regime of preferences,\r\nprevious modifications have altered the text of Article 26 in such a way\r\nthat undermines the coherence and applicability of the regime. As a result, it\r\nis suggested to make the necessary technical adjustments to reinstate the\r\nintegrity of the Article.\nIn\r\naccordance with Article 100 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, Annex IV may be revised by a decision of the ACP-EU\r\nCouncil of Ministers. In order to make sure that by 1 January 2014 a coherent\r\nset of implementing rules for the Budget and the EDF is in place, it is\r\nsuggested that the ACP-EU Council of Ministers take the decision through an exchange\r\nof letters between the Chair of the ACP Council and the Chair of the Council of\r\nthe European Union.\nThe Commission proposes that the Council of\r\nthe European Union adopts the attached Decision.\n2013/0287 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be taken by the\r\nEuropean Union within the ACP-EU Council of Ministers regarding the revision of\r\nAnnex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 209 (2)
