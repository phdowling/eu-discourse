Form A is issued for\nships other than oil tankers, while Form B is issued for oil tankers. The\namendment concerns the deletion of an information requirement in both documents\nto record incinerator capacity, which has in the past been recorded on both\nforms in litres/hour (l/h). A later document, Resolution MEPC.187(59) in Annex\n2, introduced a different measurement method (capacity in kW or kcal/h.). The\nuse of both measurements was found to cause confusion in recording and\ninspections; moreover while the first was hard to apply, the second was found\nto serve no practical purpose. Accordingly the need to record incinerator\ncapacity is to be deleted from both forms.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 13 in MEPC\n64/23/Add.1. Para 7.32 of the MEPC 64 report (MEPC 64/23) indicates that these\namendments will be adopted at MEPC 65.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Condition Assessment\nScheme (Resolution MEPC.94(46)): amendments arising from the adoption of the\nInternational Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of\nBulk Carriers and Oil Tankers 2011)\nThe Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) sets out\nthe framework for an intensified inspection of older ships. The Enhanced Programme\nof Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or Enhanced Survey\nProgramme (ESP) specifies how to do this intensified inspection. As CAS uses\nESP, so therefore CAS refers to ESP as a tool. The current amendment modifies CAS\nin order to refer to the latest (2011) ESP Code.\nThese changes are set out in Annex 16 in MEPC\n64/23/Add.1. Para 11.13 of the MEPC 64 report (MEPC 64/23) indicates that these\namendments will be adopted at MEPC 65.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International Safety\nManagement (ISM) Code\nThe International Safety Management Code aims\nto ensure safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life, an avoidance\nof damage to the environment, in particular, to the marine environment, and to\nproperty. The amendments to be adopted are the result of one of the many\nsuccessful EU submissions to IMO on this subject, in this case STW 43/10[1]. The changes will affect the\nISM Code itself and were proposed by the 27 Member States and by the European\nCommission to enhance the Code's effectiveness.\nThe changes to the Code comprise the following\nPart A, Section 6 (Resources and Personnel): insertion\nof a specific clarification (new para 6 2 1) that the Company should ensure\nappropriate manning of the ship through established procedures that encompass\nall aspects of maintaining safe and efficient operations on board.\nPart A, Section 12 (Company verification,\nreview and evaluation) insertion of a specific clarification (new para 12.2) in\nterms of company ownership, duties and responsibilities imposed by the Code, so\nthat when a Company delegates certain ISM Code duties it still retains overall\nresponsibility, with a need to verify periodically whether those entities to\nwhich it had delegated certain ISM Code related tasks are acting according to\nthe ISM Code \nFootnotes: Insertion of cross-referencing to\nrelevant guidelines within the Code\nThese changes are set out in Annex 22 in MSC\n91/22/Add.2. Para 11.9 of the MSC 91 report (MSC 91/22) indicates that these\namendments will be adopted at MSC 92.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS\nChapter III and the High Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and 2000 as well as the\nDynamically Supported Craft Code 1978 concerning enclosed space entry and\nrescue drills\nSOLAS Chapter III concerns Life Saving\nAppliances and arrangements. The amendments at stake concern Regulation 19 on\nEmergency training and drills and aim to reduce fatalities linked with enclosed\nspace entry by requiring crew members whose responsibilities include entry\nwithin enclosed spaces and rescue to participate in an enclosed space entry and\nrescue drill at least once every two months. Similar amendments are to be\ninserted in the High Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and 2000 and also in the Code of\nSafety for Dynamically Supported Craft.\nThe amendments concerning the High Speed Craft\nCodes 1994 and 2000 are contained respectively in Annexes 30 and 31 in MSC\n91/22/Add.2. Para 13.7 of the MSC 91 report (MSC 91/22) indicates that these\namendments will be adopted at MSC 92.\nThe amendments concerning the Code of Safety\nfor Dynamically Supported Craft (DSC Code) are set out in submission MSC 92/3/1\non Consequential amendments to the 1979,1989 and 2009 MODU Codes and the DSC\nCode dated 22 February 2013 and introduced by the IMO Secretariat. Annex 4 of\nthis submission contains a draft MSC 92 Resolution to amend the DSC Code. Para. 13.9 of the MSC 91 report (MSC91/22) indicates that this amendment will be adopted at\nMSC 92. Under Resolution A.373(X), the DSC Code may be amended by the Maritime\nSafety Committee as may be necessary. This is an amendment which is made,\nconsequential to similar amendments being made in the other related Codes. \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of the Amendments\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments to\nthe Supplemental Forms A and B of the International Oil Pollution Prevention\nCertificate and to the Condition Assessment Scheme\nThese amendments were approved at the 64th\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting between 1-5\nOctober 2012 and are to be submitted for adoption to the 65th\nsession of that Committee meeting between 13-17 May 2013.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments to\nthe ISM Code, to SOLAS Chapter III, the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 as\nwell as the Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft.\nThe amendments for SOLAS Chapter III, and the\nHigh Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and 2000 were approved at the 91st\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting between 26 \u2013 30 November 2012 and\nare to be submitted for adoption to the 92nd session of that\nCommittee meeting between 12-20 June 2013.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe consequential amendments to the DSC Code were\nnoted at the 91st session of the Maritime Safety Committee meeting\nbetween 26 \u2013 30 November 2012 and have been included in a draft MSC Resolution\nset out in Annex 4 of Submission MSC 92/3/1 by the IMO Secretariat is to be\nsubmitted for adoption to the 92nd session of that Committee meeting\nbetween 12-20 June 2013. \nAcceptance and entry into force. \nOnce approved and adopted by the competent\nIMO Committee, as appropriate, the amendments will be submitted to the\nrespective contracting parties in order for these to express their consent to\nbe bound by the said amendments.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relevant\nEU legislation \n1.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supplemental Forms A and B\nof the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate\nDirective 2009/16/EC[2] on port State Control aims to\nhelp to drastically reduce substandard shipping in the waters under the\njurisdiction of Member States by (a) ensuring compliance with international and\nrelated EU legislation on maritime safety, maritime security, protection of the\nmarine environment and on board living and working conditions; (b) establishing\ncommon criteria for control of ships by port State; (c) implementing a port\nState Control system based on the inspections performed within the EU and the\nParis MOU region. \nThe amendments to these forms will have an\nimpact on the requirements for inspection or more detailed inspections as laid\ndown in Article 13(1) of Directive 2009/16/EC, in particular point a)\ntherefore, according to which:\n\"1. On each initial inspection of a\nship, the competent authority shall ensure that the inspector, as a minimum: \n(a) checks the certificates and documents\nlisted in Annex IV required to be kept on board in accordance with Community\nmaritime legislation and Conventions relating to safety and security;\".\nThis certificate is listed as item 7 within\nAnnex IV of the Directive.\nThe amendments will result in a difference in\nthe requirements provided in such forms which Port State Control Officers are\nobliged to check under Article 13(1) of Directive 2009/16/EC. The procedures\nfor the control of ships referred to in Annex VI of the Directive as \"Annex\n1, 'Port State Control Procedures' to the Paris MOU\" will also need to be\namended as a result.\n1.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Condition Assessment Scheme\n(Resolution MEPC.94(46)): amendments arising from the adoption of the\nInternational Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of\nBulk Carriers and Oil Tankers 2011)\nRegulation (EU) No 530/2012[3] on the accelerated phasing-in\nof double hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers\naims to establish an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of\nthe double-hull or equivalent design requirements of MARPOL 73/78, as defined\nin Article 3 of this Regulation, to single-hull oil tankers, and to ban the\ntransport to or from ports of the Member States of heavy grade oil in single-hull\noil tankers.\nThis Regulation makes mandatory the application\nof the IMO's Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) to single hull oil tankers above\n15 years of age. Article 5 requires such tankers to comply with the CAS, which\nis then defined in Article 6 as the Condition Assessment Scheme adopted by Resolution\nMEPC 94(46) of 27 April 2001 as amended by Resolution MEPC 99(48) of 11 October\n2002 and by Resolution MEPC 112(50) of 4 December 2003. While therefore this\nforthcoming amendment is not cited in the definition of the CAS given in\nArticle 6 of the Regulation, it will have legal effect and the Regulation\nshould be updated in order to take into account new developments at\ninternational level.\n1.6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International Safety\nManagement (ISM) Code\nRegulation (EC) 336/2006[4] on the implementation of the International\nSafety Management Code within the Community and repealing Council Regulation\n(EC) 3051/95 aims to enhance the safety management and safe operation of ships\nas well as the prevention of pollution from ships. It does so by ensuring that\ncompanies operating those ships comply with the ISM Code by means of:\n(a) the establishment, implementation and\nproper maintenance by companies of the shipboard and shore-based safety\nmanagement systems; and\n(b) the control thereof by flag and port State\nadministrations. \nRegulation (EU) 336/2006[5] constituted the basis for the\nsubmission amending the ISM Code and will thus be affected by these amendments.\nThe ISM Code, although set out in Annex I of\nthe Regulation, is also defined in Art. 2(1) as being 'in its up-to-date\nversion'. Art. 5 requires the ships included in the scope of the Regulation\nunder Art. 3(1) to comply with the requirements of Part A of the ISM Code.\nHence the changes to be adopted at MSC 92 will have a direct legal effect on\nthe Regulation.\n1.6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendments to SOLAS Chapter\nIII, the High Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and 2000 and the Dynamically Supported\nCraft Code concerning enclosed space entry and rescue\ndrills\nDirective 2009/45/EC[6] on safety rules and standards\nfor passenger ships, as amended by Directive 2010/65/EC, aims to introduce a uniform level of safety of life and property on new\nand existing passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft, when both\ncategories of ships and craft are engaged on domestic voyages, and to lay down\nprocedures for negotiation at international level with a view to a\nharmonisation of the rules for passenger ships engaged on international\nvoyages. \nArticle 6(4) of the Directive specifically applies\nthe High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 to domestic high speed passenger\ncraft. For those older crafts for which the High Speed Craft Codes do not\napply, the Directive applies the previous Dynamically Supported Craft Code\n(Article 6(4)(a)(iii)). \nThus for both High Speed Craft Codes, the\nintroduction of the new amendments to Chapter 18 (operational requirements) and\nin the case of the Dynamically Supported Craft (DSC) Code the equivalent\namendments in Chapter 17 (operational requirements) will have a direct legal\neffect on EU law.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU Competence\nIn view of the relevant EU legislation above,\nthe Commission considers that the adoption of amendments to: \n(1)         \nSupplemental Forms A and B of the International\nOil Pollution Prevention Certificate;\n(2)         \nCondition Assessment Scheme (Resolution\nMEPC.94(46)): amendments arising from the adoption of the International Code on\nthe Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil\nTankers 2011)\n(3)         \nThe International Safety Management (ISM) Code;\nand\n(4)         \nAmendments to SOLAS Chapter III, the High Speed\nCraft Codes of 1994 and 2000 and the DSC Code concerning enclosed space entry\nand rescue drills \ncome under exclusive EU competence which the Union has acquired pursuant to Article 3 (2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption of the\ninternational instruments at stake may affect common rules or alter their\nscope. In this respect:\n(1)         \nThe amendment of the Supplemental Forms A and B\nof the International Oil Pollution Certificate will have a direct bearing on Directive\n2009/16/EC as it will result in a difference in the requirements in such forms\nwhich Port State Control Officers are obliged to check under Article 13(1) of\nthis Directive;\n(2)         \nThe amendment to the Condition Assessment Scheme\n(Resolution MEPC.94(46)) will preempt and predefine any future update of the\nCAS Scheme, which is applicable under Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation 530/2012,\nto take account of recent developments in Enhanced Survey Programme procedures;\n(3)         \nThe amendments to the International Safety\nManagement Code will directly affect the form of the Code that is implemented\nthrough Regulation (EC) 336/2006; and \n(4)         \nThe amendments to SOLAS Chapter III, to the High\nSpeed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 as well as to the DSC Code will have a direct\neffect on Directive 2009/45/EC. \nConsistent with a well consolidated body of\ncase law, even if the Union is not a member of the IMO, the Member States are\nnot authorised to assume obligations likely to affect EU rules promulgated for\nthe attainment of the objectives of the Treaties, unless they are authorised to\ndo so by means of a Council decision, on a proposal by the Commission. The need\nfor authorisation therefore extends to any such obligations, regardless of the\nsubject-matter of the international instruments concerned.\n1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\nThe Commission therefore proposes a Council\nDecision on the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union for the\nmatters mentioned in para 1.7 above to be adopted at the 65th\nsession of the Marine Environment Protection Committee and the 92nd\nsession of the Maritime Safety Committee respectively.\n2013/0112 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted on behalf of\nthe European Union at the 65th session of the Marine Environment Protection\nCommittee of amendments to forms A and B of the International Oil Pollution\nPrevention Certificates and amendments to the Condition Assessment Scheme and\nat the 92nd session of the Maritime Safety Committee of amendments to the\nInternational Safety Management Code and amendments to SOLAS chapter III and\nthe High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 concerning enclosed space entry and\nrescue drills\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof, in\nconjunction with Article 218(9), \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action by the European\nUnion in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime\nsafety,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now approved by the IMO\nMarine Environment Protection Committee in its 64th session (MEPC\n64, October 2012), the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting for\nits 65th session during 13-17 May 2013 is expected to adopt amendments to\nSupplemental Forms A and B of the International Oil Pollution Prevention\nCertificate and to the Condition Assessment Scheme (Resolution MEPC.94(46)\n(arising from the adoption of the International Code on the Enhanced\nProgramme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers 2011),\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now approved by the IMO Maritime\nSafety Committee meeting for its 91st session, amendments to the\nInternational Safety Management (ISM) Code and amendments to SOLAS Chapter III,\nthe High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 and the Dynamically Supported Craft (DSC)\nCode are expected to be adopted by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee meeting\nfor its 92nd session in June 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once adopted, the\namendments to the above mentioned conventions will be submitted by the IMO\nSecretary-General to the respective contracting parties in order for these to\nexpress their consent to be bound by the said amendments.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the\nSupplemental Forms A and B of the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP)\nCertificate will delete an information requirement on incinerator capacity; the\nIOPP Certificate is covered by item 7 of Annex IV of Directive 2009/16/EC[7] on port State control, as a\nform which Article 13(1) of the Directive obliges Member State's port State control\nofficers to check.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the Condition\nAssessment Scheme (CAS) for single hull oil tankers will modify the CAS to\nrefer to the latest (2011) Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of\nBulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP). Regulation\n(EU) No 530/2012[8]\non the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements\nfor single-hull oil tankers applies the CAS in its Articles 5 and 6. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to the ISM\nCode will introduce specific clarifications to the Code in terms of appropriate\nmanning considerations and responsibility for ISM-related delegated tasks as\nwell as the insertion of relevant footnotes. The ISM Code, although set out in\nAnnex I of Regulation (EC) No 336/2006[9]\non the implementation of the ISM Code and repealing Council Regulation no.\n3051/95, is also defined in Art. 2(1) as being 'in its up-to-date version'.\nArt. 5 requires that ships covered by this Regulation to comply with the\nrequirements of Part A of the ISM Code. Hence the changes to be adopted at MSC\n92 will have a direct legal effect on the Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amendments to SOLAS\nChapter III and more particularly to the High Speed Craft Codes of 1994 and\n2000 as well as to Dynamically Supported Craft Code will introduce within Regulation\n19 of SOLAS, Chapter 18 of the High Speed Craft Codes and Chapter 17 of the DSC\nCode an obligation for rescue training for those crew members with\nresponsibilities for working in enclosed spaces.
