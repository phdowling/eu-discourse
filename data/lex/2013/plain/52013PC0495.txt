In particular, Horizon 2020 encourages public-private\npartnerships in research and innovation to help tackle some of the key\nchallenges Europe faces, including in the public health sector.\nThe proposal for a public-private partnership builds on\nthe Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) established\nunder the 7th Research Framework Programme (\u2018FP7\u2019) by Regulation\n(EC) No 73/2008 of the Council of 20 December 2007. IMI JU is a public-private\npartnership between the European Commission and the biopharmaceutical industry,\nand its objective is to improve the drug development process by supporting more\nefficient research and development cooperation among academia, small and medium enterprises (\u2018SMEs\u2019) and\nthe biopharmaceutical industry, in order to deliver better and safer medicines\nfor patients. \nThis proposal is in line with the\nCommission Communication Public-private partnerships, in Horizon 2020: a\npowerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe '[1].\nReasons for and objectives of the proposed Innovative Medicines Joint\nUndertaking \nA Joint Undertaking in the area of innovative medicines is needed:\n- Because the challenges it will tackle are vital for public health\nin Europe and for its citizens: improving their health and wellbeing by\nproviding new and more effective diagnostics and treatments, while helping\nsafeguard the future international competitiveness of the European\nbiopharmaceutical and life-science industries such as diagnostics, vaccines,\nbiomedical imaging and medical information technologies; \n- Because it will help tackle a series of obstacles to effective\nresearch and innovation in this area: high risks of engaging in expensive and\ncomplex development of diagnostics and treatments, decreasing productivity of\nthe drug and vaccine development processes and the lack of economic incentives\nto develop such interventions; high risks of supporting shared databases and\nnetworks that could speed up treatment development and help achieve lifelong\nhealth and wellbeing for all, particulary important in the context of an ageing\npopulation and the associated increase in chronic and degenerative diseases;\nthe emergence and potential re-emergence of infectious diseases (including the\nincrease in anti-microbial resistance); limited knowledge spill-overs due to a\nlack of open-innovation eco-systems among the various actors from academia,\nSMEs and industry; and the threat posed by zoonoses.\n- Because industry on its own will not invest due to these\nobstacles, and because public support from the Member States acting alone is\ntoo fragmented and cannot achieve the coordinated, long-term, large-scale,\ntransnational, cross-sectorial effort required.\n- Because a JU at EU level can help the life-science industries to\nset a long-term research and innovation strategic agenda in a pan-European\nstructure, create the necessary critical mass, leverage private investment,\nprovide stable funding, facilitate knowledge sharing and reduce risk at lower\ncosts. A JU will help create networks for open innovation, which bring together\nthe main stakeholders along the entire drug development value chain.\n- Because a JU can contribute to the EU's goal in other policy areas\nsuch as the Commission Communication on Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance,\nwhere the current IMI is one of the key implementation measures, the European\ncontribution to the Global One Health Initiative, the European Innovation\nPartnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, the European Partnership for Action\nAgainst Cancer, as well as the European Pact for Mental Health and action\nrelated to the Commission Communication on Alzheimer's disease and other\ndementias.\nTherefore, the new proposal aims to address bottlenecks in areas of\npublic health interest, which are limiting the efficiency, effectiveness and\nquality of the drug development activities needed to bring innovative medicines\nto the market.\nBuilding on past experience\nThe proposed JU builds upon the\nachievements of the previous IMI JU set up under FP7. \nIMI JU has mobilised resources by bringing together\npartners from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, SMEs, patient\norganisations and regulators in focused projects; it has stepped up cooperation\nbetween stakeholders in the health research and innovation field by opening\naccess to other partners\u2019 expertise and it has increase the collaboration\nbetween the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders in Europe. It has\nalso fostered the development of comprehensive research agendas, and horizontal\npolicy coordination. \nThe interim evaluation of the IMI Joint Undertaking has\nunderlined that IMI enables mutual learning and has built understanding of\nrationales and approaches among the different stakeholders. This has benefit to\nall parties and has significantly contributed to the transition from a closed\nto an open innovation model in biopharmaceutical research, supported by a fair\nintellectual property regime. No other European programme has enabled\ncross-company collaboration within the pharmaceutical sector on the scale that\nhas been achieved in IMI.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties and use of expertise \nExtensive consultations with stakeholders have been organised,\nincluding Member States, SMEs in the life sciences, medical imaging and\ninformation technology industries conducted through a series of dedicated\nmeetings (Impact Assessment, Annex 1). The impact assessment report also draws\non the results of the current JTI evaluation and the work of a group of\nexperts. A public consultation was held from 11 July to 4 October 2012[2]. In addition, an online\nconsultation for participants of on-going IMI projects was conducted[3].\nImpact assessment\nThe proposed Regulation has been subject to\na Commission impact assessment, which is attached to the proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal consists of a Council\nRegulation on the Innovative Medicines 2 Joint Undertaking. The IMI Joint\nUndertaking was initially established by Regulation (EC) No 73/2008 of the\nCouncil of 20 December 2007, which is to be repealed. \nLegal basis \nThe proposal is based on Article 187 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe Rules for Participation and\nDissemination of Horizon 2020 will apply. However, given specific operational\nneeds of this initiative, derogations from these Rules are necessary.\nNevertheless, these specific derogations are not included in the present\nproposal at this stage, in order not to prejudice the inter-institutional\ndiscussions concerning the appropriate legal basis/procedural modalities for\ntheir adoption, which are still pending in the context of the legislative works\nconcerning the Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\nand of the Council laying down the Rules for Participation and dissemination in\nHorizon 2020 (COM(2011) 0810 - 2011/0399 (COD). The specific derogations will\nbe introduced at a later stage in view of the outcome of the abovementioned\ndiscussions.\nA first derogation will allow to limit the\neligibility for funding to entities such as SMEs, secondary and higher\neducation establishments, non-profit organizations, and companies encountering\ndifficulties to access finance, such as mid-caps or medium-sized companies.\nSecondly, in order to facilitate and speed up the delivery of innovative\nmedicines to patients and to improve the drug research and development in\nEurope, IMI2 Joint Undertaking requires derogations from the intellectual\nproperty rules which concern relevant definitions, ownership, protection,\nexploitation, dissemination, transfer and licensing of results and access\nrights.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThe proposal is designed to maximise EU\nadded value and impact, focusing on objectives and activities that cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by Member States acting alone. The industrial challenge\nof bringing biomedical research and innovation to new products and thereby\nimpacting the health of EU citizens is so large and complex that Member States\nacting alone do not have the necessary framework to set up transnational\ncollaborative platforms for strategic industrial research. \nPublic intervention at EU level is necessary\nas only the EU is able to provide sustained, large-scale public sponsorship\nable to facilitate the kind of cross-border, cross-sector, interdisciplinary\nresearch and innovation consensus-building and implementation required.\nIntervening at EU level by supporting transnational cooperation between firms\non long-term strategic research agendas produces the following added value over\nand above what Member States acting alone can achieve. Joint undertakings are\nthe best set up to achieve the critical mass, in particular by implementation\nof joint agenda setting, mobilising of additional funding and having a larger\nleverage effect on industrial R&D investment.\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the provisions of this regulation do not go beyond what is\nnecessary to achieve its objectives.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Legislative Financial Statement\npresented with this regulation sets out the indicative budgetary implications. The\nUnion contribution shall be up to EUR 1 725 million[4] including EFTA contribution.\nThe envelope is in current prices. The Union contribution shall be made from\nthe \u2018Health, demographic change and wellbeing\u2019 challenge, DG Research &\nInnovation envelope, as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 \u2013 The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum amount of Union\ncontribution for administrative costs shall be EUR 44,85 million. \n2013/0240 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2\nJoint Undertaking\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 187 and the first\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[5],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEconomic and Social Committee[6],\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public-private\npartnerships in the form of Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) were initially provided\nfor in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework programme of the European\nCommunity for research, technological development and demonstration activities\n(2007-2013)[7].\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision No\n2006/971/EC of 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019\nimplementing the Seventh Framework programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[8] identified specific\npublic-private partnerships to be supported, including a public-private\npartnership on Innovative Medicines Joint Technology Initiative between the\nUnion and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations\n(hereinafter \"EFPIA\").\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe 2020 Strategy[9] underscores the need to develop\nfavourable conditions for investment in knowledge and innovation so as to\nachieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Union. Both the European\nParliament and the Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing Horizon\n2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[10] aims to achieve a greater\nimpact on research and innovation by combining Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\nand private sector funds in public-private partnerships in key areas where\nresearch and innovation can contribute to the Union's wider competitiveness\ngoals and help tackle societal challenges. Union involvement in those\npartnerships could take the form of financial contributions to joint\nundertakings established on the basis of Article 187 of the Treaty under\nDecision No 1982/2006/EC.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nDecision (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing the Specific\nProgramme implementing Horizon 2020 (2014-2020)[11] further support should be\nprovided to joint undertakings established under Decision No 1982/2006/EC under\nthe conditions specified in Decision (EU) No [\u2026]/2013.. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Innovative Medicines\nInitiative (hereinafter ''IMI'') Joint Undertaking set up by Regulation (EC) No\n73/2008 of the Council of 20 December 2007 setting up the IMI Joint Undertaking[12] has demonstrated the effective\nmobilisation of resources by bringing together several partners from the\npharmaceutical industry, academia, small and medium-sized enterprises\n(hereinafter ''SMEs''), patient organisations and regulators. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has also stepped up\ncooperation between stakeholders in the health research and innovation field by\nallowing access to other partners\u2019 expertise and increasing the collaboration\nbetween the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders in the Union by developing comprehensive research agendas and horizontal policy coordination. No\nother European or national programme has enabled cross-company collaboration\nwithin the pharmaceutical sector on the scale that has been achieved by IMI.\nThe interim evaluation of the IMI Joint Undertaking[13] underlined that it enables\nmutual learning and provides the opportunity to improve the reciprocal\nunderstanding of the stakeholders, which benefits all parties and has\nsignificantly contributed to the transition towards an open innovation model in\nbiopharmaceutical research.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research related to the\nfuture of medicine shall be undertaken in areas where combination of societal,\npublic health and biomedical industry competitiveness goals requires pooling of\nresources and fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors,\nwith the involvement of SMEs. The scope of the initiative should be expanded to\nall areas of life science research and innovation. The areas would be of public\nhealth interest, as identified by the World Health Organisation report on\npriority medicines for Europe and the World, which is currently being updated\nwith the new version expected to be released in 2013. The initiative should\nconsequently seek to involve a broader range of partners, including mid-caps,\nfrom different sectors (e.g. biomedical imaging, medical information\ntechnology, diagnostic and/or animal health industries). A wider participation\nwould help to advance the development of new approaches and technologies for\nthe prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases with high impact on public\nhealth.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The continuation of this\ninitiative should also take into account the experience acquired from the\noperations of the IMI Joint Undertaking including the results of its interim\nevaluation and stakeholders' recommendations[14]\nand be implemented using a more fit-for-purpose structure and rules in order to\nenhance efficiency and ensure simplification at operational level. To this\neffect, the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (hereinafter ''IMI2'') Joint\nUndertaking should adopt financial rules specific to its needs in accordance\nwith Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European\nParliament and the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable\nto the general budget of the Union[15].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The private Members to the\nIMI2 Joint Undertaking have expressed in writing their agreement to\npursue the research activities in the area of the IMI2 Joint\nUndertaking within a structure better adapted to the nature of a public-private\npartnership. It is appropriate that the private-sector Members to the IMI2\nJoint Undertaking accept the Statutes contained in the Annex by means of a\nletter of endorsement.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a means to further\ndevelop IMI2 Joint Undertaking's objectives, membership should be open to other\nlegal entities. Moreover, legal entities interested in supporting IMI2 Joint\nUndertaking\u2019s objectives in their specific areas of research should be offered\nthe possibility to become Associated Partners in the IMI2 Joint Undertaking.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve its\nobjectives, the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should provide financial support to\nparticipants mainly in the form of grants following open and competitive calls\nfor proposals.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributions from the\nprivate Members should relate to the administrative costs of the IMI2 Joint\nUndertaking and, together with the Associated Partners for their specific area\nof research, to the co-financing required to carry out research and innovation\nactions supported by the IMI2 Joint Undertaking.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\nactions funded by the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should comply with Regulation (EU)\nNo \u2026 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 laying down\nthe rules for the participation and dissemination in \"Horizon 2020 - the\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)\"[16]. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union financial contribution\nshould be managed in accordance with the principle of sound financial\nmanagement and with the relevant rules on indirect management set out in\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Commission delegated Regulation (EU)\nNo 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012[17].\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of Union\nfunds under this Regulation should be carried out in such a manner that the\nadministrative burden is reduced, in compliance with Regulation (EU) No\n[\u2026]/2013 [Horizon 2020 Framework Programme].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\nthe Union and of the other Members of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking\nshould be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure\ncycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities,\nthe recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where\nappropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission's internal\nauditor should exercise the same powers over the IMI2 Joint Undertaking as\nthose exercised in respect of the Commission.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the constituent\ninstrument of bodies, offices or agencies set up by the Union may preclude the\nexamination of the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of those bodies,\noffices or agencies by the Court of Auditors. In accordance with Article 60(5)\nof Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the accounts of the bodies under\nArticle 209 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 are to be examined by an\nindependent audit body which is to give an opinion inter alia on the\nreliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying\ntransactions. Avoidance of duplication of the examination of the accounts\njustifies that the accounts of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should not be subject\nto examination by the Court of Auditors.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nprinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the\nTreaty on European Union, the objectives of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking in\nstrengthening industrial research and innovation across the Union cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of\navoiding duplication, retaining critical mass and ensuring that public\nfinancing is used in an optimal way, be better achieved by the Union. This\nRegulation confines itself to the minimum required in order to achieve those\nobjectives and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMI Joint Undertaking\nwas set up for a period up to 31 December 2017. The IMI2 Joint Undertaking\nshould provide continued support to the Innovative Medicines research programme\nby enlarging the scope of the activities under a modified set of rules. The\ntransition from the IMI Joint Undertaking to the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should\nbe aligned and synchronized with the transition from the Seventh Framework\nprogramme to the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme to ensure optimal use of the\nfunding available for research. In the interest of legal certainty and clarity,\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 73/2008 should therefore be repealed and\ntransitional provisions should be set out.\nHAS\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the implementation of\nthe Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines, a joint undertaking\nwithin the meaning of Article 187 of the Treaty (hereinafter ''IMI2 Joint\nUndertaking''), is established for a period from 1 January 2014 until 31\nDecember 2024.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMI2 Joint Undertaking\nshall replace and succeed the IMI Joint Undertaking as established by\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2008.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMI2 Joint Undertaking\nshall constitute a body entrusted with the implementation of a public-private\npartnership referred to in Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMI2 Joint Undertaking\nshall have legal personality.

The large pharmaceutical industry\nparticipates strongly in IMI (50% of resources, 30% of staff \u2013 total commitment\nto projects by large industry of \u20ac715 million until end 2012), whereas its participation\nin European research programmes outside IMI is very low (0.78% of\nparticipations in FP7 Health, total contribution to all of FP7 about \u20ac80\nmillion, \u00bc of which to FP7 Health).\nIMI has significantly contributed to strengthening the links between\nthe different stakeholders in the health research and innovation field by\nopening access to other partner\u2019s expertise and increasing collaboration\nbetween the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders in Europe.\nIMI also achieves focusing and developing strategic research agendas\nand horizontal policy coordination, the former having a structuring effect on\nEuropean life science research, notably in neuropsychiatric diseases, in\nantimicrobial resistance, and other areas, the latter by coordinating the involvement\nof patient organisations and - in projects addressing regulatory sciences - of\nregulatory agencies, which was considered a rare achievement in the interim\nevaluation.\nThe ongoing Innovative Medicines Initiative has demonstrated that\nbringing together relevant partners can lead to a new model of innovation and\ncan address key bottlenecks in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.\nAreas for improvement concern especially the administrative set-up,\nwhere simplification is required and the opening of the partnership by the\nexpanding the scope to all areas of life science research and innovation and\nconsequently involving a broader range of partners. A particular issue that\nneeds to be addressed is to open the partnership to industrial participants who\nare neither EFPIA companies nor SMEs under the EU definition.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe societal challenge of the ageing population is so large that the\nPPP under Horizon 2020 cannot address it alone. The future IMI will be\ncomplementary to the Ambient Assisted Living Article 185 initiative, which is\nfocused on deploying technology solutions for helping elderly citizens live\nindependently. The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\n(EIP on AHA) under the Innovation Union flagship initiative, aims at increasing\nby two the number of healthy life years of European citizens by 2020 through\nthe coordination of many different activities. Results from IMI2 will support\nthis EIP on AHA. Research actions conducted under IMI2 will be tightly\ncoordinated with research funded from the \u2018Health, demographic change and\nwellbeing challenge\u2019. Finally, this initiative aligns with the proposed EU\nRegulation on Clinical Trials, which addresses current shortcomings in Europe resulting from too different national legislations hampering product development.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from\n01/01/2014 to 31/12/2024 \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 01/01/2014 to\n31/12/2020 for commitment appropriations\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 01/01/2014 to\n31/12/2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[25] \n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission through:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States:\nX Indirect management by\nentrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 international organisations and their agencies (please\nspecify);\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the EIB and the European Investment Bank;\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies referred to in Article 209 FR;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 public law bodies;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission\nto the extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\nin the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and identified in the relevant basic\nact.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nThe IMI Joint Undertaking will be monitored through intermediary\ncontacts and as provided in Articles 6 and 16 of the Statutes.\nA set of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators will be\nestablished to monitor the implementation of IMI2. These performance indicators\nwill measure the impact of the JU on EU competitiveness and on achieving the\nobjectives of advancing health research to bring biomedical innovations to\npatients.\nThe top-level monitoring will fall upon the Governing Board of the\nJU, in which the Commission will be represented according to its share of the\noverall budget. The Executive Management will monitor the operations of the JU\ninternally. \nIn support of the European Research Area objective, the organisation\nof the annual Stakeholder forum will continue, in order to report on the\nprogress of IMI2 operations, to contribute to the exchange of information and\nto help coordinating activities between the JTI, other EU initiatives, and\nnational, regional and private actions.\nQuantitative indicators will be measured in a comparative and\nsystematic manner, and qualitative analyses will be performed annually.\nAn interim evaluation will be carried out by 31.12.2017 and a final\nevaluation within 6 months after the end of IMI2.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internal control framework \nThe Commission (DG RTD) through the Authorising Officer by\nDelegation will ensure that the rules applicable to the IMI JTI JU fully comply\nwith the requirements of Article 60 and 61 of the Financial Regulation.\nMonitoring arrangements, including membership of the Governing Board, of the\nIMI JTI JU and reporting arrangements will ensure that the Commission services\ncan meet the accountability requirements both to the College and to the\nBudgetary Authority.\nThe internal control framework for the IMI JTI JU is built on:\n-the implementation of the Internal Control Standards offering at\nleast equivalent guarantees to those of the Commission;\n-procedures for selecting the best projects through independent\nevaluation, and for translating them into legal instruments;\n- project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every\nproject;\n- ex-ante checks on 100% of claims, including receipt of audit\ncertificates and ex-ante certification of cost methodologies; \n- ex-post audits on a sample of claims as part of the Horizon 2020 ex-post\naudits;\n- and scientific evaluation of project results.\nVarious measures have been established to mitigate the inherent risk\nof conflict of interest within the IMI JTI JU, especially equal votes for the\nCommission and for industrial partners in the Governing Board, selection of the\nDirector by the Governing Board based on a proposal by the Commission,\nindependence of staff, evaluations by independent experts based on published\nselection criteria together with appeal mechanisms and full declarations of any\ninterests. The establishment of ethical and organisational values will be one\nof the key roles of the JTI JU, and will be monitored by the Commission.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\ncontrols \n\u00a0The Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the same powers\nover the Joint Undertaking as those exercised in respect of the Commission.\nMoreover, the Governing Board may arrange, as appropriate, for the\nestablishment of an internal audit capability of the Joint Undertaking.\nThe Executive Director of the IMI JTI JU, as Authorising Officer,\nwill be required to introduce a cost-effective system of internal control and\nmanagement. He/she will be required to report to the Commission on the internal\ncontrol framework adopted.\nThe Commission will monitor the risk of non-compliance through the\nreporting system that it will develop, as well as by following the results of\nex-post audits on the recipients of EU funds from the IMI JTI, as part of\nex-post audits covering the whole of the Horizon 2020. \nThe control system established will need to take account of the\nstrong feeling, amongst the recipients of EU funds as well as amongst the\nlegislative authority, that the control burden required to attain an error\nlimit of 2% has become too great. This runs the risk of lowering the\nattractiveness of the Union's Research programme, and so negatively affecting\nUnion research and innovation.\nThe European Council of February 4th 2011 concluded that \u2018it is\ncrucial that EU instruments aimed at fostering R&D&I be simplified in\norder to facilitate their take-up by the best scientists and the most\ninnovative companies, in particular by agreeing between the relevant\ninstitutions a new balance between trust and control and between risk taking\nand risk avoidance\u2019 (see EUCO 2/1/11 REV1, Brussels 8 March 2011).\nThe European Parliament, in its Resolution of 11 November 2010\n(P7_TA(2010)0401) on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework\nProgrammes explicitly supports a higher risk of errors for research funding and\n\"expresses its concern that the current system and the practice of FP7\nmanagement are excessively control-oriented, thus leading to waste of\nresources, lower participation and less attractive research landscapes; notes\nwith concern that the current management system of \u2018zero risk tolerance\u2019 seems\nto avoid, rather than to manage, risks\". \nThere is therefore an acceptance among stakeholders and Institutions\nthat the whole range of objectives and interests, especially the success of the\nResearch policy, international competitiveness and scientific excellence,\nshould be considered, along with the error rate. At the same time, there is a\nclear need to manage the budget in an efficient and effective manner, and to\nprevent fraud and waste. \nAs stated above, the Commission will monitor the risk of\nnon-compliance through the reporting system that it will establish, as well as\nby following the results of ex-post audits on the recipients of EU funds from\nthe IMI JTI JU, as part of the ex-post audits covering the whole of the Horizon\n2020. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected level of risk of\nnon-compliance\nAs the Commission reported in the Legislative Financial Statement\nfor Horizon 2020, it remains the ultimate objective to achieve a residual error\nrate of less than 2% of total expenditure over the lifetime of the programme,\nand to that end, it has introduced a number of simplification measures.\nHowever, the other objectives set out above as well as the costs of controls\nneed to be considered.\nAs the rules for participation of the IMI JTI JU are similar to\nthose of Horizon 2020, and with a population of beneficiaries with a similar\nrisk profile to those of the Commission, it can be expected that the level of\nerror will be similar to that established by the Commission for Horizon 2020,\ni.e. to give reasonable assurance that the risk of error over the course of the\nmultiannual expenditure period is, on an annual basis, within a range of 2-5 %,\nwith the ultimate aim to achieve a residual level of error as close as possible\nto 2 % at the closure of the multi-annual programmes, once the financial impact\nof all audits, correction and recovery measures have been taken into account.\nSee the Legislative Financial Statement for Horizon 2020 for full\ndetails of the error rate expected with respect to participants.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities \nThe Commission will ensure that procedures to fight against fraud at\nall stages of the management process are applied by the IMI2 JTI JU. The\nproposals for Horizon 2020 have been subject to fraud proofing and an\nassessment of their impact. Overall the measures proposed should have a\npositive impact on the fight against fraud, especially the greater emphasis on\nrisk based audit and reinforced scientific evaluation and control.\nThe Commission will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to\nensure that, when actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the\nfinancial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive\nmeasures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by\neffective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the\namounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and\ndeterrent penalties.\nThe current IMI2 JTI JU already cooperates with the Commission\nservices in matters relating to fraud and irregularity, the Commission will\nensure that this will continue and be strengthened. \nThe accounts of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking shall be examined by an\nindependent audit body as laid down in Article 60(5) of Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012. The accounts of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking shall not be\nsubject to examination by the Court of Auditors. The Court of Auditors may\nconduct audits on those participants that have received funding from the IMI2\nJoint Undertaking.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations,\nincluding on-the-spot checks and inspections, in accordance with the provisions\nand procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations\nconducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Council Regulation\n(Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and\ninspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European\nCommunities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities with a\nview to establishing whether
