Many of these investments have wider public benefits,\nsince they generate greater returns for society as a whole by supporting\nessential services and improving living standards. This proposal intends to\nhelp increase the pool of capital available for long term investment in tomorrow\u2019s\neconomy of the European Union with a view to finance transition to the smart,\nsustainable and inclusive growth. This will be done by creating a new form of\nfund vehicle, EU Long Term Investment Funds or ELTIFs. ELTIFs, by virtue of the\nasset classes that they are allowed to invest in, are expected to be able to\nprovide investors with long term, stable returns. Eligible assets would be\nqualified as forming part of \u2018alternative investments\u2019 \u2013 asset classes that\nfall outside the traditional definition of listed shares and bonds. While\nalternative investments comprise real estate, venture capital, private equity,\nhedge funds, non-listed companies, distressed securities and commodities,\nELTIFs would only focus on alternative investments that fall within a defined\ncategory of long-term asset classes whose successful development requires\ninvestors\u2019 long-term commitment. Therefore, real estate, unlisted companies or\ninfrastructure projects would be eligible while commodities would not be.\nThere is a clear need therefore to ensure that\nbarriers to investment with a long term perspective are tackled at the European\nUnion level. This is particularly the case for assets such as infrastructure\nprojects that depend on long term commitments. These assets depend, in part, on\nwhat is often called 'patient capital'. This kind of investment may not be able\nto be redeemed for a number of years but are invested in such a way as to be\nable to provide stable and predictable returns. Infrastructure projects,\ninvestments in human capital, or operating concessions would fit this description.\nCapital invested in this long term, 'patient' manner benefits the real economy\nby providing predictable and sustained flows of finance to firms and creates\nemployment.\nInvestors such as insurance companies and\npension funds with long term liabilities have expressed an appetite for investing\nin longer-term investment assets. At the same time they have pointed to the\nabsence of readily available pooling mechanisms, such as investment funds, to\nfacilitate access to these types of investments. As a result such investment\nopportunities are restricted to a few very large investors, such as large\npension funds or insurance undertakings, able to raise and commit sufficient\ncapital by virtue of their own resources. This, in turn, acts as a barrier to\nsmaller investors such as local pension plans, municipalities, the pension\nschemes run by the liberal professions or corporate pension plans who might\notherwise benefit from diversifying their investments into such assets. The\nabsence of these investor groups, in turn, deprives the real economy from\naccessing deeper pools of capital-backed financing. Last, but not least, also\nindividual retail investors faced with a future liability (home purchases,\neducation or the financing of major renovations) might benefit from the yield\nor regular returns offered by long-term investment funds.\nThe large-scale and long-term capital\ncommitments required for operating efficient investment pools for long-term\nassets have hitherto been hampered by regulatory fragmentation among Member States.\nWhere funds and incentives do exist on a national level they are not coherent\nwith comparable initiatives in other Member States. This prevents the scale of\npooling of capital and investment expertise that creates economies of scale for\nfunds and therefore benefits investors. On the other hand, the majority of\nMember States have no fund models or equivalent incentives that address long-term\nasset classes. In the absence of a cross-border fund vehicle, investors in\nthese markets are excluded from investing in long-term asset classes.\nThe end result is that there is no readily\navailable mechanism to channel funds that are to be committed for long periods\nof time to real economy projects in need of such financing. This acts as a\nbrake on the development of long term investing. Expertise amongst investment\nprofessionals is not developed because of lack of demand. Economies of scale\nthat lead to a reduction of the costs of operating a long-term investment fund\nfail to materialise.\nIn addition, large-scale infrastructure or\nindustrial engineering projects may require having access to capital pools that\nare not always available when capital is raised in a single Member State only.\nLarge-scale projects also may involve businesses based in a number of different\nMember States. Any funding mechanism has to deal with this problem of\nfragmentation and facilitate investors and projects in a variety of European\nUnion countries.\nThere is, therefore, the need to facilitate\na funding vehicle that is designed specifically to address these problems. To\nmaximise the efficiency of any funding mechanism it needs to be able to have\naccess to investors across the Union. The importance of tackling these issues\nwas set out already in the Single Market Act II (SMA II).[1] One of its twelve key\nobjectives is to boost long-term investment in the real economy. In order to\nachieve this goal, the SMA II proposed developing a new set of EU rules facilitating\ncross-border capital raising of the capital necessary to operate cost-efficient\ninvestment funds that target long term investments opportunities.\nThe wider context of this work has been set\nout in the European Commission's Green Paper, the Long-Term Financing of the\nEuropean Economy,[2]\noutlining supply and demand-side issues across all financing structures. The\nGreen Paper also confirmed the need for measures on investment funds, as\noutlined in this proposal, whilst concentrating on the context of the wider\nneed to revive funding of the real economy by improving the mixture and overall\nresilience of different funding sources. In this the new ELTIF can contribute\nto increasing non-bank finance available to businesses, to complement access to\nbank financing.\nCurrently, EU investment fund markets are\ndominated by funds operating under the UCITS (Undertakings in Collective\nInvestments in Transferable Securities) Directive, first introduced in 1985.\nUCITS assets under management have now reached \u20ac6,697 billion.[3] The UCITS Directive contains a\nset of product rules which are used by investment funds available to retail\ninvestors, but is focused on transferable securities for the purposes of\nensuring adequate liquidity is available to support redemptions on demand. As a\nresult, UCITS are not able to contribute to the funding of patient capital\ncommitments to infrastructure and other projects. While the UCITS initiative\ndoes not necessarily mean the creation of ELTIF will attract similar levels of\ninvestor interest, given the value that highly liquid funds have for many\nretail investors, its success show that EU-wide initiatives can have a strong\nimpact in developing a market and building investor confidence. \nThe creation of the European Venture\nCapital Funds (EuVECA) and the European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEF)\nwill, along the ELTIFs, help to contribute to the financing of the European\neconomy. But the EuVECA and EuSEF schemes target a very specific niche of the\nEU economy: start ups financed by venture capital and businesses specialising\nin achieving social impact. \nThe proposal on ELTIFs follows a broader\napproach than EuVECA and EuSEF. It intends to target a broad range of long-term\nasset classes and it intends to create an investment fund that can also be sold\nto retail investors. This raises the need for three core features: (1) specific\nproduct rules covering eligible assets and their diversification; (2) a high\ndegree of competence for those who are allowed to manage and market ELTIFs and (3)\nalignment between the ELTIFs investment horizon and the redemption expectations\nof its investors.\nThe need for product rules\nThe aim is that the new ELTIF framework is\nto create a 'second retail passport' that follows the tried-and-tested UCITS\napproach on product specifications and risk spreading. There is considerable\ninvestor interest in having an opportunity to invest in long-term asset classes\nthat either appreciate over their life cycle (small or midsized companies) or\nthat produce regular income throughout the holding period (infrastructure\nassets). Especially pension plans run by municipalities, boroughs, small and\nlarge companies or the liberal professions want such a vehicle. Due to the fact\nthat such a long-term asset funds do not exist in many Member States, investors\nin those States are shut out from this investment opportunity. A cross-border\npassport will remedy that situation. \nTo accommodate these investor needs, the\nELTIF will be able to invest in all kind of assets that are not traded on\nregulated markets. These assets are illiquid and, for that reason alone,\nrequire a fund to make a long term commitment when purchasing them. The same is\ntrue for those who invest in such a fund. Assets that are not traded on a\nsecondary market and whose owners would require considerable time in finding a\npurchaser would comprise the following: (1) Investments in infrastructure\nprojects, such as in the field of transport, energy or education; (2)\nInvestments in unlisted companies, in practice mainly SMEs; (3) investments in\nreal estate assets, such as buildings or direct purchase of an infrastructure\nasset \nTherefore, the mere fact that an asset is\nnot traded on a regulated market will qualify it as a long-term asset. These\nassets are illiquid simply on account of the fact that, without a public\ntrading venue, you will not find readily available buyers for your asset. Also,\nthese assets are often quite idiosyncratic and will only be attractive for\nbuyers who can conduct their own due diligence and are specialist in the\nrelevant field. For example, once an ELTIF invest in a project company, it\nanticipates that there will be no immediately identifiable buyer of this stake\nfor a considerable period of time. \nIn light of their intrinsic lack of\nliquidity, the ELTIF proposal refrains from prescribing pre-determined holding\nperiods. In light of the high level of due diligence that an investment in a\nlong-term asset requires, it does not appear prudent policy to prescribe\nminimum holding periods. This is because each investment decision will be\ndifferent and the ELTIF managers are best placed to decide how long they want\nto remain invested in the asset in order to generate the promised return. This\nis a big difference for UCITS managers who follow macroeconomic developments or\nthe daily fluctuations on a stock exchange. \nIt also appears necessary to provide for\nmanagerial flexibility with respect to the precise time frame in which a\nportfolio of long-term assets has to be assembled. This is why the proposal\nallows for a five year period in which the long-term asset portfolio can be\nbuild up. In addition, the proposal allows the manager to invest up to 30% of\nthe ELTIF's capital in liquid securities. This liquidity buffer has been\nconceived to allow the ELTIF to manage the cash flow that arises while the\nlong-term portfolio is being constituted. It also allows the manager to place\nsurplus cash that is achieved 'between investments' \u2013 that is when a long-term\nasset is sold in order to be replaced by another. \nTo create investor trust and legal\ncertainty, especially but not only for retail investors targeted by ELTIFs, the\nproposed scheme requires a set of robust yet flexible product rules. Product\nrules represent the most appropriate way of helping to meet the long term\nfunding needs identified and to provide ELTIFs with a predictable product\nprofile. Once authorised, ELTIFs will be available to be marketed to professional\nas well as retail investors in other Member States.\nELTIF provide opportunities for investors\nto diversify their investment portfolios. The assets the proposed ELTIF may\ninvest in are alternative investments and therefore very different in nature to\nthe more traditional listed shares and securities held by many investors. While\nthe strict diversification rules contained in the UCITS framework might make it\ncostly or even impossible to operate an ELTIF, the latter would still benefit\nfrom a reasonable level of asset diversification.\nThis diversification benefit applies\nequally to retail as well as it does to institutional or 'sophisticated'\ninvestors such as high net worth individuals. The strong product rules proposed\nand the investor protection they create are designed to make ELTIF suitable for\nretail investors.\nThe need for a high level of\nmanagerial competence\nDue to their lack of liquidity and due to\nthe fact that participations in long term asset classes targeted by an ELTIF\nare not listed on a regulated market, all long-term assets that an ELTIF is\nallowed to invest in fall within the category of \u2018alternative investments\u2019 (see\nthe description of alternative investments above). It is therefore necessary that\nELTIFs will be managed by undertakings that are duly authorised under the AIFMD\nto manage and market alternative investments. \nTherefore, the proposed ELTIF framework\nwill build on the managerial authorisation in the AIFM Directive[4], which lays down the general\nrules for alternative investment fund managers who manage and market their\nfunds to professional investors. Specific LTIF product rules will be added so\nthat ELTIFs can be easily identified by both professional and retail investors\nwho are interested in the yield and return profiles associated with investments\nin long-term assets. \nThe proposed ELTIF framework builds on the\ncross-border provisions in the AIFMD, adding to the \"European\"\npassport for marketing professional investors a \"European\" passport\nfor marketing to retail investors across the EU with regard to ELTIFs. As ELTIFs\ncan be sold to retail consumers, there is an increased consumer protection\nneed, for example the stricter ELTIF rules prohibiting investment in assets\nthat may create a conflict of interest, transparency rules requiring the\npublication of a key information document and specific marketing conditions.\nIn light of the above, for an ELTIF to be\nauthorised its manager must also be authorised under the AIFMD. The majority of\nassets an ELTIF invests in must be by definition be assets that need to be held\nfor a long duration. Over-concentration in a single asset or undertaking\ncreates risks for investors that can prove to be very difficult to manage. To\nmitigate this risk an ELTIF will have to comply with diversification rules.\nMoreover, limits are proposed on the use of derivatives in relation to ELTIF\nassets as well as a cap on borrowing.\nThe need to align investment and\nredemption horizons\nThe assets an ELTIF invests in will by\ntheir very nature be illiquid. That is to say, they will not be available to be\nbought and sold very easily. There may be no reliable secondary market for\nlong-term assets, a fact which could render their valuation and sale more\ndifficult. The illiquid nature of the assets is not of itself a problem and the\nELTIF proposal is designed to create a funding vehicle suited to this kind of\nassets. The requirements of the AIFMD also address these issues, for example,\nin relation to valuation and the requirement that managers have appropriate\nvaluation policies and mechanisms in place.\nThe illiquid nature of the assets could\nmake it difficult for funds to meet a redemption requests made by investors\nbefore an asset or project invested in reaches its expected maturity. A need to\nmaintain liquid assets to meet redemption requests would also divert money away\nfrom the primary purpose of ELTIFs - to invest in long-term assets. Further,\noptions to redeem early, i.e., before the end of the fund\u2019s investment\nlifecycle, would raise the need to dispose of assets to meet early redemption\nrequests. There is a danger these assets may have to be sold at 'fire sale'\nprices well below what the fund manager may believe the asset should be worth\nin an un-forced sale. Such a sale could also reduce any income steam being paid\nto other investors who remain invested in the ELTIF. ELTIFs will therefore not\noffer early redemption to investors. This approach will remove the potential\nconflicts of interests between exiting and remaining investors.\nThe ELTIF combined with the AIFMD will\nprovide a strong management and product framework designed to give investors\nthe confidence that their investments are being prudently, competently and\nhonestly managed. The fact that redemptions will not be allowed during the life\nof the investments selected will have to be clearly indicated as to avoid\nmis-placed expectations about the liquidity of the fund. Widening ELTIF to\nretail investors will also ensure that the widest possible capital pool is made\navailable.\nIn addition, the illiquidity premium\nassociated with an investment in a long-term asset can only be reaped if the\nmanager of an ELTIF is at liberty to engage in projects for a significant\nperiod of time without facing constant redemption pressure. As pointed out in\nthe impact assessment, the illiquidity premium inherent in investing in long\nterm assets requires holding periods of between 10 and 20 years. For example,\nthe annualised real estate performance of 12.71% beat the S&P 500 (equity\nindex) at 10.94% and the typical bond index at 7.70% when assessed over a\nperiod of 14 years. Likewise, the favourable performance of venture capital\nfunds in the US - annualised returns of 16.5% vs. the S&P 500 at 11.2% -\ncan only be achieved when choosing an investment horizon of 20 years. \nThe positive returns of an investment in\nlong-term assets should also be assessed against the risks that they carry. As\nwith traditional investments in stocks and bonds, the risk to lose the entire\ncapital is naturally present. But what distinguishes the long-term assets from\ntransferable securities dealt with on a regulated market is their illiquidity\nrisk. Contrary to stocks and bonds which can normally be easily sold on a\nregulated market, long-term assets do not benefit from liquid secondary markets\nand it often requires months or years to be able to sell such an\nasset. This is why the draft proposal requires that the chosen lifecycle\nof an ELTIF has to be sufficiently long to accommodate the diligent choice and\nlong-term engagement with a chosen project, company or real asset.\nIn these circumstances, the future fund\npassport has to be accompanied by a sufficient degree of managerial flexibility\nin choosing assets and determining the timeframe in which they are held prior\nto divestiture. This explains why the approach in the draft proposal does not\nprescribe fixed time periods for holding investment assets or for the duration\nof the ELTIF itself. \nThe new ELTIF should therefore be flexible\nin its investment policies and holding periods. The aim is to attract a\ncritical mass of managers who will offer the vehicle across borders thus\nattracting a critical mass of assets and investors. Therefore, the lifecycle of\nthe fund should match the particular profile of the assets in which it will\ninvest. This has implications on the redemption opportunities that such a fund\ncan realistically offer. Experience with open-ended long-term funds in national\nmarkets shows that a fund cannot offer redemptions while it remains invested in\nlong-term assets targeted by the proposal. Matching the lifecycle of the fund\nwith that of its investment assets is the best possible approach to ensure that\nthe managers have scope to invest in assets that require long-term commitments\nand thereby finance the economy. Offering redemption possibilities at an\nearlier stage invariably dilutes the long-term outlook of the fund; this would\nreduce its attractiveness for most of the pension plan investors who want a\nlong-term and steady income instead of early redemption facilities.\nThis does not, however, imply that\ninvestors cannot redeem their investments prior to the end of the ELTIF's\nlifecycle. Many of the successful long-term funds that the Commission's impact\nassessment found at national level have been structured as listed entities.\nThat allows investors to trade their shares or units in the fund on a secondary\nmarket. If long-term investing is really supposed to become attractive for\nsmaller-scale investors or the retail community at large, secondary markets\nwill be the principal venue in which you can buy into or leave the long term\nfund. \nELTIF will be investment products within\nthe meaning of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)[5] and therefore subject to all\nthe requirements of that directive in relation to marketing, selling and\ndisclosure.\nThe proposed new ELTIF will be available\nfor marketing to investors across the European Union. It is therefore important\nthat investors have the confidence of knowing that the level of protection they\nwill receive will be the same regardless of the origin of the fund manager..\nFor this reason, the legal instrument proposed is a Regulation since this is\nthe most appropriate way of achieving consistent, clear and directly applicable\nrules throughout the Union. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation with\ninterested parties\nSince mid-2012 the European Commission has\nengaged in extensive consultations with representatives from a wide range of\norganisations. The consultations has taken the form of bilateral and\nmultilateral meetings, a written public consultation on asset management issues[6] including long term investment\n(LTI) and a follow up questionnaire which was circulated among interested\nparties. The Commission services received 65 responses relating to the LTI\nsection. The follow up questionnaire resulted in 50 responses. Further\nbilateral discussions were held with fund managers operating in the\ninfrastructure and long term markets, fund management associations and retail\nas well as institutional investor representatives.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nIn line with its policy on 'better\nregulation' the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy\nalternatives. These alternatives contained a wide range of policy options,\nranging from taking no action, integrating long-term asset classes into the\nexisting UCITS framework, to creating a fund vehicle for professional investors\nonly, or a fund vehicle open to all investors, with or without redemption\nfacilities.\nAll of these options were analysed against\nthe general principles of increasing the capital flows available to long term\nfinancing for the European real economy and increasing the coherence of the\nsingle market. However, any new funding mechanism also needs to be framed with\nin such a way that the objective of creating economies of scale for fund\nmanagers and increase choice does not conflict with the need to inform and\nprovide appropriate protection for all investor categories. \nThe selected option is to create a\nlong-term investment fund vehicle open to both professional and retail\ninvestors. In line with the illiquid properties of long-term asset classes,\nthere would be no redemption rights prior to the termination of the fund\u2019s\nlifecycle. The characteristics of the proposed ELTIF would be to allow the\nwidest range of investors to access ELTIFs. In this way, the potential pool of\ncapital available to make such investments would be maximised. The ELTIFs would\nbe subject to product rules designed to ensure sufficient diversification,\naddress potential conflicts of interest, increase transparency as regards costs\nand limit the use of derivatives and leverage. These features are in place to\nprovide investor protection for retail investors. By not providing redemption\nrights during the lifespan of the fund, more of its capital can be invested in\nassets that are illiquid. This absence of a redemption right also signals\nstrongly to retail and professional investors the long term nature of the\ncommitment.\nThe comments by the Impact Assessment Board\nset out in their opinion of 31 May 2013 have been taken into account. The\nproblem description has been strengthened to give greater clarity on the size\nof the problem being addressed as well as the timing of the proposal. The\ndescription of the options has also been improved as has the analysis of the\neffectiveness of the preferred option. The Impact Assessment now also clarifies\nin greater detail the reasons why the proposal deviates from some of the views\nexpressed by certain stakeholders during the consultation process. In\nparticular, the reasoning was strengthened around the choice to exclude\nredemption rights, both from the perspective of investor protection, and from\nthe perspective of the expected take-up of the new option by investors. While\nsome retail investors may be less likely to invest in a fund without rights of\nredemption on demand, the risks attached to offering such rights could\nundermine the fund model, while the reduced efficiency of investments to ensure\nadditional liquidity would reduce the impact of any additional retail demand.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis and choice of\nthe legal form\nArticle 114(1) TFEU serves as the legal\nbasis for a Regulation creating uniform provisions aimed at the functioning of\nthe internal market. Prudential product rules establish the limits of the risks\nlinked to investment funds that are targeting long-term assets. As such, they\ndo not regulate access to asset management activities but govern the way such activities\nare carried out, in order to ensure investor protection and financial\nstability. They underpin the correct functioning of the internal market.\nIn pursuit of the objective of the internal\nmarket integrity the proposed legislative measure will create a regulatory\nframework for ELTIFs, with a view to ensure that such funds are subject to\nconsistent rules across the EU and that they are identifiable as such by\ninvestors throughout the EU. The target of the proposed Regulation is to create\na robust, yet flexible, set of rules that specifically correspond to the\nlong-term nature of the investments in question. The proposed rules should also\nensure a level playing field between different long term investment fund\nmanagers. This legislative proposal, therefore, harmonises the operating\nconditions for all relevant players in the investment fund market, for the\nbenefit of all investors and for the smooth functioning of the single market in\nfinancial services.\nA Regulation is considered to be the most\nappropriate legal instrument to introduce uniform requirements that will deal,\namongst others, with the scope of eligible assets, the portfolio composition,\ndiversification rules, redemption policy, as well as rules regarding the\nauthorisation of the funds intending to engage in long-term investments. The\nobjective of these product rules is to ensure the ELTIFs work in a more\nefficient way. The taking up of activities as manager of an ELTIF is regulated\nby the AIFM Directive. The activities of the managers will continue to be\nsubject to AIFMD, but the long-term investment products are governed by the\nproposed Regulation, in addition to the rules of the AIFM-D.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nNational regulatory approaches are\ninherently limited to the Member State in question. Regulating the product\nprofile of an ELTIF only at national level entails the risk of different\ninvestment products all being sold as long-term investment funds with different\ncharacteristics. This would create investor confusion and would impede the\nemergence of a Union-wide level playing field for those managers who offer\nELTIFs to professional and/or retail investors. \nAs the asset management sector is\nessentially cross-border in nature, the current fragmentation of the ELTIF\nmarket has led this sector to operate below the efficient level. The proposed\nharmonised and sustainable framework covering ELTIF will act as a source of\nlong-term financing for the European economy. The new framework will ensure the\nfinancing of various projects and sectors and will provide stable sources of\nreturn for long-term investors. Therefore, a pan-European ELTIF market is\nneeded and the proposed legislative measure is consistent with the subsidiarity\nprinciple set out in Article 5(3) TEU and the Second Protocol on the\nApplication of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality.\nAs regards proportionality, set out in\nArticle 5(4) TEU, the Proposal strikes the appropriate balance between the\npublic interest at stake and the cost-efficiency of the measure. The proposed\nrules seek to create a common product label for which there is a strong public\ninterest and which would lay down a foundation for a common, competitive and\ncost-efficient market for ELTIF across the Union. The requirements imposed on\nthe different parties concerned have been carefully calibrated. Whenever\npossible, requirements have been crafted as minimum standards (e.g. issuer\ndiversification limits,) and regulatory requirements have been tailored so as\nnot to unnecessarily disrupt existing business models. In particular, the\nproposed Regulation has combined parameters suitable for long-term investments\nand specific investor groups, by taking into full account the safety and trust\nconsiderations relating to any ELTIFs designation. The Proposal therefore does\nnot go beyond what is necessary to achieve a common legal framework for ELTIF,\nwhile at the same time it addresses the regulatory issues which would affect\nthe reliability of the label.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanations of\nthe proposal\nThe proposal for a Regulation on European\nLong-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF) is structured in seven chapters. \n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I \u2013General\nprovisions (Articles 1-6)\nChapter I contains general rules, such as\nthe subject matter and scope of the proposed fund framework, definitions, the\nprocedure for authorisation of ELTIFs (at fund level), and the interplay of the\nproposed Regulation with existing rules governing the authorisation of managers\nof alternative investment funds, as set out in Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD).\nArticle 1 specifies the subject matter and\ndelineates the scope of the Regulation. It makes clear that the requirements\ncontained in the Regulation are exhaustive, thus leaving no scope for\n'gold-plating' at national level. Article 2 contains essential definitions\nnecessary for the uniform application of the proposed Regulation. Article 3\nrequires EU AIFs to be authorised in accordance with the proposed Regulation in\norder to be marketed or managed across the Union as ELTIFs. The designation\n'European Long-term Investment Funds' (ELTIFs) shall be reserved to those EU\nAIFs that comply with the proposed Regulation. This implies that a manager of\nalternative asset classes that wants to manage or market funds focused on\nlong-term assets without using the proposed designation is not obliged to\ncomply with the proposed Regulation.\nArticle 4 provides a harmonised procedure\nfor the authorisation of ELTIFs whereas article 5 lays down the conditions for\nsuch an authorization. Article 6 describes the interaction between the existing\nAIFMD rules and the proposed Regulation, essentially specifying that compliance\nwith the Regulation shall be ensured by the manager of the ELTIF.\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II \u2013 Obligations\nconcerning the investment policies of ELTIFs (Articles 7-15)\nChapter II contains the rules on\npermissible investment policies to be pursued by an ELTIF, such as rules\nrelating to eligible investments, portfolio composition and diversification,\nconflict of interest, concentration and cash borrowing.\nArticle 7 provides that, where applicable,\neach investment compartment of an ELTIF shall be regarded as a separate ELTIF\nfor the purposes of Chapter II.\nArticle 8 describes two categories of\nfinancial assets that an ELTIF can invest in: long-term assets and assets\nlisted in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC (UCITS Directive). However, an\nELTIF shall not engage in short selling of assets, gain exposure to\ncommodities, enter into securities lending or securities borrowing agreements,\nenter into repurchase agreements or use financial derivative instruments unless\nthese instruments are used for hedging purposes.\nArticle 9 elaborates on the eligibility\nconditions for long-term assets, such as the different categories of\ninstruments used to gain access to qualified portfolio undertakings, the\ninvestment in units or shares of other ELTIFs and participations in real\nassets, such as real estate, ships or aircrafts. Article 10 sets out the\nconditions for an undertaking to become a qualified portfolio undertaking. The\nqualified portfolio undertaking should be unlisted, domiciled in the EU and\nhave the purpose of financing infrastructure projects, companies or real\nestate, ships and aircrafts. It should not take the form of a collective\ninvestment undertaking,\nArticle 11 contains a general rule on the\ntreatment of conflicts of interest by the ELTIF manager. The manager may not\nhave any personal interest in a long-term asset in which the ELTIF is invested.\nArticle 12 provides detailed rules on the\nportfolio composition characterising an ELTIF. It also covers the\ndiversification rules that each ELTIF has to respect in the context of eligible\ninvestment assets, such as rules on the maximum risk exposure that an ELTIF can\nhave vis-\u00e0-vis a single counterparty. Article 13 stipulates the maximum limits\nthat an ELTIF can hold in a single issuer (concentration limits). Article 14\nprovides for the conditions under which the ELTIF may borrow cash. Article 15\ncontains provisions on the application of the portfolio composition and the\ndiversification rules, taking into account the different stages in the ELTIF\nfund life.\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III \u2013 Redemption,\ntrading and issue of ELTIF shares or units and distribution of income (Articles\n16-20)\nChapter III deals with the redemption\npolicy of ELTIFs, the possibility of trading units or shares of ELTIF on a\nsecondary market, the issuance of new shares or units, the disposal of ELTIF\nassets and the distribution of income to the investors of an ELTIF.\nArticle 16 precludes an ELTIF from offering\na redemption right to its investors before the end of the life-cycle of the\nELTIF. The life-cycle is defined in the ELTIF rules and corresponds to the\nlife-cycle of the individual assets of the ELTIF and its long-term investment\nobjectives.\nArticle 17 provides for the trading of\nunits or shares of an ELTIF on regulated markets, as well as the free transfer\nof units or shares of an ELTIF to third parties. Article 18 contains the\nconditions for the issuance of new shares or units by the ELTIF, such as the\nprior offering to existing investors when the issuance price is below the NAV\nof the ELTIF. Article 19 deals with the procedure that each ELTIF shall adopt\nfor the disposal of its assets. Article 20 lays down the applicable rules for\nthe distribution of the income generated by the assets of the ELTIF and\nrequires an ELTIF to set out its distribution policy in its fund rules.\n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV \u2013 Transparency\nrequirements (Articles 21-22)\nChapter IV contains transparency rules\nwhere ELTIFs are being advertised to investors.\nArticle 21 requires the prior publication\nof a key information document and a prospectus before the ELTIF is marketed to\nretail investors. The prospectus and any other marketing document shall inform\nthe investors about the special nature of the long-term investment into an\nELTIF. Article 22 requires the ELTIF manager to disclose in a detailed way to\nthe investors all costs attached to the fund.\n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V \u2013 Marketing\n(Articles 23-25) \nChapter V contains the rules applicable to\nan EU AIFM for marketing units or shares of an ELTIF to professional and retail\ninvestors.\nArticle 23 requires managers of ELTIFs to\nhave facilities in place in each Member State where they intend to market their\nELTIFs. Article 24 provides the additional requirements that managers have to\ncomply with in order to market to retail investors. Article 25 builds on the\nnotification procedures contained in the AIFM Directive for authorising the\nmanagers of ELTIFs to market the units or shares of their ELTIFs to investors\nboth in their home and in potential host Member States.\n3.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI \u2013 Supervision\n(Articles 26-29)\nChapter VI sets out the applicable rules on\nsupervision of ELTIFs.\nArticle 26 clarifies the respective roles\nof the competent authorities of the ELTIF and of the manager of the ELTIF.\nArticle 27 states that the powers of the competent authorities under UCITS and\nAIFM Directives should be exercised also with respect to the proposed\nRegulation. Article 28 refers to the power of ESMA, whereas Article 29 provides\nfor the cooperation between supervisory authorities.\n3.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VII \u2013 Final\nProvisions (Articles 30-31)\nChapter VII contains rules on a review of\nthe functioning of the envisaged rules to be prepared by the Commission as well\nas provisions on the entry into force of the proposed Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe budgetary impact of the ELTIF\nregulation is as indicated in the Legislative Financial Statement attached to\nthe proposal.\n2013/0214 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non European Long-term Investment Funds\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \nLong-term finance is a crucial enabling tool for\nputting the European economy on a path of sustainable, smart and inclusive\ngrowth and for building tomorrow's economy in a way that is less prone to\nsystemic risks and is more resilient. European long-term investment funds (ELTIFs)\nprovide finance to various infrastructure projects or unlisted companies of lasting\nduration that issue equity or debt instruments for which there is no readily\nidentifiable buyer. By providing finance to such projects, ELTIFs contribute to\nthe financing of the Union economies. \n(2)              \nOn the demand side, ELTIFs can provide a steady\nincome stream for pension administrators, insurance companies and other\nentities that face regular and recurrent liabilities. While providing less\nliquidiy than investments in transferable securities, ELTIFs can provide a\nsteady income stream for individual investors that rely on the regular cash\nflow that an ELTIF can produce. ELTIFs can also offer good opportunities for\ncapital appreciation over time for those investors not receiving a steady\nincome stream.\n(3)              \nFinancing for projects, regarding transport\ninfrastructure, sustainable energy generation or distribution, social\ninfrastructure (housing or hospitals), roll-out of new technologies and systems\nthat reduce use of resources and energy or the further growth of SMEs, can be scarce.\nAs the financial crisis has shown, complementing bank financing with a wider\nvariety of financing sources that better mobilise capital markets could help\ntackle financing gaps. ELTIFs can play a crucial role in this respect. \n(4)              \nWhile individual investors may be interested in investing\nin an ELTIF, the illiquid nature of most investments in long-term projects\nprecludes an ELTIF from offering regular redemptions to its investors. The\ncommitment of the individual investor to an investment in such assets is by its\nnature made to the full term of the investment. ELTIFs should, consequently, be\nstructured so as not to offer regular redemptions before the end of life of the\nELTIF. A report, three years after the adoption of this Regulation, shall\ninvestigate whether this rule will have achieved the expected results in terms\nof ELTIF distribution or whether the introduction, in a limited number of\ncases, of the possibility, for some individual retail investors, to redeem\ntheir units or shares before the end of the ELTIF, may contribute to increase\nthe distribution of ELTIF among the individual retail investors.\n(5)              \nLong-term asset classes within the meaning of\nthis Regulation should comprise non-listed undertakings that issue equity or\ndebt instruments for which there is no readily identifiable buyer. This\nRegulation should also covers real assets that require significant up-front\ncapital expenditure. \n(6)              \nIn the absence of a Regulation setting out rules\non ELTIFs, diverging measures might be adopted at national level, which are\nlikely to cause distortions of competition resulting from differences in\ninvestment protection measures. Diverging requirements on portfolio\ncomposition, diversification and eligible assets, in particular the investment\nin commodities, create obstacles to the cross-border marketing of funds that\nfocus on non-listed undertakings and real assets because investors cannot\neasily compare the different investment propositions offered to them. Divergent\nnational requirements also lead to different levels of investor protection. Furthermore,\ndifferent national requirements pertaining to investment techniques, such as\nthe permitted levels of borrowing, use of derivative financial instruments,\nrules applicable to short selling or securities financing transactions lead to\ndiscrepancies in the level of investor protection. In addition, different\nrequirements on redemption and/or holding periods impede the cross-border\nselling of funds investing in non-listed assets. Those divergences can\nundermine the confidence of investors when considering investments in such\nfunds, and reduce the scope for investors to choose effectively between various\nlong-term investment opportunities. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for\nthis Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty, as interpreted by consistent case\nlaw of the Court of Justice of the European Union. \n(7)              \nUniform rules across the Union are necessary to\nensure that ELTIFs display a coherent product profile across the Union. In\norder to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and a high level\nof investor protection, it is necessary to establish uniform rules regarding\nthe operation of ELTIFs, in particular on the composition of the portfolio of\nELTIFs and the investment instruments that they are allowed to use in order to\ngain exposure to non-listed undertakings and real assets. Uniform rules on the\nportfolio of an ELTIF are also required to ensure that ELTIFs that aim to generate\nregular income maintain a diversified portfolio of investment assets suitable\nto maintain the regular cash flow.\n(8)              \nIt is essential to ensure that the definition of\nthe operation of ELTIFs, in particular on the composition of the portfolio of\nELTIFs and the investment instruments that they are allowed to use be directly\napplicable to the managers of ELTIFs and therefore these new rules need to be\nadopted as a Regulation. This also ensures uniform conditions for the use of\nthe designation ELTIF by preventing diverging national requirements. Managers\nof ELTIFs should follow the same rules across the Union, in order to also\nenhance the confidence of investors in ELTIFs and ensure sustainable\ntrustworthiness of the designation. At the same time, by adopting uniform\nrules, the complexity of the regulatory requirements applicable to ELTIFs is\nreduced. By means of uniform rules, the managers' cost of compliance with\ndivergent national rules governing funds that invest in non-listed undertakings\nand comparable real asset classes is also reduced. This is especially true for\nmanagers that wish to raise capital on a cross-border basis. It also\ncontributes to eliminate competitive distortions.\n(9)              \nThe new rules on ELTIFs are closely linked to\nDirective 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June\n2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC\nand 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU)\nNo 1095/2010[8]\nsince that Directive forms the legal framework governing the management and\nmarketing of alternative investment funds (AIFs) in the Union. By definition ELTIFs\nare EU AIFs that are managed by alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs)\nauthorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU.\n(10)          \nWhereas Directive 2011/61/EU also foresees a\nstaged third country regime governing non-EU AIFMs and non-EU AIFs, the new\nrules on ELTIFs have a more limited scope emphasising the European dimension of\nthe new long term investment product. Hence, only an EU AIF as defined in Directive\n2011/61/EU is eligible to become an authorised ELTIF and only if it is managed\nby an EU AIFM that has been authorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU.\n\n(11)          \nThe new rules applicable to ELTIFs should build\non the existing regulatory framework established through Directive 2011/61/EU\nand the acts adopted for its implementation. Therefore, the product rules\nconcerning ELTIFs should apply in addition to the rules laid down in the\nexisting Union legislation. Particularly, the management and marketing rules\nlaid down in Directive 2011/61/EU should apply to ELTIFs. Equally, the rules on\nthe cross-border provision of services and freedom of establishment laid down\nin Directive 2011/61/EU should apply accordingly to the cross-border activities\nof ELTIFs. These should be supplemented by the specific marketing rules\ndesigned for the cross-border marketing of ELTIFs to both retail and\nprofessional investors across the Union.\n(12)          \nUniform rules should apply to all those EU AIFs that\nwish to market themselves as ELTIFs. EU AIFs that do not wish to market\nthemselves as ELTIFs should not be bound by these rules, thereby also\nconsenting not to benefit from the advantages that ensue. On the other hand, Undertakings\nfor collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and non-EU AIFs\nwould not be eligible for marketing as ELTIFs.\n(13)          \nIn order to ensure the compliance of ELTIFs with\nthe harmonised rules governing the activity of these funds, it is necessary to\nrequire that competent authorities authorise ELTIFs. The harmonised\nauthorisation and supervision procedures for AIFMs under Directive 2011/61/EU\nshould therefore be supplemented with a special authorisation procedure for\nELTIFs. Procedures should be established to ensure that only EU AIFMs\nauthorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU and capable of managing an ELTIF\nmay manage ELTIFs. All appropriate steps are taken to ensure that the ELTIF\nshall be able to comply with the harmonised rules governing the activity of\nthese funds.\n(14)          \nGiven that EU AIFs may take different legal\nforms that do not necessarily endow them with legal personality, the provisions\nrequiring ELTIFs to take action should be understood to refer to the manager of\nthe ELTIF in cases where the ELTIF is constituted as an EU AIF that is not in a\nposition to act by itself because it has no legal personality of its own.\n(15)          \nIn order to ensure that ELTIFs target long-term investments,\nrules on the portfolio of ELTIFs should require a clear identification of the\ncategories of assets that should be eligible for investment by ELTIFs and of\nthe conditions under which they should be eligible. An ELTIF should invest at\nleast 70% of its capital in eligible investment assets. To ensure the integrity\nof ELTIFs it is also desirable to prohibit an ELTIF from engaging in certain financial\ntransactions that might endanger its investment strategy and objectives by\nraising additional risks different to those that might be expected for a fund targeting\nlong-term investments. In order to ensure a clear focus on long term investments,\nas may be useful for retail investors unfamiliar with less conventional\ninvestment strategies, an ELTIF should not be allowed to invest in financial\nderivative instruments other than for the purpose of hedging the duration and\ncurrency risk of the other assets. Given the liquid nature of commodities and\nfinancial derivative instruments that give an indirect exposure to them, investments\nin commodities do not require a long-term investor commitment and therefore should\nbe excluded. This rationale does not apply to investments in infrastructure or\ncompanies related to commodities or whose performance is linked indirectly to\nthe performance of commodities, such as farms in the case of agricultural\ncommodities or power plants in the case of energy commodities.\n(16)          \nThe definition of what constitutes a long-term investment\nis broad. Without necessarily requiring long-term holding periods for the ELTIF\nmanager, eligible investment assets are generally illiquid, require commitments\nfor a certain period of time, and have an economic profile of a long-term\nnature. Eligible investment assets are non-transferable securities and\ntherefore do not have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often\nrequire fixed term commitments which restrict their marketability. The economic\ncycle of the investment sought by ELTIFs is essentially of a long-term nature\ndue to the high capital commitments and the length of time required to produce\nreturns. As a result such assets do not suit investments with redemption\nrights.\n(17)          \nAn ELTIF should be allowed to invest in assets other\nthan eligible investment assets, as may be necessary to efficiently manage its\ncash flow, but only so long as this is consistent with the ELTIF\u2019s long term\ninvestment strategy.\n(18)          \nEligible investment assets must be understood to\ninclude participations, such as equity or quasi-equity instruments, debt\ninstruments in qualifying portfolio undertakings and loans provided to them. They\nshould also include participation in other funds that are focused on assets\nsuch as investments in non-listed undertakings that issue equity or debt\ninstruments for which there is not always a readily identifiable buyer. Direct\nholdings of real assets, unless they are securitised, should also form a class\nof eligible assets.\n(19)          \nQuasi-equity instruments must be understood to comprise\na type of financing instrument, which is a combination of equity and debt,\nwhere the return on the instrument is linked to the profit or loss of the\nqualifying portfolio undertaking, and where the repayment of the instrument in\nthe event of default is not fully secured. Such instruments include a variety\nof financing instruments such as subordinated loans, silent participations,\nparticipating loans, profit participating rights, convertible bonds and bonds\nwith warrants. \n(20)          \nTo reflect existing business practices, an ELTIF\nshould be allowed to buy existing shares of a qualifying portfolio undertaking\nfrom existing shareholders of that undertaking. Also, for the purposes of\nensuring the widest possible opportunities for fundraising, investments into\nother ELTIFs should be permitted. To prevent dilution of the investments into\nqualifying portfolio undertakings, ELTIFs should only be permitted to invest in\nother ELTIFs, provided that those ELTIFs have not themselves invested more than\n10 % of their capital in other ELTIFs.\n(21)          \nThe use of financial undertakings can be\nnecessary in order to pool and organise the contributions of different\ninvestors, including investments of a public nature, into infrastructure\nprojects. ELTIFs should therefore be permitted to invest in eligible investment\nassets by means of financial undertakings, so long as these undertakings are\ndedicated to financing long-term projects.\n(22)          \nIn order to provide investors with the assurance\nthat ELTIFs contribute directly to the development of long-term investments, ELTIFs\nshould be limited to investments in undertakings that have not been listed.\nTherefore qualifying portfolio undertakings should not be listed on regulated\nmarkets. Qualifying portfolio undertakings include infrastructure projects,\ninvestment in unlisted companies seeking growth and investments in real estate\nor other real assets that could be suitable for long term investment purposes.\n(23)          \nDue to the scale of infrastructure projects,\nthese require large amounts of capital that have to remain invested for long\nperiods of time. Such infrastructure projects include public building\ninfrastructure such as schools, hospitals or prisons, social infrastructure\nsuch as social housing, transport infrastructure such as roads, mass transit\nsystems or airports, energy infrastructure such as energy grids, climate\nadaptation and mitigation projects, power plants or pipelines, water management\ninfrastructure such as water supply systems, sewage or irrigation systems, communication\ninfrastructure such as networks and waste management infrastructure such as recycling\nor collection systems. \n(24)          \nUnlisted undertakings can face difficulties\naccessing capital markets and financing further growth and expansion. Private\nfinancing through equity stakes or loans are typical ways of raising financing.\nBecause such instruments are by their nature long-term investments they require\npatient capital that ELTIFs can provide.\n(25)          \nInvestments in real assets require patient\ncapital due to the absence of liquid secondary markets. Investment funds\nrepresent an essential source of financing for assets that require large\ncapital expenditure. For these assets, capital pooling is often necessary to\nachieve the desired level of funding. Such investments require long periods of\ntime due to the generally long economic cycle attached to these assets. It\ngenerally takes several years to amortize the investment in large real assets.\nIn order to facilitate the development of such large assets, ELTIFs should be\nable to invest directly in real assets with a value of more than \u20ac10 million.\nIn practice this would include assets such as infrastructure, real estate,\nships, aircraft or rolling stock. For these reasons it is necessary to treat\ndirect holdings in real assets and investments in qualifying portfolio\nundertakings in like manner.\n(26)          \nWhere the manager holds a stake in a portfolio\nundertaking, there is a risk that the manager puts its interests ahead of the\ninterests of investors in the fund. To avoid such conflict of interests, the ELTIF\nshould only invest in assets that are unrelated to the manager.\n(27)          \nIn order to allow managers of ELTIFs a certain\ndegree of flexibility in the investment of their funds, trading in assets other\nthan long-term investments should be permitted up to a maximum threshold of 30\n% of their capital.\n(28)          \nIn order to limit risk-taking by ELTIFs it is\nessential to reduce counterparty risk by subjecting the portfolio of ELTIFs to\nclear diversification requirements. All over-the counter (OTC) derivatives\nshould be subject to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and\ntrade repositories[9].\n(29)          \nIn order to prevent the exercise of significant\ninfluence by an investing ELTIF over the management of another ELTIF or of an\nissuing body, it is necessary to avoid excessive concentration by an ELTIF in\nthe same investment.\n(30)          \nIn order to allow ELTIF managers to raise\nfurther capital during the life of the fund, they should be permitted to borrow\ncash amounting to up to 30% of the capital of the fund. This should serve to\nprovide additional return to the investors. In order to eliminate the risk of\ncurrency mismatches, the ELTIF should only borrow in the currency the manager\nexpects to acquire the asset in. \n(31)          \nDue to the long-term and illiquid nature of the\ninvestments of an ELTIF, the managers should have sufficient time to apply the\ninvestment limits. The time required to implement these limits should take\naccount of the peculiarities and characteristics of the investments but should\nnot exceed five years.\n(32)          \nNotwithstanding the fact that ELTIFs do not\noffer redemption rights before the end of life of the ELTIF, nothing should\nprevent an ELTIF from seeking admission of these shares or units to a regulated\nmarket as defined in Article 4(14) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial\ninstruments,[10]\nto a multilateral trading facility as defined in Article 4(15) of Directive\n2004/39/EC, or to an organised trading facility as defined in point (\u2026) of\nRegulation (\u2026), thus providing investors with an opportunity to sell their\nunits or shares before the end of life of the ELTIF. The rules or instruments\nof incorporation of an ELTIF should therefore not prevent units or shares from\nbeing admitted to or from being dealt in regulated markets, nor should they\nprevent investors from freely transferring their shares or units to third\nparties who wish to purchase those shares or units.\n(33)          \nIn order for investors to effectively redeem\ntheir units or shares at the end of the fund's life, the manager should start\nto sell the portfolio of assets of the ELTIF in good time to ensure the value\nis properly realised. In determining an orderly disinvestment schedule, the ELTIF\nmanager should take into account the different maturity profiles of the\ninvestments and the length of time necessary to find a buyer for the assets in\nwhich the ELTIF is invested. Due to the impracticality of maintaining the\ninvestment limits during this liquidation period, they should cease to apply\nwhen the liquidation period starts.\n(34)          \nThe assets in which an ELTIF is invested may obtain\na listing on a regulated market during the life of the fund. Where this\nhappens, the asset would no longer comply with the non-listing requirement of\nthis Regulation. In order to allow managers to disinvest from such an asset in\nan orderly manner, this asset could continue to count towards the 70% limit of\neligible investment assets for up to three years.\n(35)          \nGiven the specific characteristics of ELTIFs, as\nwell as the targeted retail and professional investors it is important that\nsolid transparency requirements be put in place that are capable of allowing\nprospective investors to make an informed judgement and be fully aware of the\nrisks implied. In addition to the transparency requirements contained in\nDirective 2011/61/EU, ELTIFs should publish a prospectus the content of which\nshould necessarily include all information required to be disclosed by\ncollective investment undertakings of the closed-end type in accordance with\nDirective 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[11] and Commission Regulation (EC)\nNo 809/2004.[12]\nFor the marketing of an ELTIF to retail investors it should be mandatory to\npublish a key information document (KID) in accordance with Regulation No [\u2026]\nof [\u2026] of the European Parliament and the Council. Furthermore, any marketing\ndocuments should explicitly draw attention to the risk profile of the ELTIF. \n(36)          \nAs ELTIFs target both professional and retail\ninvestors across the Union, it is necessary that certain requirements be added\nto the marketing requirements laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU in order to\nensure an appropriate degree of investor protection. Thus, facilities should be\nmade available for making subscriptions, making payments to unit- or\nshareholders, repurchasing or redeeming units or shares and making available\nthe information which the ELTIF and its managers are required to provide.\nMoreover, in order to ensure that retail investors are not disadvantaged with\nrespect to experienced professional investors certain safeguards have to be put\nin place when ELTIFs are marketed to retail investors. \n(37)          \nThe competent authority of the ELTIF should verify\nwhether an ELTIF is able to comply with this Regulation on an on-going basis.\nAs the competent authorities are already provided with extensive powers under\nDirective 2011/61/EU, it is necessary that such powers be extended in order to\nbe exercised by reference to the new common rules on ELTIFs. \n(38)          \nESMA should be able to exercise all the powers\nconferred under Directive 2011/61/EU with respect to this Regulation.\n(39)          \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority\n(ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory\nAuthority (ESMA), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission\nDecision 2009/77/EC,[13]\nshould play a central role in the application of the rules concerning ELTIFs by\nensuring consistent application of Union rules by national competent\nauthorities. As a body with highly specialised expertise regarding securities\nand securities markets, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA with\nthe elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve\npolicy choices, for submission to the Commission, in respect of the\ncircumstances in which the life of an ELTIF will be sufficient in length to\ncover the life-cycle of each of the individual assets of the ELTIF, the\nfeatures of the schedule for the orderly disposal of ELTIF assets, the\ndefinitions, calculation methodologies and presentation of cost disclosures,\nand the characteristics of the facilities to be set up by ELTIFs in each Member\nState where they intend to market units or shares.\n(40)          \nThe new uniform rules on ELTIFs should comply\nwith the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[14] and with Regulation (EC) No\n45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by\nthe Community institutions and bodies and of the free movement of such data[15].\n(41)          \nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely\nto ensure uniform requirements on the investments and operating conditions for ELTIFs\nthroughout the Union, while taking full account of the need to balance safety\nand reliability of ELTIFs with the efficient operation of the market for\nlong-term financing and the cost for its various stakeholders, cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its\nscale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt\nmeasures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\n5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(42)          \nThe new uniform rules on ELTIFs respect the\nfundamental rights and observe the principles recognised in particular by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably consumer\nprotection, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to remedy and to a\nfair trial, and the protection of personal data.

The review, taking into account ELTIF\u2019s distribution to\ndifferent investor categories, shall also assess whether exempting a limited\nnumber of individual retail investors from such a rule would have the effect of\nincreasing demand for ELTIF amongst retail investors;\n(b)         \nthe impact on asset diversification of the\napplication of the minimum threshold of 70% of eligible investment assets laid\ndown in Article 12(1), in particular to assess whether increased measures on\nliquidity would be necessary should a limited number of individual retail\ninvestors be exempted from the prohibition on redeeming their units before the\nend of life of the ELTIF;\n(c)         \nthe extent to which ELTIFs are marketed in the\nUnion, including whether AIFMs falling under Article 3(2) of Directive\n2011/61/EU might have an interest in marketing ELTIFs.\nThe results of this review shall be\ncommunicated to the European Parliament and the Council accompanied, where\nnecessary, by appropriate proposals for amendments.\nArticle 31\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the\ntwentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FRAMEWORK OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Title of the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy\narea(s) concerned in the ABM/ABB structure\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature\nof the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objective(s)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds\nfor the proposal/initiative \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration\nand financial impact \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nmode(s) envisaged \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring\nand reporting rules \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management\nand control system \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s)\nof the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated\nimpact on expenditure \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.2.1.

It will do this by creating a new form of fund vehicle, EU Long Term\nInvestment Funds or ELTIFs. ELTIFs, by virtue of the asset classes that they\nare allowed to invest in, are expected to be able to provide investors with\nlong term, stable returns. Eligible assets would be qualified as forming part\nof \u2018alternative investments\u2019 \u2013 asset classes that fall outside the traditional\ndefinition of listed shares and bonds. While alternative investments comprise\nreal estate, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, non-listed\ncompanies, distressed securities and commodities, ELTIFs would only focus on\nalternative investments that fall within a defined category of long-term asset\nclasses whose successful development requires a long-term commitment from\ninvestors. \nThere is a clear need to refocus investors'\napproach away from only investing with a short-term outlook or in assets\nrequiring short-term commitments. One way of achieving this is to reduce\nbarriers to making longer-term commitments to assets such as infrastructure\nprojects, by providing what is often called 'patient capital'. This kind of\ninvestment may not be able to be redeemed for a number of years but are\ninvested in such a way as to be able to provide stable and predictable returns.\nInfrastructure projects or operating concessions would fit this description.\nCapital invested in this long term, 'patient' manner benefits the real economy\nby providing predictable and sustained flows of finance to firms and creates\nemployment.\nTo ensure the effective removal of barriers\nto a pan-European market for ELTIFs and the trust of investors in these funds,\nit is necessary to ensure the highest level of supervisory convergence and proportionate\noversight. The role of ESMA therefore will be of great importance, both in\nterms of the development of detailed regulatory requirements to achieve\nconvergence and uniformity in the market, and in supporting ongoing supervisory\noversight.\nThe costs related to tasks to be carried\nout by ESMA have been estimated for staff expenditure (Title 1), in conformity\nwith the cost classification in the ESMA draft budget. The proposal of the\nCommission includes provisions for ESMA to develop 4 regulatory technical\nstandards. In addition, ESMA will have to keep a central register on all\nauthorized ELTIFs. ESMA will also have the opportunity to develop guidelines on\nthe fields covered by this Regulation. ESMA will also have a role in relation\nto ensuring smooth cooperation and coordination of supervision of ELTIFs by the\ncompetent authorities of Member States.\nIt has been assumed that the Regulation\nwill enter into force in early 2015, and therefore the additional ESMA\nresources are required from 2015. Additional staff has been estimated for the\ntechnical standards, advice and register to be produced by ESMA; and for other\npermanent tasks that accompany the function of ESMA in enhancing cooperation\nwith the competent authorities and convergence in supervisory practices. As\nregards the nature of positions, the successful and timely delivery of new\ntechnical standards will require, in particular, additional policy, legal and\nimpact assessment officers.\nThe following assumptions were applied to\nassess the impact on number of FTEs required to develop technical standards,\nguidelines and reports:\n\u00b7       \nOne policy officer can draft on average 1,5\ntechnical standards a year. All this work requires preparatory work such as:\n\u00b7       \nBilateral and multilateral meetings with\nstakeholders\n\u00b7       \nAnalysis and assessment of options and drafting\nof consultation documents\n\u00b7       \nPublic consultation of stakeholders\n\u00b7       \nSetting up and management of standing expert\ngroups composed of supervisors from Member States\n\u00b7       \nSetting up and management of ad hoc expert\ngroups composed of market participants and representatives of investors\n\u00b7       \nAnalysis of the responses to consultations\n\u00b7       \nDrafting of cost/benefit analysis\n\u00b7       \nDrafting of the legal text\nA central register would need to be\ndeveloped (IT project specified, tenders assessed, project managed). This\nregister would then be subject to ongoing maintenance, in view of ensuring its\naccuracy and completeness. \nIn addition, other work will be necessary\non an ongoing basis, including coordination of the action of Member State\nsupervisors, work to identify supervisory practices and drive convergence in\nthese, dispute resolution and mediation processes, and market monitoring and\nassessment work to identify trends in the European market of long-term\ninvestments and clarify any emerging risks for investors or barriers to the\nsmooth functioning of the single market for such funds.\nThis means an additional 2 FTEs are needed\nfrom 2015. It was assumed that this increase in FTEs will be maintained in 2016\nto 2020 since the standards will most likely be finalised only in 2016-2017 and\nimplementation will be required till 2020, while ongoing tasks as outlined\nabove would increase for ESMA following the implementation work.\nOther assumptions:\n\u00b7       \nBased on the distribution of FTEs as from 2015,\nthe additional 2 FTEs are assumed to be comprised of 2 temporary agents \n\u00b7       \nAverage annual salary costs for different\ncategories of personnel are based on DG BUDG guidance;\n\u00b7       \nSalary weighting coefficient for Paris of 1,16;\n\u00b7       \nMission costs assumed at \u20ac10,000 per year\n\u00b7       \nRecruiting-related costs (travel, hotel, medical\nexaminations, installation and other allowances, removal costs, etc) estimated\nat \u20ac12,700, \n\u00b7       \nThe method of calculating the increase in the\nrequired budget for the 6 years is presented in more detail in table below.
