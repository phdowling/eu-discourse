Taking\naccount of the fact that these Regulations have not been substantially revised\nsince the completion of the Uruguay Round in 1995 and taking account of the\nconclusions of the evaluation study carried out into the functioning of these instruments,\nit is proposed to update and modernise the instruments.\nGeneral context\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union provides, inter alia, for measures to be established to protect trade such\nas those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\nproposal\nThe above-mentioned Council Regulations.\nConsistency with the other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThere is no conflict with any policy or\nobjective of the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nInterested parties concerned by this\nproposal have had the opportunity to participate in the Public consultation\ncarried out from April to July 2012. A summary of the results of the public\nconsultation has been available on DG Trade\u2019s website since October 2012.\nCollection and use of expertise\nAn evaluation study into the functioning of\nthe EU\u2019s anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruiments was finalised in early-2012\nand has been available on DG Trade\u2019s website since then.\nImpact Assessment\nTaking into account the results of the\npublic consultation, the evalutation study and the Commission's extensive\npractice in the use of the instruments an impact assessment was carried out in\nautumn 2012. The impact assessment report identified problems in the\nfunctioning of the trade defence instruments and proposed various solutions.\nThe Impact Assessment Board considered the report in December 2012 and gave a\nfavourable opinion subject to some revisions to the report. The report has\nsince been revised and finalised. The preferred solutions form the basis for\nthis proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nIt is proposed to amend the basic\nanti-dumping and basic anti-subsidy Regulations in order to improve them in a\nnumber of areas. Regarding transparency and predictability, these will be\nenhanced by providing that interested parties are informed two weeks in advance\nof the imposition of provisional measures that such measures are going to be\nimposed. Parties will also be given a guarantee that the measures will not be\nimposed within this two week period. A summary of the basis on which it is\nintended to impose the measures will be sent to interested parties and they\nwill have the opportunity to comment on the calculation of the dumping and\ninjury margins. Furthermore, when it is decided not to impose provisional\nmeasures but to continue the investigation, interested parties will be informed\nof the intention not to impose such measures two weeks in advance of the\nultimate date for imposition.\nConcerning threats of retaliation against\nUnion producers who are considering lodging an anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy\ncomplaint, such threats can be considered to constitute special circumstances\nthat warrant the ex-officio opening of an investigation. Furthermore, when\ninvestigations are opened on an ex-officio basis, it is proposed to oblige\nUnion producers to cooperate in the proceeding. \nIn regard to the effectiveness of the\ninstruments, it is proposed to remove the lesser duty rule in cases of circumvention,\nor where structural raw material distortions have been found to exist, and\nsubsidisation. Concerning reviews, it is proposed to reimburse duties collected\nduring an expiry review investigation that is concluded by the repeal of the\nmeasures. \nFinally, there are a number of areas where\nit is proposed to codify certain practices which stem from ECJ or WTO rulings\nthat have been handed down in recent years. These concern the definition of\nUnion industry, the consequences for exporting producers found not to be\ndumping or to be dumping at de-minimis levels in an original\ninvestigation, dealing with changed circumstances in a review investigation,\nthe treatment of related companies in anti-circumvention investigations, the\nconditions for the registration of imports and the basis for choosing a sample\nof Union producers. \nLegal basis\nArticle 207 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\naforementioned basic Regulations and leaves no scope for national decisions. \nIt will not entail any increased financial\nor administrative burden on the Union, national governments, regional and local\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens. However, the reimbursement of\nduties collected during an ongoing expiry review, if such an expiry review does\nnot lead to a prolongation of measures, is handled by national customs\nauthorities. The additional workload on customs authorities is considered to be\nsmall and proportionate to the objective of the proposal, i.e. increasing\nfairness of the instruments. \nThe non-application of the lesser duty rule\nin cases of circumvention, or where structural raw material distortions have\nbeen found to exist, and subsidisation is proportionate to the additional need\nto protect trade in these situations.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason(s):\nThe aforementioned basic Regulations do not\nprovide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has implications for the Union\nbudget. The non-application of the lesser duty rule under certain circumstances\nwill in some cases lead to higher duty levels and is thus revenue enhancing. The\nreimbursement of duties in cases where measures are terminated after an expiry\nreview represents an expense for the Union budget. Quantification is very\ndifficult since any revenue or expense depends on the circumstances of each\nindividual case. \nThe proposed legislative changes will also\nentail some changes to the practice. These will not have any budgetary\nimplications but changes to the working routines (e.g.: pre-disclosure, advance\nnotice, summary document). The upgrading of the SME helpdesk (explained in the\ncommunication) has resource implications set out in the attached legislative\nfinancial statement. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNot applicable.\n2013/0103 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of\nthe European Community and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection\nagainst subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national\nparliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas: \n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The common rules for\nprotection against dumped and subsidised imports from countries which are not\nmembers of the European Union are contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nof 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries\nnot members of the European Community[1]\nand Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection\nagainst subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community[2] respectively (hereinafter\njointly referred to as the 'Regulations'). The Regulations were initially\nadopted in 1995 following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Given that a\nnumber of amendments were made to the Regulations since then, the Council\ndecided in 2009 to codify the regulations in the interest of clarity and\nrationality.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the Regulations have\nbeen amended, there has not been a fundamental review of the functioning of\nthese instruments since 1995. As a result, the Commission launched a review of\nthe Regulations in 2011 in order to, inter alia, better reflect the\nneeds of business at the beginning of the 21st century. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the review,\ncertain provisions of the Regulations should be amended in order to improve\ntransparency and predictability, provide for effective measures to fight\nagainst retaliation, improve effectiveness and enforcement and optimise review\npractice. In addition, certain practices that in recent years have been applied\nin the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations should be\nincluded in the Regulations.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to improve\ntransparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy\ninvestigations, the parties affected by the imposition of provisional\nanti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular importers, should be\nmade aware of the impending imposition of such measures. The time given should\ncorrespond to the period between the submission of the draft implementing act\nto the anti-dumping committee established pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation\n(EC) No 1225/2009 and the anti-subsidy committee established pursuant to\nArticle 25 of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 and the adoption of that act by the\nCommission. This period is fixed in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) No\n182/2011. Also, in investigations where it is not appropriate to impose\nprovisional measures, it is desirable that parties are aware sufficiently in\nadvance of such non-imposition.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A short period of time in\nadvance of the imposition of provisional measures should be allowed for\nexporters or producers to check the calculation of their individual dumping or\nsubsidy margin. Calculation errors could then be corrected in advance of the\nimposition of measures.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\neffective measures to fight against retaliation, Union producers should be able\nto rely on the Regulations without fear of retaliation by third parties. Existing\nprovisions, under special circumstances, provide for the initiation of an\ninvestigation without having received a complaint, where sufficient evidence of\nthe existence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, injury and causal link\nexists. Such special circumstances should include threat of retaliation. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When an investigation is not\ninitiated by a complaint, an obligation should be imposed on Union producers to\nprovide the necessary information in order for the investigation to proceed, in\norder to ensure that sufficient information is available for carrying out the\ninvestigation in case of such threats of retaliation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third countries\nincreasingly interfere in trade of raw materials with a view to keeping raw\nmaterials in those countries for the benefit of domestic downstream users, for\ninstance by imposing export taxes or operating dual pricing schemes. As a\nresult, the costs of raw materials do not result from the operation of normal\nmarket forces reflecting supply and demand for a given raw material. Such\ninterference creates additional distortions of trade. As a consequence, Union\nproducers are not only harmed by dumping, but suffer, compared to downstream\nproducers from third countries engaged in such practices, additional\ndistortions of trade. In order to protect trade adequately, the lesser duty rule\nshall not apply in such cases of structural raw material distortions.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the Union, countervailable subsidies are in principle prohibited pursuant to Article 107 (1)\nTFEU. Therefore, countervailable subsidies granted by third countries are particularly\ndistortive of trade. The amount of State aid authorized by the Commission has\nsteadily been reduced over time. For the anti-subsidy instrument, the lesser\nduty rule should hence no longer be applied to imports from a country/countries\nengaged in subsidisation. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to optimise the review\npractice, duties collected during the investigation should be reimbursed to\nimporters, where measures are not prolonged after the conclusion of an expiry\nreview investigation. This is appropriate given that the conditions required\nfor the continuation of the measures have not been found to exist during the\ninvestigation period.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain practices which in\nrecent years have been applied in the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy\ninvestigations should be included into the Regulations. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry should\nno longer be defined by reference to the initiation thresholds set out in the\nRegulations.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In initial investigations\nwhere dumping or subsidy margins have been found to be less than the de\nminimis thresholds, the investigation should be immediately terminated in\nrelation to exporters that will not be subject to subsequent review\ninvestigations. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of\nanti-dumping and anti-subsidy review investigations, it seems appropriate to be\nable to change methodology as compared to the investigation that led to the imposition of the measure in order to ensure\nthat, inter alia, coherent methodologies are used across different\ninvestigations at a given point in time. This will allow, in particular, scope\nto change methodologies which are revised over time as situations change.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the conditions are met\nfor initiating an anti-circumvention investigation, imports should in all cases\nbe made subject to registration.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In anti-circumvention\ninvestigations, it seems advisable to remove the condition that, in order to be\ngranted an exemption from registration or extended duties, producers of the\nproduct concerned should not be related to any producer subject to the original\nmeasures. This is because experience shows that sometimes producers of the\nproduct concerned are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices but\nare found to be related to a producer subject to the original measures. In such\ncases the producer should not be denied an exemption merely on the grounds that\nthe company is related to a producer subject to the original measures. Also,\nwhen the circumvention practice takes place in the Union, the fact that\nimporters are related to producers subject to the measures should not be\ndecisive in determining whether the importer may be granted an exemption.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the number of\nproducers in the Union is so large that resort must be made to sampling, a\nsample of producers should be chosen from among all producers in the Union and not just from among producers lodging the complaint.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In making the Union\ninterest assessment, the opportunity to provide comments should be given to all\nproducers in the Union and not just those producers lodging the complaint.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nand Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation\n(EC) No 1225/2009 is amended as follows: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article\n4(1), the introductory wording is replaced by the\nfollowing: \n'1.

The provision of such information shall not prejudice any subsequent\ndecision that may be taken by the Commission.' \n(b) paragraph 2\nis replaced by the following:\n'The amount of\nthe provisional anti-dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping as\nprovisionally established. Unless structural raw material distortions were\nfound to exist with regard to the product concerned in the exporting country, it\nshould be less than the margin of dumping if such lesser duty would be adequate\nto remove the injury to the Union industry.\u2019\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\n9 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 3 is\nreplaced by the following:\n'3. For a\nproceeding initiated pursuant to Article 5(9), injury shall normally be\nregarded as negligible where the imports concerned represent less than the\nvolumes set out in Article 5(7). For the same proceeding, there shall be\nimmediate termination where it is determined that the margin of dumping is less\nthan 2 %, expressed as a percentage of the export price.'\n(b) in paragraph\n4, the last sentence is replaced by the following:\n'The amount of the\nanti-dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping established. Unless structural\nraw material distortions were found to exist with regard to the product\nconcerned in the exporting country, it shall be less than the margin of dumping\nif such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the Union\nindustry.' \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 11 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 5, the following subparagraph is added: \n'If following an\ninvestigation pursuant to paragraph 2, the measure expires, any duties\ncollected from the date of the initiation of such investigation shall be repaid\nprovided that this is requested from national customs\nauthorities and granted by those authorities in accordance with the applicable\nUnion customs legislation concerning repayment and remission of duty. Such repayment\ndoes not give rise to the payment of interest by the national customs\nauthorities concerned.'\n(b) paragraph 9 is\ndeleted.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 3, the second sentence is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u2018Initiations shall\nbe made, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, by Commission Regulation\nwhich shall also instruct the customs authorities to make imports subject to\nregistration in accordance with Article 14(5) or to request guarantees.\u2019 \n(b) in paragraph\n4, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n'Imports shall not\nbe subject to registration pursuant to Article 14(5) or measures where they are\ntraded by companies which benefit from exemptions.
