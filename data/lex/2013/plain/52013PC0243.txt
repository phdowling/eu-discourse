The objectives of the OIV are (i) to inform via publications and\norganisation of events and symposiums, (ii) to assist other international\norganisations involved in standardisation activities and (iii) to contribute to\ninternational harmonisation of existing practices and standards. Currently 44\nStates are members of the OIV, among which 20 are Member States of the Union.\nThe EU is currently not a member of the OIV.\nAt EU level, pursuant to Council Regulation\n(EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of\nagricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural\nproducts (Single CMO Regulation, OJ L 299, p. 1), certain resolutions adopted\nand published by the OIV affect EU law. The Single CMO provides for references\nto the OIV resolutions in the following provisions: \n- the methods of analysis for determining the\ncomposition of the products of the wine sector and certain purity and\nidentification specifications of substances used in oenological practices so\nthat the rules adopted and published by the OIV become ipso facto binding on\nthis matter within the EU (Article 120(g) of the Single CMO and Article 9 of\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 of 10 July 2009 laying down certain\ndetailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 as regards\nthe categories of grapevine products, oenological practices and the applicable\nrestrictions, OJ L 193 p. 1);\n- oenological practices adopted and published\nby the OIV upon which the Commission must base itself when it authorises such\npractices (Article 120(f) of Single CMO); and \n- the same oenological practices according to\nwhich the EU must accept wines produced in third countries and which therefore\nbecome ipso facto binding in the EU (Article 158(a) of the Single CMO).\nSimilarly, pursuant to the Commission\nRegulation (EC) No 2870/2000 of 19 December 2000 laying down Community\nreference methods for the analysis of spirits drinks (OJ L 333, p. 20) certain\nresolutions adopted and published by the OIV affect EU law. Article 3 of Regulation\n2870/2000 provides for reference to OIV resolutions where Community analytical\nreference methods are not laid down for the detection and quantification of\nsubstances contained in a particular spirit drink.\nOn the basis of discussions held within the\ngroups of experts meeting to prepare the General Assembly of the OIV, it can be\nexpected that the following Resolutions, producing legal effect within the EU\nacquis, will be on the agenda of the General Assembly for adoption:\n- The draft Resolutions OENO-TECHNO 11-498 and\n11-499 establish new oenological practices. In accordance with Articles 120(f)\nand 158(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, these Resolutions will affect the\nacquis.\n- The draft Resolutions OENO-SCMA 9-418, 10-440,\n10-480, 11-477, 11-478, 12-510 and 12-511 establish methods of analysis. In\naccordance Article 120(g) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, these resolutions\nwill affect the acquis.\n- The draft Resolutions OENO-MICRO 11-496 et\n11-497, OENO-SPECIF 10-459, 11-481, 11-482, 11-487, 11-488 and 11-495 establish\npurity and identification specifications of substances used in oenological\npractices. In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 606/2009, these\nResolutions will affect the acquis.\n- The draft Resolution OENO-SCMA 12-521\nestablishes a method of analysis for certain spirit drinks. In accordance with\nArticle 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2870/2000, this Resolution will affect the\nacquis.\nThe above mentioned resolutions have been\nextensively discussed between scientific and technical experts of the wine\nsector. They contribute to the international harmonisation of the wine standard\nand they will set a framework which will ensure fair competition in the trading\nof wine sector products. They should therefore be supported.\nAs in the past, it can be expected that the\nagenda of the meeting of the General Assembly of the OIV will still evolve and\nthat further Resolutions affecting the acquis will be added to the agenda. In\norder to ensure efficiency of the work of the General Assembly while respecting\nthe rules of the Treaties, the Commission will in due time supplement and/or\namend the present proposal to enable the Council to adopt the position to be\ntaken also for these Resolutions.\n2013/0129 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be adopted on\nbehalf of the European Union with regard to certain resolutions to be voted in\nthe framework of the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43, in conjunction\nwith Article 218(9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International\nOrganisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) is an intergovernmental scientific and\ntechnical organisation active in the sector of vine, wine, wine-based drinks,\ntable grapes, raisins and other vine products. The objectives of the OIV are\n(i) to inform via publications and organisation of events and symposiums, (ii)\nto assist other international organisations involved in standardisation\nactivities and (iii) to contribute to international harmonisation of existing\npractices and standards. Currently 44 States are members of the OIV, among\nwhich 20 are Member States of the Union. The EU is currently not a member of\nthe OIV.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At EU level, pursuant to\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common\norganisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain\nagricultural products (Single CMO Regulation, OJ L 299, p. 1), certain\nresolutions adopted and published by the OIV affect EU law. The Single CMO\nprovides for references to the OIV resolutions in the following provisions: \n- the methods of analysis for determining the\ncomposition of the products of the wine sector and certain purity and\nidentification specifications of substances used in oenological practices so\nthat the rules adopted and published by the OIV become ipso facto binding on\nthis matter within the EU (Article 120(g) of the Single CMO and Article 9 of\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 of 10 July 2009 laying down certain\ndetailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 as regards\nthe categories of grapevine products, oenological practices and the applicable\nrestrictions, OJ L 193 p. 1);\n- oenological practices adopted and published\nby the OIV upon which the Commission must base itself when it authorises such\npractices (Article 120(f) of Single CMO); and \n- the same oenological practices according to\nwhich the EU must accept wines produced in third countries and which therefore\nbecome ipso facto binding in the EU (Article 158(a) of the Single CMO).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, pursuant the\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 2870/2000 of 19 December 2000 laying down\nCommunity reference methods for the analysis of spirits drinks (OJ L 333, p.\n20) certain resolutions adopted and published by the OIV affect EU law. Article\n3 of Regulation (EC) No 2870/2000 provides for reference to OIV resolutions\nwhere Community analytical reference methods are not laid down for the\ndetection and quantification of substances contained in a particular spirit\ndrink.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly of the OIV will take place on 8 June 2013. On that occasion,\nthe General Assembly will examine and possibly adopt Resolutions which will\nproduce the legal effects referred to.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary\nto adopt, before that meeting of the General Assembly of the OIV, the positions\nthat the Member States which are members of the OIV, acting jointly in the\ninterest of the EU, should take in the General Assembly of the OIV with regard\nto these Resolutions.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolutions OENO-TECHNO\n11-498 and 11-499 establish new oenological practices. In accordance with\nArticles 120(f) and 158(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, these Resolutions\nwill affect the acquis.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolutions OENO-SCMA\n9-418, 10-440, 10-480, 11-477, 11-478, 12-510 and 12-511, establish methods of\nanalysis. In accordance Article 120(g) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, these\nresolutions will affect the acquis.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolutions OENO-MICRO\n11-496 et 11-497, OENO-SPECIF 10-459, 11-481, 11-482, 11-487, 11-488 and 11-495\nestablish purity and identification specifications of substances used in\noenological practices. In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No\n606/2009, these Resolutions will affect the acquis.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft Resolution\nOENO-SCMA 12-521 establishes a method of analysis for certain spirit drinks. In\naccordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2870/2000, this Resolution will\naffect the acquis.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above mentioned\nresolutions have been extensively discussed between scientific and technical\nexperts of the wine sector. They contribute to the international harmonisation\nof the wine standard and they will set a framework which will ensure fair\ncompetition in the trading of wine sector products. They should therefore be\nsupported.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for the\nnecessary flexibility during the negotiations ahead of the meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly of the OIV, Member States which are members of the OIV should\nbe authorised to agree to changes to these resolutions provided that such\nchanges do not alter substance thereof.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe position of the Union at the General\nAssembly of the OIV in 2013 shall be in accordance with the Annex to this\nDecision and shall be expressed by the Member States which are Members of the\nOIV, acting jointly in the interest of the Union.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the position\nreferred to in Article 1 is likely to be affected by new scientific or\ntechnical information presented before or during the meetings of the OIV, Member\nStates which are Members of the OIV shall request that the voting in the OIV\nGeneral Assembly be postponed until the position of the Union is established on\nthe basis of the new elements.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following coordination, in\nparticular on the spot, and without further decision of the Council\nestablishing the position of the Union, the Member States which are Members of\nthe OIV, acting jointly in the interest of the Union, may agree to changes to\nthe draft resolutions referred to in the Annex to this Decision which do not\nalter the substance thereof.\nArticle 3\nThis\nDecision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX\nThe Member States acting jointly in the\ninterest of the Union shall support only, and subject to any future review on\nthe basis of new developments, the following draft resolutions at step 7 on\nmethods of analysis for determining the composition of the products of the wine\nsector, on purity and identification specifications of substances used in\noenological practices and on oenological practices:\nOENO-TECHNO 11-498, modification of the files\nof oenological practices regarding enzymes,\nOENO-TECHNO 11-499, dissolved gas\nmanagement in wine using membrane contactors, \nOENO-SCMA 9-418, Practical guide for the\nassessment, quality control, and uncertainty analysis of an oenological\nanalysis method,\nOENO-SCMA 10-440, guidelines for the\nolfactory and taste evaluation of wine defects,\nOENO-SCMA 10-480, determination of methanol\nby gas chromatography,\nOENO-SCMA 11-477, detection and assay of\nphthalates in wines,\nOENO-SCMA 11-478, analysis of mineral\nelements in wines and spirits using ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma /\nAtomic Emission Spectrometry),\nOENO-SCMA 12-510, determination by isotope\nratio mass spectrometry 13C/12C of acetic acid of wine\nvinegar,\nOENO-SCMA 12-511, method for 18O/16O\nisotope ratio determination of water in wine vinegar,\nOENO-SCMA 12-521, detection and assay of\nphthalates in spirit drinks, \nOENO-MICRO 11-496, monograph on yeast\nautolysates,\nOENO-MICRO 11-497, cellular yeast hulls \u2013\ncodex,\nOENO-SPECIF 10-459, monograph on inactivated\nyeasts,\nOENO-SPECIF 11-481, monograph on\nultrafiltration membranes,\nOENO-SPECIF 11-482, monograph on\nnanofiltration membranes,\nOENO-SPECIF 11-487, revision of the\nmonograph on measurement of cinnamoyl esterase activity in enzymatic\npreparations (OIV-OENO 6-2007),\nOENO-SPECIF 11-488, revision of the\nmonograph on determination of beta-glucanase (\u00df 1-3, \u00df 1-6) activity in enzyme\npreparations (OIV-OENO 340-2010),\nOENO-SPECIF 11-495, monograph on protein\nplant origin - modification of the file.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
