Its purpose is to establish a framework\nfor bilateral or multilateral cooperation to prevent and control the pollution\nof transboundary watercourses and to ensure the rational use of water by countries\nof the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\nThe Convention was signed on behalf of the European Community in Helsinki on 18 March 1992 and approved by Council Decision 95/308/EC of 24 July 1995. \nAt the 2003 Meeting of the Parties to the\nConvention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, the Parties to the Convention expressed a wish to allow States\nsituated outside of the UNECE region to become Parties to the Convention in\norder to promote river basin cooperation throughout the world. The precedent\nfor this approach has already been established by the opening of a number of\nUNECE environmental conventions to States situated outside the UNECE region.\nThese include the Convention on the Access to Justice in Environmental Matters\nand the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary\nContext as well as the Protocol on Civil Liability and Compensation for Damage\nCaused by the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary\nWaters.\nThe 2003 Meeting of Parties adopted the Amendment allowing the\naccession of any State that is a Member of the United Nations to accede to the\nConvention upon approval by the Meeting of the Parties. The European Community and its Member States as Parties to the Convention participated in\nthe Meeting and supported the adoption of the Amendment. The amendment will enter into force upon acceptance by all States and\norganisations that were Parties to the Convention on 28 November 2003. \nOnce the Amendment enters into force, the\nConvention will be of particular importance for countries that border the UNECE\nregion, such as Afghanistan, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and certain Central Asian States. Some of these States have expressed an interest in acceding to the\nConvention. Their participation in the Convention will be beneficial in\nencouraging cooperation on management of transboundary water resources,\nespecially in light of growing pressures of climate change, desertification as\nwell as the importance of water access for stability and security. \nFollowing the adoption of an amendment in\n2003, a vast majority of Parties to the Convention have already formally\naccepted it. The EU is one of a small number of Parties\nto the Convention which have yet to accept the amendment. \nIn view of the above, it is appropriate for\nthe European Union to now accept the Amendment in order to open the Convention\nglobally and enable accession of non UNECE countries willing to do so.\n2013/0127 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the acceptance of the Amendment to Articles\n25 and 26 of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary\nWatercourses and International Lakes\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1), in conjunction\nwith Article 218(6) (a) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union is a Party to\nthe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes following its approval in 1995[2].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main purpose of this\nConvention is to establish a framework for bilateral or multilateral\ncooperation to prevent and control the pollution of transboundary watercourses\nand to ensure the rational use of water resources in the Member countries of\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the 2003 Meeting of the\nParties to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary\nWatercourses and International Lakes, the Parties to the Convention expressed a\nwish to allow States situated outside of the UNECE region to become Parties to\nthe Convention in order to promote river basin cooperation throughout the\nworld.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other UNECE environmental\nconventions (i.e. the Convention on the Access to Justice in Environmental\nMatters and the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a\nTransboundary Context) are open to States situated outside the UNECE region.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Community\nparticipated in the 2003 Meeting of Parties which adopted the Amendment\nallowing accession of any State that is a Member of the United Nations to\naccede to the Convention upon approval by the Meeting of the Parties. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Amendment will enter\ninto force upon acceptance of all States and organisations that were Parties to\nthe Convention on 28 November 2003.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Amendment should be\napproved on behalf of the European Union,\nHAS\nADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe Amendment to Articles 25 and 26 of the\nConvention (hereinafter referred to as \"the Amendment\") on the\nProtection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes\nopening accession to the Convention to all UN Member States which has been\nadopted at the Third Meeting of the Parties is hereby accepted\non behalf of the Union.\nThe text of the Amendment is attached to\nthis Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council shall\ndesignate the person empowered to proceed, on behalf of the European Union, to\nthe deposit of the instrument of acceptance of the Amendment provided for in\nArticle 21, paragraph 4, of the Convention, in order to express the consent of\nthe European Union to be bound by this Amendment. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\nday of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX \nAMENDMENT TO THE WATER CONVENTION\n(a) A new paragraph is inserted in article 25, after paragraph 2, of\nthe Convention, reading \n\u201c3.
