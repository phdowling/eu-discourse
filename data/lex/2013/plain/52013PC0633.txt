By letter dated 20 June 2013, the Commission\r\nnotified the United Kingdom that it had all the information necessary to\r\nconsider the request.\nGeneral context\nThe above-mentioned Decision authorised the\r\n  United Kingdom to apply a restriction of the right of deduction to 50% of the\r\ninput VAT incurred on the hire or lease of cars used by taxable persons for\r\nboth business and private use. At the same time, the private use by taxable\r\npersons of such leased or hired cars was not to be considered as supplies of\r\nservices for consideration. \nThis derogation removes the need for the\r\nhirer or the lessee to keep detailed private mileage records for each of these\r\ncars and to account for the VAT on the private use. The option provided for in\r\nArticle 168a(2) of the VAT Directive does not foresee partial deduction at a\r\nflat rate and could be applicable only for input VAT on cars forming part of\r\nthe business assets of the taxable person; therefore, a derogation is an\r\nappropriate measure to achieve the requested simplification. \nThe derogation is therefore essentially to\r\nbe considered as a simplification measure and is due to expire on 31 December\r\n2013. \nDerogations are normally granted for a\r\nlimited time as to allow an assessment whether the special measure is\r\nappropriate and effective. The report provided by the United Kingdom suggests that the 50% apportionment between business and private use (or any other\r\nnon-business use within the meaning of Article 26(1)(a) of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC) currently still reflects the overall business and private use of\r\nleased and hired cars by taxable persons in the United Kingdom. An extension of\r\nthe derogating measure is therefore appropriate.\nHowever, any extension should be limited in\r\ntime in order to assess whether the conditions, on which the derogation is\r\nbased, would still be valid. The United Kingdom requested to extend the\r\nderogation until 31 December 2018. It is however common practice to grant a\r\nthree year period in similar cases (see, in that regard, Council Implementing\r\nDecisions 2012/232/EU[2]\r\nand 2013/191/EU[3]).\r\nTherefore, it is proposed to extend the derogation until the end of 2016 and to\r\nrequest the United Kingdom to present a report by 1 April 2016 including a\r\nreview of the percentage restriction applied in case a further extension would\r\nbe envisaged beyond 2016. The Decision would in any case expire in case EU\r\nrules governing restrictions on the right of deduction would come into force\r\nbefore that end date.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nArticle 176 of the VAT Directive stipulates\r\nthat the Council shall determine the expenditure of which the VAT is not\r\ndeductible. Until such time, Member States are authorised to maintain\r\nexclusions which were in place on 1 January 1979. Therefore, there are a number\r\nof \"standstill\" provisions restricting the right of deduction in\r\nrelation to motor vehicles. \nIn 2004, the Commission made a proposal\r\nwhich contains rules on which categories of expenditure may be subject to a\r\nrestriction on the right to deduct but the Council has not been able yet to\r\nreach an agreement on that proposal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nDecision aims at extending in time a\r\nsimplification measure which removes the need for the taxable person to keep\r\nrecords and to account for VAT on private mileage travelled in cars operated by\r\na business and has therefore a potential positive economic impact. However,\r\nbecause of the narrow scope and the limited application in time, the impact\r\nwill in any case be limited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe implementing Decision is based on\r\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common\r\nsystem of value added tax.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the EU institutions. The subsidiarity principle therefore does\r\nnot apply.\nThe implementing Decision concerns an\r\nauthorisation granted to a Member State upon its own request and does not\r\nconstitute any obligation. The proposal therefore complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union's budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0312 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Decision 2007/884/EC authorising\r\nthe United Kingdom to continue to apply a measure derogating from Articles\r\n26(1)(a), 168 and 169 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value\r\nadded tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[4], and in particular Article\r\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter registered by\r\nthe Commission on 2 April 2013, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to\r\nextend a derogating measure in order to continue to restrict the right of\r\ndeduction of value added tax (VAT) by the hirer or lessee on charges for the\r\nhire or lease of a car where the car is not used entirely for business\r\npurposes. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States of the request made by the United Kingdom by letter\r\ndated 19 June 2013. By letter dated 20 June 2013, the Commission notified the United Kingdom that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2007/884/EC[5],\r\namended by Council Implementing Decision 2011/37/EU[6] authorised the United Kingdom to restrict to 50% the right of the hirer or lessee to deduct input VAT on\r\ncharges for the hire or lease of a car where the car was not used entirely for\r\nbusiness purposes. The United Kingdom was also allowed not to treat as supplies\r\nof services for consideration the private use of a car hired or leased by a\r\ntaxable person for his business purposes. That simplification measure removed\r\nthe need for the hirer or the lessee to keep records of private mileage\r\ntravelled in business cars and to account for tax on the actual private mileage\r\nof each car.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the report\r\nprovided by the United Kingdom, the restriction to 50% still corresponds to the\r\nactual circumstances as regards the business and the non-business use by the\r\nhirer or lessee of the vehicles concerned. It is therefore appropriate that the\r\n  United Kingdom be authorised to apply the measure until 31 December 2016.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the United Kingdom considers that a further extension beyond 2016 would be necessary, it should\r\nsubmit a report which includes a review of the percentage applied together with\r\nan extension request to the Commission no later than 1 April 2016.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2004, the\r\nCommission adopted a Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC[7], which includes the\r\nharmonisation of the categories of expenses for which exclusions of the right\r\nof deduction may apply. Council Directive 77/388/EEC[8] has been replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC.\r\nUnder the proposal adopted by the Commission on 29 October 2004, exclusions on\r\nthe right to deduct may be applied to motorised road vehicles. The derogating\r\nmeasures provided for in this Decision should expire on the date of the entry\r\ninto force of such Directive following the proposal adopted by the Commission\r\non 29 October 2004, if that date is earlier than 31 December 2016.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation will have\r\nonly a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the\r\nstage of final consumption and will have no adverse impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/884/EC\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nArticle 3 is replaced by the following: \n\"Article\r\n3\nThis Decision shall expire on the date of\r\nentry into force of Union rules determining the expenditure relating to\r\nmotorised road vehicles that is not eligible for full deduction of VAT, or on\r\n31 December 2016, whichever is the earlier. \nAny request for extension of the measures provided\r\nfor in this Decision shall be accompanied by a report, submitted to the\r\nCommission by 1 April 2016, which includes a review of the percentage\r\nrestriction applied on the right to deduct VAT on the hire or lease of cars not\r\nentirely used for business purposes.\"\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2014.\nArticle 3\nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 19, 22.1.2011, p. 19.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 117, 1.5.2012, p. 7.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 113, 25.4.2013, p. 11.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2007/884/EC authorising the United Kingdom to continue to apply a measure derogating from Articles 26(1)(a), 168 and\r\n169 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 346,\r\n29.12.2007, p. 21)\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Implementing Decision of 18 January 2011\r\namending Decision 2007/884/EC authorising the United Kingdom to continue to\r\napply a measure derogating from Articles 26(1)(a), 168 and 169 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 19, 22.1.2011, p. 11)\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2004) 728 final\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the\r\nharmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes -\r\nCommon system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145,\r\n13.6.1977, p. 1)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
