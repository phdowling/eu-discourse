Judicial cooperation needs to be founded on mutual trust\nand confidence between the different judicial systems and the perception that\nthe rights of suspects or accused persons are not respected in every instance\nhas a disproportionately detrimental effect on mutual trust and, in turn, on\njudicial cooperation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, the\nStockholm Programme[1]\nput a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in\ncriminal proceedings. In its point 2.4, the European Council invited the\nCommission to put forward proposals, setting out a step by step approach to\nstrengthening the rights of suspects or accused persons by setting common\nminimum standards on fair trial rights.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures have already\nbeen adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 20 October 2010 on the right to interpretation and translation in\ncriminal proceedings[2],\nDirective 2012/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May\n2012 on the right to information in criminal proceedings[3] and Directive 2013/48/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on the right of\naccess to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and in European arrest warrant\nproceedings, and on the right to have a third party informed upon deprivation\nof liberty and to communicate with third persons and with consular authorities\nwhile deprived of liberty[4].\nMeasures on the protection of vulnerable persons suspected or accused in\ncriminal proceedings are presented as a package with the present initiative,\ntogether with a Directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused\npersons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant\nproceedings.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the Commission\npublished, on 14 June 2011, a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice\nlegislation in the field of detention to reflect on ways to strengthen mutual\ntrust and the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the area of\ndetention, in accordance with and within the limits of the EU's competence.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the whole\nexercise of the Commission's agenda on procedural rights is to ensure the respect\nof the right to a fair trial in the European Union. The principle of presumption\nof innocence, together with its related rights, contributes to ensuring the\nright to a fair trial. Various rights of suspects or accused persons in\ncriminal proceedings established by the above-mentioned EU Directives over the\npast few years, such as the right to interpretation and translation, the right\nto information and the right to access to a lawyer are not objectives\nthemselves. They have a wider aim; they are rather tools to materialise the\nprinciple of the right to a fair trial. Presumption of innocence and its\nrelated rights contribute to it. In case of persistent breach of presumption of\ninnocence in the Member States, the objectives of the procedural right's agenda\ncould not be fully achieved.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is for this reason\nthat, in the Stockholm Programme, the European Council expressly invited the\nCommission to address the issue of presumption of innocence.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission made a\nthorough examination of the issue in its impact assessment and concluded that a\nmeasure on certain aspects of presumption of innocence is needed to strengthen\nthis fundamental right. The overarching objectives of the measures already\nadopted in the area of procedural rights in criminal proceedings, including its\nkey instrument which is the Directive on the right to access to a lawyer, still\nrequire that a certain minimum level of protection of the principle of\npresumption of innocence is guaranteed in all EU Member States.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This proposal is based on\nArticle 82(2) TFEU. That Article provides that, \u2018[t]o the extent necessary to\nfacilitate mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions and police\nand judicial cooperation in criminal matters having a cross-border dimension,\nthe European Parliament and the Council may, by means of directives adopted in\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, establish minimum rules.\nSuch rules shall take into account the differences between the legal traditions\nand systems of the Member States.\nThey shall concern:\n(a) mutual admissibility of evidence\nbetween Member States;\n(b) the rights of individuals in\ncriminal procedure;\n(c) the rights of victims of crime;\n(d)[\u2026].\u2019\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current proposal will\nalso contribute to strengthening the legal safeguards that protect individuals\ninvolved in proceedings conducted by the European Public Prosecutor's Office.\nThe recently presented Proposal for a Council Regulation[5] clarifies that the suspected\nperson has all rights granted by EU legislation as well as other rights which\nderive directly from the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion (\"the Charter\"), to be applied in accordance with applicable\nnational law, and it explicitly refers to the right to be presumed innocent. By\nintroducing strengthened standards on presumption of innocence in the current\nproposal, the procedural safeguards applying before the European Public\nProsecutor's Office are also reinforced.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6(3) of the Treaty\non European Union (\"TEU\") provides that fundamental rights, as\nguaranteed by the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n(\"the ECHR\") and as they result from the constitutional traditions\ncommon to the Member States, constitute general principles of EU law. Article\n6(1) TEU provides that the European Union recognises the rights, freedoms and\nprinciples set out in the Charter, which has the same legal value as the TFEU\nand the TEU. The Charter is addressed to EU institutions and Member States when\nthey implement EU law, such as in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal\nmatters in the European Union.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 47 of the Charter\nstipulates the right to a fair trial. Article 48 guarantees the right to be\npresumed innocent and has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by\nArticle 6(2) of the ECHR[6].\nArticle 6(2) of the ECHR stipulates that everyone charged with a criminal\noffence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. Article 11(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nsafeguards this principle by the same wording. Article\n14(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\"ICCPR\")[7] contains a very similar\nprovision.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Court of Human\nRights (ECtHR) has clarified the scope of Article 6 of the ECHR. The Court has\nrepeatedly held that it applies as well to the pre-trial stage of criminal\nproceedings[8]\nand that suspects or accused persons have the rights under Article 6 of the ECHR\nat the initial stages of police questioning[9].\nThe Court has also ruled that these guarantees must apply to witnesses whenever\nthey are in reality suspected of a criminal offence, as the formal\nqualification of the person is immaterial[10].\n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The principle of\npresumption of innocence has been developed over the years. The ECtHR has held\nthat Article 6(2) of the ECHR encompasses three key requirements[11]: the right not to be publicly presented\nas convicted by public authorities before the final judgment[12], the fact that the burden of\nproof is on prosecution and that any reasonable doubts on guilt should benefit\nthe accused and the right of the accused to be informed of the accusation. The\nECtHR also recognises the existence of a clear link between the presumption of\ninnocence and other fair trial rights, in the sense that when such rights are\nbreached, the presumption of innocence is inevitably also at stake: the right\nnot to incriminate one-self, the right not to co-operate and the right to\nsilence[13]\nand the right to liberty (and not to be placed in pre-trial detention)[14].\n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to be present at\ntrial is an essential right of defence. The right of the accused person to\nappear in person at the trial is part of the right to a fair trial provided for\nin Article 6 of the ECHR, as interpreted by the ECtHR[15]. Strengthening this right will\ntherefore contribute to reinforce the right to a fair trial.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to be informed of\nthe accusation is covered by the Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to\ninformation in criminal proceedings and is therefore not covered by this\nDirective. Pre-trial detention is the subject of separate initiatives[16] and is therefore not addressed\nin this Directive. All other above-mentioned aspects of the principle of the presumption\nof innocence or related to it are dealt with in this proposal.\n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive lays down\nminimum requirements at EU level governing certain aspects of the right of\nsuspects or accused persons to be presumed innocent, in line with the Stockholm\nProgramme and the ECtHR case law. It thus promotes the application of the\nCharter, and in particular Articles 6, 47 and 48 therein, by building upon\nArticle 6 of the ECHR as interpreted by the ECtHR.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Results of consultations with the\ninterested parties and impact assessment\n18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stakeholders were consulted\non several occasions.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2006 the Commission\npublished a Green Paper[17]\non the presumption of innocence. At that time, 11 Member States replied to the\nconsultation and independent experts and practitioners took this opportunity to\npoint out an erosion of the principle of presumption of innocence and to\nunderline, in particular as regards investigations against non-nationals or\nnon-residents, that a principle of \"presumption of guilt\" seems to be\nmore and more tolerated in national systems.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has also had\ncontact with major stakeholders and has benefitted from consultations on the\nother initiatives attached to this package.\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the meeting of the Expert\nGroup on EU Criminal Policy of 23\nJanuary 2013, the Commission gathered views from academics, practitioners,\njudges, defence lawyers and prosecutors on the topic.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, a meeting with\nRepresentatives of Ministries of Justice of Member States and Croatia specifically devoted to the presumption of innocence was held on 19 February 2013.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to this, in the\nframework of the study carried out for the preparation of the Impact Assessment\naccompanying this proposal, an on-line survey was launched on 27 February 2013\nand published on the DG Justice and EJN website. All major stakeholders were\ninformed about this survey via e-mail and more than 100 responses were received.\nThe survey focused not only on the legal situation as regards the protection of\nthe right to be presumed innocent in the Member States, but above all on its\nfunctioning in practice. The findings of this survey were included in the Annex\nIII of the Impact Assessment accompanying this Proposal. The Impact Assessment\nis available at [http://ec.europa.eu/governance].\nIt has shown that the level of safeguards in Member States' legislation is, in\na general way, acceptable and there does not seem to be any systemic problem in\nthis area. However, there still exist points in which legal safeguards should\nbe improved. Moreover, breaches of presumption of innocence do still occur too\noften across the EU.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific provisions\nArticle 1 \u2014 Subject matter\n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\nDirective is to lay down minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the right\nof suspects or accused persons to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a\nfinal judgment. This Directive covers the following rights: the right not to be\npresented as guilty by public authorities before the final judgment, the fact\nthat the burden of proof is on prosecution and that any reasonable doubts on the\nguilt should benefit the accused, the right not to incriminate one-self, the\nright not to cooperate and the right to remain silent. The right to be present\nat one's trial is also addressed by this Directive.\nArticle 2 \u2014\nScope\n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive applies to\nsuspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings from the very start of the\ncriminal proceedings, even before the time when the suspects are made aware by\nthe competent authorities of the fact that they are suspected or accused of\nhaving committed a criminal offence. It applies until the conclusion of such proceedings,\ni.e. until the final judgement is delivered.\n26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nright to be presumed innocent encompasses different needs and degrees of\nprotection regarding natural persons and legal persons, as recognised in the\ncase law of the Court of Justice on the right not to\nincriminate one-self[18]. This Directive takes into account these differences and therefore\nonly applies to natural persons.\n27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protection\nof the right of legal persons to be presumed innocent is nevertheless ensured\nby the existing safeguards of national and Union legislation, as interpreted by\nnational courts and by the Court of Justice, and by the ECHR as interpreted by\nthe ECtHR.\n28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\n\"step-by-step\" approach of intervention of Union law, in particular\nin the area of rights of individuals in criminal procedure, is therefore kept\nand respected. Future initiatives in this field will be considered depending on\nthe evolution of national legislation and of the case law.\nArticle 3 \u2013 Presumption of innocence\n29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This provision lays down\nthe right to the presumption of innocence.\nArticle 4 \u2014 Public references to guilt\nbefore conviction\n30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECtHR established as\none of the basic aspects of the principle of presumption of innocence the fact\nthat a court or public official may not publicly present the suspects or accused\npersons as if they were guilty of an offence if they have not been tried and\nconvicted of it by a final judgment[19].\nThis principle should furthermore apply, following the ECtHR case law, to all\npublic authorities[20].\nBoth situations might encourage the public to believe that person is guilty and\nprejudge the assessment of the facts by the judicial authority.\n31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nprinciple should be without prejudice to the possibility of publication,\naccording to national law, of decisions imposing sanctions following\nadministrative proceedings.\nArticle 5 \u2013 Burden of proof and standard\nof proof required\n32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presumption of innocence\npresupposes that the burden of proof is on the prosecution and any doubt on the\nguilt should benefit the suspects or accused persons (in dubio pro reo).\nThis presupposes that a court's judgment must be based on evidence as put\nbefore it and not on mere allegations or assumptions. This is without prejudice\nto the independence of the judiciary when assessing the suspect or accused's\nguilt. Furthermore, the ECtHR has admitted that in specific and limited cases the\nburden of proof can be shifted to the defence. This Article reflects the ECtHR principle[21], which is considered as a\ncorrect balance between the public interest (the needs of prosecution) and the\nright of the defence. This Directive is without\nprejudice to the possibilities for the defence to present evidence in\naccordance with the applicable national rules.\nArticle 6 and Article 7 \u2013 Right not to\nincriminate one-self and not to cooperate, right to remain silent\n33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These two Articles\nestablish the right not to incriminate oneself and not to cooperate and the\nright to remain silent. The right not to be compelled to testify against\noneself and not to confess guilt and not to cooperate and the right to remain\nsilent are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart\nof the notion of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR[22]. Their rationale lies, inter\nalia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the\nauthorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice\nand to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 of the ECHR. The \"degree of\ncompulsion\" imposed on suspects or accused persons with a view to compel\nthem to provide information relating to charges against them cannot destroy,\neven for reasons of security and public order, the very essence of their right\nnot to incriminate one-self and their right to remain silent[23]. Article 3 ECHR, on the\nprohibition of torture, as interpreted by the ECtHR, should in any case be\nrespected.\n34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right not to incriminate\none-self is primarily concerned with respecting the will of suspects or accused\npersons to remain silent and, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution\nin a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the suspects or accused\nwithout resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression\nin defiance of the will of the suspects or accused. Moreover, the scope of the\nright is not confined to cases where duress has been brought to bear on the\naccused or where the will of the accused has been directly overborne in some\nway[24].\nIn this sense, according to the ECtHR, the right in question is closely linked\nto the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6(2) of the ECHR.\n35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suspects or accused persons\nshould be promptly informed of their right to remain silent, as according to\nDirective 2012/13/EU. Such information should also refer to the content of the\nright to remain silent and of the consequences of renouncing to it and of\ninvoking it.\n36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any inferences drawn from\nthe fact that suspects or accused persons make use of these rights should be\nexcluded. Without this, the right would be merely illusory if the suspects or accused\nhad to fear that their non-cooperation or their silence will be used against them\nlater in the criminal proceedings. This is the sole way to ensure the effective\nexercise of these rights by suspects or accused persons without a fear that\nsuch exercise can be used against them at a later stage. Therefore, the\nDirective also provides a specific and immediate remedy that any use of\nevidence obtained in breach of these rights is not allowed, save in those very exceptional\ncases where the use of such evidence will not prejudice the overall fairness of\nthe proceedings[25].\n37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that no inferences\nshould be drawn from the exercise of these rights and that the exercise of\nthese rights should not be used against suspects or accused persons at a later\nstage of the criminal proceedings should not prevent Member States from taking\ninto account cooperative behaviour when deciding the concrete sanction to\nimpose.\nArticle 8 and Article 9 \u2013 Right to be\npresent at one's trial\n38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a person is not present\nduring the trial, his right of defence is at stake. The defendant is in such\ncase neither able to give his version of the facts to the Court, nor is able to\npresent evidence accordingly. He might therefore be found guilty without having\nhad the opportunity to rebut the grounds for such a conviction.\n39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to be present at\ntrial, or being able to waive such right after having been informed of it, is\nindispensable for the exercise of the rights of defence.\n40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8 provides that Member\nStates must ensure that the right to be present applies to any trial aiming at\nassessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and\nacquittal decisions). The presence of the suspects or accused at this moment in\nthe criminal proceedings is of particular importance given the consequences that\nmoment could have.\n41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8 stipulates the\nright established by the ECtHR of an accused to be present at the trial and also\nestablishes limited exceptions to this right, in line with the Charter, the ECHR\nand EU law[26].\nProvided that the conditions laid down in Article 8 are respected, nothing\nprevents Member States to make use of \"simplified procedures\" for the\nmost common minor offences. Article 9 establishes that a remedy (as established\nby the ECtHR) in cases where the right to be present at trial has not been\nobserved is an obligation to provide for a re-trial[27].\nArticle 10 \u2013 Remedies\n42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECtHR has consistently\nheld that the most appropriate form of redress for a violation of the right to\na fair trial in Article 6(2) ECHR would be to ensure that suspects or accused\npersons, as far as possible, are put in the position in which they would have\nbeen had their rights not been disregarded[28].\nArticle 11 \u2013Data collection\n43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor and\nevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this Directive, there is a need\nfor collection of data by the Member States with regard to the exercise of the\nrights set out in this Directive. Relevant data include data recorded by the\njudicial authorities and by law enforcement authorities regarding which remedy is applied whenever there has been a breach of\npresumption of innocence and of the right to present at trial.\nArticle 12 \u2013 Non-regression clause\n44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this Article\nis to ensure that setting common minimum standards in accordance with this\nDirective does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member\nStates and that the standards set in the Charter and in the ECHR are\nmaintained. Since this Directive provides for minimum rules, in line with\nArticle 82 TFEU, Member States remain free to set standards higher than those\nagreed in this Directive.\nArticle 13 \u2013 Transposition\n45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article requires that\nMember States must implement the Directive by xx/xx/201x and, by the same date,\ntransmit the text of the provisions transposing it into national law to the\nCommission. Given the simplicity of the transposition measures to be\nimplemented, the Commission does not require explanatory documents to carry out\nits task of overseeing the transposition of the Directive. The individual\ntransposition measures to be notified should be sufficiently self-explanatory.\nArticle 14 \u2013 Entry into force\n46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article provides that\nthe Directive will enter into force on the twentieth day following its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\n47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a significant\nvariation in the legislation of the Member States on the right to be presumed\ninnocent and to all its aspects. Case law of the ECtHR shows that violations of\npresumption of innocence and its related fair trial rights have steadily taken\nplace. This leads to the lack of mutual trust between judicial authorities of\ndifferent EU Member States. As a result, judicial authorities are reluctant to\ncooperate with each other. The impact assessment attached to this proposal\nshows that the ECtHR alone does not ensure a full protection of presumption of\ninnocence: some aspects of presumption of innocence have not been recently or\nextensively considered by the ECtHR, and the redress procedure at the ECtHR intervenes\nonly ex post, after exhaustion of all internal remedies. This Directive will complement\nthe safeguards provided for by the ECtHR and ensure that presumption of\ninnocence is protected from the start of the criminal proceedings, including\nthe possibility of recourse to EU redress mechanisms.\n48.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the proposal\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone as the aim of the\nproposal is to promote mutual trust; it has to be action taken by the European\nUnion, which will establish consistent common minimum standards that apply\nthroughout the whole of the European Union. This has been confirmed by the\nStockholm Programme, in which the European Council invited the Commission to\naddress the issue of presumption of innocence. The proposal will approximate\nMember States\u2019 procedural rules regarding certain aspects of the right to be\npresumed innocent and regarding the right to be present at one's trial in\ncriminal proceedings, the aim being to enhance mutual trust. The proposal\ntherefore complies with the subsidiarity principle.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\n49.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposal complies with\nthe proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum\nrequired in order to achieve the stated objective at European level and what is\nnecessary for that purpose. The proposal only deals with certain aspects of\npresumption of innocence, that are more directly linked to the functioning of\nmutual recognition instruments and to police and judicial cooperation in\ncriminal matters. Furthemore, it is limited to natural persons. This is in line\nwith the \"step-by-step\" approach of EU intervention in the area of\nprocedural rights in criminal matters and the need for proportionate action.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This proposal does not have\nany impact on the EU budget.\n2013/0407 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the strengthening of certain aspects of\nthe presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in\ncriminal proceedings\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(2) (b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[29],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[30],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\npurpose of this Directive is to enhance the right to a fair trial in criminal\nproceedings by laying down minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the\npresumption of innocence and the right to be present at the trial.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nestablishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects\nor accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the trust of Member States\nin the criminal justice systems of other Member States and can thus help to\nfacilitate mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. Such common\nminimum rules should also remove obstacles to the free movement of citizens\nthroughout the territory of the Member States.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Stockholm Programme[31] put a strong focus on the\nstrengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. In its\npoint 2.4, the European Council invited the Commission to put forward proposals\nsetting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects or\naccused persons. The EU agenda on procedural rights is designed to operate as a\nwhole, only when all its components are implemented will its benefits be felt\nin full.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Stockholm Programme\nthe European Council invited the Commission to examine further elements of\nminimum procedural rights for suspects or accused persons, and to assess\nwhether other issues, for instance the presumption of innocence, need to be\naddressed, in order to promote better cooperation in that area.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures have already\nbeen adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil[32],\nDirective 2012/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[33] and Directive 2013/48/EU of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[34].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective should apply only to criminal proceedings. Administrative proceedings\nleading to sanctions such as competition, trade, tax, financial services\nproceedings and other investigations by administrative authorities in relation\nto these proceedings, and also civil proceedings are not covered by this\nDirective.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\nfacilitate the practical application of the right to be presumed innocent and\nall its different aspects and also of the right to be present at one's trial,\nwith a view to safeguarding the right to a fair trial.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\napply to natural persons who are suspected or accused of having committed a\ncriminal offence. It should apply at any stage of the proceedings, even before\nthose persons are made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State, by official notification or otherwise, that they are suspected or accused of\nhaving committed a criminal offence, until the conclusion of such proceedings.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive\nacknowledges the different needs and levels of protection of certain aspects of\nthe right to be presumed innocent as regards natural persons and legal persons.\nSuch protection as regards natural persons is reflected in abundant case law of\nthe European Court of Human Rights. The Court of Justice of the European Union\nhas, however, recognised that the rights flowing from the presumption of\ninnocence do not accrue to legal persons in the same way as to natural persons.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the current state of\ndevelopment of national legislations and of case law at national level and at\nthe level of the Court of Justice it is premature to legislate at Union level\non the right to be presumed innocent of legal persons.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protection\nof the right of legal persons to be presumed innocent should be ensured by the\nexisting legislative safeguards and case law, the evolution of which in the\nfuture should determine an assessment of the need for Union action.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Law\nenforcement or judicial authorities\" for the purposes of this Directive\nrefers to public authorities which, according to national law, exercise powers\nin the realm of criminal proceedings.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The presumption of\ninnocence is violated if, without the accused\u2019s having previously been proved\nguilty according to law, a judicial decision or a public statement by judicial\nor other public authorities presents the suspects or accused persons as if they\nwere convicted.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The burden of proof is on\nthe prosecution, and any doubt should benefit the accused. Thus, the\npresumption of innocence will be infringed where the burden of proof is shifted\nfrom the prosecution to the defence, without prejudice to any possible ex\nofficio fact findings powers of the court and without prejudice to the\nindependence of the judiciary when assessing the suspect's or accused's guilt.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in some cases\nshifting the burden of proof to the defence should not be incompatible with the\npresumption of innocence as long as certain safeguards are guaranteed: it\nshould be ensured that presumptions of fact or law are confined within\nreasonable limits, which take into account the importance of what is at stake,\nand that they are rebuttable, for example by means of new evidence on extenuating\ncircumstances or on a case of force majeure.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right not to\nincriminate oneself and not to cooperate is an important aspect of the\npresumption of innocence. Suspect or accused persons should not be forced, when\nasked to make a statement or answer questions, to produce evidence or documents\nor to provide information which may lead to incriminate themselves.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any compulsion used to\ncompel the suspect or accused person to provide information should be limited.\nTo determine whether the compulsion did not violate those rights, the following\nshould be taken into account, in the light of all circumstances of the case:\nthe nature and degree of compulsion to obtain the evidence, the weight of the\npublic interest in the investigation and punishment of the offense at issue,\nthe existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedure and the use to which\nany material so obtained is put. However, the degree of compulsion imposed on\nsuspects or accused persons with a view to compelling them to provide information\nrelating to charges against them should not destroy the very essence of their\nright not to incriminate one-self and their right to remain silent, even for\nreasons of security and public order.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right not to\nincriminate oneself and not to cooperate should not extend to the use in\ncriminal proceedings of material which may be obtained from the suspect or accused\nperson through the use of lawful compulsory powers but which has an existence\nindependent of the will of the suspects or accused persons, such as material acquired\npursuant to a warrant, material in respect of which there is a legal obligation\nof retention and production upon request, breath, blood and urine samples and\nbodily tissue for the purpose of DNA testing.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to remain silent\nis an important aspect of the presumption of innocence. It should serve as\nprotection from self-incrimination.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right not to\nincriminate oneself and not to cooperate and the right to remain silent should\napply as regards questions material to the offence that someone is suspected or\naccused of having committed and not, for example, as regards questions relating\nto the personal identification of a suspect or accused person.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to a fair trial\nis one of the basic principles in a democratic society. The right of an accused\nperson to be present at the trial is based on that right and should be\nguaranteed throughout the Union.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the right of the\naccused person to be present at the trial is not absolute. Under certain conditions\nthe accused person may, expressly or tacitly but unequivocally, waive that\nright.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under\ncertain well defined conditions which ensure effective compliance with the\nright to a fair trial, it should be possible for a trial resulting in the decision\non guilt or innocence to take place in the absence of the suspect or accused\nperson.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should not\nregulate the forms and methods, including procedural requirements, that are\nused to achieve the results specified as regards the right to be present at\none's trial, which are a matter for the national laws of the Member States.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\nconsidering whether the way in which the information is provided is sufficient\nto ensure the person\u2019s awareness of the trial, particular attention could,\nwhere appropriate, also be paid to the diligence exercised by the person\nconcerned in order to receive information addressed to him or her.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The principle of\neffectiveness of Union law requires that Member States put in place adequate\nand effective remedies in the event of a breach of a right conferred upon\nindividuals by Union law. An effective remedy available in the event of a breach\nof any of the principles laid down in this Directive should have, as far as\npossible, the effect of placing the suspects or accused persons in the same\nposition in which they would have found themselves had the breach not occurred.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of this Directive, Member\nStates should collect data with regard to the implementation of the rights set\nout in this Directive. Such data should include data recorded by law\nenforcement and judicial authorities as regards the remedy applied where there\nhas been a breach of any of the aspects of the right to presumption of\ninnocence covered by this Directive and a breach of the right to be present at\none's trial.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nDirective upholds the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention\nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, including the\nprohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, the right to\nliberty and security, respect for private and family life, the right to the\nintegrity of the person, the rights of the child, integration of persons with\ndisabilities, the right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial,\nthe presumption of innocence and the rights of the defence.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nthis Directive establishes minimum rules, Member States may extend the rights\nset out in this Directive in order to provide a higher level of protection.\nSuch higher level of protection should not constitute an obstacle to the mutual\nrecognition of judicial decisions that those minimum rules are designed to\nfacilitate. The level of protection should never fall below the standards\nprovided by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or the European\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as\ninterpreted in the case law of the Court of Justice and of the European Court\nof Human Rights.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe objectives of this Directive, namely setting common\nminimum rules for certain aspects of the right to presumption of innocence and for the\nright to be present at trial in criminal proceedings, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the\nMember States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the measure, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with Article\n3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in\nrespect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on\nEuropean Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those\nMember States have notified their wish to participate in the adoption and\napplication of this Directive] OR [In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of\nProtocol 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the\nArea of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union\nand to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and without\nprejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking\npart in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to\nits application][35].\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union, Denmark is not taking part in the\nadoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its\napplication,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nSubject matter and Scope\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down minimum rules\nconcerning:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 certain aspects of the right to\nthe presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the right to be present at trial\nin criminal proceedings.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Directive applies to natural persons suspected\nor accused in criminal proceedings until the final conclusion of those\nproceedings.\nCHAPTER 2\nRight to the presumption of innocence\nArticle 3\nPresumption of innocence\nMember States shall ensure that suspects or\naccused persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.\nArticle 4\nPublic references to guilt before conviction\nMember States shall ensure that, before a\nfinal conviction, public statements and official decisions from public\nauthorities do not refer to the suspects or accused persons as if they were\nconvicted.\nMember States shall ensure that appropriate\nmeasures are taken in the event of a breach of that requirement.\nArticle 5\nBurden of proof and standard of proof required\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall ensure\nthat the burden of proof in establishing the guilt of suspects or accused\npersons is on the prosecution.
