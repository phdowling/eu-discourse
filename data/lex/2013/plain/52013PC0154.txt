In 2000 the Council authorised\nthe Commission to negotiate the UNTOC and 'United Nations Firearms Protocol'\n(UNFP) on behalf of the European Community[1]\nin addition to the other Protocols. \nThe Commission actively participated in the\nUN negotiations in Vienna, in close cooperation with its Member States and non-EU G8 countries. Negotiations on the UNTOC were completed in July 2000 while\nfinalisation of the Smuggling and Trafficking Protocols took until October\n2000. The UNGA adopted these three instruments at its 55th session on 15\nNovember 2000 and opened them for signature. Negotiations on the UNFP lasted\nhalf a year longer (until May 2001) and this instrument was adopted by the UNGA\nat its 55th session on 31 May 2001[2]\nand thereafter opened for signature.\nOn 12 December 2000, in Palermo, the\nEuropean Community along with all EU Member States formally signed these three\ninstruments. Authorisation to sign the UNFP was given by the Council in October\n2001[3] and this instrument was\nformally signed by the European Community at the United Nations Headquarters in\n  New York on 16 January 2002.\nThe Union approved the conclusion of the\nUNTOC in April 2004,[4]\nand the Smuggling and Trafficking Protocols in July 2006.\nThe conclusion of the UNFP was left for a later\nstage because it was considered that the Protocol comprised provisions requiring\nthe adoption of new legislation and amendments to existing one. Those\nprovisions would affect Union rules on record-keeping, marking of firearms,\ndeactivation of firearms, requirements for export, import and transit licensing\nor authorisation systems, strengthening of controls at export points and\nbrokering activities.\nIn 2005, the Commission published a\nCommunication on measures for ensuring greater security of explosives,\ndetonators, bomb-making equipment and firearms in the European Union[5] . Directive 2008/51/EC amending Council Directive 91/477 ECC of 18\nJune 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons and\nRegulation (EU) n.258/2012 implementing art.10 of the UN Firearms Protocol and\nestablishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for\nfirearms, their parts and components and ammunition represent the concrete\nfollow-up to this Communication\nThe UNFP entered into force on 3 July 2005.\nTo date, 18 EU Member States have signed it and 16 Member States are\ncontracting parties, which includes 12 Member States that have ratified (Belgium,\nBulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Portugal,\nSweden and Finland) and four Member States that have acceded to it (Spain, Latvia,\nNetherlands and Romania) .\nGeneral context\nThe Council and Commission Action Plan\nimplementing The Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice\nin the European Union[6]\nlisted among its relevant actions a proposal on the conclusion - on behalf of\nthe European Community - of the UNFP. Its successor the Stockholm Programme[7] highlighted the trafficking in\narms as one of the illegal activities that continue to threaten the internal\nsecurity of the European Union and reaffirmed that the Union should continue to\npromote ratification of international conventions (and their Protocols) in\nparticular those developed under the auspices of the United Nations. Firearms'\ntrafficking was also cited in the Internal Security Strategy[8] as one of the forms of\norganised crime which the European Union needed to tackle. \nExisting provisions in the area addressed\nby the proposal\nSeveral EU legal acts have been adopted\naiming at facilitating and eliminating barriers for the transfers of\nconventional arms within the internal market or aiming at regulating the\nexports of conventional arms to third countries:\n\u00b7                        \nCouncil Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on\ncontrol of the acquisition and possession of weapons, as amended.\n\u00b7                        \nOn 12/13 June 2007 the Council adopted a\nRecommendation on a standard procedure in Member States for cross-border\nenquiries by police authorities in investigating supply channels for seized or\nrecovered crime-related firearms, which \u2013 also through use of its annexed\nhandbook - will improve tracing activities and law enforcement cooperation in\nthe field.\n\u00b7                        \nDirective 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008 amending Council\nDirective 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and\npossession of weapons in order to integrate the appropriate provisions required\nby the UNFP as regards intra-European Union transfers of weapons[9]. \n\u00b7                        \nDirective 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament\nand the Council sets the rules and procedures applicable to the intra-community\ntransfers of defence-related products. In its Article 4.1 it provides that 'no\nfurther authorisation by other Member States shall be required for the passage\nthrough Member States or for the entrance onto the territory of the Member State where the recipient of defence-related products is located. \n\u00b7                        \nOn 8 March 2012, the Council adopted Regulation\n258/2012 to combat illicit arms trafficking through improved tracing and\ncontrol of exports of civilian firearms from the European Union, including\nmeasures for imports and transit. This Regulation brings the EU legislation into\nline with Article 10 of the UNFP.[10]\nIt is based on the principle that firearms and related items should not be\ntransferred between states without the knowledge and consent of all states involved.\nIt does not apply to firearms intended for military purposes. It only addresses\ntrade with and transfers from or to countries outside the European Union. \nConsistency with the other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThe conclusion of the UNFP by the European\nUnion is consistent with the current EU policies on measures to counter\ntransnational crimes, to strengthen the fight against illicit trafficking in\nfirearms including their exports control and tracing and to reduce the\nproliferation and spread of small arms around the world.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATION WITH INTERESTED\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nExtensive\nconsultations of different stakeholders have been carried out in parallel to the\nadoption of the European Union laws aiming at adapting Union law to the\nrelevant provisions of the Protocol. An additional Impact Assessment is not\nrequired because this proposal represents the final step in fulfilling an\ninternational obligation, and Union law already complies with the standards set\nout in the Protocol.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL \nSummary of the proposed action\nThis proposal contains a first Article that\napproves the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. The second Article\nauthorises the President of the Council to designate the person empowered to\ndeposit, on behalf of the European Union, the instrument of approval. Annex I\ncomprises the declaration of the extent of the European Union's competence with\nrespect to matters governed by the Protocol, which has to be deposited together\nwith the instrument of approval (Art. 17 (3) Firearms Protocol).\nThe Protocol promotes cooperation among\nStates Parties in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit\nmanufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and\nammunition. The text contains provisions to:\n\u00b7                        \nMaintain detailed records on the import, export\nand in-transit movements of firearms;\n\u00b7                        \nAdopt an international system for marking\nfirearms at the time of manufacture and each time they are imported;\n\u00b7                        \nEstablish a harmonised licensing system\ngoverning the import, export, in-transit movement and re-export of firearms;\n\u00b7                        \nPrevent the theft, loss or diversion of firearms\nthrough the strengthening of export controls, export points and border\ncontrols;\n\u00b7                        \nExchange information regarding authorised\nproducers, dealers, importers and exporters, the routes used by illicit\ntraffickers, best practice in combating trafficking in order to enhance states'\nability to prevent, detect and investigate illicit trafficking in firearms\nLegal basis\nThe Protocol covers issues coming under the\ncompetence of the Union, because they are within the scope of the common\ncommercial policy and because the conclusion of the UNFP is likely to affect EU\nlegal acts or alter their scope (article 3(2) TFEU). Accordingly\nboth Article 114 and Article 207 of the TFEU, are the substantive legal basis\nfor this decision.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions\nThe UNFP is the first global instrument in\nthe fight against transnational organised crime and trafficking in firearms. It\nsets out a very useful multilateral framework and a variety of important\nminimum standards for all participating States. \nThe attached proposal for a Council\nDecision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the UNFP by the\nEuropean Union on the legal basis of Articles 114 and 207\nTFEU, in conjunction with 218(6)(a) thereof. \nThe Commission accordingly proposes that\nthe Council adopt the attached Decision.\n2013/0083 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the conclusion, on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, of the Protocol against the Illicit
