The objective\nof that Regulation is to establish equivalent provisions for sound control of\nmotorcycles and clarifications to the stationary noise measurement test of such\nvehicles.\nAt EU level, Annex I to Directive\n2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the\ntype-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles[3], referring to Chapter 9 of Annex\nI to Directive 97/24/EC on certain components and characteristics of two or\nthree-wheel motor vehicles[4],\nmandates the type approval for two and three-wheel motor vehicles, according to\nmeasurement procedures and limit values for sound levels as laid down in Annex\nI.\nNow that Revision 4 of UNECE Regulation No\n41 has been established, it is appropriate for the Union to apply said\nRegulation.\nThis Council Decision will authorise the\nCommission on behalf of the European Union to notify the application of UNECE Regulation\nNo 41.\n\u00b7                        \nGeneral context\nChapter 9 of Annex I to Directive 97/24/EC lays\ndown the basic requirements for certain components and characteristics of two\nor three-wheel motor vehicles with regard to their type approval. It was deemed\nnecessary to set out the specific sound test procedures and requirements for\nsuch type-approval at EU level.\nIt is now envisaged for the European Union to\napply UNECE Regulation No 41 in order to have common harmonised requirements at\ninternational level, which will facilitate international trade and which will\nreplace the existing approval requirements as set-out in Chapter 9 of Annex I\nto Directive 97/24/EC. This will enable European companies to follow one set of\nrequirements recognised worldwide, i.e. in the countries/Contracting Parties to\nthe Revised 1958 UNECE Agreement.\n\u00b7                        \nExisting provisions in the area of the\nproposal\nChapter 9 of Annex I to Directive 97/24/EC contains\nrequirements for the type-approval of two and three-wheel motor vehicles\n(L-category) with regard to their permissible sound level and exhaust system.\n\u00b7                        \nConsistency with the other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is in line with the objectives\nof Directives 2002/24/EC and 97/24/EC and is therefore consistent with the EU health,\nsafety and environmental objectives and the objective to make progress towards the\ninternational harmonisation of motorcycle legislation.\nFurthermore, the proposal is in line with\nCouncil Decision 97/836/EC with a view to the application by the European\nCommunity of the Revised 1958 Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n \u00b7                         Consultation of interested parties \n In developing the proposal the European Commission has consulted stakeholders and stakeholder organisations. There was a general consultation on the envisaged approach as regards vehicle noise emissions in the framework of the \u2018CARS 21\u2019 process gathering Member States, manufacturers (European and national representatives and individual companies), component manufacturers, transport organisations and user representatives. The proposed approach with respect to the application of UNECE Regulation No 41 will also be presented in the Technical Committee \u2013 Motor Vehicles (TCMV), as well as in the Motorcycle Working Group meeting. \u00b7                         Impact assessment The application of UNECE Regulation No 41 does not lead to a revision of noise emission limits and/or thresholds, as currently set out in Directive 97/24/EC. Furthermore, the testing methods set out in UNECE Regulation No 41 are equivalent in scope and scientific approach to the ones provided for in Directive 97/24/EC. Therefore, the proposed application process is not expected to have societal, environmental and economic impact for the European Union or the EEA due to the overall equivalence of both the testing methods for noise emissions proposed ,as well as the noise emission limits and thresholds involved. Under the framework of the draft proposal for a Regulation (EU) No .../2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles[5], a cost-benefit analysis on noise and tampering in L-cat vehicles (two and three-wheel vehicles) was carried-out[6], which signaled the deterioration of noise emission in L-category vehicles due to tampering. In this respect, UNECE Regulation No 41, apart from its equivalence to EU testing methods and noise emissions limit values, introduces cost-effective anti-tampering elements and measures, thus in full harmony with the on-going legislative initiative for L-cat vehicles. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal will enable the Union to apply UNECE Regulation No 41 on noise emissions from motorcycles and replace the EU\nregional testing requirements with world-harmonised test procedures and\nrequirements.\n\u00b7                        \nLegal basis\nTaking into consideration the the object\nand content of the Council Decision, the legal bases are Articles 114(1) and\n207(4) TFEU The procedure to be followed for the adoption of the Council Decision\nis the one laid down in Article 3(3) of Council Decision 97/836/EC.\n\u00b7                        \nSubsidiarity principle\nSound requirements are already harmonised\nat EU level, but the relevant legislation is outdated and needs updating with\nrespect to technical progress made since its adoption. The application of\ninternational instruments like equivalent UNECE Regulations and their incorporation\ninto the EU system for the type-approval of motor vehicles can only be done by\nthe European Union. This does not only prevent fragmentation of the Internal\nMarket, but also ensures uniform health, safety and environmental standards\nacross the Union. It also offers advantages derived from economies of scale:\nproducts can be made for the whole Union market and even for the international\nmarket, instead of being customised to obtain national type-approval for every\nsingle Member State.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle as it does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the Internal\nMarket while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and environmental\nprotection.\n\u00b7                        \nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Council Decision.\nThe use of a Council Decision is considered\nto be appropriate as in line with the requirements of Article 3(3) of Council\nDecision 97/836/EC.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7                        \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0159 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the application of Regulation No 41 of\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on uniform provisions\nconcerning the approval of motor cycles with regard to noise\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114(1) and 207(4)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[7],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\n97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United\nNations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform\ntechnical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be\nfitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal\nrecognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (\u2018Revised\n1958 Agreement\u2019)[8].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The harmonised\nrequirements of Regulation No 41 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the\nUnited Nations (UN/ECE) \u2014 Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor\ncycles with regard to noise[9]\n(\u2018UNECE Regulation No 41\u2019) are intended to remove technical barriers to the\ntrade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958\nAgreement and to ensure that such vehicles offer a high level of safety and protection.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2002/24/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the\ntype-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles and repealing Council\nDirective 92/61/EEC[10]\nand Directive 97/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June\n1997 on certain components and characteristics of two or three-wheel motor\nvehicles[11]\nand its implementing measures mandate the adoption of permissible sound levels,\nexhaust systems and testing procedures of two and three-wheel motor vehicles.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter 9 of Annex I to\nDirective 97/24/EC contains requirements for the type-approval of L-category\nvehicles with regard to their permissible sound level and exhaust system.\nL-category vehicles is the family name of light\nvehicles such as powered cycles, two or three-wheel mopeds, motor cycles with\nand without sidecar, tricycles and quadricycles.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the date of its\naccession to the Revised 1958 Agreement, the Union acceded to a limited number\nof UNECE Regulations listed in Annex II to Decision 97/836/EC; UNECE Regulation\nNo 41 was not included in that list.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for in Article\n3(3) of Decision 97/836/EC, and pursuant to Article 1(7) of the Revised 1958\nAgreement, the Union may, decide to apply one, some or all of the UNECE\nRegulations to which it has not acceded at the time of its accession to the\nRevised 1958 Agreement.
