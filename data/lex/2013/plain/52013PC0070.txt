Although the final duty\nrates have been slightly revised, the provisional findings were confirmed.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council\nadopt the attached proposal for a Regulation which should be published no later\nthan 15 March 2013.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\nof the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0044 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION \nimposing a\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty\nimposed on imports of certain aluminium foils in rolls originating in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on\nprotection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European\nCommunity[1]('the\nbasic Regulation'), and in particular\nArticle 9,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROVISIONAL\nMEASURES\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, by\nRegulation (EU) No 833/2012[2]\n(\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty ('the\nprovisional measures') on imports of certain aluminium foils in rolls originating\nin the People's Republic of China ('PRC').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\nproceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 9\nNovember 2011 by the European association of Metals (Eurom\u00e9taux)\n('the complainant') on behalf of producers representing\nmore than 50% of the total Union production of certain aluminium foil in\nrolls. The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of the said\nproduct and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered\nsufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. As set out in recital\n(17) of the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury\ncovered the period from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011 (the \u2018investigation\nperiod\u2019 or \u2018IP\u2019). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of\ninjury covered the period from January 2008 to the end of the IP (\u2018the period\nconsidered\u2019).\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSEQUENT\nPROCEDURE\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nto the disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of\nwhich it was decided to impose provisional anti-dumping measures ('the\nprovisional disclosure'), several interested parties made written submissions\nmaking known their views on the provisional findings. The parties who so\nrequested were granted the opportunity to be heard. In particular, one exporting\nproducer requested and was afforded hearings in the presence of the Hearing\nOfficer of the Directorate-General for Trade. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission continued\nto seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive\nfindings.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the publication\nof the provisional Regulation, three of the cooperating Chinese exporting\nproducers stated that their names were incorrectly spelt in Article 1(2) of\nthat regulation. Accordingly, a corrigendum to the provisional Regulation was published\nin the Official Journal of the European Union[3],\nin which the correct names of these companies were set out.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT\nCONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is aluminium\nfoil of a thickness of 0,007 mm or more but less than 0,021 mm, not backed, not\nfurther worked than rolled but whether or not embossed, in low weight rolls of\na weight not exceeding 10 kg (\u2018the product concerned\u2019 or 'aluminium foil in\nrolls' or 'AHF'). The product concerned currently falls within CN codes ex 7607\n11 11 and ex 7607 19 10. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nproduct concerned is generally used as a consumer product for packaging and\nother household/catering applications. The product\ndefinition was not contested. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\nshown that aluminium foil in rolls produced in and exported from the PRC,\naluminium foil in rolls produced and sold in the Union by the Union producers\nand aluminium foil in rolls produced and sold in Turkey (the analogue country) by\nthe cooperating Turkish producer have the same basic physical and technical\ncharacteristics as well as the same basic uses and are therefore considered to\nbe alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any comments\nregarding the product concerned and the like product, recitals (18) to (20) of\nthe provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SAMPLING\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments on sampling, recitals (21) to (26) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market\neconomy treatment (MET)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\nthe provisional disclosure, comments were received from CeDo (Shanghai) Ltd. (\u2018CeDo\u2019) concerning the findings in\nregard to criterion 3. The company in its comments and during a hearing with\nthe Hearing Officer, contested the finding that its decisions on obtaining\nfinancing from abroad were subject to approval of the State and thus created a\ndistortion in its financial situation. CeDo claimed that the Chinese 'Rules for\nthe Implementation of Registration of External Debts' did not have a distortive\neffect on its financial situation as its loan concerned an intra-group loan\nfrom a related company outside China and was based solely on intra-group\nfinancial considerations. The company further claimed that the approval to\ntransfer interest and principal was automatically granted. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having re-examined further\nthe additional information provided by the company and the arguments put\nforward following the provisional disclosure, it was considered that, despite\nthe existence of loan registration and repayment approval requirements, it\ncould be established in this particular case of an intra-group loan that the\nfinancial situation of the company was not subject to significant distortions\ngiven that the company was found to have repaid the interest and principal sum\nin line with the terms of the loan agreement. In these circumstances, the\ncompany is found to meet criterion 3. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments concerning MET, recitals (27) to (53) of the provisional Regulation\nare, subject to the above modification, hereby confirmed.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\ntreatment (IT)\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments on IT, recitals (54) to (56) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue\ncountry\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No party disputed the\nselection of Turkey as an analogue country for the definitive determination.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning the selection of the analogue country, recitals (57) to\n(64) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal\nvalue\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\nnormal value was calculated on the basis of the data provided by the sole\ncooperating producer in the analogue country (i.e. Turkey). Thus, normal value\nwas established on the basis of prices of domestic sales and constructed normal\nvalue of one Turkish producer of the like product. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The company Ningbo Favored\nCommodity Co., Ltd ('Ningbo Favored') questioned how the data of a single\nTurkish producer could be sufficiently representative to establish a dumping\nmargin for the entirety of all Chinese exporting producers, and considered\nsurprising that the domestic prices in Turkey were significantly higher than in\nthe Union. In regard to the Turkish market for aluminium foil, as mentioned in\nrecital (63) of the provisional Regulation, Turkey was considered a suitable\nanalogue country based on volumes and values of domestic production, import and\nexport. In regard to the fact that the prices on the Turkish market are higher\nthan in the Union, this is not a decisive factor in selecting a suitable\nanalogue country market. In any event, the price difference can be partly\nexplained by the fact that the Union industry was close to breakeven during the\nIP. If the Union industry is put in a position whereby it can achieve a\nreasonable profit (i.e. 5% as mentioned in recital (158) of the provisional\nRegulation), the price gap between Turkish prices and prices on the Union market\nwill narrow.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ningbo Favored also\nsubmitted that the institutions did not provide sufficient information on the\nconstructed normal value. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect it is noted that, as explained under recital (70), the Commission\nprovided to the party all relevant information concerning the data used to\ncalculate normal value that could be released without infringing the provisions\nof Article 19 of the basic Regulation, i.e. assuring at the same time that any\nconfidential data provided by the sole Turkish producer is treated as such and\nis not disclosed to other parties. The information provided to the exporting\nproducer was meaningful and offered it the possibility to understand the\nmethodology used in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic\nRegulation. In addition, during a hearing which\ntook place at the request of Ningbo Favored, the company was informed that for\nthe purpose of the dumping calculation full product control numbers (PCNs) had\nbeen used and that in situations where the Turkish producer did not sell the\nexact same product type, the normal value was established by adjusting the\nclosest PCN sold by the Turkish producer. Finally, Ningbo Favored and the other\nsampled Chinese exporters were provided with additional information regarding\nthe establishment of the constructed normal value at the time the disclosure of\nthe final findings was made. The above claims therefore had to be rejected.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments, recitals (65) to (72) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export\nprice\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ningbo Favored requested\nthat the values of the export sales in the transaction-by-transaction listing\nshould be converted from US dollars into Chinese currency using the monthly\nexchange rate supplied in the questionnaire, rather than the actual exchange\nrate at the time of the various transactions. In this respect, in accordance\nwith Article 2(10)(j) 'currency conversions' of the basic Regulation,\nwhen the price comparison requires a conversion of currencies, such conversion\nshall be made using the rate of exchange on the date of sale. It is also noted\nthat, the instructions to the questionnaire provide explicitly that the amounts\nto be used are those in the accounting currency as booked in the accounting\nrecords of the respondent. The company had thus been duly informed of the\nexchange rate to be used. This claim could therefore not be accepted.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe imposition of the provisional measures, an additional verification visit\nwas carried out at the premises of one of the unrelated importers for whom the\nprofit mentioned in recital (75) of the provisional Regulation was established.\nAs a result, the profit margin used in constructing the export prices under\nArticle 2(9) of the basic Regulation decreased. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments, recitals (73) to (75) of the provisional Regulation, subject to the\nabove modification, are hereby confirmed.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No pertinent comments were\nreceived with respect to the comparison. In the absence of any other comments,\nrecitals (76) to (78) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping\nmargins\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No pertinent comments with\nrespect to the dumping margins were submitted. In the absence of any other\ncomments, recitals (79) to (81) of the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of the revision\nof the unrelated importers' profit as mentioned in recital (23) above, as well\nas following the correction of some clerical errors, the definitive dumping\nmargins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty\nunpaid, are as follows:\n Company Name || Dumping margin \n CeDo (Shanghai) Ltd. || 37.4% \n Ningbo Favored Commodity Co., Ltd. || 30.6% \n Ningbo Times Aluminium Foil Technology Co., Ltd. || 32.9% \n Other co-operating companies || 34.9% \n Countrywide dumping margin || 45.6% \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the facts\nstated in recital (81) of the provisional Regulation, the country-wide definitive\ndumping margin for the PRC was established using the most dumped transactions of\nthe cooperating exporters. On this basis, the definitive dumping margin was\nfound to be 45.6%.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production\nand Union Industry\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments\non Union production and Union industry, recital (83) of the provisional\nRegulation is hereby confirmed. \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments on\nUnion consumption, recitals (84) to (86) of the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed. \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\ninto the Union from the PRC\n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments\non the level of imports into the Union from the PRC and market share, recitals\n(87) to (89) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of dumped imports and\nprice undercutting\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nduly explained in recital (47) below, after analysis of the comments received\nfollowing provisional disclosure, it was found appropriate not to apply a level\nof trade adjustment for the comparison between prices of the product concerned\nand aluminium foil produced by Union industry. This change of method slightly\naffected the undercutting margins. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nthe undercutting margin of the CeDo group was reduced by the revision of the\nunrelated importers' profit margin (see recital (23)). However, the weighted\naverage undercutting margin of the sampled exporting producers remains above\n7%. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the exception of the\nabove changes and in the absence of any other comment concerning prices of\ndumped imports and price undercutting, the methodology described in recital\n(90) to (94) of the provisional Regulation to establish price undercutting is\nhereby confirmed.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry and the representative Union producers\n5.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks and data\nrelating to the Union industry \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments in this regard, the provisional findings set out in recitals (95) to\n(107) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. \n5.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magnitude of the actual\ndumping margin\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments\nin this regard, recital (108) of the provisional Regulation is hereby\nconfirmed.\n5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the above, the\nprovisional findings set out in recitals (109) to (112) of the provisional\nRegulation are hereby confirmed. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSALITY\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission received no comments\non the provisional findings concerning the causal link between dumping and\ninjury. It is consequently confirmed that the dumped imports from the PRC\ncaused material injury to the Union industry within the meaning of Article 3(6)\nof the basic Regulation and that there are no other known factors which are as such\nas to break the causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. Therefore, the conclusions as set out in\nrecitals (113) to (136) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION\nINTEREST\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union industry\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments with regard to the interest of the Union industry, recitals (138) to\n(142) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. \n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Importers/wholesalers\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Co-operation\nfrom the importing sector was very low and, as already mentioned in recital\n(146) of the provisional Regulation, only two importers had submitted a\nquestionnaire reply. As mentioned at recital (23) after the imposition of\nprovisional measures, the largest importer (Robinson Young, UK) was visited to verify its questionnaire\nresponse. The verification resulted in a correction of the reported profitability of this company on its relevant\nactivities. As a consequence, the weighted average profit margin of the two\ncooperating sampled importers went down. However,\nthe reduction in profit of the co-operating importers was not considered to be\nsignificant in terms of the Union interest analysis because both profit rates\n(before and after the correction) were moderate.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the sampled\nimporters contested the preliminary conclusion summarized in recital (148) of\nthe provisional Regulation that the impact of the measures on the importing\nsector as a whole would not be disproportionate as it could be forced to exit\nthe market if the measures would be confirmed. However, in the provisional\nRegulation it was indeed concluded that the Union industry might win back some\ncontracts to the detriment of the importing sector. However, there is no doubt\nthat imports of the product concerned will continue to serve the Union market,\nalbeit now on the basis of fair competition and, therefore, possibly on a\nsmaller scale. In view of that, it is confirmed that the overall impact on the\nimporting sector is not disproportionate.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No further comments or\ninformation were received regarding the interests of importers or wholesalers. Therefore\nthe provisional findings in recitals (143) to (149) of the provisional\nRegulation on the interest of these groups are hereby confirmed. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retailers and Consumers\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments\nconcerning the interest of retailers and consumers, recitals (150) to (153) of\nthe provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nprovisional findings concerning Union interest are confirmed, i.e. there are no\ncompelling reasons against the imposition of definitive measures on imports of certain\naluminium foils in rolls originating in the PRC.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING\nMEASURES\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\ndisclosure of the provisional findings, Ningbo Favored made a submission\nconcerning the methodology employed to calculate the injury margins. The\ncompany claimed that the adjustments made to the PCN structure had created an\nimbalance. In particular, it claimed that packaging costs were probably\nresponsible for distorting the data. A second issue concerned the method\nemployed to ensure fair comparison in terms of level of trade. At the\nprovisional stage the Union data was split between retail and wholesale sales\nchannels, however, Ningbo Favored argued that this created two target prices\nper product type which it said would be unlawful.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With reference to the claim\non the adjustment made to the PCN structure, simulations have shown that\ndistortions would take place in case no adjustment was made. Those changes to\nthe PCN structure (which were in effect a consolidation of data to improve\nmatching rates and representativity) had removed distortions and improved the\nreliability of the calculations. Therefore, this claim has to be rejected.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second issue raised by the Ningbo Favored, regarding\nthe method provisionally employed to ensure fair comparison in terms of level\nof trade, was also duly analysed. In this respect it was found that although\nprices usually differed between the two sales channels, no identifiable or\nconsistent pattern was present in the current case. Indeed, in certain\ninstances, the producer sale prices to retailers would be lower than those to\nwholesalers whereas in other cases, the opposite would be the case. It was\ntherefore decided to accept this claim that no level of trade adjustment should\nbe made because the conditions for such adjustment were not met. Consequently,\nthe definitive calculations of the injury elimination levels have been done on\nthe basis of consolidated prices of both the exporting producers and the Union industry,\nmaking no adjustment for level of trade. This\nchange in methodology slightly affected the injury margins.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to the\ndefinitive disclosure Ningbo Favored argued that the method used to calculate\nunderselling was flawed and unreliable because, on the Union industry side, its\nstarting point was the Union sales price per PCN rather than the cost of\nproduction per PCN. Ningbo Favored concluded that the COP per PCN was not used because\nthe Commission officials \"did not urge\" the company to provide the\nrelevant data and the proceeding should therefore be terminated because of a \"lack\nof evidence\".\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the basic\nRegulation does not prescribe how Union industry's target price should be\nestablished. It is common practice to do this either on the basis of cost of\nproduction per PCN plus target profit, or by using the ex-works sales prices\nper PCN to unrelated customers on the Union market and adjusting those by the\nactual profit/loss made during the IP and by adding the established target profit.\nIt is noted that both methods are reliable and they may be used interchangeably\n(depending on the circumstances). In the investigation, the second method (i.e.\non the basis of actual Union sales prices to unrelated customers) was employed\nbecause not all the sampled Union producers were able to calculate a reliable COP\nper PCN. \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the allegation\nthat the method adopted is unreliable and the claim that the proceeding should\ntherefore be terminated are rejected. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CeDo Group claimed that\nthe methodology used for calculating its provisional injury margins was not\ncorrect because it did not fully take into account the structure of the Cedo\nGroup. Indeed the importer CeDo UK, related to a sampled co-operating exporting\nproducer (\"CeDo (Shanghai)\"), supplies the Union market with foil\nproduced in both the PRC and the Union, all channelled via a related importer/trader.\nThe company claimed that SGA of this related importer and a profit margin\nshould not have been deducted from CeDo resales price as competition takes place\nat the level of customers in the EU. CeDo sales prices at customers' level, it\nclaimed, would not be injurious to the Union industry.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CeDo's assertion regarding\nits sales prices vis-\u00e0-vis those of the Union industry was challenged by\nseveral submissions from complaining Union producers. However, this issue could\nnot be further investigated because the information submitted by the parties could\nnot be verified at such a late stage of the investigation. \n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nsubstance, it should be noted that the purpose of calculating an injury margin\nis to determine whether applying to the CIF price of the dumped imports a lower\nduty rate than the one based on the dumping margin would be sufficient to\nremove the injury caused by the dumped imports. This assessment should be based\non the CIF price of the imports in question, which is considered to be a level\ncomparable to the Union industry ex-works price. In the case of imports made\nvia related importers, by analogy with the approach followed for the dumping\nmargin calculations, which the injury margin calculations could subsitute for\nthe determination of the duty rate in application of the lesser-duty rule, the\nCIF price is constructed on the basis of the resales price to the first\nindependent customer duly adjusted pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic\nRegulation. Second and without prejudice to the latter observations, it should\nbe noted that the methodology advocated by CeDo would lead to the inevitable\nuse of prices relating to the Union production by CeDo of aluminium foil since,\nas mentioned above, the related importer/trader supplied the Union market with\naluminium foil produced both in China and the Union. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CeDo returned to the above\nissue at the definitive stage. It also requested to be heard by the Hearing\nOfficer of the Directorate-General for Trade and a hearing was organised to\ndiscuss the matter. CeDo reiterated its previous arguments and also challenged\nthe above explanation concerning Article 2(9), stating that Article 2(9) appears\nunder the dumping provisions of the basic Regulation and could not be used by\nanalogy for calculating injury. The institutions pointed out that although\nArticle 2 deals with dumping issues, Article 2(9) thereunder falls under the\n\"export price\" subchapter and it gives guidance for calculating an\nexport price in case of Union sales via a related importer. No other provision\nin the basic Regulation gives more specific guidance in this regard.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CeDo\nraised the issue of the Kazchrome[4]\njudgment of the General Court which it alleged provided guidance in this\nrespect by stating that the most accurate way of\ncalculating price undercutting would be to compare import prices with the\nprices of goods of the Community industry by including all the costs incurred\nup until the customers' premises. However, it should be\nnoted that the Court also acknowledged that this approach is not practical and\nthe judgment makes clear that CIF prices are an acceptable methodology in\ncalculating injury margins. In addition, the Kazchrome case related to a\nspecial situation involving goods which entered the EU market first through Lithuania (in transit) and then to Rotterdam where they were customs cleared. In that case, the\nCommission had decided to calculate undercutting and underselling on the basis\nof the price at the point of transit, as opposed to the price after customs\nclearance. This is not the case in the current investigation where it is not\ndisputed that the underselling and the undercutting calculations are based on\nCeDo's CIF price after customs clearance. Furthermore, in the Kazchrome\njudgment the Court clearly restricted its conclusions to that specific case.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CeDo also raised the issue\nof fair comparison and quoted two WTO Panel Reports[5]. The institutions are satisfied\nthat CeDo's prices as established by the Commission services and the ex-works\nUnion industry prices (both for undercutting and underselling) provide the\nbasis of a fair and reasonable comparison. It should be remembered that a\nperfect comparison would mean that only bids for the same contract should be\ntaken into account because only then would the conditions of sale be identical.\nAs a perfect comparison is not possible here the institutions are satisfied\nthat its methodology (which uses average prices collected for similar products\nover the period of a one year IP) is fair. This methodology has been clearly\ncommunicated by disclosure.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it is\nconsidered that the method advocated by CeDo would lead to unequal treatment in\nthe calculation of its margins and those of other sampled exporting producers\nselling to independent importers. The methodology employed for the other\nsampled exporting producers was based on an export price at CIF level which of\ncourse excludes Union SGA and profit for resale in the Union after customs\nclearance. The Commission considers that the establishment of the relevant\nimport price for undercutting and underselling calculations should not be\ninfluenced by whether the exports are made to related or independent operators\nin the Union. The methodology followed by the Commission ensures that both\ncircumstances receive equal treatment. Lastly, as already mentioned in recital\n(53) above, the approach requested by CeDo would, in particular in the\ncircumstances of this company, confuse and blur the two distinct qualities in\nwhich Cedo operates as a supplier of aluminium foil to the Union market.\nIndeed, Cedo supplies the Union market, first, as a producer located in the\nUnion and, second, as a reseller of alumium foil imported from China. The purpose of the injury margin calculations is not to measure to what extent the\nsales of CeDo UK, as a Union importing producer, are causing injury to the\nUnion producers but rather whether the exports from CeDo Shanghai have such\neffect through undercutting and underselling the prices of Union producers. To\nthat end, the relevant price to be taken into account is the price at which the\nproduct concerned is sold to the Union, and not the price at which the imported\nmaterials are then resold by importing producers in the Union. This is\nconsistent with the approach taken when calculating the injury margin\nattributable to imports made by domestic producers in the Union.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, it should be\nstated that the Union producers' prices have been adjusted to an ex-works level\nby deducting mot only credit notes, discounts and rebates but also commissions\n(a form of selling cost) and transport related expenses. Hence comparing the\nimporter's resale price with a Union ex-works price would not be a fair\ncomparison.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the reasons stated\nabove, it was mantained that the claim to revise the methodology to calculate\nCeDo's injury margin could not be accepted.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the revised\nunrelated importers profit margin (modified for the reasons explained in recital\n(23) above) had an impact on the injury margin of CeDo, as this is deducted\nfrom its resales price. Finally, all underselling margins were affected by the\ncorrection of a minor clerical error in the application of the target profit at\nthe provisional stage. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nthe definitive injury margins are as follows: \n Company Name || Underselling \n CeDo (Shanghai) Ltd. || 14.2% \n Ningbo Favored Commodity Co. Ltd. || 14.6% \n Ningbo Times Aluminium Foil Technology Co., Ltd || 15.6% \n Weighted average for other co-operators || 14.6% \n Residual || 35.6% \n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, and in\naccordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping\nduty should be imposed on imports of certain aluminium foils in rolls originating\nin the PRC at the level of the lower of the dumping and\ninjury margins found, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. In this case,\nthe duty rate should accordingly be set at the level of the injury margins found.\n\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nthe rate at which such duties will be imposed are set as follows: \n Company Name || Dumping margin || Injury elimination margin || Anti-dumping Duty Rate \n CeDo (Shanghai) Ltd. || 37.4% || 14.2% || 14.2% \n Ningbo Favored Commodity Co. Ltd. || 30.6% || 14.6% || 14.6% \n Ningbo Times Aluminium Foil Technology Co. Ltd. || 32.9% || 15.6% || 15.6% \n Other co-operating companies || 34.9% || 14.6% || 14.6% \n Countrywide dumping margin || 45.6% || 35.6% || 35.6% \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nindividual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were\nestablished on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.\nTherefore, they reflect the situation found during that investigation in\nrespect to these companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide\nduty applicable to 'all other companies') are thus exclusively applicable to\nimports of the products originating in the PRC and produced by the companies\nand thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imports of the product\nconcerned manufactured by any other company not specifically mentioned in the\noperative part of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities\nrelated to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and\nshall be subject to the duty rate applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise the\nrisks of circumvention due to the high difference in the duty rates, it is\nconsidered that special measures are needed in this case to ensure the proper\napplication of the anti-dumping duties. These special measures include the\npresentation to the Customs authorities of the Member States of a valid commercial\ninvoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in the Annex to this\nRegulation. Imports not accompanied by such an invoice shall be made subject to\nthe residual anti-dumping duty applicable to all other exporters. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should the exports by one\nof the companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates increase\nsignificantly in volume after the imposition of the measures concerned, such an\nincrease in volume could be considered as constituting in itself a change in\nthe pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures within the meaning of\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In such circumstances and provided the\nconditions are met an anti-circumvention investigation may be initiated. This\ninvestigation may, inter alia, examine the need for the removal of individual\nduty rates and the consequent imposition of a country-wide duty. \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of an individual anti-dumping duty rate (e.g. following a change in\nthe name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales\nentities) should be addressed to the Commission[6]\nforthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the\ncompany\u2019s activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated\nwith, for instance, that name change or that change in the production and sales\nentities. If appropriate, this Regulation will then be amended accordingly by\nupdating the list of companies benefiting from individual anti-dumping duty\nrates.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure a proper enforcement of the anti-dumping duty, the country-wide\nduty level should not only apply to the non-cooperating exporting producers but\nalso to those producers which did not have any exports to the Union during the\nIP.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure equal treatment between any new exporters and the cooperating\ncompanies not included in the sample, listed in the table at Article 1(2) below\nat the sample average duty rate of 14,6%, provision should be made for the\nweighted average duty imposed on the latter companies to be applied to any new\nexporters which would otherwise be entitled to a review pursuant to Article\n11(4) of the basic Regulation as that Article does not apply where sampling has\nbeen used.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\nparties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of\nwhich it was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping\nduty on imports of certain aluminium foils in rolls\noriginating in the PRC and the definitive collection of\nthe amounts secured by way of the provisional duty (final disclosure). All\nparties were granted a period within which they could make comments on this\nfinal disclosure. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The oral and written\ncomments submitted by the interested parties were considered and taken into\naccount where appropriate.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF\nTHE PROVISIONAL DUTY\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the magnitude of\nthe dumping margins found and in the light of the level of the injury caused to\nthe Union industry, it is considered necessary that the amounts secured by way\nof the provisional anti-dumping duty, imposed by the provisional Regulation\nshould be definitively collected.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the definitive duties\nare higher than the provisional duties, only the amounts secured at the level\nof the provisional duties should be definitively collected, while the amounts\nsecured in excess of the definitive rate of anti-dumping duties should be\nreleased. \nHAS\nADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.

If no such invoice is presented, the duty applicable to \"all\nother companies\" shall apply.\n4. Unless otherwise specified, the\nprovisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply. \nArticle 2\nAmounts secured\nby way of provisional anti-dumping duty pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 833/2012\nshall be definitively collected.
