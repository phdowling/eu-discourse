However, it is necessary to ensure, at European level, clarity and\r\nuniformity in this regard, thus providing legal certainty for operators as well\r\nas avoiding any distortion of competition resulting from differing approaches\r\nand rules.\nThe vast majority of jet fuel imports to\r\nthe European Union (EU) originates in countries that benefit from the Generalised\r\nScheme of Preferences (GSP) and are, thus, duty free. This has a significant\r\nimportance for the EU air industry.\nFollowing the revision of the GSP scheme,\r\nregarding the preferences that will apply as of 1 January 2014, large exporting\r\nproducers of jet fuel such as the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) will\r\ncease to be beneficiaries of this preferential access to the EU, whereas others\r\n(India), at least for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 will not\r\nbenefit from the GSP for some categories of products, including fuel. \nThe imposition of customs duties on jet\r\nfuel from those suppliers would likely have an abrupt impact on the price of\r\njet fuel on the EU market in the absence of a diversification of the sourcing\r\nof jet fuel for the EU market. Moreover, refineries in the EU would not be able\r\nto increase production of aviation fuel to any significant degree at short\r\nnotice, since this implies producing other derivative products, such as\r\ngasoline for which new exports opportunities would need to be explored. Both\r\nthe EU air and oil industry sector therefore need time to adjust to the\r\nconsequences of the graduation of these supplier countries from GSP status. \nTaking into account possible future changes\r\nin the market situation, the suspension should be reviewed on the basis of\r\nproportionate assessment within five years.\nIn the light of the foregoing it is\r\nproposed to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 accordingly.\nThe proposal to prolong the status-quo is\r\nin line with the Union's policies. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH\r\nTHE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group, in\r\nwhich the competent authorities of all Member State are represented, was\r\nconsulted.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\r\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal will follow an inter-service\r\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\r\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the TFEU,\r\nautonomous tariff rate is fixed by the Council acting by qualified majority on\r\nthe basis of a Commission proposal. \nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle given that, as foreseen in the Treaty, it promotes\r\ntrade between Member States and third countries and balances the commercial\r\ninterest of economic operators (service providers in the Union, users and\r\nconsumers) without changing the EU WTO schedule.\nThe subsidiarity principle does not apply, as\r\nthe proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThere is no loss in the revenues of the\r\nTraditional Own Resources against the current situation. There is a potential\r\nnon-realisation of additional revenues in view of the changes of the GSP status\r\nof certain third countries as of 01 January 2014. However, in view of bilateral\r\naviation agreements currently applied that provide for duty relief to aviation\r\nfuel, the possible loss of additional revenue in Traditional Own Resources as\r\nof 01/01/2014 is considered to be negligible.\n2013/0341 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No\r\n2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs\r\nTariff\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union (EU)\r\nmarket for jet fuel depends considerably on imports of jet fuel from third\r\ncountries. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although bilateral\r\naviation agreements between Member States and third countries typically include\r\nprovisions concerning duty relief for jet fuel, it is necessary to lay down\r\ncommon rules on duty relief for jet fuel in order to ensure clarity and\r\nuniformity in this regard, provide legal certainty for operators and avoid any\r\ndistortion of competition resulting from differing practices and rules.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, a significant\r\npart of jet fuel imports to the Union originates in countries that benefit from\r\nthe scheme of generalised tariff preferences or have preferential access to the\r\nUnion market, and thus the imports are duty free. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the application of\r\ntariff preferences in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 978/2012[1] starting from 1 January 2014, a\r\nnumber of countries which are important exporters of jet fuel will cease to be beneficiaries\r\nof this preferential access to the Union market, and certain other exporting\r\ncountries will not benefit from this preferential access for certain product\r\ncategories, including fuel[2].\r\n\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The imposition of customs\r\nduties on jet fuel from those suppliers would likely cause an increase in the\r\nprice of jet fuel on the Union market as it is not economically viable for refineries\r\nin the Union to increase their production of aviation fuel to any significant\r\ndegree.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account\r\npossible future changes in the market situation of jet fuel, this measure\r\nshould be reviewed on the basis of a proportionate assessment within five\r\nyears.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore appropriate\r\nto suspend the autonomous rate of customs duty for jet fuel. The suspension\r\nshould cover all products falling within CN code 2710 19 21.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex I to Council\r\nRegulation (EEC) No 2658/87[3]\r\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87,\r\nthe text for CN code 2710 19 21 in column 3 of the table in Part Two, Section\r\nV, Chapter 27, is replaced by the following:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20184,7 (*) \n_________________\n(*)\r\nAutonomous rate of duty: Free.\u2019\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1\r\nJanuary 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nLEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT\nNAME OF THE PROPOSAL:\nProposal for a Council Regulation\r\namending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the Tariff and Statistical\r\nNomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.\nBUDGET LINES:\nChapter and Article: Chapter 12,\r\nArticle 120\nAmount\r\nbudgeted for the year 2014: 18.086.400.000 \u20ac (DB 2014)\nFINANCIAL IMPACT:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial impact\r\non expenditure but it may have a potential financial impact, yet of negligible\r\nnature, for the following reasons:\nIn\r\n2012, the total value of imports of CN code 2710 19 21 amounted to 12,2 Billion\r\n\u20ac[4]. The conventional rate of duty\r\nfor this CN code is 4,7%. \nThe\r\nvast majority of these imports (above 97%) were duty free as a result of the\r\nimplementation of Free Trade Agreements and the GSP.\nAs\r\nof 1/1/2014 a number of important exporting countries (accounting for 82% of\r\nimports) will no longer benefit from the GSP. This could evenually represent a\r\npotential revenue intake of approxiamtely 470 Mio \u20ac for Traditional Own\r\nResources.\nHowever,\r\nthere exists currently more than 1 500 Air transport agreements between EU or\r\nMember States and third countries and Member States have issued national\r\nprovisions for the stores of aircraft.\nIn\r\nview of this score of Member States measures that provide for duty relief to\r\naviation fuel, the possible loss of the additional revenue in Traditional Own\r\nResources as of 01/01/2014 is considered to be negligible.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 applying a scheme of\r\ngeneralised tariff preferences and repealing Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 732/2008 (OJ L 303, 31.10.2012, p.1).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) of\r\n17 December 2012 suspending the tariff preferences for certain GSP beneficiary\r\ncountries in respect of certain GSP sections in accordance with Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council applying a\r\nscheme of generalised tariff preferences (OJ L 348, 18.12.2012, p.11). \n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987\r\non the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ\r\nL 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Source Eurostat \u2013 Statistical procedure: Normal \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
