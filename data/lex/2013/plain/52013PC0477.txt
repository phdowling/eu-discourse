The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 9 August 2012, the Commission initiated a partial interim review limited to the level of subsidisation of the countervailing duty in force in respect of imports of certain stainless steel bars and rods originating in India. The review was initiated because the applicant, an exporting producer in India, provided sufficient prima facie evidence - that the circumstances with regard to subsidisation on the basis of which measures were established have changed and that these changes are of a lasting nature. The partial interim review investigation confirmed that (i) the level of subsidisation with regard to the concerned co-operating Indian producer has decreased; (ii) the actual modalities of the investigated schemes and their countervailiability have not changed with respect to the previous investigation. Since it was demonstrated that the applicant current level of subsidization is below de minimis, the level of the measures should be amended to reflect the new findings. The changed circumstances were found to be of a lasting nature. Therefore, it is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation so as to amend the duty rate applicable to the concerned co-operating Indian producer. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle because the form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. An indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate because the basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0223 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 405/2011\r\nimposing a definitive countervailing duty and collecting definitively the\r\nprovisional duty imposed on imports of certain stainless steel bars and rods\r\noriginating in India \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1] (\u2018the\r\nbasic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after consulting the Advisory\r\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previous\r\ninvestigation and existing countervailing measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April 2011, by Regulation (EU) No 405/2011[2] (\u2018the definitive\r\nRegulation\u2019), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports\r\nof certain stainless steel bars and rods ('SSB') currently falling within\r\nCN codes 7222 20 21, 7222 20 29, 7222 20 31, 7222 20 39, 7222 20 81 and 7222 20\r\n89 and originating in India. The investigation, which led to the adoption of the\r\ndefinitive Regulation, is hereinafter referred to as 'the original\r\ninvestigation'. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ndefinitive measures consisted of ad valorem countervailing duties,\r\nranging between 3.3% and 4.3% imposed on imports from individually named\r\nexporters, a 4.0% duty rate imposed on non-sampled cooperating companies and a\r\nresidual duty rate of 4.3% imposed on all other companies in India. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\r\nof a partial interim review\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\nrequest for a partial interim review was lodged by Viraj Profiles Vpl. Ltd., an\r\nexporting producer located in India ('the applicant'). The request was limited\r\nin scope to the examination of subsidisation as far as the applicant was concerned.\r\nThe applicant had provided prima facie evidence that the circumstances with\r\nregard to subsidisation on the basis of which measures were imposed have\r\nchanged significantly and that these changes are of a lasting nature.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having\r\ndetermined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence\r\nexisted to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission\r\nannounced on 9 August 2012, by a notice published in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union[3]\r\n('notice of initiation'), the initiation of a partial interim review, in\r\naccordance with Article 19 of the basic Regulation, limited to the examination\r\nof subsidisation in respect of the applicant. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review\r\ninvestigation period\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nreview investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 July 2011 to 30\r\nJune 2012 ('the review investigation period' or 'RIP').\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties\r\nconcerned by the investigation\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission officially informed the applicant, the Government of India (\u2018the GOI\u2019) and EUROFER as the representative of the Union industry in the original\r\ninvestigation ('the Union industry'), of the initiation of the partial interim\r\nreview investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make\r\ntheir views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set\r\nout in the notice of initiation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nwritten and oral comments submitted by the parties at the stage of initiation were\r\nconsidered and, where appropriate, taken into account.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to obtain the information necessary for its investigation, the Commission\r\nsent a questionnaire to the applicant. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to\r\nthe GOI.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replies\r\nto the questionnaire were received from the applicant and from the GOI. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the\r\ndetermination of subsidisation. Verification visits were carried out at the premises\r\nof the applicant. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT\r\nCONCERNED \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nproduct under review is the same product as the one defined in the original\r\ninvestigation, namely stainless steel bars and rods, not further worked than\r\ncold-formed or cold finished, other than bars and rods of circular\r\ncross-section of a diameter of 80 mm or more, currently falling within CN codes\r\n7222 20 21, 7222 20 29, 7222 20 31, 7222 20 39, 7222 20 81 and 7222 20 89 and originating\r\nin India. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDISATION\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\r\n\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\nthe basis of the information submitted by the GOI and interested parties and\r\nthe replies to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire, the following schemes allegedly used\r\nby applicant were investigated: \n(a)         \r\nExport Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS); \n(b)         \r\nExport Oriented Units Scheme (EOU);\n(c)         \r\nExport Credit Scheme (ECS); \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Schemes (a) and (b) are\r\nbased on the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 (No 22 of\r\n1992) which entered into force on 7 August 1992 ('Foreign Trade Act'). The\r\nForeign Trade Act authorises the GOI to issue notifications regarding the\r\nexport and import policy. These are summarised in a document called 'Foreign\r\nTrade Policy' documents, issued by the Ministry of Commerce every five years\r\nand updated regularly. The Foreign Trade Policy document relevant to the RIP is\r\nthe \u201cForeign Trade Policy 2009-2014\u201d (\u2018FTP 09-14). In addition, the GOI also\r\nsets out the procedures governing the FTP 09-14 in a 'Handbook of Procedures,\r\nVolume I' ('HOP I 09-14'). The Handbook of Procedures is updated on a regular\r\nbasis.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECS scheme specified\r\nunder (c) is based on sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949,\r\nwhich allows the Reserve Bank of India to direct commercial banks in the field\r\nof export credits. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\r\nfollowing the allegation of the Union industry, the Commission investigated\r\nwhether the applicant:\n(a)         \r\nwas benefiting from the Electricity Duty\r\nExemption Scheme (EDES)\n(b)         \r\nwas using local subsidy programmes of the State\r\nof Maharashtra, \n(c)         \r\nwas benefiting from provisions of inputs for\r\nless than adequate remuneration, \n(d)         \r\nwas benefiting from incentives related to power\r\ngeneration and distribution,\n(e)         \r\nwas benefiting from purchases of cheap raw\r\nmaterials from related off-shore companies.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the Commission verified\r\nthat the following schemes investigated in the original investigation: \n(a)         \r\nDuty Entitlement\r\nPassbook Scheme (DEPBS) \n(b)         \r\nAdvanced Authorization Scheme (AAS)\nare still not being used by the applicant. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Findings\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Promotion Capital\r\nGoods Scheme \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation revealed\r\nthat the applicant used this scheme during the RIP. However, it was found that\r\nthe incentives received were insignificant at 0.02%. Therefore, it was\r\nconsiderated that it was not necessary to further evaluate the\r\ncountervailability of this scheme. \n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Oriented Unit Scheme \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that the\r\napplicant had the status of EOU and received the subsidies under this scheme in\r\nthe RIP.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to this scheme\r\nthe company claimed that the Commission should deviate from the method of\r\ncalculation of the benefit received under EOU used in the original\r\ninvestigation. The company argued that certain benefits under EOU scheme should\r\nbe treated as a permissible duty drawback scheme within the meaning of Annex II\r\nand III of the basic Regulation and therefore they should not be\r\ncountervailable. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, since it was found\r\nthat regardless of which method of calculation will be used, the subsidy rate\r\nestablished with respect to this scheme will not exceed 0.22%, leading to an overall\r\nsubsidy margin below de minimis level, it was decided not to analyze\r\nfurther this claim in the context of this review investigation. \n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Credits Scheme \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that the\r\napplicant was not using this scheme in the RIP.\n3.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electricity Duty Exemption\r\nScheme\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation revealed\r\nthat the applicant used this scheme during the RIP. However, it was found that\r\nthe incentives received were insignificant. Therefore, it was considerated that\r\nit was not necessary to further evaluate the countervailability of this scheme.\r\n\n3.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Local Subsidy Programs of\r\nthe State of Maharashtra\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that the\r\napplicant was not using this scheme in the RIP. \n3.2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Others \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not\r\nreveal any other benefits for the applicant in the RIP related to the terms of\r\nraw materials and energy purchases which would involve a financial contribution\r\nof the GOI and could therefore be treated as subsidies within the meaning of\r\nArticle 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, the\r\nallegations of the Union industry listed in the recital (15) points c-e were\r\nfound irrelevant in the context of this review. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AMOUNT\r\nOF COUNTERVAILABLE SUBSIDIES\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nis recalled that the original investigation established the amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies for the applicant, expressed ad valorem, at 4.3%. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\r\nthe RIP, the amount of countervailable subsidies for the applicant, expressed ad\r\nvalorem, resulting from only one subsidy scheme, was found to be 0.22%. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account\r\ntaken of the above, it is concluded that the level of subsidisation with regard\r\nto the applicant exporting producer concerned has decreased.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nwas also examined whether the changed circumstances with regard to the examined\r\nschemes could be considered to be of a lasting nature. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nmentioned above, the findings with regard to the EPCGS scheme during this\r\ninterim review confirmed the findings of the original investigation where the\r\nsubsidy granted under this scheme was found to be insignificant. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\r\nwhile in the original investigation the main benefit to the applicant was\r\nconferred under the EOU scheme, the benefit under this scheme has dropped\r\nduring the RIP. Evidence has been obtained that this change is of a lasting\r\nnature as it relates to the decreased level of customs tariffs on stainless\r\nsteel scrap and ferro-nickel, two main raw materials used by the applicant for\r\nthe production of the product concerned.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COUNTERVAILING\r\nMEASURES\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above there are indications that the applicant\r\nwill continue to receive subsidies in the future of an amount which is below the\r\nde minimis level. Hence, it is considered appropriate to amend the\r\ncountervailing duty rate applicable to the applicant in order to reflect the\r\ncurrent level of subsidisation. Such duty rate is established at 0% for the\r\napplicant.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\r\nregard to the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product\r\nconcerned from exporting producers listed in the Annex to the definitive\r\nRegulation, it is noted that the actual modalities of the investigated schemes\r\nand their countervailability have not changed with respect to the previous\r\ninvestigation. Thus there is no reason to re-calculate the subsidy and duty\r\nrates of these companies. Consequently, the rates of the duty applicable to the\r\ncompanies listed in Annex to the definitive Regulation remain unchanged.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\r\nregard to all other companies\u2019 duty rate, it is noted that in the original\r\ninvestigation its level was set at the level of the highest individual subsidy\r\nmargin found for the sampled companies. That corresponded to the subsidy margin\r\nof the applicant. Given that the margin of the applicant has changed following\r\nthis interim review, the all other companies rate should be revised and set at\r\nthe next highest subsidy margin. Since, the next highest rate is the one\r\napplicable to the companies listed in the Annex, the rate of duty for the all\r\nother companies is set at this level, i.e. 4%. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DISCLOSURE\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nGOI and the other interested parties were informed of the essential facts and\r\nconsiderations upon which it was intended to propose to amend the duty rate\r\napplicable to the applicant. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nwritten and oral comments submitted by the parties were considered and, where\r\nappropriate, taken into account. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\r\ninterested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular\r\nreasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nArticle 1(2) of Council Implementing Regulation\r\n(EU) No 405/2011 shall be replaced by the following:\n\"2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive\r\ncountervailing duty applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price, before\r\nduty, of the product described in paragraph 1 and manufactured by the companies\r\nbelow shall be:\n Company || Duty (%) || TARIC additional code \n Chandan Steel Ltd., Mumbai || 3,4 || B002 \n Venus Wire Industries Pvt.
