The attached\r\nproposal for a Council Regulation is based on the findings that it is not\r\nlikely that injury would reoccur if the measures were allowed to lapse.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council adopt\r\nthe attached proposal for a Regulation terminating the proceeding and repealing\r\nthe existing measures on imports of steel ropes and cables originating in the Russian\r\nFederation.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nThis proposal concerns the application of Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped\r\nimports from countries not members of the European Community. \n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reasons: \nThe form of action is described in the\r\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how the financial and\r\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\r\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\r\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not foresee\r\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\r\nbudget.\n2013/0395 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nrepealing the anti-dumping measures on\r\nimports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Russian\r\nFederation following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\r\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\r\n(the \u2018basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 9(2) and 11(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\r\nthe European Commission ('the Commission') after consulting the Advisory\r\nCommittee,\nWhereas:\nA. PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\r\nin force\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001[2] the\r\nCouncil imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or\r\nsteel ropes and cables (SWR) originating in the Russian Federation, Turkey,\r\nThailand, and the Czech Republic. These measures will\r\nhereinafter be referred to as 'the original measures' and the investigation that\r\nled to those measures will be hereinafter referred to as 'the original\r\ninvestigation'.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission had\r\naccepted in August 2001 a price undertaking offer by a Russian producer (JSC\r\nSeverstal-Metiz). This undertaking agreement was repealed in October 2007[3] because it was considered as\r\nnot workable due to difficulties in the proper classification of the large\r\nnumber of product types exported by the company.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\r\nRegulation (EC) 1279/2007[4] the Council, following partial interim and expiry reviews, maintained\r\nthe original measures for the Russian Federation in accordance with Article\r\n11(2) of the basic Regulation. These measures will hereinafter be referred to\r\nas 'the measures in force' and the expiry review investigation will be\r\nhereinafter referred to as 'the last investigation'. The same Regulation terminated the measures concerning\r\nimports of steel ropes and cables originating in Turkey and Thailand.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currently[5], there are also measures in force against SWR from Ukraine and the\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, which were extended to imports of SWR consigned\r\nfrom Morocco, Moldova and the Republic of Korea. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request for a review\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 27 October 2012, the\r\nCommission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union the initiation of an expiry review ('notice of initiation')[6] of the anti-dumping measures\r\napplicable to imports of SWR originating in the Russian Federation pursuant to\r\nArticle 11(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The review was initiated\r\nfollowing a substantiated request lodged by the Liaison Committee of European\r\nUnion Wire Rope Industries (hereafter referred to as \u2018EWRIS\u2019 or \u2018the applicant\u2019)\r\non behalf of Union producers representing more than 50%, of the total Union\r\nproduction of certain iron or steel ropes and cables. The request was based on\r\nthe grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in\r\ncontinuation of dumping and recurrence of injury to the Union Industry ('UI').\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review investigation period\r\nand period considered\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation of\r\ncontinuation or recurrence of dumping and injury covered the period from 1\r\nOctober 2011 to 30 September 2012 (RIP). The examination of the trends relevant\r\nfor the assessment of a likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of injury\r\ncovered the period from 1 January 2009 until the end of the RIP (period\r\nconsidered).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\r\nproceedings\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\r\nadvised the exporting producers, Union producers, importers and users known to\r\nit as well as the applicant and the authorities of the exporting country.\r\nInterested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in\r\nwriting and to request a hearing within the time-limit set out in the notice of\r\ninitiation. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the potentially\r\nlarge number of exporting producers in the Russian Federation involved in the\r\ninvestigation, sampling was initially envisaged in the notice of initiation in\r\naccordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable the\r\nCommission to decide whether sampling would be indeed necessary and, if so, to\r\nselect a sample, exporting producers from the Russian Federation were\r\nrequested, to make themselves known within 15 days from the initiation of the\r\nproceeding and to provide the Commission with the information requested in the\r\nnotice of initiation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that only two exporting producers in the Russian\r\nFederation provided the information requested in the notice of initiation and\r\nexpressed their willingness to further cooperate with the Commission, it was\r\ndecided not to apply sampling for exporting producers. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission announced in\r\nthe notice of initiation that it had provisionally selected a sample of Union\r\nproducers and invited interested parties to comment thereupon within a deadline\r\nprovided for in the notice of initation. The provisional sample consisted of five\r\nUnion producers that were found to be representative of the Union industry in\r\nterms of volume of production and sales of the like product in the Union.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any comments,\r\nthe proposed companies were selected to be included in the final sample and\r\ninterested parties were accordingly informed. However, one of the finally\r\nselected companies subsequently withdrew from the sample.\r\nThe Commission therefore decided to reduce the sample to the four remaining companies,\r\nwhich were still found to be representative of the Union industry in terms of\r\nvolume of production (29.3%) and sales (20.9%) of the like product in the\r\nUnion. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although\r\nsampling was envisaged in the notice of initiation of unrelated importers, neither\r\nany unrelated importer nor any user came forward. Therefore,\r\nsampling was not applied to unrelated importers.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaires were sent to\r\nthe four sampled Union producers, the two exporting producers in the Russian\r\nFederation, and the related importer.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questionnaire replies\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replies\r\nto the questionnaires were received from the four sampled Union producers, from\r\nthe related importer and from one exporting producer from the Russian\r\nFederation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although two exporting\r\nproducers from the Russian Federation had originally come forward, only one of\r\nthem provided a reply to the questionnaire and is\r\nconsidered to be cooperating in the investigation. The cooperating exporting\r\nproducer has a wholly owned subsidiary based in Italy, which also produces SWR\r\nand imports the product concered from the Russian Federation. The other exporting\r\nproducer provided a submission at the time of the initiation of the\r\ninvestigation and although was invited to fill in a questionnaire, failed to do\r\nso. It is therefore considered that the second exporting producer did not\r\ncooperate in the investigation. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Verification visits\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\r\nverified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of determining the\r\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and of\r\nthe Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the\r\nfollowing companies:\na) Union producers:\n\u2013              \r\nCASAR Drahtseilwerk Saar GmbH, Germany,\n\u2013              \r\nBRIDON International Ltd. United Kingdom,\n\u2013              \r\nTEUFELBERGER Seil GmbH, Austria,\n\u2013              \r\nManuel Rodrigues de OLIVEIRA S\u00e1 & Filhos, S.A.,\r\nPortugal;\nb) Exporting producer in the Russian\r\nFederation:\n\u2013              \r\nJSC SEVERSTAL-Metiz, Cherepovets;\nc) Related importer:\n\u2013              \r\nREDAELLI Tecna SpA, Italy.\nB. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\r\nPRODUCT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nproduct concerned is the same as that in the original investigation and in the\r\nlast investigation, which led to the imposition of measures currently in force,\r\ni.e. iron and steel ropes and cables, including locked coil ropes, excluding\r\nropes and cables of stainless steel, with a maximum cross-sectional dimension\r\nexceeding 3 mm, with fittings attached or not (in industry terminology often\r\nreferred to as 'SWR'), currently falling within CN codes ex 7312 10 81, ex 7312\r\n10 83, ex 7312 10 85, ex 7312 10 89 and ex 7312 10 98 (the 'product\r\nconcerned').\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncurrent expiry review investigation confirmed that SWR produced in the Russian\r\nFederation and exported to the Union, and SWR produced and sold in the Union by\r\nthe Union producers have the same basic physical and technical characteristics\r\nand end uses and are therefore considered to be like products within the\r\nmeaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIKELIHOOD OF A\r\nCONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether dumping was currently\r\ntaking place and whether the expiry of the existing measures would be likely to\r\nlead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above in\r\nrecital (10), it was not necessary to select a sample of exporting producers in\r\nthe Russian Federation. The cooperating exporting producer accounted for 99% of\r\nthe exports of the product concerned from the Russian Federation to the Union\r\nduring the RIP. On this basis, it was concluded that cooperation was high.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since two other known\r\nproducers in the Russian Federation did not cooperate in the investigation, the\r\nfindings on the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping set out\r\nbelow had to be based on the best available facts including Eurostat data, the\r\nRussian official statistics and limited data obtained from a second producer.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\r\nthe RIP \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the request\r\nfor review, the exports from the Russian Federation into the Union were\r\nallegedly dumped at an average margin of 130.8%. As mentioned in the notice of\r\ninitiation (paragraph 4.1), the applicant compared the export prices from the\r\nRussian Federation to the Union (at ex-works level) with the domestic prices in\r\nthe Russian Federation.\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n2(2) of the basic Regulation, it was first established for the cooperating\r\nexporting producer whether its total domestic sales of the like product to\r\nindependent customers in the Russian domestic market were representative, i.e.\r\nwhether the total volume of such sales was equal to at least 5% of the total\r\nvolume of the corresponding export sales to the Union. The domestic sales of\r\nthe like product by the cooperating exporting producer were found to be overall\r\nrepresentative. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, the\r\nCommission identified those types of the like product sold domestically by the\r\nexporting producer which were identical or directly comparable to the types\r\nsold for export to the Union. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was further examined\r\nwhether the domestic sales of the cooperating exporting producer were\r\nrepresentative for each product type, i.e. whether domestic sales of each\r\nproduct type constituted at least 5% of the sales volume of the same product\r\ntype to the Union. For the product types sold in representative quantities it\r\nwas then examined whether such sales were made in the ordinary course of trade\r\n(\u2018OCOT\u2019), in accordance with Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The examination as to\r\nwhether the domestic sales of each product type, sold domestically in\r\nrepresentative quantities, could be regarded as having been made in the OCOT\r\nwas made by establishing the proportion of the profitable sales to independent\r\ncustomers of the type in question. In all cases where the domestic sales of the\r\nparticular product type were made in sufficient quantities and in the OCOT,\r\nnormal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted\r\naverage of all the domestic sales of that type made during the RIP. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the remaining product\r\ntypes where domestic sales were not representative or not sold in the OCOT,\r\nnormal value was constructed in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic\r\nRegulation. Normal value was constructed by adding to the manufacturing costs\r\nof the exported types, adjusted where necessary, a reasonable percentage for\r\nselling, general and administrative expenses and a reasonable margin for\r\nprofit, on the basis of actual data pertaining to the production and sales of\r\nthe like product in the OCOT, in accordance with the first sentence of Article\r\n2(6) of the basic Regulation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For export sales to the\r\nUnion market of the cooperating Russian exporting producer made directly to the\r\nindependent customers, the export price was established on the basis of the\r\nprices actually paid or payable for the product concerned in accordance with\r\nArticle 2(8) of the basic Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the export transaction\r\nwhere the export to the Union was made through a related trading company, the\r\nexport price was established on the basis of the first resale price of the\r\nrelated trader to independent customers in the Union, pursuant to Article 2(9)\r\nof the basic Regulation. Adjustments were made to take account of all the costs\r\nincurred between the importation and resale, and for profit, to establish a\r\nreliable export price. In the absence of information from independent importers\r\nconcerning the level of profits accrued during the RIP, an average profit\r\nmargin of 5% was used.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison between the\r\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price was made on\r\nan ex-works basis and at the same level of trade. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a fair\r\ncomparison between normal value and the export price, account was taken, in\r\naccordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in\r\nfactors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. For\r\nthis purpose, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences\r\nin transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs, financial\r\ncosts, packing costs, commissions and rebates where applicable and justified.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nprovided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average\r\nnormal value by type was compared with the weighted average export price of the\r\ncorresponding type of the product concerned. This comparison showed the\r\nexistence of dumping which amounted to 4.7% for the exporting producer. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Developments of imports\r\nshould measures be repealed\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the analysis of\r\nthe existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of the continuation of\r\ndumping should measures be repealed was also investigated. In this respect the\r\nfollowing elements were analysed: the volume and prices of dumped imports from the\r\nRussian Federation, the attractiveness of the Union market and other third\r\ncountry markets, production capacity and excess capacity for exports in the\r\nRussian Federation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and prices of dumped\r\nimports from the Russian Federation\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\r\nto Eurostat, during the period considered, the imports from the Russian\r\nFederation increased from 2 005 tonnes in 2009 to 2 343 tonnes in the RIP\r\nrepresenting around 1% of the Union consumption in the RIP and in the period\r\nconsidered. As mentioned above in recital (33), the imports from the cooperating exporting producer were made at\r\ndumped prices (4.7%) despite the anti-dumping duty in force.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\r\nmarket and other third country markets\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nexports to the Union constituted 3% of the total sales of the cooperating\r\nproducer, while the majority of the sales (85%) were made on the Russian domestic\r\nmarket. The domestic market grew by 38% in the period considered[7] and may further grow should the GDP of the Russian Federation\r\ncontinue to grow, as forecasted by publically available sources specialising on\r\neconomic analysis. Moreover, the information gathered during the investigation\r\nrevealed that the cooperating producer does not produce all types of the\r\nproduct concerned and therefore its competitive pressure on the Union producers\r\nis limited. This is likely to be the case also for the two other producers in\r\nview of no available information on the investments in new machinery, which\r\ncould for instance allow the production of the product concerned of a bigger\r\ndiameter. Furthermore, the limited competitive pressure of the exporting\r\nproducers from the Russian Federation seems also be confirmed by the presence\r\nof the Union producers on the Russian market. According to the official Russian\r\ncustoms statistics the Union producers' exports of the like product to the\r\nRussian Federation represented 30% of all imports of the like product to the\r\nRussian market in RIP, making of the Union producers the largest exporter on\r\nthe Russian market. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\r\ndisclosure the applicant argued that the projected GDP growth of Russia (in the\r\nrange of 3%) is rather moderate and will not allow for further development of\r\nthe Russian SWR market. Consequently, the Russian market might not be able to\r\nabsorb additional volumes of the like product. In this respect it is noted that\r\nthe Russian GDP growth during the period considered, i.e. from 2009 to the end\r\nof the IP, was lower than the forecasted growth for the year 2014 and\r\nnevertheless allowed for the growth of the SWR market in Russia by 38%.\r\nTherefore the argument has been rejected.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party also pointed\r\nto the new types of products that the cooperating exporting producer has\r\nrecently developed (in cooperation with its subsidiary based in the Union) and\r\nclaimed that this confirms the investments made by this producer in the period\r\nconsidered. This fact however does not contradict the finding on the\r\ncooperating producer\u2019s inability to produce all type of ropes (especially SWR\r\nin the high end of the market). Therefore the argument has been rejected.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The attractiveness of the\r\nUnion market should also be seen in the context of some acquisitions of Union\r\nproducers by the Russians exporting producers. Indeed, two Russian producers\r\ncurrently own subsidiaries based in the Union. The verification visit to the EU\r\nbased subsidiary of the cooperating exporter revealed that its sales were\r\nconcluded mainly on the European market and that the related sales between the\r\ncooperating producer and this subsidiary remained limited in RIP.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the data of\r\nthe cooperating exporter, it has to be noted that the Russian export volume of\r\nthe product concerned to third countries exceeded four times the export volume\r\nto the Union in RIP. The export prices of the cooperating exporting producer to\r\nthird countries were found to be on average lower than its domestic sales price\r\nin the Russian Federation, but on average at higher levels than the export\r\nprices to the Union market. This allows a conclusion that the export sales to\r\nthird countries' markets are more attractive than the sales to the Union\r\nmarket. In this context, the existence of long established sales channels with\r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States' (CIS) markets is also noted. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\r\ndisclosure the applicant argued that the export prices of the Russian producers\r\nto the third markets are in fact lower than the export prices to the Union. A\r\ncomparison between average export prices to Ukraine and some European countries\r\nbased allegedly on the Russian customs statistics was evoked. No original data\r\nunderlying the comparison was submitted. In this respect it is noted that the\r\ncomparison of the price difference between Russian export prices to the Union\r\nand to third markets carried out in the investigation was based on the verified\r\nquestionnaire data of the cooperating exporting producer. Such price comparison\r\nwas made at ex-works level taking into account the differences between the product\r\ntypes and the level of trade. The average prices submitted by the applicant do\r\nnot reflect the complexity of the price components and ranges existing in the\r\nSWR market and resulting from a significant number of different products and\r\ndifferent level of trade. Therefore the argument has been rejected.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party argued that\r\nthe level of export volume of the Union industry to the Russian Federation is\r\nirrelevant in this case and rather pointed to the increased imports from the\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China to the Russian Federation and the need to take them into\r\nconsideration in the analysis as they constitute a competitive threat to the\r\npresence of the Russian producers on the Russian and CIS markets. In this\r\nregard the fact that the Union producers remain the export leaders on the\r\nRussian market is relevant as it confirms inter alia the fact that the Russian\r\nproducers are unable to produce all types of SWR for which demand exists on the\r\nRussian market. As regards the Chinese exports to the Russian Federation, it is\r\nnoted that they grew in parallel to the rapid growth of the demand of the\r\nRussian market. No information was provided e.g. regarding Chinese export price\r\nlevels to the Russian Federation or CIS countries or the characteristics of the\r\nimported product under investigation to allow for a further analysis. Finally,\r\nit is noted that according to the Russian customs statistics the Russian\r\nproducers of the product concerned remained the leader on their SWR domestic\r\nmarket in the RIP and the total imports to this market accounted for only about\r\n15% of the Russian SWR market. Therefore the argument has been rejected.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production capacity and\r\nexcess capacity available for exports in the Russian Federation\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the request\r\nfor review, the production capacity of all Russian exporting producers was 115\r\n000 tonnes. During the investigation the applicant reassessed the Russian\r\nproduction capacity to be in a range between 220 000 and 250 000 tonnes, which\r\nwas however not supported by any evidence. On the basis of the verified data of\r\nthe cooperating exporter, the data submitted by a second known producer and the\r\ndata contained in the request on the third producer, the production capacity of\r\nall Russian producers of the product concerned was established at the level of\r\naround 158 000 tonnes. In this context, it is noted that the production\r\ncapacity of the cooperating exporting producer underwent structural adjustments\r\nin the period considered, as a result of which one production workshop was\r\nclosed.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\r\ndisclosure one party argued that some machinery from the closed production workshop\r\nwas transferred to another production site of the cooperating producer. No\r\nevidence was provided however to support this claim. In this respect it is\r\nconfirmed that the evidence gathered during the investigation confirms that the\r\ncooperating producer underwent in the period considered structural adjustments,\r\nwhich included scrapping of some machinery in all three production sites and\r\nclosure of one production workshop. At the same time it cannot be excluded that\r\ncertain machinery from the closed production workshop was transferred to the\r\nremaining ones. In any event, this does not change the estimation of the\r\nproduction capacity of this producer and of Russia in total, which the party\r\ndid not contest. Therefore the argument has been rejected.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the question of\r\ncapacity utilisation and excess capacity, further to the data of two producers,\r\nin the absence of any precise information on the capacity utilisation of the\r\nthird producer it was assumed that its capacity utilisation was in the range of\r\nthe two other producers i.e. 90% in RIP. Considering the above, it was\r\nconcluded that the total spare capacity in the Russian Federation is in the\r\nrange of 17 000 tonnes. This corresponded to about 8% of the Union consumption\r\nin RIP.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings\r\nthat exports from the Russian Federation are still being dumped during the RIP,\r\nthere is a likelihood of continuation of dumping on the Union market in case\r\nthe current anti-dumping measures are removed. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the following\r\npoints should be highlighted. Firstly, there is a limited spare capacity\r\navailable in the Russian Federation, which may be absorbed by the fast growing\r\ndemand on the domestic market. Secondly, the Russian producers do not possess\r\ncapacities to deliver all types of ropes and therefore their competitive\r\npressure on the Union market is limited. Thirdly, two of three known exporting\r\nproducers have their fully owned subsidiaries in the Union producing the like\r\nproduct. Based on the information received from the subsidiary of the\r\ncooperating exporting producer, is can be seen that the like product produced\r\nby the subsidiary is sold primarily on the Union market while the exporting\r\nproducer produces and sells the like product mostly for the Russian market. In\r\naddition, the Russian exporting producers have strong commercial links with the\r\nthird country markets, in particular the CIS markets, which are more attractive\r\nfor the Russian exporters because on average the prices charged in these\r\nmarkets are higher than the ones charged in the Union. On this basis it was\r\nconcluded that the imports of the product concerned from the Russian Federation\r\nare unlikely to grow substantially should the measures be allowed to lapse. \nD. DEFINITION OF THE UNION INDUSTRY\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the RIP, SWR are\r\nmanufactured by over 30 Union producers. The output of those producers\r\n(established on the basis of the information collected from the cooperating\r\nproducers and for the other Union producers on the data from the applicant) is\r\ntherefore deemed to constitute the Union production within the meaning of\r\nArticle 4(1) of the basic Regulation. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained under recital\r\n(12), due to the large number of Union producers, a sample was selected. For\r\nthe purpose of the injury analysis, the injury indicators have been established\r\nat the following two levels:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n- the macroeconomic elements (production, capacity, sales volume, market share,\r\ngrowth, employment, productivity, average unit prices, magnitude of dumping) were\r\nassessed, at the level of the whole Union production, on the basis of information\r\ncollected from the cooperating producers, from Eurostat data and, for the other\r\nUnion producers, an estimate based on the data from the applicant was used;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n- the analysis of microeconomic elements (i.e. stocks, wages, profitability, return\r\non investments, cash flow, ability to raise capital and investments) was\r\ncarried out for the sampled Union producers on the basis of their information\r\nwhich was verified.\nE.

Therefore, the undercutting margin may only be\r\nconsidered to be indicative. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from other countries\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume, market share and\r\nprices of imports from other countries\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from countries\r\nother than the Russian Federation have increased by 10.6% over the period considered,\r\nwhich is higher than the increase in consumption on the EU market (+8%).\r\nDespite the gain of EU market share by countries other than the Russian\r\nFederation, the respective market shares can be considered as being stable.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main exporting countries\r\nduring the RIP were South Korea with 16% market share followed by the PRC\r\n(1.78%), Thailand with about 1.65% market share, and the Russian Federation\r\n(see above, 1.11% market share) while the Union industry market share was close\r\nto 60%. \n Countries/ Imports in tonnes || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || RIP \n South-Korea || 32 027 || 23 926 || 28 906 || 34 798 \n China || 5 797 || 4 067 || 5 174 || 3 765 \n Thailand || 3 673 || 3 815 || 5 348 || 3 499 \n Other countries || 34 938 || 38 974 || 39 376 || 42 444 \n Subtotal (excluding the Russian Federation) || 76 435 || 70 782 || 78 804 || 84 506 \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Russia || 2 005 || 2 197 || 2 548 || 2 343 \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Total imports (including the Russian Federation) || 78 440 || 72 979 || 81 352 || 86     849 \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Price undercutting\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overall average\r\nprices of imports of the like product from other countries remained stable\r\nand unchanged during the period considered and undercut Union industry prices\r\non average by 57%. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation of the Union\r\nIndustry\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 3(5) of\r\nthe basic Regulation, the Commission examined all relevant economic factors and\r\nindices having a bearing on the state of the Union industry.\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the fact that\r\nsampling was used with regard to the Union industry, the injury was assessed on\r\nthe basis of information collected at the level of the entire Union industry\r\n('UI') (macroeconomic elements as defined in recital (49)) and on the basis of\r\ninformation collected at the level of the sampled Union producers (microeconomic\r\nelements as defined in recital (49)).\n(a)         \r\nProduction\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The UI\u2019s production increased\r\nby 6% between 2009 and the RIP, i.e. from 214 475 tonnes to 228 368 tonnes.

The improvement in the\r\neconomic and financial situation of the UI, further to the imposition of\r\nanti-dumping measures in 2001, evidence that the measures are effective and\r\nthat the UI has recovered from the effects of past dumping practices.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the period\r\nconsidered the UI managed more or less to maintain its market share, prices\r\nincreased by 8%, stocks remained at a reasonable level while production volume and\r\nconsumption increased. The UI was profitable throughout the period considered,\r\nalthough profits were at a lower level in the RIP than in 2009. Considering the\r\nabove, it can be concluded that the UI did not suffer material injury over the\r\nperiod considered.\nF. LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF\r\nINJURY\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\r\nhas also been examined whether the recurrence of material injury would be\r\nlikely if the measures were allowed to lapse. It is assessed that this is not\r\nbe likely to happen for the reasons as explained below. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nhighlighted in recital (54) prices of imports from the Russian Federation were\r\nfound to undercut EU prices. However, given the low\r\nvolumes of matching product types, the present undercutting margin may only be\r\nconsidered to be indicative. \n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nexplained in recital (51), the volume of imports of the\r\nproduct concerned originating in the Russian Federation was 2 005 tonnes in\r\n2009 and 2 343 tonnes during the RIP, representing a market share of respectively\r\n1.03% and 1.11%. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nexplained in recitals (-43 ) and (45), the total Russian capacity is estimated\r\nto be about 158 000 tonnes, whereas during the last investigation this was estimated to be approximately at\r\nthe level of the total EU consumption, namely 220 000 tonnes. Furthermore, the spare\r\ncapacities appear currently to be limited. \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\r\nthe last investigation, the Russian market was assessed as not able to absorb the\r\nlevel of supply. Currently, as explained in recital (36), the domestic consumption\r\nof SWR in Russia experienced a considerable growth by 38% in the period\r\nconsidered. In addition, publicly available economic forecasts estimate a\r\nstrong GDP growth in the Russian Federation in the coming years. The Russian\r\nspare capacity, as mentioned in recital (45), is therefore likely to be absorbed\r\nby the growing Russian market as Russian prices are around 11% higher than\r\nexport prices to the EU. In addition, Russian export prices to other markets,\r\nnotably the CIS countries are on average 5.6% higher than the export prices to\r\nthe EU. It is therefore unlikely that substantial quantities of either the\r\nspare capacity or their current sales on the more beneficial domestic market\r\nand/or in CIS country markets will be redirected to the Union market.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe light of the above, it is concluded that the repeal of the measures on imports\r\noriginating in the Russian Federation would in all likelihood not result in the\r\nrecurrence of material injury to the UI as whole.\nG. ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above, the\r\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of SWR from the Russian Federation\r\nshould be repealed and the present proceeding terminated in accordance with\r\nArticle 9(2) and Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed\r\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended\r\nto recommend that the existing measures be terminated with regard to imports\r\noriginating in the Russian Federation. They were also granted a period to make\r\nrepresentations subsequent to this disclosure. Comments were received by one\r\ninterested party which also requested and was granted a hearing in the presence\r\nof the hearing officer, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe anti-dumping measures concerning\r\nimports of steel ropes and cables including locked coil ropes, excluding ropes\r\nand cables of stainless steel, with a maximum cross-sectional dimension\r\nexceeding 3 mm, with fittings attached or not, originating in the Russian\r\nFederation and currently falling within CN codes ex\r\n7312 10 81, ex 7312 10 83, ex 7312 10 85, ex 7312 10 89 and ex 7312 10 98, are hereby\r\nrepealed and the proceeding concerning these imports is terminated.\nArticle 2\nThe expiry review proceeding of the\r\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of steel ropes and cables including\r\nlocked coil ropes, excluding ropes and cables of stainless steel, with a\r\nmaximum cross-sectional dimension exceeding 3 mm, with fittings attached or\r\nnot, currently falling within CN codes ex 7312 10 81, ex 7312 10 83, ex 7312 10\r\n85, ex 7312 10 89 and ex 7312 10 98 and originating in the Russian Federation,\r\ninitiated pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, is hereby\r\nterminated.\nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European\r\nUnion.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 211, 04.08.2001, p. 1.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 285, 31.10.2007, p. 52.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 285, 31.10.2007, p. 1.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 36, 09.02.2012, p. 1.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 330, 27.10.2012, p. 5.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the data obtained from Prommetiz \u2013\r\nRussian association of hardware producers.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
