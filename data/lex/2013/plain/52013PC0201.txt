The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n 3) Legal elements of the proposal \n 305 || \u00b7      Summary of the proposed action On 16 February 2012, the Commission announced by a notice (\u2018notice of initiation\u2019), published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of threaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron, originating in the People's Republic of China, Thailand and Indonesia. The anti-dumping proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 3 January 2012 by the Defence Committee of Tube or Pipe Cast Fittings, of Malleable Cast Iron of the European Union (\u2018the complainant\u2019) on behalf of producers representing more than 50 % of the total Union production of threaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron containing evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom. On 15 November 2012, the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EU) No 1071/2012, a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Union of threaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron, originating in the People's Republic of China and Thailand ran ging from 15,9 % to 67,8 %. No provisional anti-dumping duty was imposed on imports of threaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron originating in Indonesia. The attached proposal for a Council Regulation is based on the definitive findings which have confirmed the existence of dumping causing injury, and the fact that the imposition of measures is not against the Union interest. The provisional findings were in general confirmed, but the product scope has been narrowed and changes to the calculation of dumping and injury margins have resulted in a reduction of the duty levels that now range from 14,9 % to 57,8 %. It is proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a Regulation which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 15 May 2013 at the latest. \n 310 || \u00b7      Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n 329 || \u00b7      Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || \u00b7      Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n 331 || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n 332 || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || \u00b7      Choice of instruments \n 341 || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n 342 || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n 4) Budgetary implication \n 409 || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0108 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\nand collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of threaded\ntube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron, originating in the People's\nRepublic of China and Thailand and terminating the proceeding with regard to Indonesia\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[2]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Article 9\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the\nproposal submitted by the European Commission after having consulted the\nAdvisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisional measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 15 November 2012, the\nEuropean Commission ('the Commission'), by Regulation (EU) No 1071/2012[3] (\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019)\nimposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of threaded tube or pipe\ncast fittings, of malleable cast iron, originating in the People's Republic of\nChina (\u2018the PRC\u2019) and Thailand.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nproceeding was initiated by a notice of initiation[4]\npublished on 16 February 2012, following a complaint\nlodged on 3 January 2012 by the Defence Committee of Tube or Pipe Cast\nFittings, of Malleable Cast Iron of the European Union (\u2018the complainant\u2019) on\nbehalf of producers representing more than 50 % of the total Union production\nof threaded tube or pipe cast fittings of malleable cast iron ('threaded\nmalleable fittings'). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (15)\nto the provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered\nthe period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 (\u2018investigation period\u2019 or\n\u2018IP\u2019). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered\nthe period from 1 January 2008 to the end of the IP (\u2018period considered\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent procedure\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the\ndisclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it\nwas decided to impose provisional anti-dumping measures ('provisional\ndisclosure'), several interested parties made written submissions making their\nviews on the provisional findings known. The parties who so requested were also\ngranted the opportunity to be heard. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission continued to seek and analyse all the information it deemed\nnecessary for its definitive findings. \nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND\nLIKE PRODUCT\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that the product they import should not be part of the product\nconcerned, since its product had certain technical peculiarities. These\nmalleable fittings use tapered threads, contrary to the parallel threads of the\nother imported malleable fittings.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the investigation\nhas shown that, apart from these technical specifications, these malleable\nfittings have the same physical and technical characteristics of the other\nimported malleable fittings. Furthermore, as concerns the use, the\ninvestigation has shown that the taper threaded fittings are used in a similar\nway to the other imported malleable fittings. Indeed, in one Member State where both types are used, they have been found to be interchangeable. The claim was\ntherefore rejected \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party claimed that white-heart malleable threaded fittings can be\nsold throughout the Union, while black-heart malleable threaded fittings can\nonly be sold in the UK, the\n Republic of Ireland, Malta and Cyprus. Therefore, black-heart and white-heart\nmalleable threaded fittings do allegedly not compete fully on the Union market.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the investigation\nhas shown that the majority of imports of black-heart malleable threaded\nfittings originating in the countries concerned go to continental European\ncountries such as Germany, Italy, Poland or Spain. It is therefore concluded\nthat black-heart and white heart malleable threaded fittings fully compete on\nthe Union market, and not only in a limited number of Member States.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An importer reiterated its\nclaim that bodies of compression fittings should not fall\nunder the definition of the product concerned. That\nimporter argued that bodies of compression fittings have different use and\nprovided supporting evidence that the thread on the body of compression\nfittings can be easily distinguished from the thread on a standard fitting,\nbecause it is done according to a different ISO standard[5]. After\nconsidering the evidence that was submitted, it was concluded that the product\nscope should be limited accordingly.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\nother interested parties argued for exclusion from the product scope of malleable\niron electrical conduit fittings and, in particular, malleable iron threaded\ncircular junction boxes that are a key component of all electrical conduit tube\nand conduit fittings installations. They claimed that such junction boxes serve\ndifferent purposes (i.e. containment and protection of electrical wiring\nsystems as opposite to ensuring leak-less flow of gas or water as in the case\nof standard fittings investigated in this proceeding). They are also easily\ndistinguishable from other fittings (rather than having to be absolutely gas or\nliquid tight they have light lids when assembled into a system after\nimportation to allow easy access to cables). After careful consideration of\nthose arguments, it was concluded that malleable iron threaded circular\njunction boxes without having a lid should be excluded from the product scope.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it\nwas deemed appropriate to revise the product scope definition determined in the\nprovisional Regulation. Therefore, the product concerned is definitively\ndefined as threaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of\nmalleable cast iron, currently falling within CN code ex 7307 19 10, excluding\nbodies of compression fittings using ISO DIN 13 metric thread and malleable iron threaded circular junction boxes without having a\nlid.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments concerning the product concerned and the like product, the findings in\nrecitals (17) to (21) and (23) to (28) to the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SAMPLING\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following provisional\ndisclosure, no comments concerning sampling of Union producers, exporting\nproducers in the PRC and unrelated importers were received. Consequently, the\nfindings set out in recitals (29) to (31) to the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed. \nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People's\nRepublic of China\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market economy treatment\nand individual treatment\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning market economy treatment and individual treatment, the\nprovisional findings in recitals (32) to (46) to the provisional Regulation are\nhereby confirmed.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning the analogue country, the findings in recitals (47) to (53)\nto the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value, export price,\ncomparison\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\nChinese exporting producer claimed that the normal value should be calculated on\nthe basis of the domestic sales by the sole cooperating analogue country\nproducer, even if they are not made in representative quantities as set out in\nArticle 2(2) of the basic Regulation. The claim can be accepted in the case of\nan analogue country. Accordingly, domestic sales in the ordinary course of\ntrade by the sole cooperating analogue country producer were used to establish the\nnormal value.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsame Chinese exporting producer claimed that the dumping margin should be\nestablished using all export sales, and not only for the product types directly\ncomparable with the types sold by the analogue country producer on its domestic\nmarket. This claim was accepted. For these not directly comparable product\ntypes, the normal value was based on the arithmetical average normal value for\nthe matching product types, adjusted by the market value of the differences in\nthe physical characteristics pursuant to Article 2(10)(a) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments concerning the normal value, export price and comparison, the findings\nin recitals (54), (59) to (61) and (64) to (67) to the provisional Regulation\nare hereby confirmed.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margins\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sampled companies,\nthe weighted average normal value of each type of the like product established\nfor the analogue country was compared with the weighted average export price of\nthe corresponding type of the product concerned, as provided for in Articles\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis the definitive\ndumping margins expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty\nunpaid, are as follows:\n Company || Dumping Margin \n Hebei Jianzhi || 57,8 % \n Jinan Meide || 40,8 % \n Qingdao Madison || 24,6 % \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average\ndumping margin of the cooperating exporting producers not included in the\nsample was calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(6) of the\nbasic Regulation. Accordingly, this margin was established on the basis of the\nmargins established for the sampled exporting producers.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the dumping\nmargin for the cooperating companies not included in the sample was established\nat 41,1 %.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to all other\nexporting producers in the PRC, the dumping margins were established on the\nbasis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation. To this end the level of cooperation was first established by\ncomparing the volume of exports to the Union reported by the cooperating\nexporting producers with the volume of Chinese exports, as established in\nrecital (51) below.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the cooperation\naccounted for more than 50 % of total Chinese exports to the Union and the\nindustry can be considered fragmented due to the high number of exporting\nproducers in the PRC, the level of cooperation can be considered high. Therefore,\nthe residual dumping margin was set at the level of the sampled company with\nthe highest dumping margin. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis the\ndefinitive dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier\nprice, duty unpaid, are as follows:\n Company || Dumping Margin \n Hebei Jianzhi || 57,8 % \n Jinan Meide || 40,8 % \n Qingdao Madison || 24,6 % \n Other cooperating companies || 41,1 % \n All other companies || 57,8 % \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value, export price\nand comparison\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning normal value, export price and comparison, the findings in\nrecitals (75) to (87) and (91) to the provisional Regulation with regard to\nIndonesia are hereby confirmed.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margins\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the level of\ncooperation was considered high (the volume of exports of the sole cooperating\nIndonesian company represented more than 80 % of total Indonesian exports to\nthe Union during the IP), the dumping margin for all other Indonesian exporting\nproducers was set at the same level as for the cooperating company. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis the\ndefinitive dumping margins for the Indonesian companies expressed as a\npercentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty unpaid, are as follows:\n Company || Dumping Margin \n PT.

The dumping\nmargin for the other cooperating exporting producer is definitively confirmed\nat the provisional level.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that the level of\ncooperation was considered high (the volume of exports of the two cooperating\nThai companies represented more than 80 % of total Thai exports to the Union during the IP), the dumping margin for all other Thai exporting producers was set at\nthe level of the highest dumping margin of the two cooperating companies. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis the definitive dumping margins for the Thai companies expressed as a\npercentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty unpaid, are as follows:\n Company || Dumping Margin \n BIS Pipe Fitting Industry Co., Ltd || 15,5 % \n Siam Fittings Co., Ltd || 50,7 % \n All other companies || 50,7 % \nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 INJURY\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union production\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments with regard to Union production, recital (94) to the\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. It is added that during the period\nconsidered the like product was manufactured by three more producers in the Union that ceased production between 2008 and 2009, and another producer which ceased\nproduction around the end of the period considered.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definition\nof the Union industry\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties claimed\nthat both sampled groups of Union producers are importing the product\nconcerned, and should therefore pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) not be considered\npart of the Union industry.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it was established that both sampled groups of Union producers do\nindeed import the product concerned. However, first, it should be noted that\nthe finding that a Union producer is also an importer of the product concerned\ndoes not lead automatically to the exclusion of this Union producer from the\nUnion industry, and second, for each of the Union producers, these imports were\nminor compared to the total production and sales of the groups of companies. It\nis therefore confirmed that both groups of companies are considered part of the\nUnion industry.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, one interested\nparty claimed that one Union producer should not be considered part of the Union\nindustry, since the Union producer is allegedly related to an importer of the\nproduct concerned. However, first, it should be noted that the finding of a\nrelation between a Union producer and an exporter does not lead automatically\nto the exclusion of this Union producer from the Union industry, and second, no\nevidence was provided that the relation between the Union producer and the\nimporter, if any, would meet the criteria of Article 4(2) of the basic\nRegulation. Furthermore, the quantities imported by the allegedly related\nimporter are only a small fraction of the quantities produced and sold by the\nallegedly related Union producer. Therefore, even if the Union producer and the\nimporter were found related, the Union producer would still be considered part\nof the Union industry.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the\ndefinition of the Union industry for the purposes of the injury assessment, all\nUnion producers manufacturing the like product during the period considered are\nconsidered to constitute the Union industry and they will therefore be\nhereafter referred to as the \u2018Union industry\u2019 within the meaning of Article\n4(1) of the basic Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\ncommented on the fact that during the whole period considered, the production\nof the Union industry exceeds its sales. At the same time, a decrease in stocks\nwas reported, which is implausible as production exceeding sales should lead to\nan increase in stocks. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted in this respect that indeed, while at the\nprovisional stage production and stocks were found to have been reported\ncorrectly, an error occurred in reporting the Union sales of the Union industry\nand some sales volumes of the non-sampled Union producers were not completely\ntaken account of. This was corrected and as a consequence, the Union\nconsumption and market shares on the Union market also had to be revised\naccordingly. Due to the shut-down of three Union\nproducers during the period considered mentioned in recital (113) to the\nprovisional Regulation, the revision with regard to the Union consumption has a\nmore significant impact at the beginning of the period considered.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption significantly decreased by 28 % between 2008 and 2009, subsequently\nincreasing by 7 percentage points to a level of 21 % below the consumption at\nthe beginning of the period considered.\n Union consumption (tonnes) \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Union consumption || 84 270 || 60 807 || 60 640 || 66 493 \n Index || 100 || 72 || 72 || 79 \n Source: Complaint data, Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\nfrom the countries concerned\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cumulative\nassessment of the effects of the imports concerned\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the volumes of the dumped imports from Indonesia, it is definitively confirmed that they constituted only around 2,5 % of all imports of\nthe like product to the Union during the IP. Therefore, they can be considered\nas not constituting a cause of material injury to the Union industry in the\nsense of Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation or the provisions of the WTO\nAnti-Dumping Agreement.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe light of the above, it is definitively decided not to cumulate those\nimports with the dumped imports from the PRC and Thailand.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the cumulative\nassessment of imports from the PRC and Thailand for the purpose of the injury\nand causation analysis, interested parties claimed that Thai imports should not\nbe cumulatively assessed with Chinese imports for a number of reasons.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, it was argued that\nthe sales quantity of Thai imports is much lower than that of Chinese imports,\nand that the sales quantity of Thai imports is decreasing in absolute terms.\nHowever, the quantity of Thai imports is not negligible, and therefore\nsufficient to allow cumulation. In addition, even though the Thai imports are\ndecreasing in absolute terms as demonstrated in the table in recital (51) below,\nthey were gaining 19 % of market share during the period considered, as demonstrated\nin the table in recital (51) below.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In terms of prices, it was\nargued that Thai imports are sold, on average, at higher prices than Chinese\nimports. While this is correct, Thai imports are nevertheless significantly\nundercutting Union industry prices. Furthermore, the price difference between\nThai imports and Chinese imports was constantly decreasing during the period\nconsidered from 698 EUR/tonne in 2008 to 472 EUR/tonne during the IP, as shown\nin the table of recital (108) to the provisional Regulation.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\nclaim or comments, the content of recitals (98) to (105) to the provisional\nRegulation is hereby confirmed.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume,\nmarket share of the dumped imports concerned, their import prices and\nundercutting\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the import volumes for the PRC stated in recital (106) of the\nprovisional Regulation are too high, as the relevant CN code includes all types\nof malleable cast iron fittings, not only threaded fittings.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nnoted that not the full quantities reported in the CN code were presumed to be\nthreaded fittings. The volumes reported in the provisional Regulation were already\ncorrected downwards, based on information provided by national customs\nauthorities. These volumes were in line with the information contained in the\ncomplaint. Interested parties had sufficient time to comment on this. However,\nno information in this regard was submitted by any interested party either\nbefore the publication of the provisional Regulation, nor within the time limit\ngranted for submitting comments to the provisional Regulation. The Chinese\nChamber of Commerce provided some quantified information concerning the\nallegedly correct level of Chinese imports very late in the procedure, almost\ntwo months after the deadline for submitting comments to the provisional\nRegulation, which means it was provided only almost one year after the\ninitiation of the investigation, when the import figures were disclosed for the\nfirst time in the non-limited version of the complaint. The submission of this\ninformation outside the deadline does not allow for its verification through an\nobjective process of examination without unduly extending the period of the\ninvestigation beyond the overriding 15-month deadline as laid down in Article\n6(9) of the basic Regulation. In any case, this information appears to\nsubstantially understate the Chinese import quantities, since it is based on\nestimates concerning exports of cooperating companies only and could not therefore\nbe regarded as accurate. This claim therefore was rejected.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\na number of importers provided information concerning their imports of products\nother than the product concerned imported under the same CN code during the\nperiod considered. This information could be taken into account, and the import\nvolumes from the countries concerned were revised downwards accordingly.\n Union import volume (tonnes) \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n PRC || 24 180 || 20 876 || 20 416 || 28 894 \n Index || 100 || 86 || 84 || 119 \n Thailand || 3 723 || 2 681 || 3 331 || 3 485 \n Index || 100 || 72 || 89 || 94 \n Two countries concerned || 27 903 || 23 558 || 23 747 || 32 379 \n Index || 100 || 84 || 85 || 116 \n Source: Complaint data, Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\na consequence of the issue concerning the Union sales of the Union industry\nmentioned in recital (41) above, the market share of the dumped imports from\nthe two countries concerned had to be revised as well. The market share of dumped imports from\nthe two countries concerned has increased by 15,6 percentage points from\n33,1 % to 48,7 % during the period considered.

However, since the sample of Union producers was\ncomprised of only two groups of producers, as indicated in recital (111) of the\nprovisional Regulation, for confidentiality reasons the actual aggregated\ninformation could not be disclosed. This reason also applies to the disclosure\nof the aggregated sales price by product type.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties claimed that the imports from the countries concerned enter the Union at a different level of trade than the goods\nsold by the Union producers. Indeed, it was confirmed that this is the case,\nand the Union industry and the importers typically share a substantial number\nof customers. The claim could therefore be accepted and an allowance in the\nform of an adjustment for level of trade was applied.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\na result the undercutting margins given in recital (110) to the provisional\nRegulation were revised downwards. Nevertheless, the undercutting margins found\ntypically remain substantial at 25 % to 45 %, with the sole exception of one\nThai exporter where the undercutting margin found was around 10 %.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\nclaim or comments, the content of recitals (108) to (109) to the provisional\nRegulation is hereby confirmed.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Situation\nof the Union industry\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any claim\nor comments, recital (111) to the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production,\nproduction capacity and capacity utilisation\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments with regard to production, production capacity and capacity\nutilisation, recitals (112) to (114) to the provisional Regulation are hereby\nconfirmed.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stocks\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments with regard to stocks, recital (115) to the provisional Regulation is\nhereby confirmed.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sales\nvolume and market share\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\na consequence of the issue mentioned in recital (41) above, the sales volume\nand market share of the Union industry had to be revised as well. The sales\nvolume of all Union producers on the Union market significantly decreased by 36\n% between 2008 and 2009 due to a decreasing demand. After 2009, however, the\ndemand in the Union increased by around 6 000 tonnes, as mentioned in\nrecital (42) above, but the Union sales further decreased by another 5 percentage\npoints or 2 440 tonnes until the end of the period considered.\n Union sales volume (tonnes) \n All producers || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Union sales || 48 823 || 31 069 || 30 466 || 28 629 \n Index || 100 || 64 || 62 || 59 \n Source: Questionnaire replies sampled Union producers, complaint \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of the\nUnion industry continuously decreased by 26 % or 14,8 percentage\npoints during the period considered, while the dumped imports gained\n15,6 percentage points of market share during the same period, as\nindicated in recital (52) above.\n Union market share \n All producers || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Market share || 57,9 % || 51,1 % || 50,2 % || 43,1 % \n Index || 100 || 88 || 87 || 74 \n Source: Complaint data, Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that the market shares in the non-domestic market segment in the United Kingdom would show different market shares, with the Union industry holding a larger\nmarket share, while the market share of Chinese imports would be smaller on\nthis particular segment of the Union market.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may very well be the\ncase that the Union industry holds a higher market share in a particular market\nsegment in a single Member State. It is indeed normal that the various economic\noperators do not have the same market shares in all market segments of all\nMember States. However, the present injury analysis covers the Union market as\na whole. In this respect, it was indeed confirmed that the market share of the\nUnion industry significantly decreased, as explained above.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\non injury\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\nclaim or comments, the content of recitals (118) to (133) to the provisional\nRegulation including the conclusion that Union industry has suffered material\ninjury within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation is hereby\nconfirmed.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSATION\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect\nof other factors\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\nfrom other third countries\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nissue concerning the Union sales of the Union industry mentioned in recital (41)\nabove, the market share of the other third countries had to be revised as well.\nFor the other third countries, there were limited\nimports throughout the whole period considered. The total market share of\nimports from countries other than the two countries concerned has decreased during\nthe period considered by 0,8 percentage points, from 9,0 % to 8,2 %.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nnext largest sources of imports during the IP were Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, which held market shares between 1,3 % and 1,5 %, and all of these countries\nhad stable or decreasing market shares during the period considered.\n Import market share \n   || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || IP \n Brazil || 3,1 % || 3,6 % || 3,9 % || 1,5 % \n Indonesia || 1,5 % || 2,4 % || 1,9 % || 1,5 % \n Turkey || 1,3 % || 1,9 % || 1,8 % || 1,3 % \n Other Countries || 3,0 % || 2,3 % || 3,1 % || 3,9 % \n Total || 9,0 % || 10,2 % || 10,6 % || 8,2 % \n Index || 100 || 114 || 118 || 92 \n Source: Eurostat \n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due\nto the limited volumes and the stable trend, it can be concluded that imports\nfrom third countries other than the countries concerned have not contributed to\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry during the IP.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development\nof Union consumption\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties argued that the Union consumption developed negatively due to the\nemeregence of substitute products manufactured with different materials other\nthan malleable cast iron, such as plastic, stainless steel, carbon steel and\ncopper, as well as new connection technologies. As a consequence, some Union\nproducers have broadened their product range, which now also includes some of\nthese substitute products.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it is noted that the substitution effects were addressed in\nrecital (146) to the provisional Regulation. These substitution effects had a\nnegative impact on the Union consumption, which as a consequence had an effect\non production and sales volume of the Union producers.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nas already indicated in the provisional Regulation, the injurious effect of the\nshrinking Union consumption was aggravated by the steady increase of dumped\nimports which gained 15,6 percentage points of market share in a shrinking\nmarket. As indicated in recital (60) above, the demand\nin the Union increased by around 6 000 tonnes between 2009 and the IP, but\nthe Union industry's sales further decreased by another 2 440 tonnes until the\nend of the period considered in a recovering market.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the above, it is concluded that the negative development of Union\nconsumption does not break the causal link between the dumped imports and the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease\nin production capacity not due to dumped imports\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties claimed that the decrease in the Union production\ncapacity mentioned in recital (113) to the provisional Regulation is due to the\nshutdown of three Union producers between 2008 and 2009 due to the economic\ncrisis. This decrease can therefore allegedly not be attributed to imports from\nthe countries concerned.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it is pointed out that it was already mentioned in recital (113) to\nthe provisional Regulation that the main reason for the reduction of the\nproduction capacity was the shutdown of three Union producers.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nthe shutdown of the three Union producers cannot only be seen as an effect of\ndecreasing demand. During the period considered, the shrinking Union market\nreferred to in recital (42) above has been subject to continuously increasing\nimports from the countries concerned, which gained 15,6 percentage points of\nmarket share, as explained in recital (52) above. It is therefore clear that\nnot only the decreasing demand has contributed to the shutdown of three Union\nproducers and thereby to the decrease of the production capacity of the Union\nindustry. There is also a clear link between the decrease in the Union production capacity and the\nincreasing market share of dumped imports.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\nof the product concerned by Union producers\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties claimed that the injury suffered by Union producers was self-inflicted,\nas they allegedly imported significant quantities of the product concerned.\nThis claim was not supported by the findings of the investigation. Information\nsupplied by both the Union producers and the cooperating exporters showed that,\nfor each of the sampled groups of Union producers, these imports were minor\ncompared to their total production and sales of own-produced goods as already\nindicated in recital (37) above. Given the insignificance of the volumes of\nimports of the product concerned by the Union industry, it was concluded that those\nimports did not contribute to the injury suffered by the Union industry.\nConsequently, the claim was rejected. \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use\nof 2008 as a starting year \n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties claimed\nthat the deteriorating trend of the EU industry is largely based on the use of\n2008 as a reference point for the period considered. Allegedly, 2008 was an\nexceptionally good year for the Union industry. However, information included\nin the complaint suggests that the situation of the EU industry in 2007 was\nsimilar or better than the situation in 2008. It is therefore concluded that\nthe finding of injury does not depend on the use of 2008 as a starting year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account taken of the above\nand in the absence of any other claim or comments, the content of recitals\n(134) to (153) to the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In conclusion, it is\nconfirmed that the material injury of the Union industry, which is characterised\nby decreasing profitability, production volumes,\ncapacity utilisation, sales volumes and market share\nwas caused by the dumped imports concerned. Indeed, the effect of decreasing\ndemand on the Union industry's negative developments in terms of production\ncapacity, production and sales was limited.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above analysis,\nwhich has properly distinguished and separated the effects of all the known\nfactors on the situation of the Union Industry from the injurious effects of\nthe dumped imports, it is hereby confirmed that these other factors as such do\nnot reverse the fact that the assessed injury must be attributed to the dumped\nimports.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION\nINTEREST\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any comments,\nrecitals (154) to (164) to the provisional Regulation, including the conclusion\nthat no compelling reasons exist against the imposition of measures on the\ndumped imports from the countries concerned are hereby confirmed. \nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE MEASURES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The injury elimination\nlevels were adjusted to take into account the level of trade adjustment made in\nthe calculation of undercutting as set out in recitals (54) and (55) above.

The \u2018all other companies\u2019 duty\nwill be applied to those companies that had not cooperated in the investigation\nand to companies that have not had exports of the product concerned to the\nUnion during the IP.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe cooperating non-sampled Chinese companies listed in the Annex to this Regulation, the\ndefinitive duty rate is set at the weighted average of the rates of the sampled\ncompanies.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nrates of the definitive anti-dumping duties are as follows:\nPeople's Republic of China\n Company || Dumping margin || Injury margin || Duty Rate \n Hebei Jianzhi Casting Group Ltd. || 57,8 % || 96,1 % || 57,8 % \n Jinan Meide Casting Co., Ltd. || 40,8 % || 84,4 % || 40,8 % \n Qingdao Madison Industrial Co., Ltd. || 24,6 % || 89,4 % || 24,6 % \n Other cooperating companies || 41,1 % || 86,3 % || 41,1 % \n All other companies ||   ||   || 57,8 % \nThailand\n Company || Dumping margin || Injury margin || Duty Rate \n BIS Pipe Fitting Industry Co., Ltd || 15,5 % || 43,1 % || 15,5 % \n Siam Fittings Co., Ltd || 50,7 % || 14,9 % || 14,9 % \n All other companies ||   ||   || 15,5 % \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The individual company\nanti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the\nbasis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the\nsituation found during this investigation with respect to these companies.\nThese duty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of product concerned\noriginating in the PRC and Thailand and produced by the companies and thus by\nthe specific legal entities mentioned. Imported product concerned produced by\nany other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this\nRegulation with its name and address, including entities related to those\nspecifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to\nthe duty rate applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of an individual company anti-dumping duty rate (e.g. following a\nchange in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[6] forthwith with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s activities linked\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities. If\nappropriate, the Regulation will then be amended accordingly by updating the\nlist of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the PRC, in\norder to ensure equal treatment between any new exporters and the cooperating\ncompanies not included in the sample, provision should be made for the weighted\naverage duty imposed on the latter companies to be applied to any new exporters\nwhich would otherwise be entitled to a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the\nbasic Regulation as that Article does not apply where sampling has been used.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended\nto recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of\nthreaded tube or pipe cast fittings, of malleable cast iron, originating in the\nPeople's Republic of China and Thailand, and the definitive collection of the\namounts secured by way of the provisional duty ('final disclosure'). They were\nalso granted a period within which they could make representations subsequent\nto this disclosure.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that following the\nfinal disclosure no new arguments that would influence the outcome of the\nassessment of the case were brought forward, no modification of the findings as\ndetailed above is warranted.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNDERTAKING\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating Thai\nexporting producer offered a price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1)\nof the basic Regulation. However, the product concerned exists in a multitude\nof product types (the exporting producer reported over 900 product types sold\nto the EU), for which prices vary significantly (by up to 200 % within the most\nsold types but some less sold product types may be even 10 times as expensive\nas others), thus posing a very high risk of cross-compensation. In addition,\nthe product types may evolve in design and finishing. It was therefore\nconsidered that the product is not suitable for a price undertaking.
