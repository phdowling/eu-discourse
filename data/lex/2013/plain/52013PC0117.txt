The Commission initiated an expiry review on 21 January 2012. A\npartial interim review limited to dumping as regards The Dow Chemical Company\nwas initiated on 11 April 2012. By its judgment of 8\nMay 2012 the General Court annulled the Council Regulation insofar as it\nconcerns the The Dow Chemical Company. On 18 October 2012, the Commission published\na notice concerning the partial reopening of the anti-dumping investigation\nconcerning imports of ethanolamines originating in the United States of America limited in scope to the implementation of the General Court\njudgment.\nThe attached proposal for a Council\nRegulation is based on the findings which brought the Commission to conclude\nthat, on the basis of the verified information of the third expiry review investigation,\nthe institutions could not have come to the conclusion\nthat dumping had continued during the RIP, nor that there was a likelihood of\ncontinuation of dumping. Moreover, the institutions should also have concluded\nthat there was was no likelihood of recurrence of\ndumping.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council\nadopt the attached proposal for a Regulation which terminates the existing\nanti-dumping measures on ethanolamines originating in the USA. This regulation should be published no later than 10 April 2013, i.e. 12 months after\nthe initiation of the interim review.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30\nNovember 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members\nof the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0070 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nterminating the partial reopening of\nanti-dumping investigation concerning imports of ethanolamines originating in\nthe United States of America and terminating the expiry review pursuant to\nArticle 11(2) and the partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of\nRegulation (EC) 1225/2009 \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[1]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Articles 9 (2), 11(2) and 11(3)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by\nthe European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) after having consulted the Advisory\nCommittee, \nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing\nmeasures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n2 February 1994, the Council imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 229/94[2] (\"the original\nRegulation\"), definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of ethanolamines\n(product concerned) originating in the United States of America (\u2018USA\u2019). On 20 July 2000 and following an\nexpiry review investigation, these measures were extended for five years by\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 1603/2000[3]\n(\"the first expiry review Regulation\").\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n23 October 2006, following the second expiry review investigation, the measures\nwere extended for five more years by Council Regulation (EC) No 1583/2006[4] (\"the second expiry review\nRegulation\"). \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n19 January 2010 and following a third expiry review investigation, the\nanti-dumping duties on imports of ethanolamines originating in the USA were imposed for two more years by Council Regulation (EC) No 54/2010[5] (\"the third expiry review\nRegulation\"). \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n9 April 2010, The Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow Chemical\") filed an\napplication for partial annulment of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n54/2010 of 19 January 2010.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n12 March 2011, the Commission published a Notice of impending expiry in the Official\nJournal[6].\n\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a request lodged\nby BASF AG, Ineos Europe AG, and Sasol Germany GmbH (\"the Union\nindustry\"), the Commission initiated an expiry review on 21 January 2012\n(\"fourth expiry review\")[7]. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A partial interim review\nlimited to dumping as regards Dow Chemical was initiated on 11 April 2012[8].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nits judgment of 8 May 2012 in case T-158/10[9]\n(\u2018the judgment\u2019) the General Court\nannulled the third expiry review Regulation insofar as it concerns Dow Chemical\nfollowing an application lodged[10]\non 9 April 2010. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Partial\nreopening\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe General Court judgment of 8 May 2012, a notice[11] was published concerning the\npartial reopening of the third expiry review investigation concerning imports\nof ethanolamines originating in the USA. The reopening was limited in scope to\nthe implementation of the General Court judgment as far as the determination of\na likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping during the RIP,\nincluding the spare production capacity of ethanolamines in the USA, is concerned.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthat notice, parties were informed that, in view of the judgment of the General\nCourt, imports into the European Union of ethanolamines\nmanufactured by Dow Chemical are no longer subject to the anti-dumping duties\nimposed by the third expiry review Regulation and that definitive anti-dumping duties\npaid pursuant to this Regulation on imports of ethanolamines should be repaid\nor remitted in accordance with the applicable customs regulation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission officially advised the exporting producers, the importers and users\nknown to be concerned and the Union industry of the partial reopening of the\ninvestigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out\nin the notice.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\nparties who so requested within the above time limit, and who demonstrated that\nthere were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted the\nopportunity to be heard.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Representations were\nreceived from two exporting producers, three Union producers and a user of the\nproduct concerned.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE\nGENERAL COURT JUDGMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\nPreliminary remark\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis recalled that the reason for the annulment of the contested Regulation was\nthe General Court finding that the third expiry review Regulation contained two\nerrors of assessment: (i) a finding of continued dumping during the review\ninvestigation period (\"RIP\")\nand, therefore, on that basis, a finding of a likelihood of continuation of\ndumping; and (ii) the determination that the spare production capacity of\nethanolamines in the United States amounted to 60 000 tonnes.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments\nof interested parties\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry acknowledged that the General Court judgment\nquestioned the methodologies employed by the Institutions to quantify the spare\ncapacity production in the USA. However, the Union industry sustained that\nbasing the actual production capacity on 90% of the nameplate capacity, as the\ninstitutions had done, is overly conservative as it is common and accepted for\ncompanies to exceed the nameplate capacity. Basing themselves on published\nmarket data allegedly sourced from PCI Xylenes & Polyesters (\"PCI\"), they concluded that there\nwas indeed a spare capacity in 2008 and onwards. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the Union industry considered that market conditions had\nnot changed materially since the publication of the third expiry review\nRegulation and found several reasons to conclude that there is a likelihood of\na recurrence of dumping. In this respect, they invoked the continuation of the\nUS production capacity over domestic demand since the RIP; the material capacity\nexpansions in third countries after 2009 which would have made US export\nmarkets increasingly self-sufficient; the existence of anti-dumping measures\nimposed or likely to be imposed soon in third countries; the increase of MEG\n(monoethylene glycol) capacity production from 2009 onwards; and the proposal\nin the USA to include some of the ethanolamines in the list of products with\npotential harmful effects to health which could ultimately have an impact in\ndomestic consumption. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dow Chemical expressed its doubts about the legality of the\nre-opening of the investigation arguing that there is no specific provision in\nthe basic Regulation allowing for that. This exporting producer also alleged\nthat the re-opening would be in conflict with the 15-month statutory deadline\nset out in article 11(5) of the basic Regulation for the completion of review\ninvestigations.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dow Chemical further claimed that the General Court judgment would\nnot require any implementing measure and that the Commission could not legally\nremedy the aspects of the contested Regulation since each of the substantive\ngrounds that led to the adoption of the Regulation was either annulled by the\nGeneral Court or contested. Dow Chemical therefore considered that the only\nlegal way to remedy these aspects of the third expiry review Regulation would\nbe to repeal the existing measures. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An EU user, Stepan Europe (\"Stepan\"), submitted that the\nlegal consequence of the judgment could only be that the measures imposed by\nthe third expiry review Regulation should be withdrawn as they had been imposed\non the basis of an erroneous analysis. Similar views were expressed by the\nexporting producer Huntsman Petrochemical Corporation LLC (\"Huntsman\").\nIndeed, Stepan and Huntsman argued that the Court held that, during the RIP,\nthe country-wide dumping margin was negative and therefore no continuation of\ndumping could be established. Stepan considered that the institutions should\nhence have examined if there was a likehood of recurrence of dumping; yet the third\nexpiry review Regulation had been silent on this. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\nStepan stressed that, would the notion of continuation of dumping be\ninterpreted on an individual company basis, the institutions should have concluded\nthat there was no continuation of dumping for Dow Chemical as, according to the\nCourt, the company represented more than 85% of all imports from the USA, and\ntherefore they should have considered whether dumping by Dow Chemical was\nlikely to recur. For the other exporting companies, it was established that\nthere had been dumping and therefore the institutions should have established\nwhether dumping was likely to continue. The likelihood of continuation of\ndumping analysis was mainly based, according to Stepan, on a country\u2013wide spare\ncapacity in the USA of 60 000 tonnes. Given the Court's finding that the\ninstitutions erred in assessing the spare capacity in the USA and given that,\naccording to Stepan, the spare capacity was closer to at the most 8 000 tonnes,\nit was no longer possible to sustain that the other exporting companies were\nlikely to continue dumping. The institutions would have needed to also analyze\nand establish the likelihood of recurrence of dumping. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hunstman\nalso based its analysis on the assumption that the General Court's judgment\nconfirmed that there was no spare capacity in the USA during the RIP and that\nit was therefore unlikely that an increased amount of ethanolamines would be\nexported into the EU on that basis. They claimed that it was therefore also not\nnecessary to analyse other factors such as the impact of trade defence masures\nin third countries, the possible development of demand in the USA and in other markets or the downward pressure of prices. Moreover, Huntsman argued\nthat, in the light of the Court's finding of the lack of spare capacity in the USA\nduring the RIP, it was no longer possible for the Commission to re-analize the\nlikelihood of recurrence of dumping and of injury and to conclude in the\nframework of this partial re-opening that there was a likelihood of recurrence\nof injurious dumping. Yet, were the Commission able to revisit the likelihood\nof recurrence of dumping and of injury, Huntsman considered that there would be\nno evidence to demonstrate that the requirements of Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation\nwould be met. As regards the likelihood of recurrence of dumping, Huntsman opined\nthat, on the basis of the finding that during the RIP there was no dumping for\nDow Chemical, the biggest exporter by far, there was no likelihood of recurrence\nof dumping on a country-wide basis after the RIP if the anti-dumping duties would\nbe withdrawn. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto Huntsman, the recurrence of injury would be unlikely in view of the absence\nof unused production capacity which results in very little leeway for\nincreasing exports to the EU after the RIP. Huntsman maintained that such\nconclusion is corroborated by the fact that, according to the SRI report[12], the expected growth of\nconsumption in the USA does not differ significantly from that of the other\nmarkets.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Huntsman\nraised that if the Union industry would have suffered from any injury, this were\nto be attributted to the effects of the economic crisis and not to imports from\nthe USA. The mere exacerbation of the negative impact of the crisis through\nimports could not permit a finding of a likely recurrence of injury caused by\nthe mentioned imports. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis\nof comments\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the alleged illegality of the reopening (recitals (17)-(18)), it is\nrecalled that in case C-458/98 P (\"the IPS judgment\"), the Court of\nJustice recognised that in cases where a proceeding consists of several\nadministrative steps, the annulment of one of those steps does not annul the\ncomplete proceeding. The anti-dumping proceeding is an example of such a\nmulti-step proceeding. Consequently, the annulment of the amending Regulation\nin relation to one party does not imply the annulment of the entire procedure\nprior to the adoption of that Regulation[13].\nMoreover, according to Article 266 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU), the Union institutions are required to comply with the\njudgment. In the light of the above, the claim that there is no legal basis for\nthe partial reopening of a review investigation was found to be unwarranted. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nclaim that the introduction of deadlines to conclude anti-dumping\ninvestigations prevents the Commission from extending the investigation beyond\nthe 15-months statutory limit (recital (17) above) was also found to be\nunwarranted. It is considered that this deadline is not relevant for the\nimplementation of a Court judgment. Indeed, such deadline only governs the\ncompletion of the initial review investigation from the date of initiation to\nthe date of definitive action, and does not concern any subsequent action that\nmight have to be taken for instance as a result of judicial review. The\nconsequence of accepting such claim would make it impossible for the\ninstitutions to take account of the General Court\u2019s findings (as Article 266\nTFEU requires). Indeed, the General Court\u2019s judgment will always be handed down\nat a point in time when the deadline for the investigation has expired. Furthermore, it is noted that any other\ninterpretation would mean that, for example, a successful legal action brought\nby one party would be without any practical effect for that party if the expiry\nof the time limit to conclude the original investigation would not permit the\nimplementation of a judgment of the General Court. This would be at odds with\nthe principle that all parties should have the right to effective judicial\nreview.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning\nthe claim that the Commission would not be able to legally remedy the errors of\nassessment found to be contained in the contested Regulation and that the only\nmean to implement the judgement is to repeal the existing measures (recital (18)\nabove), the following should be noted. The Court has already established that\nthe annulment of a Regulation also implies the possibility of remedying the\naspects of the amending Regulation which led to its annulment, while leaving\nunchanged the uncontested parts which are not affected by the judgment \u2014 as was\nheld in the IPS judgement. The institutions are therefore required to have regard not only to the operative part of the\njudgment but also to the grounds which led to the judgment and constitute its\nessential basis, in so far as they are necessary to determine the exact meaning\nof what is stated in the operative part[14]. The procedure for replacing an illegal measure may thus be resumed.[15]. Hence,\nthis is also considered to be unwarranted.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGeneral Court, as also noted by Stepan and Hunstman (see recital (19)), found\nthat, during the investigation that resulted in the adoption of the third expiry\nreview Regulation, the institutions could not have come to the conclusion that\ndumping had continued during the RIP, nor that there was a likelihood of\ncontinuation of dumping. The vast majority of imports from the USA namely, as the Court noted, more than 85% from Dow Chemical, had entered the Union at non-dumped\nprices. Moreover, that situation should have resulted in a finding that the\nweighted average margin for imports of the product at issue originating in the USA was negative. The Court concluded that the institutions were thefore obliged to demonstrate\nthat there was a likehood of a recurrence of dumping[16]. \n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nanalysis of the likelihood of the recurrence of dumping is in this case, as all\ninterested parties recognize explicitly or implicitly, linked to the\ncalculation of the spare production capacity in the USA. Some interested\nparties contend that the General Court confirmed that there was no significant spare\ncapacity in the USA during the RIP. The Court found that the calculation\nmethodology resulting in a spare production capacity of ethanolamines of 60 000\ntonnes during the RIP was confusing and that the resulting number of 60 000\ntonnes was in conflict with the evidence relied on in the case[17].\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned in recital (15), the Union industry has submitted that, based on PCI\ndata, there would be a country-wide spare capacity in 2008 exceeding \n60 000 tonnes. It is however noted that, in the\ncalculation submitted by the Union industry, the total US production capacity had been used, i.e. no downwards adjustment to 90% thereof had been\ndone. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the allegations\nregarding the calculation of the spare capacity during the RIP, it is noted\nthat two exporting producers cooperated with the third expiry review investigation.\nDuring that investigation, it was established that INEOS Oxide LLC (hereafter: \"INEOS\") did not have\nany spare capacity during the RIP, whereas Dow Chemical had some. The verified\ninformation shows that Dow Chemical did not use its spare capacity to engage in\nlow-prices exports during the RIP although it could have done so given the low\nlevel of the measures when expressed at an ad valorem equivalent. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\nthe cooperating companies, Dow Chemical and INEOS, represented during the RIP\ntogether 91,6% of exports from the US into the EU. The total exports of Dow Chemical and INEOS amounted\nto 30 000 \u2013 35 000 tonnes; exports from non-cooperating companies were not more\nthan 3 000 \u2013 4 000 tonnes. The country-wide dumping margin during the RIP was de\nminimis and imports from non-cooperating companies\nrepresented less than 1% of EU market. For confidentiality reasons the above\nfigures have either been given in the form of ranges or are not exact figure.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned in recital (16), the Union industry referred to different factors\nwhich would indicate that, according to them, there\nwas still a likelihood of a recurrence of dumping after 2008. However, market conditions have not changed\nmaterially since the publication of the third expiry review Regulation. These\ncircumstances are also acknowledged by the Union industry. However, it should\nbe noted that as mentioned in recitals (30) and(31), given the low level of the\nmeasures and the lack of spare capacity from INEOS as well as the absence of\ndumping from Dow, there is no indication that the repeal of the measure would\nbe likely to change the situation.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An exporting producer\ncommented that the third expiry review should not have concluded with\nRegulation 54/2010 imposing measures. The exporting producer requested that\nmeasures be repealed with retroactive effect so that all duties paid since the\ndate of entry into force of Regulation No 54/2010 be reimbursed to all\nimporters who duly paid them. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This claim is rejected as\nexporting producers other than Dow Chemical could also have brought an action for\nannulment against the Regulation - which was annulled only insofar it concerned the applicant, i.e. Dow Chemical. Therefore, according to the principle of legal certainty and\nfollowing the jurisprudence of the Court[18],\nthe regulation became definitive as regards the other exporting producers.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Account taken of the comments made by parties and the analysis\nthereof, it was concluded that the implementation of the General Court\njudgement implies that during the investigation that resulted in the adoption\nof Regulation No 54/2010, the institutions could not have come to the\nconclusion that dumping had continued during the RIP, nor that there was a\nlikelihood of continuation of dumping. Moreover, the institutions should also\nhave concluded that there was no likelihood of\nrecurrence of dumping.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nthe anti-dumping duty on ethanolamines should not have been reintroduced. With\nrespect to Dow Chemical, it should be recalled that Council Implementing\nRegulation 54/2010 has already been annulled in so far as Dow Chemical is\nconcerned by the judgment of the General Court in case T-158/10. Therefore, for\nthe sake of clarity, it should be pointed out that with regard to imports of\nethanolamines from Dow Chemical, the anti-dumping duties are not in force\nanymore as of the date of entry into force of Council Implementing Regulation\n54/2010 (i.e., 23 January 2010).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FOURTH EXPIRY REVIEW\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the above and\nin particular recital (35), it is considered that the fourth\nexpiry review should be terminated without reimposing a duty.
