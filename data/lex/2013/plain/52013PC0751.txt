The analysis showed that some of the\r\nmeasures do not fall into the scope of Article 290 TFEU. In cases where those\r\nmeasures fulfil the criteria of Article 291 TFEU, it is therefore proposed that\r\nthe Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts. In few cases where the powers\r\ngiven to the Commission are not in accordance with the Treaty, it is proposed\r\nthat the provisions in question are deleted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 METHOD OF THE ADAPTATION\nThe approach followed in this proposal is similar\r\nto the one followed in the preceding proposals (COM(2013)451\r\nand COM(2013)452). Accordingly, the present framework\r\nregulation provides that where legal acts listed in Annex I provide for the use\r\nof Article 5a of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the\r\nprocedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[1]\r\n(\"the Comitology Decision\"), the Commission is empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts, while for legal acts providing for the use of Article 5a of the\r\nComitology Decision which are listed in Annex II, the Commission is empowered\r\nto adopt implementing acts. \nIn cases where one provision contains a\r\nlist of empowerments which, in light of the criteria of Articles 290 and 291\r\nTFEU, are of a differing nature (some empowerments are of delegated and some of\r\nimplementing nature), it is proposed that the empowerment is split.\nIn case of measures listed in Annex I, the\r\nproposal adapts the urgency procedure according to Article 5a(6) of the\r\nComitology Decision to the urgency procedure for delegated acts (Article 3 of the\r\nproposal).\nFor measures listed in Annex II, the\r\nproposal adapts the urgency procedure according to Article 5a(6) of the\r\nComitology Decision to the procedure for immediately applicable implementing\r\nacts under Article 8 of Regulation 182/2011[2]\r\n(\"the Comitology Regulation\") (Article 4(2) of the proposal).\nAdaptation to the delegated act regime and\r\nthe implementing act regime will not affect pending procedures in which an\r\nopinion has already been delivered by a committee in accordance with the\r\nComitology Decision.\nBasic acts which are adapted to the delegated\r\nacts regime are listed in Annex I of the proposal. Basic acts which are adapted\r\nto the implementing acts regime are listed in Annex II of the proposal. Annex III\r\ncontains amendments to the basic acts the provisions of which are deleted. The\r\nlists are organised according to policy areas and chronological order of the\r\nadoption of the instruments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIST OF BASIC ACTS SUBJECT\r\nTO A SEPARATE REVISION\nThe instruments listed hereunder referring\r\nto the RPS for which a separate substantial revision is envisaged, are not\r\nincluded in this proposal, nor in the two preceding alignment proposals. Their alignment\r\nwill be part of those envisaged revisions.\n Field || Instrument \n AGRI || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 \n ESTAT || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 \n ESTAT || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 \n ESTAT || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics \n HOME || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas \n MARKT || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC \n OLAF || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters \n SANCO || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EC \n SANCO || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products \n2013/0365 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nadapting to Article 290 and 291 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union a number of legal acts providing\r\nfor the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43(2), 53(1), 62,\r\n100(2), 114, 168(4)a, 168(4)b, 172, 192(1), 207, 214(3), 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[4],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nTreaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between the powers delegated to the\r\nCommission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement\r\nor amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts),\r\nand the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for\r\nimplementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nmeasures which can be covered by delegations of powers, as referred to in\r\nArticle 290(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\r\ncorrespond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with\r\nscrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC[5]. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to adapt\r\nto Article 290 of the TFEU a number of legal acts already in force which provide for the use of\r\nthe regulatory procedure with scrutiny and which fulfil the criteria of Article\r\n290(1) TFEU.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the Commission\r\nprepares delegated acts on the basis of the legal acts adapted by this\r\nRegulation, it is of particular importance that it carry out appropriate\r\nconsultations, including at expert level. The\r\nCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a\r\nsimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to adapt\r\nto Article 291 of the TFEU a number of legal acts already in force which provide for the use of\r\nthe regulatory procedure with scrutiny and which fulfil the criteria of Article\r\n291(2) of the TFEU.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When implementing powers are\r\nconferred on the Commission, those powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.[6]\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nentry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is also necessary to amend a\r\nnumber of legal acts already in force which provide for\r\nthe use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny by deleting certain measures covered by that procedure.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should not\r\naffect pending procedures in which the committee has already delivered its\r\nopinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC before the entry\r\ninto force of this Regulation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the adaptations and amendments\r\nto be made by this Regulation concern only procedures, they do not, in the case\r\nof directives, need to be transposed by the Member States,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. Where provisions\r\nlisted in Annex I to this Regulation provide for the use of the regulatory\r\nprocedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5a(1) to (5) of Decision\r\n1999/468/EC, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in\r\naccordance with Article 2 of this Regulation.\n2.

A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the\r\npower specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the\r\npublication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union\r\nor at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any\r\ndelegated acts already in force. \n4. As soon as\r\nit adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the\r\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council. \n5.
