Specifically, the authorisation concerned an agreement between the French Republic, acting for Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, and the Union that provided, for that territory,\nfor the application of Union legislation on the taxation of savings and\nadministrative cooperation in the field of taxation\nThe negotiating directives annexed to the\nCouncil's decision laid down, in particular, that:\n- the objective was to conclude an agreement\nproviding for the application to Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy of the mechanisms of Council\nDirective 77/799/EEC and Council Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011\non administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and of Council Directive\n2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income. To do this,\nfurther legislative developments in these areas should be taken into account so\nthat the arrangements applicable to Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy would be equivalent to\nthose applicable in mainland France;\n- the agreement had to cover the arrangements\nprovided for in the Directives referred to above. On the question of taxation\nof savings, it had to cover interest payments, as defined in Article 6 of\nCouncil Directive 2003/48/EC and any amendments, made\u200bby paying agents\nestablished in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy to beneficial owners resident in the EU;\n- the agreement was to be concluded for an\nindefinite period of time.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES \nActing on this authorisation, the European\nCommission drew up a draft agreement, on which negotiations were conducted with\n  France in 2012 and early 2013.\nThe draft agreement was also discussed in the\nEU Council's Working Party on Tax Questions and no Member State entered any\nreservation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for this proposal is provided\nby Articles 113 and 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nin conjunction with Article 218(6)(b) and (8), second subparagraph.

In fact, the\nmeasure is designed to extend the mechanisms of Directives 2011/16/EU and\n2003/48/EC, which are based on these two articles - to relations between the Member States and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.\nAccording to Article 1 of\nthe agreement, its purpose is to ensure the application to Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy of\nthe tax provisions of:\n- Council Directive 2011/16/EU, which repealed\nDirective 77/799/EEC from 1 January 2013, \n- Council Directive 2003/48/EC,\n- and any related acts.\nThe provisions of Article 1(3)\nand Article 2 render the agreement dynamic. It covers not only\nfuture amendments to the two Directives but also any current or future\ndelegated and implementing acts[1].\nThis is needed to ensure identical treatment at all times in situations within\nthe European Union and between the Member States and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.\nArticle 3 provides that the competent authorities are central liaison\noffices, liaison departments and competent officials so as to ensure\nconsistency with any national measures transposing Council Directives\n2011/16/EU and 2003/48/EC which have been taken, or will be taken, by the\nMember States.\nStatistics and information concerning the\napplication of the agreement to the collectivity of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy will be\nsubmitted to the Commission by the French Republic (Article 4).\nProvision is made for the settlement of\ndisputes as follows:\n- a mutual agreement procedure between the\ncompetent authorities of only the Member States concerned where implementation\nor interpretation of the agreement leads to problems or raises issues between\nthese competent authorities (Article 5).
