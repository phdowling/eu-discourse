The Commission proposed the 2003 Decision in\r\norder to institutionalise the practice of high-level consultation between the\r\nEU institutions and the EU social partners. The proposal meant abolishing the\r\nformer Standing Committee on Employment, which was set up in 1970 and reformed\r\nin 1999, but which proved too heavy to be an appropriate forum for EU\r\nconsultation with social partners \u2014 in particular in view of enlargement and at\r\nthat time the prospect of an EU 27 format. It was also too narrow in scope to\r\nenable the social partners to be involved in the EU employment strategy and the\r\nEU integrated economic and social strategy resulting from the Amsterdam Treaty\r\nand the 2000 Lisbon European Council.\nSince 2003, the TSS has been a separate event\r\nfrom the European Council meetings and has broadly fulfilled its aim of\r\nfacilitating the exchange of views at the highest level between the Commission,\r\nthe EU Presidency and the EU social partners on employment and social aspects\r\nof the Lisbon Strategy (since 2010, and then of the Europe 2020 Strategy).\r\nUntil the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the meetings were co-chaired by the\r\nCouncil Presidency and the President of the Commission. The 2003 Decision also\r\ngave a role to the two subsequent Presidencies.\nIn its Communication (COM(2013)690) of 2 October\r\n2013 on the social dimension of the EMU, the Commission announced that it will\r\npresent a proposal to revise the 2003 Council Decision.\n\r\nWHY DOES THE DECISION NEED TO BE REVISED?\n\r\nThe Lisbon Treaty brought in significant institutional\r\nchanges, which justify revising the 2003 Council Decision:\n\u2013                        \r\nIt institutionalised the European Council and created\r\nthe role of President of the European Council (Article 15 TEU);\n\u2013                        \r\nIt recognised the role of the TSS as part of the\r\nEU social dialogue (Article 152 TFEU);\n\u2013                        \r\nIt repealed Article 202 ECT, which was the legal\r\nbasis used to adopt the 2003 Decision (the functions of the Council are now\r\nlaid out in Article 16 TEU and the principles for comitology are in Articles\r\n290 and 291 TFEU).\nFollowing the institutional change brought in by the Lisbon Treaty to\r\ncreate the function of President of the European Council, the 2003 Council\r\nDecision establishing the Tripartite Social Summit needs to be revised. To maintain\r\nthe logic of the Treaty and of the TSS institutional setting, the role and\r\nresponsibilities that the 2003 Council Decision attributed to the rotating\r\nPresidency of the Council should be transferred to the newly created function\r\nof President of the European Council.\nIn addition, the overall policy framework needs to be revised,\r\nreplacing the Lisbon Strategy with the Europe 2020 Strategy and specifying how\r\nthe TSS for Growth and Employment contributes to the overall governance.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nA formal consultation of the social\r\npartners is not required, given the legal basis chosen (see below), but the EU cross-industry social partners were informally consulted on\r\nthe main thrust of this revision. There was broad support for the idea of a\r\nlimited/technical revision to make the technical changes needed as a result of the\r\ninstitutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nLEGAL BASIS\nThe legal basis for adoption of the Council\r\nDecision should be Article 352 TFEU. \nINTER-INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE\r\nREVISION\nA specific aspect of the revision concerns the representation of the\r\nCouncil. Under the current format of TSS meetings, the Council Presidency and\r\nthe two subsequent presidencies participate.\nSpecifically, the current practice in force since 2010 involves the\r\nfollowing arrangements:\n\u2013                        \r\nthe official invitations are signed by the\r\nPresident of the European Council, the President of the Commission and the Head\r\nof State or Government of the Member State holding the Presidency of the EU;\n\u2013                        \r\nthe meeting is co-chaired by the President of\r\nthe Commission and the President of the European Council, who open it and present\r\nthe conclusions respectively. The Head of State or Government of the Member\r\nState holding the Presidency takes the floor once during the meeting;\n\u2013                        \r\nthe Council Presidency and the two subsequent\r\npresidencies participate at the level of Heads of State or Government and of ministers\r\nfor employment.\nOne could argue, in the light of a legally strict interpretation of\r\nArticle 15 TEU, that continuity of the Council participation could be provided\r\nby the participation of the President of the European Council only. Hence there\r\nis no longer a need for the three successive presidencies to participate.\nBut given the positive experience with this format followed since\r\n2010, and the consensus developed around it, the Commission favours a pragmatic\r\nsolution, building on existing practice. This means that the participation of\r\nthe three successive presidencies, at the level of Heads of State or Government\r\nand at the level of ministers for employment, is still justified on the grounds\r\nof continuity of the Council\u2019s tasks under the responsibility of the rotating\r\npresidencies.\nFREQUENCY\nThe current Council Decision provides that the TSS should meet at\r\nleast once a year before the spring European Council. In practice, the TSS has\r\nmet twice a year, with the interactive involvement of the rotating presidencies\r\nsince 2003, before the spring and the autumn meetings of the European Council.\nThe Commission considers that, once again, experience with current\r\npractice has been positive and that the need for an efficient and visible high-level\r\nconcertation between the EU institutions and the EU social partners justifies holding\r\ntwo meetings of the TSS every year. The revision confirms the practice of TSS\r\nmeetings ahead of the spring and autumn meetings of the European Council.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nN/A\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A LIMITED/LIGHT REVISION\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\nThe Commission does not intend at this stage to use the opportunity\r\nof this revision to carry out a profound review of the functioning of the\r\nTripartite Social Summit. The Summit has always been considered by the social\r\npartners as a privileged forum to discuss social and employment issues at the\r\nhighest level, ahead of the Spring and Autumn European Council, in the presence\r\nof Heads of State or Government and ministers of employment and social affairs\r\nof the rotating presidencies. It also provides an opportunity for the\r\nrepresentatives of EU institutions attending the TSS to hear the views and\r\nproposals from both sides of the social dialogue spectrum, enabling them to pass\r\non these views subsequently to European Council members.\n\r\nThe Commission favours a proposal that adapts the current Decision to the institutional changes brought in\r\nby the Treaty of Lisbon, while reflecting the positive results of recent\r\npractical experience with the TSS. A few editing adjustments are also\r\nintroduced to improve the technical quality of the text. This will ensure a swift revision process.\n2013/0361 (APP)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non a Tripartite Social Summit for Growth\r\nand Employment\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nfunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 352,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[1],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 3 TEU provides\r\nthat one of the objectives of the European Union is to develop a highly\r\ncompetitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social\r\nprogress \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In defining and\r\nimplementing its policies and activities, the Union must take into account\r\ntheir social dimension, specifically the requirements linked to the promotion\r\nof a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the\r\nfight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and\r\nprotection of human health, in line with Article 9 TFEU.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union recognises and\r\npromotes the role of the social partners at its level and facilitates dialogue\r\nbetween them while respecting their autonomy, in line with Article 152 TFEU.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To promote a high-level\r\nconcertation with EU social partners on the overall strategy set up by the\r\nLisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000, the Union has established a\r\nTripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment, which is now recognised in Article\r\n152 TFEU as an integral component of social dialogue at EU level.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union and the Member\r\nStates are committed to cooperate within the framework of an integrated\r\nstrategy designed to boost the EU\u2019s potential for growth and jobs over the\r\ndecade 2010-2020, the Europe 2020 Strategy.

It has contributed positively to the\r\ndevelopment of social dialogue at EU level under the Lisbon Strategy over the\r\ndecade 2000-2010 and under the current Europe 2020 Strategy.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tasks and the\r\nmembership of the Tripartite Social Summit should be adapted in order to take\r\ninto account the institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon,\r\nnotably the creation of the function of President of the European Council, as\r\nlaid down in Article 15 TEU.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision is without\r\nprejudice to the organisation and operation of the national systems of\r\nindustrial relations and social dialogue.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\r\nTask\nThe task of the Tripartite Summit for\r\nGrowth and Employment shall be to ensure, in compliance with the Treaty and\r\nwith due regard for the powers of the institutions and bodies of the Union,\r\nthat there is a continuous concertation between the Council, the Commission and\r\nthe social partners.
