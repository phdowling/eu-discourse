Therefore, the claims for 2014 will be treated under transitional\nrules. \nAs for the second pillar, the definition of\ntransitional rules between the two programming periods represents standard\npractice. Transitional rules are generally needed to bridge the two consecutive\nprogramming periods, as already experienced at the beginning of the current\nprogramming period. However, for rural development, there is this time also a\nneed for some specific transitional arrangements, notably to deal with the\nimplications which the delay of the new direct payment regime has for certain\nrural development measures especially as regards the baseline for\nagri-environment and climate measures and the application of the\ncross-compliance rules. Transitional arrangements are also needed to ensure\nthat MS can keep on undertaking new commitments for area and animal-related\nmeasures in 2014 even if the resources for the current period have been\nexhausted. These new commitments, as well as corresponding on-going commitments\nshall be eligible from the new financial envelopes of the rural development\nprogrammes of the next programming period. \nFor the horizontal regulation, the need for\ntransitional measures is limited to the FAS, IACS and cross-compliance, due to\ntheir link to the direct payments. \nIn light of the above, specific\ntransitional rules need to be adopted by the Council and the European\nParliament before the end of the year, amending the current CAP basic acts\nwhere necessary.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn relation to the transitional rules,\nthere was no need for consultation of interested parties or an impact\nassessment since these adjustments follow from the state of play of the\ndiscussions between the Institutions regarding the MFF and the CAP reform.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nFor direct payments, the transitional\nmeasures first provide for the prolongation of the main elements of the\nexisting schemes \u2013 SPS, SAPS, coupled regimes, also those granted as specific\nsupport under Article 68 \u2013 for claim year 2014. Secondly, they incorporate,\nsubject to agreement of the European Parliament the financial impacts of the European\nCouncil conclusions of 8 February; including the start of the external\nconvergence process. The introduction of transitional measures implies that\ncertain of the dates included in the Commission proposal for direct support\nafter 2013 will have to be adapted accordingly in order to ensure consistency\nwith this draft Regulation. \nFor rural development, transitional rules\nwill have to be established to define how the current measures would be carried\nover to the next programming period, including their financing from the new\nfinancial envelope. In addition, these rules define which baseline and\ncross-compliance rules should apply in 2014. Finally, these rules establish\ntransitional provisions for Croatia. \nThe transitional measures also include\nprovisions regarding the possibility for Member States to transfer funds\nbetween pillars. Such flexibility mechanism is an element of the CAP reform to\nbe decided by ordinary legislative procedure. Both the European Parliament on\n13 March 2013 and the Agriculture Council on 19 March 2013 took position on\nthis issue. Whilst the Council took over the European Council conclusions on\nthe MFF, the EP increased the percentages proposed by the Commission to 15% for\ntransfer to the second pillar and 10% for transfers to the first pillar, the\nlatter being allowed only to those MS with an average payment below 90% of the\nEU average. To indicate that the present proposal is without prejudice to the\nfinal decision that will be taken by the legislator on this specific element,\nthe parts of the Article included in the transitional measures that differ from\nArticle 14 of the Commission proposal for direct support after 2013 have been\nput within square brackets.  \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis draft Regulation only implements the\nCommission proposals on the MFF and the CAP reform for financial year 2015\ntaking into account the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013. It\nincorporates the external convergence of the direct payments, the flexibility\nbetween the CAP pillars and the co-financing rate for rural development. The\nnew elements arising from the European Council conclusions are put within\nsquare brackets pending the final agreement on the MFF. \nFor direct payments, the European Council\nconclusions of 8 February 2013 correspond, compared to the Commission proposal,\nto a reduction of EUR 830 million (in current prices) in financial year 2015 (corresponding\nto claim year 2014 for direct payments). The distribution of direct payments\nceilings among Member States takes account of the external convergence as it\nshould start from financial year 2015. Compared to the Commission proposal, the\nEuropean Council conclusions modify the timeframe of the convergence (6 years)\nand add a minimum of 196 EUR/ha to be reached by financial year 2020. \nCompared to the Commission proposal, the\nflexibility between pillars is increased according to the European Council\nconclusions. It will be budgetary neutral as exactly the same amounts reduced\nfrom one Fund (EAGF or EAFRD) will be made available to the other Fund (EAGF or\nEAFRD).\nAs regards rural development, this draft\nRegulation aims to ensure the continuity of a number of measures involving\nmultiannual commitments. Those provisions have no financial impact as the rural\ndevelopment allocation remains unchanged. However, the distribution over time\nof the payments might be slightly different than otherwise but it cannot be\nquantified at this stage.\nDetails on the financial impact of this\nproposal are set out in the financial statement accompanying the proposals. \n2013/0117 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down certain transitional\nprovisions on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund\nfor Rural Development (EAFRD) and amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0 [RD] as regards\nresources and their distribution in respect of the year 2014 and amending\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Regulations (EU) No [DP], (EU) No [HZ]\nand (EU) No [sCMO] as regards their application in the year 2014\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[2],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [\u2026]\n[RD] of the European Parliament and of the Council of\u2026 on support for rural\ndevelopment by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)[3], which is to apply from 1\nJanuary 2014, lays down rules governing Union support for rural development and\nrepeals Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support\nfor rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development\n(EAFRD)[4],\nwithout prejudice to the continued application of the Regulations implementing\nthat Regulation until they are repealed by the Commission. To facilitate the\ntransition from existing support schemes under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 to\nthe new legal framework which covers the programming period starting on 1\nJanuary 2014 (\"the new programming period\"), transitional rules\nshould be adopted to avoid any difficulties or delays in the implementation of\nrural development support, which may result from the time of adoption of the\nnew rural development programs. For that reason it should be provided that\nMember States may continue to undertake legal commitments under their existing\nrural development programs in 2014 for certain measures and that the resulting\nexpenditure shall be eligible for support in the new programming period. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the substantial\nchange in the method for the delimitation of areas facing significant natural\nconstraints proposed for the forthcoming programming period, it should be\nprovided that for new legal commitments undertaken in 2014 the obligation for\nthe farmer to continue farming in the area for 5 years does not apply.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure legal certainty\nin the transition it should be provided that expenditure undertaken pursuant to\nRegulation (EC) No 1698/2005 under area and animal related measures should be\neligible for an EAFRD contribution in the new programming period when there are\nstill payments to be made. In the interest of sound financial management and\neffective programme implementation, such expenditure should be clearly\nidentified in the rural development programmes and throughout the management\nand control systems of the Member States. In order to avoid unnecessary\ncomplexity in the financial management of rural development programmes in the new\nprogramming period, it should be provided that the co-financing rates of the new\nprogramming period shall apply to transitional expenditure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU)\nNo [\u2026] of the European Parliament and of Council of\u2026 establishing rules\nfor direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of\nthe common agricultural policy [DP][5] sets up new support schemes and is to apply\nfrom 1 January 2014. That date of application would not allow that the\nadministrative and practical arrangements needed for the lodging of applications\nfor 2014 are set up in time. For that reason, the application of the new direct\npayments regime needs to be postponed by one year. Council Regulation (EC) No\n73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes\nfor farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain\nsupport schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and\nestablishing certain support schemes for farmers[6]\nshould therefore continue to form the basis on which to grant income support\nfor farmers in calendar year 2014, while taking due account of [Regulation\nlaying down the Multiannual Financial Framework][7].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that Regulation (EC)\nNo 73/2009 is to continue to apply in 2014 and in order to ensure consistency\nin the implementation of the provisions on cross-compliance and the respect of\nthe standards required by certain measures, it should be provided that the\nrelevant provisions that apply in the 2007-2013 programming period continue to\napply until the new legislative framework becomes applicable. For the same\nreasons, it should be provided that the provisions relating to complementary\nnational direct payments for Croatia that apply in 2013 continue to apply.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 76 of Regulation (EU) No [\u2026][HZ] of the European\nParliament and the Council[8]\n Member States will be able to pay advances for the direct payments. Under\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 such possibility needs to be authorised by the\nCommission. Experience in the implementation of direct support schemes\nshows that it is appropriate to allow for farmers to receive\nadvance payments. As regard applications made in 2014, those advances should be\nlimited to up to 50% of the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation\n(EC) No 73/2009 and to up to 80% of the beef and veal payment. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to respect [Regulation laying down the Multiannual Financial\nFramework], and in particular the levelling\nof the amount available for granting direct support to farmers as well as the\nexternal convergence mechanism, it is necessary to modify the national ceilings\nfixed in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for 2014. The modification of\nthe national ceilings will inevitably have an impact on the amounts that\nindividual farmers may receive as direct payments in 2014. The way in which\nthis modification will impact on the value of payment entitlements and the\nlevel of other direct payments should therefore be laid down. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience gained in the financial implementation of Regulation\n(EC) No 73/2009 showed that there was a need for clarifying certain provisions,\nin particular as regards the elements covered by the figures set out in Annex\nVIII to that Regulation and the link with the possibility given to Members\nStates to use the funds unspent in the single payment scheme to finance the\nspecific support. As Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 has to be\nmodified in order to make clear how Member States will have to take into\naccount the variations in the national ceilings, it is appropriate to take this\nas an opportunity to clarify the wording of the relevant provisions.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Member States had the\npossibility to decide to use a certain percentage of their national ceiling for\nspecific support for their farmers as well as to review a previous decision by\ndeciding to modify, or put an end to, such support. It is appropriate to\nprovide for an additional review of those decisions with effect from calendar year\n2014. At the same time, the special conditions under which the specific support\nis paid in some Member States pursuant Article 69(5) of Regulation (EC) No\n73/2009, which are due to expire in 2013, need to be extended for one more\nyear, in order to avoid disruption in the degree of support. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The single area payment scheme laid down in Regulation (EC) No\n73/2009 has a transitional nature and was due to end on 31 December 2013. Since\nthe new basic payment scheme will replace the single payment scheme only as\nfrom 1 January 2015, an extension of the single area payment scheme for the\nyear 2014 is necessary in order to prevent new Member States from having to\napply the single payment scheme for only one year.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to allowing Member States to address the needs of their\nagricultural sectors or to strengthen their rural development policy in a more\nflexible way, they should be given the possibility to transfer funds from their\ndirect payments ceilings to their support assigned for rural development and\nfrom the suport assigned for rural development to their direct payments\nceilings. At the same time, Member States where the level of direct support\nremains lower than 90 % of the Union average level of support should be given\nthe possibility to transfer additional funds from their support assigned for\nrural development to their direct payments ceilings. Such choices should be\nmade, within certain limits, once and for the whole period of financial years\n2015-2020.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 22 of Directive 2000/60/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a\nframework for Community action in the field of water policy[9], Council Directive 80/68/EEC of\n17 December 1979 on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by\ncertain dangerous substances[10] is repealed from 22\nDecember 2013. In order to maintain the rules under cross compliance related to\nprotection of groundwater, it is appropriate to adjust the scope of\ncross-compliance and to define a standard of good agricultural and\nenvironmental condition encompassing the requirements of Articles 4 and 5 of\nDirective 80/68/EEC. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [\u2026][sCMO]\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[11]\nprovides for the integration of the support for silkworm rearing into the\ndirect support regime and therefore its removal from Regulation (EU) No [\u2026][sCMO].\nIn view of the delayed application of the new direct support regime, it is\nappropriate to provide for the continuation of the aids in the silkworm sector for\none more year.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the provisions on\nthe farm advisory system, the integrated administration and control system and\ncross compliance laid down in Title III, Chapter II of Title V and Title VI,\nrespectively, of Regulation (EU) No [\u2026][HZ] of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common\nagricultural policy[12]\nshould apply from 1 January 2015.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the insertion of\nArticle 136a into Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and the replacement of Article 14\nof Regulation (EU) No [DP], which applies from 1 January 2015, references to\nArticle 14 of Regulation (EU) No [DP] in Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [RD] need to be\namended. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulations (EC) No 73/2009, (EU) No [\u2026][DP], (EU) No [\u2026][HZ], (EU) No [\u2026][sCMO]\nand (EU) No [\u2026] [RD] should therefore be amended\naccordingly.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nRegulation should apply from 1\nJanuary 2014. In order to avoid any overlap between the rules on flexibility\nbetween pillars laid down in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\nand Regulation (EU) No [DP] as amended by this Regulation, it is appropriate to provide that that particular amendment to\nRegulation (EC) No 73/2009 is to apply from the date of entry into force of this\nRegulation and that the amendments of Regulation (EU) No [DP], including its deferred\napplication from 1 January 2015, are to apply from the date of entry into force\nof Regulation (EU) No [DP]. Furthermore, the amendment\nof Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should apply from 22\nDecember 2013, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER 1\nTransitional provisions on support for\nrural development\nArticle 1\nLegal commitments under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 in 2014\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of derogation from Article\n94 of Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [RD], for the measures of Article 36(a)(i) to (v)\nand (b)(iv) and (v) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, Member States may continue\nto undertake new legal commitments to beneficiaries in 2014 pursuant to the\nrural development programmes adopted on the basis of Regulation (EC) No\n1698/2005 even after the financial resources of the 2007-2013 programming\nperiod have been used up, until the adoption of the respective rural\ndevelopment programme for the 2014-2020 programming period.

This draft regulation aims to prolong some elements of the existing schemes, incorporating the effect of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) agreement on external convergence of the direct payments, flexibility between the CAP pillars and the co-financing rate for rural development. There is no financial consequence as such since this draft Regulation only implements the Commission proposals on the MFF and the CAP reform taking into account the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013. The new elements arising from the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013 are put within square brackets pending the final agreement on the MFF.   As regards direct payments, external convergence and flexibility between pillars are applicable as of financial year 2015 (corresponding to claim year 2014 for direct payments). Compared to the Commission proposal and its financial statement, the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013 correspond to a reduction of EUR 830 million (in current prices) for direct payments in claim year 2014 (EUR 5 million for the crop specific payment for cotton and EUR 825 million for Annex VIII).   Concerning the flexibility between pillars, it is not possible to assess the financial impact yet as Member States will have to notify their transfers to the Commission later this year. In any case, the flexibility will be budgetary neutral as exactly the same amounts reduced from one Fund (EAGF or EAFRD) will be made available to the other Fund (EAGF or EAFRD).   As regards rural development, this draft Regulation aims to ensure the continuity of a number of measures involving multiannual commitments. Also for those measures, the draft Regulation intends that, for commitments undertaken during 2007-2013, the corresponding expenditure can be eligible after 2015 (if there are payments to be made) under the new programming period, or before when the current financial allocation has been exhausted. Those provisions have no financial impact as the rural development allocation remains unchanged. However, the distribution over time of the payments might be slightly different than otherwise but it cannot be quantified at this stage.     \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p.
