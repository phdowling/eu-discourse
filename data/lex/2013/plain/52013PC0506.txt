In particular, it provides for\r\nthe creation of public-private partnerships that will contribute to tackling\r\nsome of the key challenges Europe is facing.\nThis proposal provides for a prolongation\r\nof the Joint Undertaking in the field of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen launched under\r\nSeventh Framework Programme, in line with the Commission Communication'\r\nPublic-private partnerships, in Horizon 2020: a powerful tool to deliver on\r\ninnovation and growth in Europe'[1],\r\nCommission Communications 'Energy 2020 - A strategy for\r\ncompetitive, sustainable and secure energy'[2]\r\nand 'Clean Power for Transport: A European alternative\r\nfuels'[3].\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reasons and objectives for\r\na JU in the area of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen\nA JU in the area of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen\r\nis needed:\n\u00b7                        \r\nto address two key challenges for the EU - to\r\nensure the energy security of supply and to boost/maintain competitiveness;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto support EU policies on sustainable energy and\r\ntransport, climate change, the environment and industrial competitiveness as\r\nembodied in the Europe 2020 strategy for growth, and help achieve the EU\u2019s\r\noverarching objective of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto tackle a series of obstacles to effective\r\nresearch and innovation in this area: high risks, high cost of R&D,\r\nknowledge spillovers, market failures. Industry on its own only cannot invest\r\nin view of these obstacles, and hence public support is needed;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto counteract the fragmentation of the Member\r\nStates programmes and achieve the coordinated, long-term, large-scale,\r\ntransnational, cross-sectoral effort required;\n\u00b7                        \r\nto help industry to set a long-term research and\r\ninnovation agenda, create the necessary critical mass, leverage private\r\ninvestment, provide stable funding, facilitate knowledge sharing, reduce risk,\r\nlower costs and reduce time to market.\nThe general objective of the FCH 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking for the period of 2014-2024 is to develop a strong, sustainable and\r\nglobally competitive fuel cells and hydrogen sector in the Union, in particular\r\nto:\n\u2013              \r\nreduce the production cost of fuel cell systems\r\nto be used in transport applications, while increasing their lifetime to levels competitive with conventional\r\ntechnologies,\n\u2013              \r\nincrease the electrical efficiency and the\r\ndurability of the different fuel cells used for power production, while\r\nreducing costs, to levels competitive with conventional technologies,\n\u2013              \r\nincrease the energy efficiency of production of\r\nhydrogen from water electrolysis while reducing capital costs, so that the\r\ncombination of the hydrogen and the fuel cell system is competitive with the\r\nalternatives available in the marketplace, and\n\u2013              \r\ndemonstrate on a large scale the feasibility of\r\nusing hydrogen to support integration of renewable energy sources into the\r\nenergy systems, including through its use as a competitive energy storage\r\nmedium for electricity produced from renewable energy sources.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building on past\r\nexperience\nThe proposed Joint Undertaking 2 builds\r\nupon the achievements of the previous one under FP7. The main achievements of\r\nthe existing FCH Joint Undertaking have so far been the creation of strong\r\npartnership, the leveraging of public and private funding and the strong\r\ninvolvement of industry (in particular SMEs). Also, the existing FCH Joint\r\nUndertaking has put in place a significant project portfolio of strategic\r\nimportance. For both energy and transport applications substantial\r\ntechnological progress took place. Market introduction has been achieved for\r\nsome early applications such as forklifts and small back-up power units. It has\r\nalso encouraged industry, Member States and the research community to commit\r\nmore of their own resources. Large industry and SME participation is stable and\r\nsignificantly higher than in FP7-Energy. \nThe first interim evaluation, finalised in\r\n2011 with the help of independent experts, concluded that the Joint Undertaking\r\napproach generally succeeds to enhance public-private activities in technology\r\ndevelopment and demonstration, and provides stability for the R&D\r\ncommunity. The overall technical objectives of the FCH Joint Undertaking were\r\njudged ambitious and competitive.\nAlthough the FCH sector has reached an\r\nadvanced stage of innovation it is still a pre-mature and vulnerable one.\r\nCarrying FCH technologies from the drawing board to full deployment in a global\r\ncompetitive environment requires a substantial increase in public and private\r\nR&D investment in Member States as well as in Associated Countries. The\r\npublic means available in the EU for FCH research, both in the Member States\r\nand in the Framework Programme will not suffice to cover the estimated\r\nfinancial resources needed to implement the FCH Technology Roadmap for the\r\nperiod 2014-2020[4].\r\nBut an ambitious public policy can provide the required positive environment to\r\nleverage the private investment necessary to complement the public support and\r\nfulfil the R&D needs.\nThe proposal for the continuation of the\r\nFCH Joint Undertaking includes provisions aiming at simplification and\r\nflexibility of operations. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with the stakeholders and\r\nImpact Assessment\nResults of consultations\n\u00b7                        \r\nStakeholder groups representing the industry and\r\nresearch communities, the Member States and the general public have been\r\nconsulted on the continuation of FCH Joint Undertaking under Horizon 2020. Several\r\nworkshops and ad-hoc meetings were organised in the course of 2012 to discuss\r\npriorities for research on fuel cells and hydrogen, and define the best\r\nmechanism to implement the research & innovation programme at European\r\nlevel. In the second part of 2012, a stakeholder survey was sent to all the\r\nbeneficiaries of the FCH Joint Undertaking and 154 responses were received,\r\nincluding 46 from the Industry Grouping. 93% of the beneficiaries that\r\nresponded indicated that they favour the continuation of the FCH Joint\r\nUndertaking. Moreover, 70% of the members of the Industry Grouping have seen\r\ntheir turnover on FCH increase since 2007 and 70% have raised their\r\nexpenditures on R&D. About half of the responding members reported\r\nincreased expenditures on R&D as a direct result of the establishment of\r\nthe JU.\n\u00b7                        \r\nA public consultation was conducted\r\nbetween July and October 2012 and 127 responses were received. Most respondents\r\nagree on the fact that FCH technology will play a notable role in the future EU\r\nlow-carbon energy and transport sectors (98% of respondents), for the EU energy\r\nsecurity of supply (94%) and for the EU industrial competitiveness (95%). The\r\nresults of the public consultations concerning a Public-Private Partnership\r\n(PPP) in Fuel Cell and Hydrogen under Horizon 2020 are available on-line at: http://ec.europa.eu/research/consultations/fch_h2020/fch-f2020-consultation-results.pdf\nImpact Assessment\nThe proposed Regulation has been subject to a Commission Impact\r\nAssessment which is attached to the proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the proposal\n\u00b7       \r\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal consists of a Council\r\nRegulation on the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking. The FCH Joint\r\nUndertaking was initially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 of\r\n30 May 2008 which is to be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.\n\u00b7       \r\nLegal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nThe Rules for Participation and\r\nDissemination of Horizon 2020 will apply.\n\u00b7       \r\nSubsidiarity and proportionality\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States because the scale of the challenge\r\nexceeds the capacity of any Member State to act alone. Significant differences\r\nexisting among national programmes, their fragmentation and sometimes\r\noverlapping call for a more efficient intervention at European Union level. The\r\npooling and coordination of research and development efforts at EU level stand\r\na better chance of success, given the trans-national nature of the\r\ninfrastructure and technologies to be developed, and also the need to achieve a\r\nsufficient mass of resources. The intervention of the European Union will help\r\nto rationalise research programmes and ensure inter-operability of the\r\ndeveloped systems not only through common pre-normative research to support the\r\npreparation of standards but also through the de facto standardisation\r\nwhich will arise from the close research cooperation and the trans-national\r\ndemonstration projects. This standardisation will open a wider market and\r\npromote competition. The scope of the proposal should encourage the Member\r\nStates to pursue complementary initiatives at national level, in the spirit of\r\nreinforcing the European Research Area - indeed the very intention of the Joint\r\nundertaking is to leverage these national and regional programmes to make best\r\nuse of the combined efforts.\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality,\r\nthe provisions of this regulation do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve\r\nits objectives.\n\u00b7       \r\nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason:\nThe creation of an\r\nundertaking in which the Union participates requires a Council regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implication\nThe EU budget, totalling up to EUR 700 million[5] (including EFTA), will come\r\nfrom the \u2018Secure, clean and efficient energy\u2019 and the \u2018Smart, green and\r\nintegrated transport\u2019 H2020 societal challenges budget.\nThe administrative costs of the FCH 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking shall not exceed EUR 40 million and shall be covered in cash, on an\r\nannual basis, divided equally between the Union and the Members other than the Union. The Union shall contribute with 50%, the Industry Grouping\r\nwith 43% and the Research Grouping with 7%.\nThe research activities shall be funded by\r\nthe EU and the constituent entities of the Members other than the Union participating\r\nin the indirect actions, with the EU contribution paid in cash and the\r\ncontributions from the constituent entities of the other Members made in-kind within\r\nthe indirect actions.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optional elements\n\u00b7       \r\nTransition period\nFollowing the adoption of the draft\r\nRegulation on Fuel Cells and Hydrogen, the Regulation 521/2008 will be\r\nrepealed; however actions initiated under Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 and\r\nfinancial obligations related to those actions shall continue to be governed by\r\nthat Regulation until their completion.\n\u00b7       \r\nReview\nThe European Commission will present an\r\nannual report on the progress achieved by the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking. The\r\nEuropean Commission will also perform a mid-term review and a final review at\r\nthe termination of the Joint Undertaking.\nDischarge for the implementation of the Union\r\ncontribution shall be part of the discharge given by the European Parliament,\r\nupon recommendation of the Council, to the Commission in accordance with the\r\nprocedure provided for in Article 319 of the Treaty.\n\u00b7       \r\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes\r\na review clause.\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0245 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 187 and the first\r\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[6]\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEconomic and Social Committee[7],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public-private\r\npartnerships in the form of Joint Technology Initiatives were initially provided\r\nfor in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\r\nof 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework programme of the European\r\nCommunity for research, technological development and demonstration activities\r\n(2007-2013)[8] .\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2006/971/EC\r\nof 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019 implementing\r\nthe Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research,\r\ntechnological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[9] identified specific\r\npublic-private partnerships to be supported, including a public-private\r\npartnership in the specific area of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology\r\nInitiative.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe 2020 Strategy[10] underscores the need to\r\ndevelop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and innovation so as\r\nto achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Union. Both European\r\nParliament and Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing Horizon\r\n2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[11] aims to achieve a greater\r\nimpact on research and innovation by combining Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\r\nand private sector funds in public-private partnerships in key areas where\r\nresearch and innovation can contribute to Union's wider competitiveness goals\r\nand help tackle societal challenges. The involvement of the Union in those\r\npartnerships may take the form of financial contributions to joint undertakings\r\nestablished on the basis of Article 187 of the Treaty under Decision No\r\n1982/2006/EC.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\r\nDecision (EU) No [\u2026]/2013 of the Council of [\u2026] 2013 establishing the Specific\r\nProgramme implementing Horizon 2020 (2014-2020)[12] further support should be provided to\r\njoint undertakings established under Decision (EU) No 1982/2006/EC under the conditions specified in\r\nDecision (EU) No [\u2026]/2013.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Fuel Cells and\r\nHydrogen Joint Undertaking, set up by Regulation (EC) No. 521(2008) of the\r\nCouncil of 30 May 2008 setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking[13] has demonstrated the potential\r\nof hydrogen as an energy carrier, and of fuel cells as energy converters, to\r\noffer a pathway for clean systems that reduce emissions, enhance energy\r\nsecurity, and stimulate the economy. The interim evaluation of the FCH Joint\r\nUndertaking[14]\r\nhas shown that the Joint Undertaking has served as a platform for creating of a\r\nstrong partnership, for leveraging public and private funding and for the\r\nstrong involvement of industry, in particular SMEs. The also recommended increase\r\nin the activities on hydrogen production, storage and distribution has been\r\ntaken up in the new objectives. Its research area should therefore continue to\r\nbe supported with the aim of developing, to the point of market introduction, a\r\nportfolio of clean, efficient and affordable solutions.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continued support for the Fuel Cells and\r\nHydrogen research programme should also take into\r\naccount the experience acquired from the operations of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking including\r\nthe results of its first interim evaluation, the results of stakeholders' recommendations[15], and be implemented using a\r\nmore fit-for-purpose structure and rules in order to enhance efficiency and to ensure\r\nsimplification. To this effect, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nshould adopt financial rules specific to its needs in accordance with Article\r\n209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general\r\nbudget of the Union[16].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Members other than the\r\nUnion of the FCH Joint Undertaking have expressed in writing their agreement for\r\nthe research activities in the area of the FCH Joint Undertaking to be pursued within\r\na structure better adapted to the nature of a public-private partnership. It is\r\nappropriate that the Members other than the Union to the Fuel Cells and\r\nHydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking accept the Statutes set out in Annex to this\r\nRegulation by means of a letter of endorsement.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve its\r\nobjectives, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking should provide\r\nfinancial support mainly in the form of grants to participants following open\r\nand competitive calls for proposals.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contributions from Members\r\nother than the Union and their constituent entities should not only be limited\r\nto the administrative costs of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking\r\nand to the co-financing required to carry out research and innovation actions\r\nsupported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their contributions should\r\nalso relate to additional activities to be undertaken by the Members other than\r\nthe Union or their constituent entities, as specified in an additional\r\nactivities plan. In order to get a proper overview of\r\nthe leverage effect those additional activities should represent contributions\r\nto the broader FCH Joint Technology Initiative.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nspecificities of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen sector, in particular that it is\r\nstill a pre-mature sector, without clear returns of investments and its main\r\nbenefits being societal ones, justify that the Union contribution is higher\r\nthan the contribution from the Members other than the Union. In order to\r\nencourage broader representativeness of the groupings that are members of the Fuel\r\nCells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking and support participation of new\r\nconstituent entities in the Joint Technology Initiative, the Union contribution\r\nshould be divided in two instalments, the second of which should be made\r\nconditional upon additional commitments, in particular from new constituent\r\nentities.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nassessing the overal impact of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology\r\nInitiative, the investments from all legal entities other than the Union contributing\r\nto the objectives of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative\r\nwill be taken into account. These overall investments to the Fuel Cells and\r\nHydrogen Joint Technology Initiative are expected to amount to at least EUR 700\r\nmillion.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation\r\nin indirect actions funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking should\r\ncomply with Regulation (EU) No \u2026 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of \u2026 2013 laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination\r\nin \u2018Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation\r\n(2014-2020)\u2019[17].\r\n\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nUnion financial contribution should be managed in accordance with the principle\r\nof sound financial management and with the relevant rules on indirect\r\nmanagement set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Commission delegated\r\nRegulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[18].\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of Union\r\nfunds under this Regulation should be carried out in such a manner that\r\nadministrative burden is reduced, in compliance with Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\r\n[the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\r\nthe Union and of the other members of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the\r\nexpenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of\r\nirregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used\r\nand, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission's internal\r\nauditor should exercise the same powers over the FCH 2 Joint Undertaking as\r\nthose exercised in respect of the Commission.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n287(1) of the Treaty, the constituent instrument of bodies, offices or agencies\r\nset up by the Union may preclude the examination of the accounts of all revenue\r\nand expenditure of those bodies, offices or agencies by the Court of Auditors. In\r\naccordance with Article 60(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the\r\naccounts of the bodies under Article 209 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 are\r\nto be examined by an independent audit body which is to give an opinion inter\r\nalia on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the\r\nunderlying transactions. Avoidance of duplication of the examination of the\r\naccounts justifies that the accounts of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking should not be subject to the examination by the Court of Auditors.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty on the European Union, the objectives of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2\r\nJoint Undertaking in strengthening industrial research and innovation across\r\nthe Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of avoiding duplication, retaining critical mass and\r\nensuring that public financing is used in an optimal way, be better achieved by\r\nthe Union; this Regulation confines itself to the minimum required in order to\r\nachieve those objectives and does not go beyond what is necessary for that\r\npurpose;\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FCH Joint Undertaking\r\nwas set up for a period up to 31 December 2017. The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2\r\nJoint Undertaking should provide continued support to the Fuel Cells and\r\nHydrogen research programme by enlarging the scope of the activities under a\r\nmodified set of rules. The transition from the FCH Joint Undertaking to the\r\nFuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking should be aligned and synchronized\r\nwith the transition from the Seventh Framework Programme to the Horizon 2020\r\nFramework Programme to ensure optimal use of the funding available for\r\nresearch. In the interest of legal certainty and clarity, Council Regulation\r\n(EC) No. 521/2008 should therefore be repealed and transitional provisions\r\nshould be set out.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nEstablishment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the implementation of\r\nthe Joint Technology Initiative on Fuel Cells and Hydrogen, a joint undertaking\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 187 of the Treaty (hereinafter \u2018FCH 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking\u2019), is established for a period from 1 January 2014 until 31\r\nDecember 2024.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FCH 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking shall replace and succeed the FCH Joint Undertaking as established\r\nby Council Regulation (EC) No 521/2008.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FCH 2 Joint\r\nUndertaking shall constitute a body entrusted with the implementation of a public-private\r\npartnership referred to in Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European\r\nParliament and the Council[19].\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FCH\r\n2 Joint Undertaking shall have legal personality.

Monitoring\r\narrangements, including membership of the Governing board, of the FCH 2 JU and\r\nreporting arrangements will ensure that the Commission services can meet the\r\naccountability requirements both to the College and to the Budgetary Authority.\nThe internal control framework for the FCH 2 JU is built on:\n-the implementation of the Internal Control Standards offering at\r\nleast equivalent guarantees to those of the Commisson;\n-procedures for selecting the best projects through independent\r\nevaluation, and for translating them into legal instruments;\n- project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every\r\nproject;\n-ex-ante checks on 100% of claims, including receipt of audit\r\ncertificates and ex-ante certification of cost methodologies; \n- ex post audits on a sample of claims as part of the Horizon 2020\r\nex-post audits;\n- and scientific evaluation of project results.\nVarious measures have been established to mitigate the inherent risk\r\nof conflict of interest within the FCH 2 JU, especially equal votes for the\r\nCommission and for industrial partners in the Governing Board, selection of the\r\nExecutive Director by the Governing Board based on a proposal by the Commission,\r\nindependence of staff, evaluations by independent experts based on published\r\nselection criteria together with appeal mechanisms and full declarations of any\r\ninterests.

He/she\r\nwill be required to report to the Commission on the internal control framework\r\nadopted.\nThe Commission will monitor the risk of non-compliance through the\r\nreporting system that it will develop, as well as by following the results of\r\nex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from the FCH 2 JU, as part of ex\r\npost audits covering the whole of the Horizon 2020.\nThe European Council of February 4th 2011 concluded that \u2018it is\r\ncrucial that EU instruments aimed at fostering R&D&I be simplified [\u2026],\r\nin particular by agreeing between the relevant institutions a new balance\r\nbetween trust and control and between risk taking and risk avoidance\u2019.\r\nMoreover, the European Parliament, in its Resolution of 11 November 2010\r\n(P7_TA(2010)0401) on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework\r\nProgrammes explicitly supports a higher risk of errors for research funding and\r\n\u2018expresses its concern that the current system and the practice of FP7\r\nmanagement are excessively control-oriented\u2019.\nThere is therefore an acceptance among stakeholders and Institutions\r\nthat the whole range of objectives and interests, especially the success of the\r\nResearch policy, international competitiveness and scientific excellence,\r\nshould be considered, along with the error rate. At the same time, there is a\r\nclear need to manage the budget in an efficient and effective manner, and to\r\nprevent fraud and waste. \nAs stated above, the Commission will monitor the risk of\r\nnon-compliance through the reporting system that it will establish , as well as\r\nby following the results of ex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from\r\nthe FCH 2 JU, as part of the ex post audits covering the whole of the Horizon\r\n2020. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected level of risk of\r\nnon-compliance \nAs the Commission reported in the Legislative Financial Statement\r\nfor Horizon 2020, it remains the ultimate objective to achieve a residual error\r\nrate of less than 2% of total expenditure over the lifetime of the programme,\r\nand to that end, it has introduced a number of simplification measures.\r\nHowever, the other objectives set out above as well as the costs of controls\r\nneed to be considered.\nAs the rules of participation in the FCH JU are basically the same\r\nas those that the Commission will use, and with a population of beneficiaries\r\nwith a similar risk profile to those of the Commission, it can be expected that\r\nthe level of error will be similar to that established by the Commission for\r\nHorizon 2020.\nSee the Legislative Financial Statement for Horizon 2020 for full\r\ndetails of the error rate expected with respect to participants.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities\nThe Commission will ensure that appropriate mesures to fight against\r\nfraud, corruption and any other illegal activity at all stages of the\r\nmanagement process are applied by the FCH 2 JU. The proposal for Horizon 2020\r\nhas been subject to fraud proofing and an assessment of the impact. Overall the\r\nmeasures proposed should have a positive impact on the fight against fraud,\r\nespecially the greater emphasis on risk based audit and reinforced scientific\r\nevaluation and control.\nThe current FCH JU already cooperate with the Commission services in\r\nmatters relating to fraud and irregularity, the Commission will ensure that\r\nthis will continue and be strengthened.\nThe Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of\r\ndocuments and on-the-spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and\r\nsubcontractors who have received Union funds under the Programme.\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot\r\nchecks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly by such funding\r\nin accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96\r\nwith a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any\r\nother illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in\r\nconnection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract concerning\r\nUnion funding.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      New budget lines requested\nIn order of multiannual financial framework\r\nheadings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number 1A [Heading Competitiveness for growth and jobs] || Diff./non-diff. || from EFTA countries || from candidate countries || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation \n [1A] || 08.020733 Societal challenges \u2013 FCH 2 JU || Diff || YES || YES || YES || YES \n*the goal is to use one single budget line.\r\nThe contribution to this budget line is expected to come from:\n   || Commitment Appropriation (EUR million) \n Budget line || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 || 2020 || Total \n 06.030301 Achieving a resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and seamless European transport system || 10,050 || 11,741 || 11,742 || 10,634 || 10,479 || 9,980 || 10,374 || 75,000 \n 08.020303 Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system || 36,177 || 42,267 || 42,271 || 38,283 || 37,726 || 35,929 || 37,347 || 270,000 \n 08.020304 Achieving a European transport system that is resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and seamless || 23,448 || 27,395 || 27,398 || 24,813 || 24,452 || 23,287 || 24,207 || 175,000 \n 32.040301 Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system || 24,118 || 28,178 || 28,181 || 25,522 || 25,151 || 23,952 || 24,898 || 180,000 \n   || 93,793 || 109,581 || 109,592 || 99,252 || 97,808 || 93,148 || 96,826 || 700,000 \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimated impact on\r\nexpenditure\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of estimated impact\r\non expenditure \nEUR million (to three decimal places)\n Heading of multiannual financial Framework: || 1A || Competitiveness for growth and jobs \n \u00a0Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking ||   ||   || Year 2014 || Year 2015 || Year 2016 || Year 2017 || Year 2018 || Year 2019 || Year 2020 || Year 2021-2024 || TOTAL \n Title 1 || Commitments || (1) || 0,324 || 0,330 || 0,337 || 0,344 || 1,454 || 1,483 || 7,285 ||   || 11,557 \n Payments || (2) || 0,324 || 0,330 || 0,337 || 0,344 || 1,454 || 1,483 || 1,512 || 5,772 || 11,557 \n Title 2 || Commitments || (1a) || 0,115 || 0,257 || 0,261 || 0,454 || 1,640 || 1,711 || 4,005 ||   || 8,443 \n Payments || (2a) || 0,115 || 0,257 || 0,261 || 0,454 || 1,640 || 1,711 || 1,746 || 2,260 || 8,443 \n Title 3 || Commitments || (3a) || 93,354 || 108,994 || 108,994 || 98,454 || 94,714 || 89,954 || 85,536 || 0 || 680,000 \n   || Payments || (3b) ||   || 56,012 || 65,396 || 84,067 || 80,871 || 97,298 || 95,462 || 200,893 || 680,000 \n TOTAL appropriations for FCH JU || Commitments || =1+1a +3a || 93,793 || 109,581 || 109,592 || 99,252 || 97,808 || 93,148 || 96,826 || 0 || 700,000 \n Payments || =2+2a +3b || 0,439 || 56,599 || 65,994 || 84,865 || 83,965 || 100,492 || 98,720 || 208,925 || 700,000 \nThe administrative\r\ncosts shall be shared between the Union and the other members of the FCH 2\r\nJoint Undertaking.
