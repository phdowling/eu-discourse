This is designed to make\nbetter use of the available resources, and responds to public expectation to\nend the practice of throwing marketable fish back into the sea. High levels of\ndiscards are identified as an important driver of the lack of environmental\nsustainability of the CFP in the impact assessment[2] carried out for the\nproposal for the Basic Regulation for the CFP. \nThe European Parliament in its plenary vote\nin February 2013 agreed the gradual introduction of the landing obligation with\na starting date of 2014 for pelagic fisheries, highly migratory species and\nsalmon in the Baltic and extending to all fisheries in the Union in the\nfollowing years. Later in February, the Council also gave a clear indication\nthat they support this approach and agreed a similar timetable for\nimplementation. Subsequently political agreement has been reached by the\nEuropean Parliament and Council on the Basic Regulation with a new start date\nfor implementation of the landing obligation of 1 January 2015. \nIn order to make the landing obligation\noperational certain provisions within the current Regulations on technical\nmeasures, management measures and control that run contrary to the landing\nobligation and oblige fishermen to discard fish must be removed or amended. A\ndeclaration signalling this intention was made by the Council at the June\nCouncil[3],\nurging the Commission to act swiftly to make these changes to the existing\nregulations once the reform is agreed. \nIt is the intention of the Commission that a\nnew technical measures framework will be developed as part of the reform which,\nover time, should facilitate the full implementation of the landing obligation\nas envisaged. It would also incorporate the new, regionalised approach, including\nthe development of multiannual and discard plans. However, this new framework\nwill almost certainly not be in place in time for the first group of fisheries\nto be covered under the landing obligation. Therefore legislation is required\nto remove any legal and practical impediments to implementation on a\ntransitional basis while this new framework is being developed. \nOn the technical measures regulations\nseveral provisions contained in the current regulations contradict the landing\nobligation and oblige fishermen to discard. These are minimum landing sizes\n(MLS), catch composition rules and bycatch provisions. \nMinimum Landing Sizes (MLS) are contained\nin Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through\ntechnical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms[4] as amended in\nparticular by Regulation (EU) No 227/2013[5],\nand Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery resources\nthrough technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending\nRegulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98[6]. MLS set the legal\nsizes of fish which can be retained on board. Fish below these sizes currently\nmust not be retained on board or landed. Under the landing obligation, for all\nspecies under catch limits, MLS will be replaced by minimum conservation\nreference sizes (MCRS). Fish below these MCRS will have to be landed but the\nsale of catches below MCRS will be limited to uses other than human\nconsumption. A specific situation occurs in the Mediterranean Sea where Regulation\n(EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable\nexploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, amending Regulation\n(EEC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1624/94[7]. This Regulation\nprohibits that marine organisms which are smaller than the minimum size\nspecified therein are caught, retained on board, transhipped, landed,\ntransferred, stored, sold, displayed or offered for sale. These minimum sizes\nwere put in place in 2007 and were established to promote improvements in the\nsize selection beyond the minimum standards of the gear characteristics for the\nfisheries concerned. In the Mediterranean where minimum catching sizes apply\nthese will also be replaced by minimum conservation reference sizes for\nconsistency with the same requirement that fish below the MCRS will have to be\nlanded but will their use will be limited to purposes other than human\nconsumption.\nCatch composition rules are contained in\nRegulation (EC) 850/98 and associated regulations (Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007\nestablishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the\nfisheries exploiting those stocks[8],\nRegulation (EC) No 1434/98 specifying conditions under which herring may be\nlanded for industrial purposes other than direct human consumption[9], Regulation (EC) No\n254/2002 establishing measures to be applicable in 2002 for the recovery of the\nstocks of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa[10] and Regulation (EC) No\n2347/2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions\napplicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks[11]).\nThere are similar catch composition percentages in the Baltic Sea Regulation\n(Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005) but not in the Mediterranean. \nCatch composition rules set limits which must\nbe met on a daily basis and at the end of a fishing trip. If fishermen are\noutside the limits they are obliged to discard components of the catch in order\nto balance the retained catch with the catch composition rules. Under the\nlanding obligation, fishermen will no longer be allowed to discard, so the\ncontradiction between continuing to regulate catch composition and obliging\nfishermen to land all catches must be addressed. This will be achieved by\nrequiring that all unintended catches of marine organisms subject to the\nlanding obligation over the permitted catch composition percentages must be\nlanded and counted against quotas. The catch composition rules are interlinked\nwith other provisions (e.g. mesh size ranges, conditions for use of certain\ncombinations of mesh sizes) and detailed rules for sorting of catches on board\nvessels are also based on the catch composition percentages. These rules will\nalso have to be aligned or deleted to remove the obligation to discard. \nIn the case of Regulation (EC) No 1434/1998\nthe catch composition rules and associated restrictions on the use of herring contained\nin this regulation are no longer relevant. The landing obligation will apply to\nall pelagic and industrial fisheries in EU waters from 1 January 2015 and requires\nthat all herring caught must be landed and counted against quotas and that any herring\nbelow the minimum conservation reference size can only be used for purposes\nother than human consumption. This regulation should be repealed.\nWithin the technical conservation measures\nregulations (Regulation (EC) 850/98 and associated regulations (Regulation (EC)\nNo 1098/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 254/2002) for Union waters in the Atlantic\nand some other specified areas, and Regulation (EC) No 2187/200510\nfor the Union waters of the Baltic Sea) there are also multiple bycatch\nprovisions. These are similar to catch composition rules but are area or gear\nspecific. Typically these are derogations to allow bycatch of certain species\nof 5-10% in restricted areas with certain gear types in specific fisheries.\nCatches in excess of these bycatch limits currently have to be discarded. As\nwith catch composition rules this creates a contradiction with the landing\nobligation as they currently require fishermen to discard fish caught in excess\nof the bycatch provisions whereas under the landing obligation such fish must\nbe landed. Therefore, they need to be dealt with in a similar way as the catch\ncomposition rules to remove the obligation to discard. \nOne further amendment is proposed to\nRegulation (EC) No 850/98 which is not linked to the landing obligation but is\nrequired to ensure legal certainty. Several Member States have indicated that\nthe current provisions pertaining to an area closure in ICES division VIb to\nprotect juvenile haddock have led to misinterpretation creating concerns for\nthe conservation of haddock in this area. Therefore it is proposed to amend\nthis article in Regulation (EC) 850/98 by reverting to the original wording\nincluded under Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 and removing any\npossibility of misinterpretation.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 1224/2009\nestablishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules\nof the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No\n2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No\n2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No\n1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC)\nNo 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006[12] also needs to be\naligned with the landing obligation. The modifications required concern changes\nto fishing authorisations; recording of data on all catches particularly when\nbelow minimum conservation reference sizes; a higher margin of tolerance for\ncatch estimates below 50 kg in logbooks and transhipment declarations; establishment\nof rules for remote electronic monitoring (REM) for the recording of data for\nmonitoring the landing obligation at sea; separate stowage of catches and\ncontrol of marketing of catches below minimum conservation reference sizes;\nestablishing the conditions for the use of control observers for monitoring\npurposes; the definition of the violation of the landing obligation as a\nserious infringement. The introduction of the landing obligation in combination\nwith certain new inter-annual quota flexibilities, makes adjustment of existing\nrules on the deduction of quotas and effort necessary. All of these changes\nfollow from rules in the CFP reform. \nAs the first group of fisheries will be subject\nto the landing obligation in 2015, the relevant provisions of the regulations\non technical measures, management measures and on control measures should be amended\nby this Regulation to ensure timely removal of legal obstacles to applying the landing\nobligation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNo specific Impact Assessment has been\ncarried out as the impacts of introducing a landing obligation have already\nbeen assessed under the impact assessment supporting the reform of the CFP. As\npart of that impact assessment[13],\nthe impacts of discard reducing policies including a discard ban were\nquantified. That assessment had two phases. The first phase comprised a series\nof desk studies on the extent of discarding practices in the EU and described\nthe anti-discard policies in a number of fisheries (in Iceland, Norway, Scotland and Denmark). Moreover, the level of discarding in EU fisheries was\nclassified and finally specific studies of discarding in Mediterranean\nfisheries were undertaken. The second analytical phase assessed the impacts of\na range of anti-discard policy options in EU fisheries including the effects of\nchanges in fishing gear selectivity and the introduction of new technical\nmeasures such as real-time closures. This analysis showed that the introduction\nof an anti-discard policy based on more effective technical measures and the\nremoval of ineffective technical measures that induce discarding would result\nin short-term economic losses but medium to long-term additional gains,\nprimarily in environmental and economic terms. \nA further impact assessment would not add\nto the information already available from the previous assessment carried out.\nThe changes that are needed to the existing regulations are essential to the\nproper functioning of the new CFP.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe main action is to facilitate the\nimplementation of the landing obligation envisaged under the Common Fisheries\nPolicy reform by removing all existing provisions from EU technical measures\nand control regulations that run contrary to the landing obligation.\nLegal basis\nArticle 43(2) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union.\nProportionality principle\nThis proposal is amending measures which\nalready exist; therefore no concern on the proportionality principle arises.\nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason: Regulations must be amended by a Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis measure does not involve any\nadditional Union expenditure \n2013/0436 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulations (EC) No\n850/98, (EC) No 2187/2005, (EC) No 1967/2006, (EC) No 1098/2007, No 254/2002,\n(EC) No 2347/2002 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing (EC) No 1434/98 as\nregards the landing obligation \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[14],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No [xxxx]\nhas a central objective of the progressive elimination of discards in all EU\nfisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of\nspecies subject to catch limits and species covered by minimum sizes in\nthe Mediterranean. In order to make this landing obligation operational certain\nprovisions within the current technical measures and control regulations run\ncontrary to the landing obligation and oblige fishermen to discard fish and\nshould be removed or amended. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new technical measures\nframework is awaited pending the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).\nThe unlikelihood that such a new framework will be in place by the start of 2015\nwhen the landing obligation will be first introduced justifies the amendment or\nremoval of certain elements of the current technical measures regulations to remove\nthe incompatibility between these regulations and the landing obligation.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, in order to\nensure the implementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No\n850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for\nthe protection of juveniles of marine organisms should be amended by requiring\nall unintended catches of marine organisms subject to the landing obligation\ncaught in excess of catch composition rules should be landed and counted\nagainst quotas;

by replacing minimum landing sizes for marine organisms subject to the\nlanding obligation with conservation reference sizes; and by prohibiting the\ncatching of salmon and sea trout at specific times and in specific areas except\nwith trap-nets. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nimplementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006\nconcerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources\nin the Mediterranean Sea, amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and repealing\nRegulation (EC) No 1624/94 should be amended by replacing minimum sizes for\nmarine organisms subject to the landing obligation with minimum conservation\nreference sizes without undermining the concept and implementation of existing\nminimum catching sizes and by deleting the rules governing the fishing for sardine\nfry which no longer are relevant with the implementation of the landing\nobligation because all such catches shall be avoided where possible and in the\ncase of unintended catches shall be landed but no longer used for human\nconsumption.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nimplementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007\nestablishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the\nfisheries exploiting those stocks should be amended by requiring that when\nfishing with drifting lines and with gillnets, entangling nets and trammel nets\nin specified areas and at specified times all unintended catches of cod should\nbe landed and counted against quotas.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nimplementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 254/2002\nestablishing measures to be applicable in 2002 for the recovery of the stocks\nof cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa should be amended by requiring that\nin the trawl fishery for queen scallop that all unintentional catches of marine\norganisms subject to the landing obligation caught in excess of permitted\nbycatch percentages should be landed and counted against quotas.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nimplementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002\nestablishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable\nto fishing for deep-sea stocks should be amended by requiring all catches of\ndeep-sea species should be landed and counted against quotas.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nimplementation of the landing obligation Control Regulation (EC) 1224/2009\nestablishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules\nof the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No\n2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No\n2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007,\n(EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No\n2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 should be amended to ensure\nmonitoring of the landing obligation. For this purpose fishing authorisations\nshould apply to fisheries subject to a landing obligation ; data on catches of\nall species shall be recorded irrespective of a weight threshold; data on\ncatches below minimum conservation reference sizes should be recorded\nseparately; in view of the difficulty to establish the exact quantity of small\ncatches on board a fishing vessel a higher margin of tolerance should apply for\nestimates of small catches in logbooks and transhipment declarations; rules for\nremote electronic monitoring (REM) should be established for the recording of\ndata for monitoring the landing obligation at sea; rules on a separate stowage\nof catches and control of marketing of catches below minimum conservation\nreference sizes should be set up; and the conditions for the use of control\nobservers for monitoring purposes should be defined. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As discards constitute a\nsubstantial waste and affect negatively the sustainable exploitation of marine\nbiological resources and marine ecosystems and as a general observance of the\nlanding obligation by operators is essential for its success a violation of the\nlanding obligation should be defined as a serious infringement. The\nintroduction of the landing obligation in combination with certain new inter-annual\nquota flexibility rules, requires adjustment of the rules on the deduction of\nquotas and effort.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulations (EC) No\n850/98, (EC) No 2187/2005, (EC) No 1967/2006, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No\n254/2002, (EC) No 2347/2002 and (EC) No 1224/2009 should therefore be amended\naccordingly.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\n1434/1998 specifying conditions under which herring may be landed for\nindustrial purposes other than direct human consumption should be repealed as\nthe catch composition rules and associated restrictions on the use of herring\ncontained in this regulation are no longer relevant under the landing\nobligation as all herring caught should be landed and counted against quotas\nand any herring below the minimum conservation reference size should be used\nfor purposes other than human consumption,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER 1\nTechnical Measures\nArticle 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No\n850/98\nRegulation (EC) No 850/98 is amended as\nfollows\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 3, the following point\n(i) is added:\n\"(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unintended catches shall mean\nincidental catches of marine organisms the fishing for which is prohibited in\nthe relevant circumstances.\" \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4 is amended as follows: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In paragraph 1, the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n\"Fishing for any species listed in\nAnnexes I to V using a mesh size not provided for in those Annexes for that\nspecies shall be prohibited.\"\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In paragraph 4(a) the following\nsubparagraph is added:\n\"By way of derogation from the first\nsubparagraph, landings shall not be prohibited where the conditions established\nin Annex X cannot be complied with because of unintended catches of marine\norganisms subject to the landing obligation set out in Article 15 of Regulation\n(EU) [xxxx].
