Healthy seeds and\npropagating material are required for profitable crops and for ensuring jobs,\nplant innovation and food security. In the case of trees and shrubs, protecting\nplant health is essential for the preservation of the Union's forests,\nlandscape and public and private green. Plant health is also important for the\nprotection of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nPests from other continents are especially\ndangerous. European plants and trees usually lack adequate genetic resistance against\nforeign pests, which moreover often do not have natural enemies here. When\nintroduced into Europe, foreign pests cause severe economic damage. They may\njump to previously unaffected host species, spread fast across countries, and\ncause lasting yield reduction and permanently increased costs for production\nand control. The often severe economic losses undermine the profitability and\ncompetitiveness of agriculture and forestry. The establishment of new pests may\nelicit trade bans from third countries, damaging EU exports. Not all pests can\nbe controlled with pesticides and, where available, pesticide use may be undesirable.\n\nRegulatory framework\nThe current EU regulatory framework for plant\nhealth aims to protect European agriculture and forestry by preventing the\nentry and spread of foreign pests. The main tool hereby is Council Directive\n2000/29/EC[1], which also reflects international trade\nagreements in this area. The EU phytosanitary (plant health) regime is unique\nin that it is an open regime: movements of plants and plant products into and\nwithin the Union are allowed on condition that specific restrictions and requirements\nare respected (e.g. provenance from a pest free area or appropriate treatment).\nThe high volumes of imports from other continents nevertheless imply a high\nprobability of future outbreaks of foreign pests. \nThe regime is indispensable for protecting the\nhealth, economy and competitiveness of the EU plant production sector as well\nas for maintaining the Union's open trade policy. However, the existing\nregulatory framework is being criticised for being unable to stop the increased\ninflux of dangerous new pests caused by globalisation of trade. Moreover\nclimate change enables those pests to survive in Europe, while they could not\nin the past, and renders crops and ecosystems more vulnerable to new pests.\nMajor outbreaks in the past decade of dangerous import-related pests affecting\nforestry have raised societal and political awareness of the costs and impacts\nof inadequate protection. \nProblem analysis\nAn evaluation of the regime (2010)[2]\nhas shown that the basic legislation has to be amended in order to be able to\nfully address these increased risks. The main problems identified relate to\ninsufficient focus on prevention in relation to increased imports of high-risk\ncommodities, the need for prioritising pests at EU level across all 27 Member\nStates, the need for better instruments for controlling the presence and\nnatural spread of pests in case they eventually reach the Union territory, a\nneed for modernising and upgrading the instruments concerning intra-EU\nmovements (plant passports and protected zones), and a need to foresee\nadditional resources. \nA need for \"greening\" of the regime\nhas furthermore emerged and objectives relating to the natural environment have\ngained importance. This requires changes to the intervention logic, also in\nterms of financing, of the regime, which is moving from a private good regime\nfor agriculture to a mixed public/private good regime for agriculture,\nforestry, natural environment and landscape.\nThe science base of the regime (research,\nlaboratories) needs to be reinforced. There has been a steady erosion of the\nclassical plant pathology and pest taxonomy in universities, endangering the\nsupport from science to assess risks from new pests and to adequately diagnose\nthose pests in the laboratory. A State of Emergency declaration has been issued\nin this respect by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection\nOrganisation. \nFinally, a new balance needs to be struck as\nconcerns costs and responsibility sharing (partnership development) and there\nis a need to increase effectiveness and reduce unnecessary costs and\nadministrative burden. A need for modernisation of the regime furthermore\nexists in terms of incentives for compliance. \nObjective of the proposal\nThe present revision aims to overcome these\nflaws and to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory\nframework that is 'fit for purpose'. The proposed Regulation replaces and\nrepeals Directive 2000/29/EC. \nRelationship to other proposals in the\npackage\nThe proposal is part of a package of reviews\nrelating to the health of plants, quality of plant reproductive material,\nhealth of animals, official controls concerning plants, animals, food and feed,\nand Union expenditures for those policies. \nThe proposal reinforces the synergies with the\nplant reproductive material regime, while removing avoidable duplications and\nunnecessary burden from those duplications. This is achieved by repositioning\nthe pests that are currently regulated under the so-called marketing Directives\nfor seed and plant propagating material under the proposed plant health\nRegulation. That repositioning will introduce flexibility to change the status\nof widespread quarantine pests into quality pests, as requested by professional\noperators and Member States, so as to use the resources available to the phytosanitary\nauthorities for true Union priorities. In the meanwhile, the proposal ensures\nthat the existing practical arrangements in the Member States concerning the\ncertification of plant reproductive material for quality pests can remain. Altogether,\nthe rearrangements between the EU plant health regime and plant reproductive\nmaterial regime should reinforce the coherence between those two regimes\n(through shared use of certification schemes, labels and registers) and thus result\nin reduced burden for professional operators. The proposed new arrangements\nwill, however, require enhanced coordination between the competent authorities\nin the Member States for plant health and plant reproductive material.\nThe proposal does not contain provisions concerning\nofficial controls by the competent authorities of compliance by professional operators\nwith the Union phytosanitary legislation, as are currently present in Directive\n2000/29/EC. Those controls are now being positioned exclusively in the proposal\nconcerning official controls (replacing Regulation (EC) 882/2004[3]). This will also allow improved\ncoherence with the new Customs Code and allow simplified procedures at import.\nThe proposal does not contain provisions on\nexpenditures eligible for a financial contribution from the Union, as exist in\nDirective 2000/29/EC. The provisions concerned, drafted in accordance with the\npreferred option of the impact assessment, are included in the accompanying\nlegal proposal for a Regulation on food and feed expenditure, which concerns\nthe management of Union expenditures relating to the food chain, animal health\nand animal welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive\nmaterial.\nThe proposal will be complementary to the\nproposal concerning Invasive Alien Species foreseen under the EU Biodiversity\nStrategy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation process\nThe Council on 21 November 2008 invited the\nCommission to proceed to an evaluation of the EU plant health regime and to\nconsider possible modifications to the existing legal framework and the impact\nof such modifications[4].\nThe Commission initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the regime from the\nintroduction of the internal market (1993)[5]\nand contracted the necessary study out to an external consultant[6]. Member State experts\nparticipated in the Inter-Service Steering Group for the evaluation. A\nconference took place on 23-24 February 2010 to inform the stakeholders and MS\non the progress of the evaluation and to consult them on the provisional\noptions for the future developed by the consultant. The input received framed\nthe final options and recommendations. The report of the evaluation[7] was presented in a second\nconference on 28 September 2010 including stakeholders, the general public, and\nrepresentatives of MS and third countries. Linked to this conference was a\npublic consultation on the recommendations from the evaluation and the scope of\nthe subsequent impact assessment.\nIn preparation for the impact assessment, the\noptions recommended by the external consultant were discussed with the Member\nStates in Council with the Chief Officers for Plant Health (COPHs) in many\nrounds of meetings and, as concerns the coherence with the Plant Reproductive\nMaterial (PRM) regime, the Heads of Service for that regime and the relevant\nWorking Party. Five task forces with Member State experts and Commission were\nconvened to further discuss the main areas of change. \nStakeholders (industry association\nrepresentatives and NGOs) were consulted from the very start of the review\nprocess, prior to the initiation of the evaluation, during the evaluation study\nand again during the preparation of the impact assessment. An ad-hoc Working\nGroup on Plant Health was set up under the Advisory Group on the Food Chain,\nAnimal and Plant Health. The progress was presented and discussed in several\nmeetings of the aforementioned Advisory Group, in other Advisory Groups[8] and on invitation in meetings\nof COPA-COGECA, EUROPATAT, ESA and UNION FLEURS. Stakeholder consultation was a\nkey element of the evaluation study and the supplementary economic study\ncontracted out to an external consultant. The consultation concerned changes of\nthe EU plant health regime itself as well as elements of the regime to be\ntransferred to or from the plant reproductive material regime and the EU regime\non official controls on food and feed, animal health and welfare, plant health\nand plant reproductive material.\nThe conferences organised during the review\nprocess ensured stakeholders' input and views concerning the recommendations\nand the scope of the impact assessment, both orally at the conferences and\nthrough the linked public consultation. A consultation on the technical change\nproposals was linked to the meeting of the Working Group on Plant Health on 18 February\n2011 and targeted the preferred way forward for the changes with major impact.\nConsultations were additionally published on the dedicated web page[9] of DG SANCO. A final\nconsultation on the strategic options was launched on 13 May 2011. \nData collection\nThe collection of data commenced with a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the regime by the external consultant from 2009 to\n2010. The evaluation included an ex post analysis of the regime for the\nperiod 1993-2008, the collection of economic data on costs and administrative\nburden for competent authorities and stakeholders stemming from the regime, as\nwell as the development ex ante of options and recommendations for the\nfuture. The evaluation report was delivered in May 2010.\nThe internal process to develop the IA was\nfurther supported by a second contract with the consultant. This contract\nconcerned a study on the quantification of costs and\nbenefits of amendments to the regime, supplementary to the data that had been\ncollected during the evaluation. The study consisted of modules addressing the ex\nante assessment of the economic impact of specific technical options for\nthe revision of the legislation. The scope of the issues to be addressed had\nbeen subject to stakeholder consultation. The modules were set up in such a way\nthat aggregation was possible to potential overall policy options. In July 2011,\nthe final report of the study was delivered by the consultant. Where necessary further\ninformation was gathered from the literature, study reports and queries to\nassess the key impacts the change in policy would have. Furthermore, the social\nand environmental impacts of the policy options were assessed by Commission's\nservices. \nImpact assessment\nFour options were developed to improve the\nregime:\nOption 1: Improve only the legal form and\nclarity of the regime. The legislation would be\nconverted from a Directive into a Regulation, and simplified and clarified. The\nstatus quo would be maintained in terms of substance. \nOption 2: Prioritise,\nmodernise and step up prevention.\nAdditional to Option 1, prioritisation would be improved by transforming the\ncurrent Annexes I and II, which list regulated pests according to technical\nfeatures irrespective of their priority for the Union, into lists based on\nintervention logic and priority. The plant passport and protected zone systems\nwould be modernised (responsibility sharing with professional operators) and\nupgraded (plant passport scope, format, mandatory cost-recovery based plant\npassport fees as already exist for import controls, rules for surveillance and outbreak\neradication in protected zones). The coherence between the PHR and the plant\nreproductive material regime would be improved to increase effectiveness and\nreduce costs for professional operators. Prevention would be reinforced by\nintroducing a new provision concerning high-risk plant reproductive materials\n(plants for planting) that are not authorised for introduction into the Union\nor subject to specific enhanced physical controls until completion of a risk\nanalysis, and by removing exemptions for passenger luggage (to be subject to\nlow frequency controls to minimise the cost impacts). \nOption 3: Prioritise, modernise, step up prevention and reinforce actions\nagainst outbreaks. Additional to Option 2, obligations would be introduced for surveillance and\ncontingency planning. In analogy with the arrangements in the animal\nhealth regime, EU co-financing would be made available for surveillance and, in\ncertain cases, for financial compensation of direct losses of professional operators.\nThe legal instruments for eradication and containment would be further\ndeveloped. The exclusion of natural spread related measures would be removed. \nOption 4: Prioritise, modernise, step up\nprevention, reinforce actions against outbreaks and expand the scope to\ninvasive plants. Additional to Option 3, the regime\nwould also cover invasive plants, in terms of legal provisions for measures and\nEU co-financing. Invasive plants (other than parasitic plants) would not be\ncovered in Options 1, 2 and 3.\nThe assessment of the impacts of the four\noptions revealed that Option 3 provided the best way forward to achieve the\nobjectives with the best cost-benefit level and an optimal balance of inputs\nfrom Member States, professional operators and the Union. Option 3 should have\na significant positive impact on profitability and economic growth of the\nsectors involved; it was also the closest reflection of the outcome of the\nstakeholder and MS consultation. \nThe EU budget necessary to implement Option 3\nwas secured in the Commission proposal for the Multi-Annual Financial Framework\n(MFF) for 2014-2020. The corresponding legal provisions are included in the legal\nproposal for a Regulation laying down provisions for the management of\nexpenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and\nrelating to plant health and plant reproductive material. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises\nThe nature of the plant health regime requires that small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SME) are not exempted from the obligations of this\nRegulation. The majority of the enterprises affected by the regime are SME and\nexempting them a priori would fundamentally jeopardise the regime's\nobjectives. However, the proposal exempts enterprises selling plants and plant\nproducts exclusively to the local market from the obligation to issue plant\npassports, which will moreover not be required for sales to final\nnon-professional consumers anyhow. For micro-enterprises, special arrangements\nconcerning potential refunding of fees for plant health controls, within the\nframework of State Aid rules, will be made possible under the new Regulation\nconcerning official controls. \nFundamental rights\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights\nand observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter on\nFundamental rights of the European Union. It should be applied by the Member\nStates in accordance with those rights and principles, implemented as appropriate\nin their national legislation. Certain provisions of this Regulation\nnevertheless limit particular rights under the Charter, however only to the\nextent strictly necessary for protecting the general interest of the Union\nconcerned by this Regulation and conserving the essence of the rights at stake.\n\nEradication of outbreaks of foreign pests can\nonly be successful if all sources of infestation are removed. Apart from\noutbreaks of quarantine pests on the premises of professional operators,\noutbreaks may also take place in public or private green. In those cases, the\neradication measures need to include the infested and potentially infested\nplants in that public and private green in order to be successful at all (any\nremaining infested plants will act as a source of new infestations elsewhere).\nThis implies that, in certain cases, competent authorities of Member States\nneed to be given access to private premises for official controls, possibly\nfollowed by the imposition of treatment or eradication measures or certain\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the use of plants. This is a limitation of\nArticles 7 and 17 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights concerning,\nrespectively, the Respect for Private and Family Life and the Right to\nProperty. That limitation is necessary to achieve an objective of general\ninterest, being the protection of plant health in the Union. The limitation is\nproportionate because the objective of general interest cannot be achieved\nwithout ensuring that phytosanitary measures are respected equally by all\n(refraining from destruction of infested plants in private gardens would\nannihilate the benefits of eradication measures imposed on professional operators\nand carried out in public-owned green). It will be the responsibility of the\nMember States to provide fair compensation to affected citizens in good time\nfor the suffered loss. The essence of the Right to Property is thus conserved. \nAnybody who is aware of the presence of a\nquarantine pest will be obliged to notify the presence of that quarantine pest\nto the competent authorities, accompanied with the information concerning the\norigin and the nature of the material concerned. This will also apply to\nlaboratories and research organisation encountering pests in samples provided\nto them. This may in some cases constitute a limitation of Article 8 of the\nCharter, concerning the Right to Protection of Personal Data. That limitation\nis necessary to achieve the public interest objective of plant health in the\nUnion, as findings of quarantine pests need to be made known to the competent\nauthorities in order to ensure the immediate eradication of outbreaks. The\nlimitation is proportionate because personal data are subject to the provision\nonly to the extent that they are indispensable for the competent authorities to\nlocate the outbreaks and take the necessary action. The essence of the Right to\nProtection of Personal Data is thus conserved. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nChapter I: Subject matter, scope and\ndefinitions\nThe territorial scope of the regime does not\ninclude any non-European outermost regions of Member States, as those regions\nbelong to other biogeographic regions of the world, where exactly those pests\noccur against which the European territories of the Member States require\nprotection. The territorial scope of the regime does include part of the\nMacaronesian archipelago (the island of Madeira and the Azores), which forms a\nbiogeographic region overlapping with the Mediterranean region, in particular\nthe Iberian peninsula, in terms of natural vegetation. It is therefore\nappropriate to include that archipelago in the scope of the regime. Annex I\nlists the territories of the Member States that are covered by the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of European Union but, for the purpose of this Regulation, are\nconsidered as third countries. \nInvasive plants other than parasitic plants\n(physically feeding on host plants) are excluded from the scope, in line with\nthe outcome of the impact assessment. \nDefinitions are provided as necessary.\nChapter II: Quarantine pests\nIn Directive 2000/29/EC, pests are listed in\nspecific Annexes. The proposal, instead, sets out the conceptual nature of\nquarantine pests and subsequently lists them in implementing acts, either as\nUnion quarantine pests or Protected Zone quarantine pests. Union quarantine pests\nrequire eradication measures in the entire Union territory, while for Protected\nZone quarantine pests that is only the case within specified protected zones\nwhere certain pests are absent, while they are known to occur in other parts of\nthe Union territory. The proposal empowers the Commission to list certain\nquarantine pests as priority pests for the Union, up to a maximum of 10% of the\nlisted Union quarantine pests. Those pests will be subject to an enhanced level\nof obligations concerning preparedness and eradication, supplemented by\nenhanced financial support from the Union for the required actions. Criteria to\ndecide whether a pest qualifies as a quarantine pest, Union or Protected Zone\nquarantine pest, or priority pest are provided in Annex II of the Regulation. A\ntransfer is foreseen of the pests currently listed in Annexes I and II of\nDirective 2000/29/EC to the appropriate lists of the future implementing acts.\nNo distinction will be made any longer between pests currently listed in Annex\nI and Annex II of Directive 2000/29/EC. \nThis chapter furthermore sets out detailed\nrules on notification of the presence of quarantine pests, measures to be taken\nfor the eradication of those pests including the restriction of areas subject\nto eradication measures, surveys to be carried out for the presence of pests\nand the establishment of contingency plans and eradication plans concerning\noutbreaks of priority pests. \nThe provisions in this chapter empower the\nCommission to adopt implementing acts on permanent measures to manage\nquarantine pests that have become established in the Union territory. Those\nacts can also be adopted on a temporary basis for non-listed quarantine pests,\nif necessary using the urgency procedure established under the Lisbon Treaty.\nThe tools developed in this chapter exist today under Directive 2000/29/EC,\nhowever the proposal develops those tools explicitly. A provision is included\nallowing Member States to take stricter measures against pests than foreseen in\nthe Union legislation, on condition that those measures do not restrict in any\nway the free movement of plants, plant products and other regulated objects on\nthe internal market.\nThe chapter also covers the provisions\nconcerning protected zones, which maintain the existing system, however\nexplicitly reinforced to ensure that protected zones are technically justified\nand that any outbreaks of the Protected Zone quarantine pests concerned are\nproperly and timely eradicated. If not, the protected zone will be revoked.\nWith these changes, the Union's protected zone system aligns with the pest-free\narea system under the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), as\nrequested by the regime's stakeholders and by third countries.\nChapter III: Quality pests\nPests that affect the intended use of plants\nfor planting, but do not require eradication, are regulated today under the\nmarketing Directives for seed and plant propagating material and, partly, in\nAnnex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. The proposal categorises them all as Union quality\npests. It sets out the conceptual nature of such pests and subsequently lists\nthem through implementing acts. Criteria to decide whether a pest qualifies as\na Union quality pest are provided in Annex II. Quality pests will not be\nregulated under the legal proposal for Plant Reproductive Material, other than\ntheir inclusion, where appropriate, in certification schemes.\nSchematic representation of the various\ntypes of pests in the proposal, the decision process for their qualification\nand the measures required against them.\nChapter IV: Measures concerning plants,\nplant products and other objects\nDirective 2000/29/EC has Annexes listing\nprohibitions for certain plants, plants products and other objects (Annex III),\nand specific requirements for the introduction into and movement within the\nUnion (Annex IV). The proposal empowers the Commission to adopt such lists\nthrough implementing acts. The provisions in Chapter IV furthermore concern\nrules for recognition of measures of third countries as equivalent to the Union\nmeasures, and derogations to the prohibitions. The respective rules concerning\nthe movement of plants, plant products and other objects into and within\nprotected zones are also addressed.\nNew to the Union plant health regime is an\nArticle empowering the Commission to adopt implementing acts to address\nemerging risks from certain plants for planting from certain third countries\nwhich require precautionary measures. Listed plant materials will require\nintensified visual examination and testing, or subjection to a quarantine\nperiod, or will be subject to a temporary prohibition of introduction into the\nUnion. Those measures shall apply for two years, prolongable once. During that\ntime, a full risk assessment shall be developed, followed by a decision to\nregulate the material concerned on a permanent basis, or to drop the temporary\nmeasures.\nNew is also an article setting out the basic\nrules for quarantine stations, when the use of those stations is required by\nthe Regulation or by secondary acts under the Regulation.\nThe introduction into the Union of regulated\nplants by passengers in their luggage will no longer be exempted from the\nrespective requirements and prohibitions. This is necessary because plants in\npassenger luggage have been found an increasing risk for the phytosanitary\nstatus of the Union and jeopardise the success of the regime.\nNew is finally an Article requiring that\nexports of plants, plant products and other objects to third countries shall\ntake place either in accordance to the Union rules, or, if the third country's\nrules so allow or the third country explicitly so agrees through bilateral\nagreements or otherwise, in accordance to the requirements of that third\ncountry.\nChapter V: Registration of professional operators\nand traceability\nThe proposal requires the relevant professional\noperators to be registered, in a register which will also contain the professional\noperators required to be registered under the proposed Regulation concerning plant\nreproductive material. This should reduce burden for professional operators.\nRegistered operators shall fulfil certain requirements for the traceability of\nthe plant material under their control.\nChapter VI: Certification of plants, plant\nproducts and other objects\nDirective 2000/29/EC has an Annex (V) listing\nrequirements concerning certification of plants, plant products and other\nobjects introduced into or moved within the Union. The proposal empowers the\nCommission to adopt such lists through delegated acts. The respective rules\nconcerning the certification of plants, plant products and other objects\nintroduced into and moved within protected zones are also addressed.\nThe proposal foresees that all plants for\nplanting, other than certain seeds, shall require a phytosanitary certificate\nfor introduction into the Union and a plant passport for movement within the\nUnion. Plant passports shall be required for all movements between professional\noperators, but not for sales to final non-professional users. The plant passport\nwill be simplified and harmonised. Instead of a lot number, the plant passport\nmay use a chip, barcode or hologram linking to the internal traceability\nsystems of professional operators. \nExaminations on plants, plant products and\nother objects requiring a plant passport may require the use of certification\nschemes with regard to certain quarantine pests and/or quality pests, where\nexaminations in the field during the growing season are indispensable. This\npossibility could be created thanks to the inclusion of quality pests in the\nplant health Regulation. Where certification schemes are required under the\nplant health Regulation, it is provided that the certification schemes created\nunder the proposed Regulation concerning plant reproductive material shall be\nused. This should preclude that double schemes are set up, which would result\nin double costs for professional operators.\nPlant passports shall be issued by registered\noperators that are authorised so by the competent authorities, or, on their request,\nby the competent authorities. Where plant material requires a plant passport\nunder the plant health Regulation and a certification label under the proposed\nRegulation concerning plant reproductive material, the plant passport and the\ncertification label shall be combined in a single document. This should\npreclude double costs for professional operators, where the issuance is done by\nthe competent authorities.\nRules are foreseen concerning the authorisation\nand supervision of professional operators issuing plant passports and for the\nexamination of the plant material concerned, in order to ensure that that\nmaterial complies with all provisions of the Regulation. \nRules are also foreseen concerning the\nauthorisation and supervision of wood packaging material producers who apply a\ncertain mark to that material, following its treatment according to the\nInternational Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 on Regulation of wood\npackaging material in international trade.\nFor export purposes, the proposal foresees the\nintroduction of a pre-export certificate, for cases where plant material is\nexported from a Member State which is not the Member State of origin. The\npre-export certificate will replace the currently used informal guidance\ndocument agreed by the Member States.\nChapter VII: Measures supporting the\nimplementation of the Regulation\nThe proposal foresees the establishment of an electronic\nnotification system for notification and reporting.\nChapter VIII: Final provisions\nThe proposal foresees that the Commission will be assisted by a new\nStanding Committee, which will include the existing Committees dealing with the\nfood chain, animal and plant health and plant reproductive material (instead of\nthe existing Standing Committee on Plant Health).\nThe proposal foresees amendments to the\nRegulation laying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to\nthe food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health\nand plant reproductive material, which is foreseen to be adopted in advance of\nthe current legal proposal. Those amendments include the possibility for the\nUnion to co-finance measures concerning priority pests (a pest category created\nin the current proposal) and compensation to operators for the foregone value of\nplant material that is destroyed as part of eradication measures concerning\npriority pests.\nThe proposal repeals six so-called Control\nDirectives concerning the management of certain quarantine pests (potato wart\nfungus, potato cyst nematodes, potato brown rot, potato ring rot, carnation\nleafrollers and San Jos\u00e9 scale) that are known to be present in the Union. Acts\nof such nature will in future be adopted as secondary acts under the proposed\nRegulation and not as co-decided acts. The Directives on pests of potato will\nbe replaced by secondary acts under now proposed Regulation, without changing\ntheir substance. The Directives on carnation leafrollers and San Jos\u00e9 scale\nwill not be replaced.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe financial provisions and appropriations for\nimplementing the Regulation up to 31 December 2020 will be presented in the forthcoming\nlegal proposal for a Regulation on the management of expenditure relating to\nthe food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health\nand plant reproductive material. The current proposal does not imply any\nexpenditures which will not be part of the financial statement of the legal\nproposal for that Regulation and it does not require additional human\nresources. \n2013/0141 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non protective measures against pests of\nplants\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[10],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[11],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\n2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into\nthe Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against\ntheir spread within the Community[12]\nsets out a plant health regime.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 November 2008, the\nCouncil invited the Commission to proceed to an evaluation of that plant health\nregime[13].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the\noutcome of that evaluation and the experience gained from the application of\nDirective 2000/29/EC, that Directive should be replaced. To ensure uniform\napplication of the new rules, the act replacing that Directive should take the\nform of a Regulation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant health is very\nimportant for plant production, public and private green, natural ecosystems,\necosystem services and biodiversity in the Union. Plant health is threatened by\nspecies injurious to plants and plant products, hereinafter 'pests'. To fight\nthat threat, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the determination of\nthe phytosanitary risks posed by those pests and the reduction of those risks\nto an acceptable level.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need for such measures\nhas long been recognised. They have formed the subject of international\nagreements and international conventions, including the International Plant\nProtection Convention (IPPC) of 6 December 1951 concluded at the United Nations\nFood and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and its new revised text approved by\nthe Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference in November 1997 at its 29th\nsession. The Union is party to the IPPC.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has appeared that for\nthe determination of the scope of this Regulation it is important to take into\naccount bio-geographical factors to avoid that pests not present in the\nEuropean territory of the Union spread to that territory. Consequently,\nnon-European territories (outermost regions) of Member States referred to in\nArticle 355(1) TFEU should be excluded from the territorial scope of this\nRegulation. Those territories should be listed. Where the status of such a\nterritory or a territory referred to in Article 355(2) TFEU is amended pursuant\nto Article 355(6) TFEU, that list should be amended to ensure that the\nterritorial scope of this Regulation remains confined to the European part of\nthe Union territory. References to third countries should be read as references\nalso to the territories included in that list.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2000/29/EC sets\nout rules concerning official controls to be carried out by the competent\nauthorities as regards protective measures against the introduction into the\nCommunity of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their\nspread within the Community. Such rules are presently set out by Regulation\n(EU) No \u2026/\u2026. on official controls and other official activities performed to\nensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and\nwelfare, plant health and plant reproductive material, plant protection\nproducts and amending Regulations (EC) No 999/2001, 1829/2003, 1831/2003,\n1/2005, 396/2005, 834/2007, 1099/2009, 1069/2009, 1107/2009, Regulations (EU)\nNo 1151/2012, [\u2026.]/2013 [Office of Publications, please insert number of\nRegulation laying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to\nthe food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health\nand plant reproductive material], and Directives 98/58/EC, 1999/74/EC,\n2007/43/EC, 2008/119/EC, 2008/120/EC and 2009/128/EC (Official controls\nRegulation)[14]\n[Office of Publications, please insert number of Regulation on Official\nControls and, in the footnote, the reference to the Official Journal] and\ntherefore should not be part of this Regulation.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criteria should be set out\nin order to allow pests to be identified for which it is necessary to adopt\nmeasures of control for the entire Union territory. Such pests are referred to\nas 'Union quarantine pests'. Criteria should also be set out for the\nidentification of pests for which it is necessary to adopt measures of control only\nas regards one or more parts of that territory. Such pests are referred to as\n'protected zone quarantine pests'.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow efforts\nfor the control of Union quarantine pests to concentrate on pests whose\neconomic, environmental or social impact is most severe for the Union territory\nas a whole, a restricted list of such pests, hereinafter 'priority pests',\nshould be established.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nprovide for exemptions from the prohibition of introduction into and movement\nwithin the Union territory of Union quarantine pests for scientific purposes,\ntrials, varietal selections, breeding and exhibitions.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\neffective and timely action in case of the presence of a Union quarantine pest,\nnotification obligations should apply to the public, professional operators and\nto the Member States.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where those notification\nobligations imply that personal data of natural or legal persons should be\ndisclosed to the competent authorities, this may constitute a limitation of\nArticle 8 (Protection of Personal Data) of the Charter on Fundamental Rights.\nHowever that limitation would be necessary and proportionate to achieve the\npublic interest objective of this Regulation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A professional operator\nbecoming aware of the presence of a Union quarantine pest in a plant, plant\nproduct or other object which is or was under its control should be under an\nobligation to take all measures that may be appropriate as regards the\nelimination of the pest, the withdrawal or recall of the plants, plant products\nor other objects concerned and the information of the competent authority,\nother persons in the trade chain and the public. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should take\nall necessary measures to eradicate Union quarantine pests, when found present\nin their territories. It is appropriate to set out measures which may be taken\nby Member States in such a case and the principles based on which they are to\ndecide what measures to take. Those measures should include the establishment\nof restricted areas, consisting of an infested zone and a buffer zone.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases, Member\nStates should impose measures for the eradication of quarantine pests on plants\nin private premises, because eradication of pests can only be successful if all\nsources of infestation are removed. For this purpose, the competent authorities\nof Member States should have legal access to those premises. This may\nconstitute a limitation of Article 7 (Respect for Private and Family Life) and\nArticle 17 (Right to Property) of the Charter on Fundamental Rights. That\nlimitation is necessary and proportionate to achieve the public interest\nobjective of the regime, in so far as Member States ensure fair compensation in\ngood time for the loss of private property. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early detection of the\npresence of pests is extremely important for timely and effective eradication.\nMember States should therefore conduct surveys for the presence of Union\nquarantine pests in the areas where those pests were not known to be present.\nIn view of the number of Union quarantine pests and the time and resources\nrequired to carry out those surveys, Member States should establish\nmulti-annual survey programmes.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\nempowered to adopt measures in case of the suspected or confirmed presence of\nspecific Union quarantine pests, concerning in particular their eradication and\ncontainment, and the establishment of restricted areas, surveys, contingency\nplans, simulation exercises and eradication plans as regards those pests. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure swift\nand effective action against pests which are no Union quarantine pests but\nwhich Member States consider may fulfil the conditions for inclusion in the\nlist of Union quarantine pests, provision should be made for measures to be\ntaken by Member States in case they become aware of the presence of such a\npest. Similar provisions should be set out for the Commission.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under certain conditions\nMember States should be allowed to adopt more stringent eradication measures\nthan required by Union legislation. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Special provisions should\napply to priority pests as regards the information of the public, surveys,\ncontingency plans, eradication plans and co-financing of measures by the Union,\nin particular.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quarantine pests which are\npresent in the Union territory but absent from specific parts of that territory\ndesignated as 'protected zones', and whose presence would have unacceptable\neconomic, social or environmental impacts only for those protected zones,\nshould be specifically identified and listed as 'protected zone quarantine\npests'. The introduction into, movement within, and release into the respective\nprotected zones of protected zone quarantine pests should be prohibited.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be set out\nconcerning the recognition, modification or revocation of recognition of\nprotected zones, survey obligations for protected zones, and actions to be\ntaken in case protected zone quarantine pests are found present in the\nrespective protected zones. In case of findings of the presence of the protected\nzone quarantine pest inside the respective protected zone, strict rules should\napply for the amendment and revocation of those protected zones. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pest, which is no Union\nquarantine pest, should be referred to as a 'Union quality pest' in case that\npest is mainly transmitted through specific plants for planting, its presence\non those plants for planting has an unacceptable economic impact as regards the\nintended use of those plants and it is listed as a Union quality pest. To limit\nthe presence of such pests their introduction into or movement within the Union\nterritory on the plants for planting concerned should be prohibited unless\nprovided otherwise in that list.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain plants, plant\nproducts and other objects pose an unacceptable phytosanitary risk by their\nlikelihood to host a Union quarantine pest. For some of those, acceptable risk\nmitigation measures are available, while not for others. Depending on the\navailability of acceptable risk mitigation measures, their introduction into, and\nmovement within, the Union territory should be either prohibited or subject to\nspecial requirements. Those plants, plant products and other objects should be\nlisted. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Derogations from the\nprohibitions or special requirements as regards the introduction of plants,\nplant products and other objects into the Union territory should be provided\nfor. The Commission should be empowered to recognise certain measures of third\ncountries as equivalent to the requirements for the movement within the Union\nterritory of plants, plant products and other objects concerned.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those prohibitions or\nrequirements should neither apply to small quantities of plants, plant products\nand other objects, other than plants for planting, for non-commercial and\nnon-professional purposes nor to the introduction into and movement within\nfrontier zones of plants, plant products and other objects. Nor should they\napply to the introduction into and movement within the Union territory of\nplants, plant products and other objects for scientific purposes, trials,\nvarietal selection, breeding and exhibitions. Proper safeguards should be set\nand information should be provided to those concerned.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A derogation from the Union\nrules for introduction into and movement within the Union territory should be\nprovided for plants, plant products and other objects in transit.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The international trade of\nplants for planting with which there is limited phytosanitary experience can\ninvolve serious risks of the establishment of quarantine pests for which no\nmeasures have been adopted pursuant to this Regulation. In order to ensure\nswift and effective action against newly identified risks associated with\nplants for planting which are not subject to permanent requirements or\nprohibitions, but may qualify for such permanent measures, the Commission\nshould have the possibility to adopt temporary measures in accordance with the\nprecautionary principle. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to set out\nprohibitions and special requirements, similar to those set out for the Union\nterritory, in respect of the introduction into and movement within protected\nzones of plants, plant products and other objects that would pose a\nphytosanitary risk of an unacceptable level by their likelihood to host the\nrespective protected zone quarantine pest.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General requirements should\nbe adopted concerning vehicles and packaging material of plants, plant products\nand other objects to ensure that they are free from quarantine pests.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\ndesignate quarantine stations. Requirements concerning the designation,\noperation and supervision of those quarantine stations as well as the release\nof plants, plant products or other objects from those stations should be set\nout. Where those requirements include the maintenance of lists of staff and\nvisitors entering the stations, this may constitute a limitation of Article 8\n(Protection of Personal Data) of the Charter on Fundamental Rights. However\nthat limitation would be necessary and proportionate to achieve the public\ninterest objective of this Regulation.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where so required by a\nbilateral agreement concluded by the Union with a third country, or by the\nlegislation of a third country, plants, plant products and other objects moved\nout of the Union territory to the third country concerned should comply with\nthose rules. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where, as regards certain\nplants, plant products or other objects moved out of the Union territory to\nthird countries, no bilateral phytosanitary agreement concluded by the Union\nwith a third country and no phytosanitary legislation of a third country\napplies, protection should be offered to third countries against Union\nquarantine pests because of their acknowledged harmful nature, except where a\nUnion quarantine pest is officially known to be present in the third country concerned\nand not under official control, or where it can be reasonably assumed that that\nUnion quarantine pest does not meet the criteria to qualify as a quarantine\npest for the third country concerned. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\neffective implementation of this Regulation, professional operators subject to\nobligations under this Regulation should be registered in registers set up by\nthe Member States. In order to reduce administrative burden, those registers\nshould also include professional operators falling within the ambit of\nRegulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026. on \u2026\u2026[15]\n[Office of Publications to insert number, title and, in a footnote, the OJ\nreference for the Regulation on plant reproductive material].\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professional operators\noperating at more than one premise should be given the possibility to register\nseparately for each of those premises.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To facilitate the detection\nof the source of an infestation by a quarantine pest, it is appropriate to\nrequire professional operators to keep records in respect of the plants, plant\nproducts and other objects supplied to them by professional operators and\nsupplied by them to other professional operators. In view of the latency\nperiods of some quarantine pests, and the time required for the detection of\nthe source of infestation, records should be kept for three years.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professional operators\nshould also have in place systems and procedures to allow identification of the\nmovements of their plants, plant products and other objects within their own\npremises. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A phytosanitary certificate\nshould be required for the introduction from third countries into the Union\nterritory, and into protected zones, of certain plants, plant products and\nother objects. Those plants, plant products and other objects should be listed\nin the interest of clarity.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those phytosanitary\ncertificates should comply with the requirements of the IPPC and attest\ncompliance with the requirements and measures established pursuant to this\nRegulation. In order to ensure the credibility of the phytosanitary\ncertificates, rules should be established concerning the conditions of their\nvalidity and cancellation.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The movement within the\nUnion territory, and into and within protected zones, of certain plants, plant\nproducts and other objects should only be permitted if accompanied by a plant\npassport, attesting compliance with the requirements and measures established\npursuant to the provisions of this Regulation. Those plants, plant products and\nother objects should be listed in the interest of clarity.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant passports should not\nbe required for plants, plant products and other objects intended for final\nusers.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncredibility of the plant passports, rules should be established concerning\ntheir contents. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plant passports should\ngenerally be issued by the professional operator. Where professional operators\ndo not have the resources to issue plant passports, the possibility should\nexist that, upon their request, plant passports are issued by the competent authorities.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rules should be set out for\nthe issuance of plant passports, the examinations required for issuance, the\nauthorisation and supervision of professional operators issuing plant\npassports, the obligations of authorised operators and the withdrawal of that\nauthorisation.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce the\nburden of authorised operators, examinations for issuing plant passports should\nbe combined with the examinations required under Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026. [Office\nof Publications to insert number of Regulation on plant reproductive material\nlaw], where appropriate.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Authorised operators should\npossess the necessary knowledge concerning pests.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain operators may\ndesire to establish a phytosanitary risk management plan, ensuring and\ndemonstrating a high level of competence and awareness as regards phytosanitary\nrisks as regards critical points in their professional activities and\njustifying special control arrangements with the competent authorities. Union\nrules should be established concerning the contents of those plans.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\nprovide for the replacement of plant passports and of phytosanitary\ncertificates.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In cases of non-compliance\nwith the Union rules, plant passports should be removed, invalidated and, for\nreasons of traceability, kept.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FAO International Standard\nfor Phytosanitary Measures No 15 requires that wood packaging material is\nmarked with a specific mark, applied by duly authorised and supervised\nprofessional operators. This Regulation should set out the model and contents\nof that mark and the authorisation and supervision of professional operators in\nthe Union territory applying that mark.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where so required by a\nthird country, the respective plants, plant products or other objects should\nmove from the Union territory to that third country with a phytosanitary\ncertificate for export or re-export. In respect of the relevant provisions of\nIPPC, those certificates should be issued by the competent authorities,\nrespecting the contents of the model certificates for export and re-export set\nout by the IPPC.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a plant, plant\nproduct or other object is moved through more than one Member States before it\nis exported to a third country, it is important that the Member State in which\nthe plants, plant product or other objects were produced or processed exchanges\ninformation with the Member State which issues the phytosanitary certificate\nfor export. This exchange of information is important to enable attestation of\ncompliance with the requirements of the third country. Therefore, a harmonised\n'pre-export certificate' should be established to ensure that the exchange of\nthat information takes place in a uniform manner.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nestablish an electronic system for the notifications required in accordance\nwith this Regulation. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nexceptions for Union quarantine pests used for scientific purposes, trials,\nvarietal selections, breeding or exhibitions are implemented in a manner that\ndoes not pose any phytosanitary risk to the Union territory or parts of it, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to\nthe Commission in respect of rules concerning the exchange of information\nbetween Member States and the Commission as regards the introduction into and\nmovement within the Union territory of the pests concerned, the respective\nassessments and authorisation, and the monitoring of compliance, the action in\ncase of non-compliance and the notification thereof.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure an\neffective system of notifications, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules\nconcerning notification obligations concerning the suspected presence of\nparticular Union quarantine pests which has not yet been officially confirmed.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount the technical and scientific developments concerning surveys on the\npresence of pests, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules amending or\nsupplementing the elements to be covered by the multi-annual survey programmes.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\neffective functioning of simulation exercises, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of rules setting out the frequencies, contents, format and other\nprovisions on simulation exercises.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nprotected zones are established and function in a reliable manner, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of rules on surveys to be carried out for purposes of the\nrecognition of protected zones and on whether protected zones comply with the\nrespective requirements.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a\nproportionate and restricted application of the exemptions concerning the\nmovement of plants, plant products or other objects into or within frontier\nzones, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of rules concerning the maximum width of\nthird country frontier zones and Member State frontier zones, the maximum\ndistance of the movement of the plants, plant products and other objects\nconcerned within the third country frontier zones and Member State frontier\nzones and the procedures concerning the authorisation of the introduction into\nand movement within the Member State frontier zones of plants, plant products\nand other objects.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid phytosanitary\nrisks during transit of plants, plant products or other objects, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of rules setting out the contents of a declaration\nconcerning the passing of plants, plant products or other objects through the\nUnion territory for the purpose of moving to a third country.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nregistration of professional operators is proportionate to the objective of\ncontrolling phytosanitary risk, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules\nsetting out categories of, and conditions for, professional operators to be\nexempted from the obligation to register in a register.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncredibility of phytosanitary certificates of third countries which are not\nparties to the IPPC, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290\nTFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules supplementing the\nconditions for acceptance of phytosanitary certificates from those third\ncountries.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise the\nphytosanitary risks of plants, plant products or other objects moved within the\nUnion territory, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU\nshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules setting out the\nmaximum figure for small quantities of particular plants, plant products or\nother objects to be exempted from plant passports.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nreliability of examinations of plants, plant products and other objects carried\nout for the issuance of plant passports, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules\non visual examination, sampling and testing and the use of certification\nschemes.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance the\ncredibility of plant passports, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules setting\nout qualification requirements to be fulfilled by the professional operators in\norder for them to be authorised to issue plant passports.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance the\nscope and utility of the phytosanitary risk management plan, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission\nin respect of rules supplementing or amending the elements covered by such\nplan.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount the development of international standards, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of rules concerning attestations for commodities of a specific nature,\nother than wood packaging material, which would require the application of a\nspecific attestation of compliance with the rules of this Regulation.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nutility and reliability of official attestations and pre-export certificates, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to\nthe Commission in respect of rules setting out the contents of official\nattestations, the authorisation and supervision of professional operators\nissuing those attestations, and the contents of the pre-export certificate.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to adapt to the\ntechnical and scientific developments, and to adapt to a decision of the\nEuropean Council pursuant to Article 355(6) TFEU, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of rules amending the Annexes of this Regulation.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation with respect to\nestablishing a list of Union quarantine pests, establishing a list of the\npriority pests, setting out measures against specific Union quarantine pests,\nadopting measures for a limited time as regards the phytosanitary risks posed\nby pests provisionally qualifying as Union quarantine pests, recognising the\nprotected zones recognised in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article\n2(1)(h) of Directive 2000/29/EC and establishing a list of the respective\nprotected zone quarantine pests, amending or revoking protected zones, amending\nthe list of those protected zones, listing of Union quality pests and the\nplants for planting concerned, listing the plants, plant products and other\nobjects whose introduction into and movement within the Union territory is to\nbe prohibited, and the third countries concerned, listing the plants, plant products\nand other objects, and the requirements for their introduction into and\nmovement within the Union territory, setting out equivalent requirements of\nthird countries to the requirements for movement within the Union territory of\nplants, plant products or other objects, setting out specific conditions or\nmeasures concerning the introduction of particular plants, plant

and other objects, for which a plant passport is to be required for\ntheir introduction into certain protected zones, and setting out the format of\nthe plant passport, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member\nStates of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[16].\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The advisory procedure\nshould be used for the adoption of the initial list of Union quarantine pests\ngiven that that initial list should merely contain, without any modifications,\nthe pests listed in Part A of Annex I to Directive 2000/29/EC and Section I of\nPart A of Annex II to that Directive, for the amendment of the scientific name\nof a pest, where such an amendment is justified on the basis of the development\nof
