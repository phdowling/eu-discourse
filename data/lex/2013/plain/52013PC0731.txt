Article 12(b) of the Agreement provides as follows: \"This\r\nAgreement is concluded for an initial period of five years. Subject to review\r\nby the Parties in the final year of each successive period, the Agreement may\r\nbe extended with possible amendments, thereafter for additional period of five\r\nyears by mutual written agreement by the Parties\". \nBy Council Decision 2009/306/EC of 30 March\r\n2009, the Agreement was extended for a further period of five years. The\r\nAgreement is due to expire on 14 October 2013. \nExtension of the Agreement would be in the\r\ninterest of both Parties so as to maintain continuity in the scientific and\r\ntechnological relations between the US and the European Union leading to\r\nsocio-economic benefits for both Parties.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission published in June 2013 a\r\nreview of the Agreement in 2012-2013 conducted by independent experts.\nBoth sides confirmed their interest in\r\nextending the Agreement in order to continue to facilitate cooperation between\r\nthe Union and the United States of America in common science and technology\r\nareas. \nHowever, during\r\nexploratory talks and an exchange of letters with Dr\r\nKerri-Ann Jones, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International\r\nEnvironmental and Scientific Affairs, the USA made the extension of the current\r\nAgreement conditional upon negotiation of some amendments. In a letter from 19\r\nMarch 2013, Dr Jones identified the intellectual property rights annex as a potential\r\narea for negotiation. The USA is preparing an official note identifying all the\r\nareas which they would like to negotiate. \nConsidering that engagement in negotiations\r\ncould lead to a lengthy process, which would most certainly go beyond the expiration\r\ndate of the current Agreement, it was commonly decided to proceed on two\r\nparallel tracks:\n(1)                   \r\nstart by extending the current Agreement under\r\nits existing provisions, in order to avoid any disruptions;\n(2)                   \r\nIn parallel, the two parties will engage in a\r\nprocess which will lead to the negotiation of an amended Agreement. Such\r\nnegotiations will require the Council to adopt a decision authorising the\r\nopening of negotiations in accordance with Article 218 (3) of the TFEU upon the\r\nCommission's recommendation.[1] \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe material content of the extended\r\nAgreement will be identical to that of the current Agreement. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Legislative Financial Statement presented\r\nwith this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications.

In addition,\r\nthe Commission will make sure, in carrying out the research activities, that\r\nthe financial interests of the Union are protected by effective checks and,\r\nwhere irregularities are detected, by deterrent and proportionate measures and\r\npenalties.\nIn\r\norder to achieve this aim, rules on checks, measures and penalties, with\r\nreference to Regulations No 2988/95, No 2185/96 and No 1073/99 will be\r\nincorporated in all contracts used in the implementation of the Framework\r\nprogramme.\nIn\r\nparticular, the following points will have to be provided for in the contracts:\n-\r\nthe introduction of specific contractual clauses to protect the financial\r\ninterests of the EU in carrying out checks and controls in relation to the work\r\nperformed;\n-\r\nthe carrying out of administrative checks as part of anti-fraud measures, in\r\naccordance with Regulations No 2185/96, No 1073/1999 and No 1074/1999;\n-\r\nthe application of administrative penalties for all intentional or negligent\r\nirregularities in the implementation of the contracts, in accordance with the\r\nFramework Regulation No 2988/95, including a blacklisting mechanism;\n-\r\nthe fact that any recovery orders in the event of irregularities and fraud must\r\nbe enforceable according to Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union. \nIn\r\naddition and as a routine measure, a control programme in respect of scientific\r\nand budgetary aspects will be carried out by the responsible staff in the DG\r\nfor Research and Innovation; an internal audit will be carried out by the\r\nInternal Audit unit of DG Research and Innovation; and local inspections will\r\nbe undertaken by the European Court of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
