Member States are required to\nnotify every two years to the Commission data and information on investment\nprojects concerning production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas, electricity\n(including electricity from renewable sources), biofuels and the capture and\nstorage of carbon dioxide.\nInvestments to be notified to the\nCommission encompass planned and under construction projects, transformation of\nexisting infrastructure as well as decommissioning projects of a certain size,\non a five-year horizon, in the territory of Member States, including\ninterconnections with third countries. Undertakings concerned should be under\nan obligation to notify to the Member State the data and information in\nquestion.\nThe Court's ruling of 6 September 2012 was\ndecided after the European Parliament took legal action against the Council in\nOctober 2010 contesting the legal basis used for the adoption of Regulation 617/2010\nand requesting the Court to annul it (Case C-490/10). The Council used Articles\n337 TFEU and 187 TEAEC as a legal base, on the grounds that the Regulation\nrelates to the activity of collecting general information. \nFollowing the Parliament's request, the\nCourt annulled Regulation 617/2010, but maintained its effects until a new\nregulation has been adopted on the correct legal basis within a reasonable\nperiod of time. In order to comply with the Court's\njudgement and to ensure continuity in the observation of investment projects in\nenergy infrastructure, the Commission proposes a Regulation with the same\ncontent as the annulled Regulation and suggests a few adaptations, which are strictly necessary due to the new\nlegislative process. These modifications concern the new legislative procedure\n(ordinary legislative procedure), the date for a review of the act (31 December\n2016 instead of 23 July 2015) and the date for reporting. \nFollowing the ruling of the Court, the\neffects of the annulled Regulation are maintained until a new Regulation has\nbeen adopted. Even though we expect a swift adoption of the new Regulation in\nthe course of 2013, it is unlikely that the new Regulation will be adopted\nbefore July 2013, which is the next deadline for Member States to notify their\ninvestments according to the annulled Regulation. The next reporting exercise\nin 2013 should therefore still be based on the annulled Regulation. In the new Regulation proposed, notification of\ndata should be done from 1 January 2015 and from then onwards every two years. \nThe form and technical details of the notification to the Commission\nof data and information on investment projects in energy infrastructure are set\nout in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 833/2010 of 21\nSeptember 2010 implementing the annulled Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\n617/2010. Commission Regulation 833/2010 will remain applicable until its\nrevision, which will follow the adoption of this proposed Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nGiven that (i) a proper impact assessment\nand a consultation with the interested parties were carried out when Regulation\n617/2010 was proposed, (ii) the content of the proposed Regulation is the same\nas that of Regulation 617/2010, the Commission did not carry out a new impact\nassessment, nor did the Commission launch a new consultation with the\ninterested parties. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposed Regulation establishes a\ncommon framework for the notification to the Commission of data and information\non investment projects in energy infrastructure in the petroleum, gas,\nelectricity and bio-fuel sectors and related to carbon dioxide produced by\nthese sectors. \nEvery two years, Member States or the entity they delegate this task to would be required to collect and notify data\nand information on investment projects concerning production, transport and\nstorage. To minimise the administrative burden, two elements of flexibility and\nsimplification are introduced: \n\u2013     \nUnless otherwise decided by Member States,\nundertakings would be under an obligation to provide Member States - or the\ncompetent entity - information on their investment projects, including\ndecommissioning projects; \n\u2013     \nMember States would be exempted from reporting\nif they already provide equivalent information to the Commission under EU\nenergy sector \u2013 specific legislation. This would also be the case if the bodies\nin charge of network development plans for gas and electricity collect the\nrelevant data. In this case, they would be requested to notify the relevant\ndata to the Commission, with the appropriate comments of Member States if\nnecessary. \nData and information collected (type of\ninvestment, planned capacities and major obstacles\u2026) would provide the major\ntrends for investment in EU energy infrastructure. Provision is made to\nguarantee that data and information notified to the Commission meet generally\naccepted standards; that data and information are received, stored and\nprocessed with the appropriate IT tools and in full compliance with the legal\nframework on data protection for individuals; that data and information will be\nmade public except where they are commercially sensitive.\nOn the basis of the data and information\nreceived, the Commission will provide a regular and cross \u2013 sector analysis of\nthe structural evolution and perspectives of the EU energy system and any other\nspecific analysis needed. This would allow for an identification of potential\nfuture demand and supply gaps and obstacles to investment. With these analyses,\nthe Commission will be in a better position to promote best practice and to\nestablish greater transparency for market participants. To develop common views\non these issues, the results of these analyses would be discussed with\nstakeholders and published.\nLegal\nbasis\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article\n194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThis draft proposal aims at strengthening\nthe framework for collection of data and information for the Commission\u2019s\ntasks. With appropriate data, the Commission and in particular its Market\nObservatory for Energy will be in a better position to monitor the evolution of\nthe EU energy system, in a cross \u2013 sector perspective and at EU level, and the\npotential problems which could delay or hinder investment projects. Given the\ninterrelations of energy sub sectors (e.g. electricity and gas) and the\nexistence of an internal market, the EU-wide dimension is becoming more and\nmore relevant, thus justifying the role of EU institutions and of the\nCommission in particular. \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle. This proposal does not go beyond what is necessary\nin order to achieve the objectives. Member States will continue to have\nconsiderable flexibility in choosing the arrangements to collect data.\nChoice of instruments\nThe instrument proposed is a Regulation as\nit replaces an existing Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal\nwill have a limited impact on the Community budget, in particular to cover\nexpenditure on information technology and, should the Commission so decide,\nexpenditure on data purchasing of data and reimbursement of experts. No\nmajor direct impact is foreseen for the budgets of Member States.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nSimplification\nBy taking account of existing reporting\nobligations and monitoring mechanisms, this proposal does not add an\nunnecessary administrative burden but should apply for its reporting part only\nif equivalent data and information is not provided by sector- specific\nlegislation. \nReview clause\nBy 31\nDecember 2016, the Commission will review the reporting and monitoring\nmechanism laid down by the new Regulation.\n2013/0082 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nconcerning the notification to the\nCommission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European\nUnion and replacing Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL\nOF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee\nof the Regions, \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obtaining an overall\npicture of the development of investment in energy infrastructure in the Union is essential for the Commission to perform its tasks in the field of energy. The\navailability of regular and up-to-date data and information should enable the\nCommission to make the necessary comparisons, evaluations or to propose\nrelevant measures based on appropriate figures and analysis, in particular\nconcerning the future energy supply-demand balance.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The energy landscape\nwithin and outside the Union has changed significantly in recent years and\nmakes investment in energy infrastructure a crucial issue for securing the\nUnion\u2019s energy supply, for the functioning of the internal market and for the\ntransition towards a low-carbon energy system the Union has begun.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new energy context\nrequires significant investment in all kinds of infrastructure in all energy\nsectors as well as the development of new types of infrastructure and new\ntechnologies to be taken up by the market. The liberalisation of the energy\nsector and the further integration of the internal market give a more prominent\nrole to economic operators for investment. At the same time, new policy\nrequirements such as targets affecting the fuel mix will alter Member States\u2019\npolicies towards new and/or modernised energy infrastructure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, greater\nattention should be paid to investment in energy infrastructure in the Union,\nin particular with a view to anticipating problems, promoting best practices\nand establishing greater transparency on the future development of the Union\u2019s energy system.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission and in\nparticular its Market Observatory for Energy should therefore have at its\ndisposal accurate data and information on investment projects, including\ndecommissioning, in the most significant components of the energy system of the\nUnion.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data and information\nregarding foreseeable developments in production, transmission and storage\ncapacities and projects in the various energy sectors are of interest to the Union and important to future investment. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the\nCommission is notified of investment projects on which construction or\ndecommissioning work has started or on which a final investment decision has\nbeen taken.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Articles 41\nand 42 of the Euratom Treaty, undertakings are under an obligation to notify\ntheir investment projects. It is necessary to supplement such information with,\nin particular, a regular reporting on the implementation of investment\nprojects. Such additional reporting is without prejudice to Articles 41 to 44\nof the Euratom Treaty.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for the\nCommission to have a consistent view of the future developments of the Union\u2019s energy system as a whole, a harmonised reporting framework for investment projects\nbased on updated categories for official data and information to be transmitted\nby the Member States is necessary.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should, to\nthis end, notify to the Commission, data and information on investment projects\nin energy infrastructure concerning production, storage and transport of oil,\nnatural gas, electricity, including electricity from renewable sources,\nbio-fuels and the capture and storage of carbon dioxide planned or under\nconstruction in their territory, including interconnections with third\ncountries. Undertakings concerned should be under an obligation to notify to\nthe Member State the data and information in question.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the time horizon of\ninvestment projects in the energy sector, reporting every two years should be\nsufficient.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to avoiding\ndisproportionate administrative burdens and to minimise costs to Member States\nand undertakings in particular for small and medium enterprises, this\nRegulation should give the possibility to exempt Member States and undertakings\nfrom reporting obligations provided that equivalent information is supplied to\nthe Commission pursuant to energy sector-specific legal acts, adopted by the\ninstitutions of the Union, aiming at achieving the objectives of competitive\nenergy markets in the Union, of sustainability of the energy system of the\nUnion and of the security of energy supply to the Union. Any duplication of\nreporting requirements specified in the third internal market package for\nelectricity and natural gas should therefore be avoided.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To process data as well as\nto simplify and secure data notification, the Commission and in particular its\nMarket Observatory for Energy should be able to take all appropriate measures\nto that effect, in particular the operation of integrated IT tools and\nprocedures.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The protection of\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States\nis governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[1], while the protection of\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Commission is\ngoverned by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil[2].\nThis Regulation leaves those provisions intact.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States, or their delegated entities, and the Commission should preserve the confidentiality of\ncommercially sensitive data and information. Therefore, Member States or their delegated entities should, with the exception of data and information related\nto cross-border transmission projects, aggregate such data and information at\nnational level before submitting it to the Commission. If required the\nCommission should further aggregate this data in such a way that no details\nconcerning individual undertakings and installations are disclosed or can be\ninferred.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission and in\nparticular its Market Observatory for Energy should provide a regular and\ncross-sector analysis of the structural evolution and perspectives of the Union\nenergy system and, where appropriate, more focused analysis on certain aspects\nof this energy system. This analysis should in particular contribute to\nidentifying possible infrastructure and investment gaps in view of an energy\nsupply and demand balance. The analysis should also form a contribution to a\ndiscussion at Union level about energy infrastructures and should therefore be\nforwarded to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and\nSocial Committee and made available to interested parties.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission may be\nassisted by experts from Member States or any other competent experts, with a\nview to developing a common understanding of potential infrastructure gaps and\nassociated risks and to fostering transparency regarding future developments.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation replaces\nCouncil Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 of 24 June 2010, which was\nannulled by the European Court of Justice on 6 September 2012 and whose effects\nwere maintained until a new regulation is adopted[3].\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The form and technical\ndetails of the notification to the Commission of data and information on\ninvestment projects in energy infrastructure are set out in the Commission\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 833/2010 of 21 September 2010, implementing Council\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010. Commission Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\n833/2010 remains applicable until its revision, which will follow the adoption\nof this Regulation. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.
