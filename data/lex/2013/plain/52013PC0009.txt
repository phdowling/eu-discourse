MEMORANDUM\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the\nCommission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement\nor amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in\nArticle 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the\nCommission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union\nacts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts).\nIn the context of the alignment of\nRegulation (EC) No 1224/2009 on the new decision-making rules of the TFEU,\npowers currently conferred upon the Commission under that Regulation have been\nre-classified into delegated and implementing powers. \nFollowing this exercise, a draft proposal\nfor an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 has been prepared. \nPursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty, the\nLegislator may confer upon the Commission powers to supplement or amend certain\nnon-essential elements of that Regulation. \nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt\ndelegated acts to grant exemptions from the obligation of prior notification\nand the obligation to complete and submit a transhipment declaration, to decide\na different way and frequency for data transmission, to adopt rules on the\nkeeping on board of stowage plans for certain processed fisheries products, to\ndefine the trigger catch levels for real-time closures of a fishery, to modify\nthe distances by which a vessel has to change position under certain\ncircumstances, to amend threshold below which fish products are exempted from\ntraceability, first sale and sale notes rules, to determine fisheries subject\nto specific control and inspection programmes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThere was no need for consultation of\ninterested parties or for impact assessment. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nIdentify the powers conferred upon the Commission\nin Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and classify these as delegated or\nimplementing powers \nAdapt certain provisions to the decision-making\nprocedures of the TFEU. \n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 43(2) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union. \n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union.\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal is amending measures which\nalready exist in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, therefore no concern on\nthe principle of proportionality arises. \n\u00b7      Choice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason: a Regulation must be amended by a Regulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis measure does not involve any\nadditional Union expenditure. \n2013/0007 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation

of the common fishery policy[1] confers powers upon the\nCommission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nentry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation\n(EC) No 1224/2009 need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to develop some\nof the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Fonctionning of the European\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the following:\n\u2013     \nthe exemption of certain categories of fishing\nvessels from the obligation of

fisheries subject to\nspecific control and inspection programmes;\n\u2013     \nthe adoption of a different way and frequency\nfor data transmission by Member States to the Commission following pilot\nprojects. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, implementing\npowers should be conferred upon the Commission in accordance with Article 291\nof Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the following:\n\n\u2013     \nfishing licences;\n\u2013     \nfishing authorisations;\n\u2013     \nthe vessel monitoring system;\n\u2013     \nconversion factors to convert stored or\nprocessed fish weight into live fish weight;\n\u2013     \nthe completion and submission of logbooks\ninsofar as they are not delegated acts;\n\u2013     \nthe methodology for sampling plans for fishing\nvessels not subject to fishing logbook requirements;\n\u2013     \nthe completion and submission of transhipment\ndeclarations as far as they are not delegated acts ;\n\u2013     \nthe completion and submission of landing\ndeclarations;\n\u2013     \nthe methodology for sampling plans for fishing\nvessels not subject to landing declaration requirements;\n\u2013     \nthe formats for transmission of catch and effort\ndata to the Commission;\n\u2013     \nthe closure of a fishery by the Commission;\n\u2013     \ncorrective measures in cases of closure of a\nfishery by the Commission;\n\u2013     \nchecks of fishing capacity of Member States;\n\u2013     \nthe certification of propulsion engine power and\nthe physical verification of propulsion engine power;\n\u2013     \nthe methodology for sampling plans for the\nverification of engine power;\n\u2013     \nthe approval by the Commission of plans on\ncontrols in designated ports;\n\u2013     \nthe calculation of trigger catch levels for\nreal-time closures;\n\u2013     \nreal-time closures;\n\u2013     \nthe establishment, notification and evaluation\nof sampling plans for recreational fisheries;\n\u2013     \nthe information on fisheries and aquaculture\nproducts to consumers;\n\u2013     \nthe approval by the Commission of sampling\nplans, control plans and common control programmes for weighing;\n\u2013     \nthe methodology for sampling plans, control\nplans and common control programmes for weighing;\n\u2013     \nthe content and format of sales notes;\n\u2013     \nthe format of surveillance reports;\n\u2013     \ninspection reports;\n\u2013     \nthe electronic database for uploading inspection\nand surveillance reports;\n\u2013     \nthe establishment of a list of Union inspectors;\n\u2013     \nthe fixation of quantities as a corrective\nmeasure in the absence of proceedings by the Member State of landing or\ntranshipment;\n\u2013     \npoint system for serious infringements insofar\nas they are not delegated acts;\n\u2013     \nfisheries subject to specific control and\ninspection programmes;\n\u2013     \nextension of a period for forwarding to the\nCommission the results of an administrative inquiry;\n\u2013     \nthe establishment of an action plan in case of\nirregularities or shortcomings in the control system of a Member State;\n\u2013     \nthe suspension and cancellation of Union\nfinancial assistance;\n\u2013     \nthe closure of fisheries for failure to comply\nwith the common fisheries policy objectives;\n\u2013     \nthe deduction of quotas;\n\u2013     \nthe deduction of effort;\n\u2013     \nthe deduction of quotas for failure to comply\nwith the rules of the common fisheries policy;\n\u2013     \ntemporary measures;\n\u2013     \nthe approval by the Commission of national plans\nfor the implementation of the data validation system;\n\u2013     \nthe analysis and audit of data;\n\u2013     \nthe development of common standards and\nprocedures to ensure transparent communication;\n\u2013     \nthe operation of websites and web services;\n\u2013     \nthe content and format of reports by Member\nStates on the application of this Regulation.\nWhere the control of Member States is required\nthose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member\nStates of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[2].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nentry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the provision on emergency measures\nwhich foresees a referral of certain Commission measures to the Council under\ncertain conditions needs to be adapted.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nentry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, some provisions conferring\ndecision-making powers upon Council alone need to be adapted to bring them into\nline with the new procedures applicable to the common fisheries policy.
