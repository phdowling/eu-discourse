At present, the Adriatic Highway, a two-lane state road D8 passing\nthrough the Neum Corridor, is the only land transport connection between the\narea of Dubrovnik and the rest of the territory of Croatia. The section of the\nroad that passes through the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum is\n9.25 km long. There are two border crossing points on the territory of Croatia,\nsituated at both ends of the road mentioned in the Neum Corridor. These are\nKlek \u2013 Neum I, on the western part of the Neum Corridor, and Zaton Doli - Neum\nII, in the eastern part of the Neum Corridor. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes\nfor a vehicle to travel the distance between these two points.\nThe local economy in the area surrounding\nthe city of Dubrovnik is primarily focused on tourism which is run mostly by\nsmall and medium sized enterprises dependent on supplies of goods from the main\nterritory of Croatia whose value is usually below EUR 10 000 per consignment.\nCurrently, 89% of the goods transported\nthrough the Neum Corridor are goods that have obtained the status of goods in\nfree circulation in Croatia. They pass through the corridor accompanied by\npaper-based documents equivalent to the T2L document as referred to in Article\n317 (2) of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2454/92. \nThe customs authorities of Croatia\nestablish the identity of vehicles and goods, checking the accompanying\ncommercial documents before they leave temporarily the customs territory of Croatia.\nCustoms checks and controls are also to be performed, as appropriate, upon the\nre-entry of the goods after crossing the Neum Corridor. The capacity for\ncustoms controls is to be enhanced at the time of accession of Croatia to the\nEU. \nThe application of the customs legislation\nof the EU as of the date of accession of Croatia will entail the application of\nthe customs formalities, risk analysis and controls for the purposes of safety\nand security as well as the electronic submission and exchange of information\nfor that purpose. This requires significant investments and efforts to ensure\nan appropriate IT framework. Given the specific circumstances of the Neum\nCorridor the application of these measures seems excessively burdensome and\ndisproportionate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nBy virtue of Article 43\nof the Act concerning the conditions of accession, a special act of the Council\nhas to be adopted in order to lay down the conditions for derogation from entry/exit\nsummary declarations as regards goods that are being transported through the\nNeum Corridor. \nIn accordance with the European Union\ncommon position on that matter[4],\nthe derogations from the submission of entry and exit summary declarations shall\napply under the following conditions:\n\u2013              \nthe goods have Community status, \n\u2013              \nthe goods are accompanied by commercial (invoice\nor transport) documents, which should contain at least the set of data required\nin Article 317(2) CCIP as well as the total value of the goods,\n\u2013              \nthe total value of the goods transported by a\nvehicle shall not exceed EUR 10 000,\n\u2013              \nthe document in question shall be endorsed by the\ncustoms authorities of Croatia upon exit of the goods with official markings\n(signature, stamps and date and time of exit),\n\u2013              \nwhen deemed necessary, proper sealing of\nconsignments or means of transport is performed at exit from Croatia,\n\u2013              \nupon re-entry into the territory of Croatia, the\ncustoms authorities shall check the documents, the time spent for crossing the\ncorridor, the seals (if any) and the goods (where appropriate).\nThe application of these derogations shall\nnot prejudice the requirement to carry out risk analysis and controls for safety\nand security purposes, exchange of risk information in accordance with Article\n4g (2) CCIP and appropriate measures in case of irregularities. Croatia should\nprovide the Commission with sufficient proof that the arrangements applied by\nthe customs authorities are equivalent to the standards of risk analysis laid\ndown in the EU customs legislation.\nIn addition to the exchange of risk information referred to\nabove, Croatia shall regularly inform the Commission under the agreed procedures of the Common Risk Management\nFramework of irregularities that have been found and, where applicable,\nof the measures that have been subsequently adopted.\nA review, aimed to verify the proper\napplication of this regime, shall be held two years after the date of\naccession. \nWhere appropriate, acting on the\nbasis of a proposal from the Commission, the Council shall amend or terminate this regime.\n2013/0003 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the waiver from the requirement to\nsubmit entry and exit summary declarations for Union goods that are moved\nacross the Neum corridor \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Accession Treaty of Croatia,\nand in particular Article 3(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession of\nCroatia, and in particular Article 43 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9 December 2011, the\nMember States of the Union and Croatia signed the Treaty concerning the accession\nof the Republic of Croatia to the European Union (\u201cAccession Treaty\u201d). By\nvirtue of Article 3(3) of the Accession Treaty it is to enter into force on 1\nJuly 2013 provided that all the instruments of ratification have been deposited\nbefore that date. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 2 of\nthe Act concerning the conditions of accession of the\nRepublic of Croatia and the adjustments to the Treaty on European Union, the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty Establishing the\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community (\u201cthe Act concerning the conditions of\naccession\u201d), as from the date of accession, the provisions of the original\nTreaties and the acts adopted by the institutions before accession shall be\nbinding on Croatia under the conditions laid down in those Treaties and in the\nAct concerning the conditions of accession. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The territory of Neum\n(\"Neum Corridor\") is a place where the territory of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina reaches the Adriatic coast, thus separating the area of Dubrovnik\nfrom the rest of the territory of Croatia. Tourism is of significant importance\nfor the local economy, which is driven by small and medium sized enterprises\ndependent on supplies from the rest of the territory of Croatia. The value of\nsuch supplies usually does not exceed EUR 10 000 per consignment and 89 % of\nthese goods have the status of goods in free circulation on the territory of\nCroatia. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\n43 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession provides that the Council,\nacting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission is to define the\nterms under which the requirement for an entry or exit summary declaration may\nbe waived as regards Union goods that are moved across the Neum Corridor.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Articles 36a (1)\nand 182a (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing\nthe Community Customs Code[5]\n(\"the Community Customs Code\"), goods entering or leaving the customs\nterritory of the Union must be accompanied, in advance, by a summary declaration\nsubmitted electronically which contains the data necessary for the performance\nof risk analysis.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the specific\ncharacteristics of the local economy it is appropriate to provide for waivers from\nthe obligation to lodge entry and exit summary declarations for Union goods moved\nacross the Neum Corridor.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Customs authorities should\nperform effective risk analysis and customs security checks on the basis of the\ndata present on the invoice and transport documents, accompanying the goods.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current arrangements\nderogate from the principle of electronic pre-arrival submission of safety and\nsecurity data set up under the Community Customs Code. In order to ensure\neffective and efficient risk analysis and controls for the purposes of safety\nand security, Croatia should ensure that the border crossing points at the Neum\nCorridor dispose of the necessary human resources, equipment and control.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a consignment is\nfound not to fulfil the requirements of this Regulation, the consignment in\nquestion should not be allowed to re-enter the territory of Croatia unless an\nassessment of the risk involved has been carried out and effective and targeted\nmeasures based upon a risk analysis have been adopted. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition to the exchange of information for the purposes of safety and security\nas provided under Article 4g (2) of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0\n2454/92, Croatia should regularly inform the Commission\nunder the procedures of the Common Risk\nManagement Framework for any irregularities found and, where applicable,\nof the measures subsequently adopted with regard to the movement of goods\nacross the Neum Corridor.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\nassessment for the purposes of verifying the proper application of this\nRegulation should be carried out two years after the date of accession,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Regulation lays down the rules under which: \n(a)\nthe requirement for an exit summary declaration is waived for Union goods\nleaving the territory of Croatia to be moved across the Neum corridor;
