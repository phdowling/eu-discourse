While\nsuch cooperation has already been successful, a number of areas have been\nidentified where further action is necessary, mainly as regards the functioning\nof the antifraud system in the customs field and the improvement of customs\nrisk management at national and Union levels[1].\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal context\nThe main legal instruments applying to\nbreaches of customs legislation in this context are Regulation (EC) No 515/97\nof 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of\nthe Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to\nensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters,\nand Council Decision 2009/917/JHA of 30 November 2009 on the use of information\ntechnology for customs purposes. \nRegulation (EC) No 515/97 governs issues relating\nto the customs union which is an area of the exclusive EU competence according\nto Article 3(1)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU).\nCouncil Decision 2009/917/JHA addresses\nmatters relating to the area of freedom, security and justice which according\nto Article 4(2)(j) of TFEU is an area of shared competence between the Union and\nthe Member States.\nOn this basis, the Commission created an IT\nstructure, the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), for the implementation of the\nrelevant legislation, which includes databases for customs issues and for\nissues related to cooperation in the law enforcement field.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific issues\n1.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nneed to address loopholes in the existing systems for the detection of\ncustoms-related fraud \nThere are various duties, taxes, rates and\nquantitative limits which have to be respected by traders operating\nlegitimately in the EU. The financial gains to be had from avoidance of these\ncharges constitute an incentive to commit fraud such as misdeclaration of\norigin, misdescription of goods and misuse of the transit system. This risk is\neven greater since the existing systems for the detection of customs fraud are\nstill not sufficiently developed and the means of checking the true origin of\nimported goods are currently limited. In particular, it is not possible for\ncustoms officers to verify whether the declared origin of goods is consistent\nwith the route followed by the container transporting the goods. The\ninformation on container movements (Container Status Messages - CSMs) is\nconsidered crucial for detecting cases of misdeclaration of origin. The current\nsystem for the detection of misdescription of goods is also unsatisfactory. In\nthis context, the identification of suspicious cases by customs authorities is\nbased on notifications that may be received from various sources (for example\nother customs authorities or economic operators) and risk analysis based on\nlimited data. The main drawback of this procedure is that the controls are\nstill not sufficiently targeted as they are based on analyses of limited data.\nSimilarly, gaps exist in the system for the detection of misuse of the transit\nsystem. The procedure currently used for the verification of goods in transit\nconsists of document checking and physical controls. However, the effectiveness\nand efficiency of these methods are limited by the available resources and by\nlimitations in the scope and quality of data available for automated risk\nanalysis and targeting of controls. To effectively target instances of\nmisdeclaration of origin, misdescription of goods and misuse of the transit\nsystem, it is appropriate to use automated and scientific risk analysis methods\nfor identification of suspect shipments. The Commission believes that these\nmethods can be more effectively and efficiently implemented when supported by\nsystematic availability of high-quality and timely data on CSMs, imports,\nexports and transit at national and EU levels.\n1.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need to enhance customs\nrisk management and supply chain security at national and EU levels\nThe need to establish an equivalent level of\ncustoms controls for goods brought into/ taken out of the customs territory of\nthe Union is recognised, alongside the need to introduce a Union-wide risk\nmanagement framework to support a common approach. In that context, Regulation\n(EC) No 648/2005 amending the Community Customs Code provides for the common\nrisk management framework which has been implemented by the Commission and the\nMember States. In its Communication on Customs Risk Management and Security of\nthe Supply Chain[2], the Commission identified a number of strategic implementation\nchallenges. Of particular importance are the difficulties caused by gaps in the\navailability and quality of data for pre-arrival screening for safety and\nsecurity risks. The Communication emphasises that 'provision\nby traders of quality data and its availability to the authorities involved in\nrisk management at the appropriate level is a major priority'. In this context, the collection of CSMs and their integration in\npre-arrival risk analysis can make a vital contribution to enhancing the supply\nchain security in general and to the work of the Commission and the Member\nStates in managing the risks identified in Article 4 (25) of the Community\nCustoms Code, including the threats posed to the Union\u2019s security and safety,\nto public health, to the environment and to consumers.\n1.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need to address delays\nin OLAF investigations\nAs a result of\nthe recent introduction of e-Customs, the documents supporting import and\nexport declarations (invoice, certificate of origin, etc.) are kept by the\neconomic operators and no longer by the customs administrations. Importantly,\nthese documents are often necessary for OLAF to conduct its investigations. The\ncurrent procedure used by OLAF to obtain those documents is to send a request\nto the Member States. However, such a system is inefficient because, as\npreviously mentioned, the Member States are no longer in possession of relevant\ninformation and thus they have to request it from the economic operators before\nforwarding it to the Commission. This causes a loss of time before the\ndocuments become available to OLAF. There is currently no provision in the\nlegal framework which could be used to accelerate procedures relating to OLAF\ninvestigations.\n1.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nneed for clarification on the possibility to\nrestrict visibility of data \nThe AFIS IT system is currently underused because Member States are\nnot able to select the potential users of the information they insert in the\nsystem. Consequently, protection of the Union's financial interests and customs\ncooperation are sub-optimal and unnecessarily obstructed. There is thus a need for technical clarification that data inserted\nby the owners can be restricted to particular users. A provision in the\nRegulation clearly enabling data owners to restrict visibility to specific\nusers would considerably increase the exchange of information and improve\nfurther the possibility to prevent, detect and investigate customs-related\nfraud. In addition, restricted visibility protects confidentiality and\ntherefore improves the level of confidence in the system. The ability to shield\nsensitive data would lead to increased willingness to share information within\nthe AFIS system. Moreover the restricted visibility feature would enable the\nCommission to improve data management, making it possible to store, update and\nsearch for information thus far only exchanged.\n1.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nneed for streamlined data protection supervision \nIn line with the current legislation, two\ndifferent bodies (i.e. European Data Protection Supervisor \u2013 EDPS and Customs\nJoint Supervisory Authority \u2013 CJSA) carry out audits. There are cases where a lack\nof coordination between these bodies leads to diverging recommendations causing\ninefficient use of resources in the Commission and Member States. The\nimplementation process is prolonged because it is necessary to accommodate the recommendations\nof both the EDPS and CJSA. This causes inefficiency and generates additional\ncosts in terms of time and resources. Carrying out the recommendations can\ncontinue even one year after the audit took place. Closer collaboration between\nthe two supervisory bodies is therefore necessary.\nAnother issue in the area of data\nprotection which needs to be further clarified is the responsibility for the\ntechnical systems established by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC)\nNo 515/97. Currently, the Commission is providing Member States with technical\nassistance, training, communication activity and other operational support by\nmeans of technical systems. However, the responsibility for data protection supervision\nwith regard to those technical systems has not been specifically assigned. For\nthis reason, the proposal clarifies the EDPS' competence. \n1.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nneed for clarification on the admissibility of evidence collected under mutual assistance\nCurrently, national prosecutors are\nreluctant to use documents obtained via mutual assistance channels as evidence\nin criminal proceedings because the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 are\nnot sufficiently clear on such a possibility. This inevitably causes delays in\nnational criminal proceedings or may even result in the dismissal of a case due\nto time barring. Importantly, it also undermines the principle of legal\ncertainty, given that relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 are subject\nto differing interpretations. It appears necessary to clarify that the evidence\nobtained via mutual assistance may be used by prosecutors in the national criminal\nproceedings. The proposal does not oblige national courts to accept such\nevidence automatically as it still has to satisfy the national procedural\nrules. \n1.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Public\nProsecutor\u2019s Office\nThe Commission recently proposed the\nsetting up of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office[3]. Given the associated changes\nin the investigation and prosecution of crimes affecting the Union\u2019s financial\ninterests, the Commission should assess the need for revision of the current Regulation\nonce the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is established. In that event, all\nnational authorities of the Member States and all institutions, bodies, offices\nand agencies of the Union must immediately inform the European Public\nProsecutor\u2019s Office of any conduct which might constitute an offence within its\ncompetence. In accordance with the draft Regulation establishing the European\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the latter will have access to the databases\noperated by the Commission or the Member States under this Regulation.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposed solution\nIn order to address the above shortcomings,\nit appears necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 515/97.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\nstakeholders\nThe Commission has consulted stakeholders\non a number of occasions and has taken into account the comments received. \n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States\u2019 customs authorities\nMember States were consulted by means of a questionnaire\nin February 2012. Member States expressed their needs for access to customs-related\ndata (import, transit and export) regarding transactions in another Member\nState and the perceived usefulness of information on container movements. They\nalso provided their views on the best way of collecting, storing and analysing\nsuch information. \nIn May 2012, the Commission organised a conference\nto gather feedback and suggestions from Member State experts on the overall\nfunctioning of the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), as well as on the\nimplementation of and prospects for Regulation (EC) No 515/97. The conference\nconsisted of a plenary session and four specific workshops on legal issues,\nJoint Customs Operations, applications, and technical and IT security aspects\nof the current status and future evolution of AFIS. \nOn a number of occasions, the Commission\nconsulted the \u2018Mutual Assistance Committee\u2019, established on the basis of\nArticle 43 of Regulation (EC) No 515/97, consisting of the representatives\nof the Member States responsible for mutual administrative assistance matters.\nRecent discussions took place during the meetings on 24 May 2012 and on 25 September\n2012.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shipping companies - World\nShipping Council\nA major consultation of the shipping\nindustry took place on 15 March 2012, with participation of private sector companies\nand the World Shipping Council (WSC)[4].\nThe aim was to inform carriers about the proposed initiative and to obtain\ntheir feedback on the envisaged provision of CSMs to the Commission. The\nCommission also proposed a pilot exercise in this area. Discussion focused on the\ntype of data that container carriers must provide to the Commission and how\nthis should be done, as well as the methods of transmission, etc. The\nCommission did its utmost to involve the industry in the preparations, so as to\nensure easy implementation of its proposal. \nIn addition, several meetings were held between\nthe Commission and representatives of the WSC.\n\nBased on these consultations, the type of\ninformation to be submitted by the companies was established. The most cost-effective\nmethod of transmitting this information is through a \u2018global dump\u2019, i.e. a\ndaily copy of all container movements. Alternatively, companies may opt for\nselective submission of data. Remaining modalities will need to be further\nspecified. \nThe shipping industry has underlined the\nneed to ensure that data provided by the companies should be transmitted only\nonce. The Commission should then be responsible for communicating these data to\ninternational and/or European institutions, as well as Member States, for the\npurposes for which the database is established. \n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data Protection Supervisors\nIn the course of the preparations for this\nproposal, meetings with the EDPS and CJSA were organised in May and June 2012.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Commission carried out an impact\nassessment of policy options, taking into account the consultations of the\ninterested parties. The conclusion was that, amongst other things, the\nsolutions sought by the main amendments of the Regulation would comprise the\nfollowing:\n\u00b7                        \nCreate conditions for improved fighting of\ncustoms fraud related to misdeclaration of goods origin through the submission\nof Container Status Messages by the deep sea carriers to the Commission. The\nrecommended submission method is global reporting (\u2018global dump\u2019) involving\nnear zero costs. An alternative submission method is also possible.\n\u00b7                        \nCreate conditions for improved fighting of\ncustoms fraud related to misdescription of goods through the\ncreation of a central database for import and export data. A legal basis for the supply of such data would need to be created.\nThis measure will not impose any additional costs on Member States because the\ninformation that is required already exists in electronic format, namely in\nrespective databases operated by the Commission. Therefore, only consent of the\nMember States to copy these data is required.\n\u00b7                        \nCreate conditions for improved fighting of\ncustoms fraud related to misuse of the transit system through the\ncreation of a centralised repository for transit-related data. \n\u00b7                        \nSpeed up OLAF investigations by enabling direct access to documents supporting import and export\ndeclarations. Expected costs for private sector operators are near zero, since\nthe obligation already exists (businesses are required by national law and also\nthe Customs Code to keep the relevant documentation). Importantly, the expected\nvolume of requests addressed to economic operators that would be necessary for\nOLAF investigations is expected to be very small (a few cases per year).\nThe Impact Assessment concluded that the\nproposed options are in line with the fundamental rights. In this context it is\nimportant to note that the envisaged CSM database would contain no personal\ndata. Databases on import, export and transit would contain personal data and\nprotection of this data is to be monitored by the EDPS according to already\napplicable standards laid down in Regulation (EC) No 515/97. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis\nThe proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 515/97\nshould be based on Articles 33 and 325 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nArticle 33 TFEU provides the basis to cover\nmost of the scope of exchanges of information between customs authorities and\nbetween the customs authorities and the Commission for the purpose of customs\ncooperation. Article 325 TFEU sets out the EU\u2019s competence to enact the\nnecessary measures in the fields of prevention of and fight against fraud and\nany other illegal activities affecting the Union\u2019s financial interests which \u2018act\nas a deterrent\u2019. Article 325(4) and Article 33 of the TFEU provide for the legislative\nprocedure to adopt the necessary measures with a view to affording effective\nand equivalent protection.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity,\nproportionality and respect for fundamental rights\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nThe need for EU-level legislation on mutual\nadministrative assistance and customs cooperation stems from the following\nfacts: \n\u00b7                        \nThe need for EU legislation on mutual\nadministrative assistance and customs cooperation has already been recognised\nby the European legislator with the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 and\nCouncil Decision 2009/917/JHA. \n\u00b7                        \nIt is acknowledged that many customs risks manifest\nthemselves on a transnational basis. Illicit supply chains can quickly adapt to\nimprovements in the risk management environment at a given point of entry and\nfocus on other points with lower levels of protection. Action at EU level is\nnecessary to ensure an equivalent level of protection against customs risks at\nall points of the external borders, as envisaged in Regulation (EC) No 648/2005.\n\u00b7                        \nGiven that trade is global, Member States alone\ncannot efficiently observe, detect and mitigate risks entailing breach of\ncustoms legislation and other customs-related risks; complementary action at EU\nlevel would substantially facilitate the work of Member States in pursuing\ninvestigations, especially in cases where cross-border transfer of goods is\ninvolved. Organising activities in the area of customs cooperation at EU level\nwould create significant added value, with a coherent approach and coordination\nof the activities. \n\u00b7                        \nThe EU has exclusive competence in the areas of fraud\nprevention and the Customs Union. \n\u00b7                        \nIt is clear from consultation with trade\nstakeholders that a single central submission of CSMs will have lower costs\nthan submission only to the Member State through which the container enters or\nleaves the customs territory of the Union.\n\u00b7                        \nThe EU is best placed to drive such collective\naction because it already possesses the necessary experience, systems and\nexpertise to guarantee the rapid and cost-efficient gathering, communication\nand sharing of data. \n\u00b7                        \nNational customs authorities alone cannot\neffectively share information and conduct a large-scale fight against breach of\ncustoms legislation and other customs risks at reasonable cost. Systematic collection\nof the data required to analyse customs risks which pose a threat to the EU and\nits Member States would constitute a disproportionate effort for 28 individual\nMember States and can be achieved more effectively and efficiently by action at\nEU level.\nIt can thus be concluded that EU action to\ncollect, store, process, use and make available to the Member States the data\nidentified in this Regulation in pursuit of the fight against fraud and other\ncustoms risks is necessary and proportionate to the nature and scale of the\nrisks concerned, and satisfies the principle of subsidiarity.\n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relation with fundamental\nrights\nThis initiative concerns in particular the\nfundamental right to protection of personal data. This right is enshrined in\nArticle 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 TFEU, based on\nDirective 95/46/EC, as well as in Article 8 of the ECHR. \nThe respect of personal data protection\nrights has already been duly considered in Regulation (EC) No 515/97 and\nCouncil Decision 2009/917/JHA through rigorous rules as regards the content\ncoverage of data, data preservation and data protection supervision. In this\ncontext, it is important to note that the envisaged CSM database would contain\nno personal data. Databases on import, export and transit would contain\npersonal data and protection of those data is to be ensured by the EDPS\naccording to already applicable standards laid down in Regulation (EC) No 515/97.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Value added \nThe proposed action at EU level would\nsignificantly improve the detection, investigation and prevention of\ncustoms-related fraud, by increasing the exchange of information and the\navailable evidence, and improving the functioning of the established system,\nthus rendering the action more efficient and effective. It would also\nsignificantly enhance the capacity of the EU to identify and mitigate the risks\nidentified in Article 4 (25) of the Community Customs Code, including the\nthreats posed to the Union\u2019s security and safety, to public health, to the\nenvironment and to consumers. Consequently, the envisaged action will\nstrengthen the protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests, improve risk\nmanagement, and further promote customs cooperation.\nTo guarantee that full value can be\ndelivered, the Commission will ensure that the governance and administration of\nthe future databases and information concerning CSMs, transit, import and\nexport is formally shared between its services for the purposes indicated in\nthe Regulation. It will ensure that the databases are available for seamless\nincorporation in risk management activities of the Commission and the Member\nStates, including systematic real-time pre-arrival and pre-departure risk\nanalysis. An appropriate inter-service governance structure will be provided to\nstreamline operational management and the allocation of responsibilities for\ndata protection and security. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nThe instrument proposed is a Regulation,\ncorresponding to the instrument being amended.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific provisions\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitions \u2013 Article 2\nThe definition of the concept of customs\nlegislation is updated, in order to have the terminology aligned with the\ncustoms field, namely adding references to entry and exit of goods. A\ndefinition of service providers active in the international supply chain in\norder to clarify to whom the obligation laid down in Article 18c(1) shall apply.\n\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Admissibility of evidence \u2013\nArticle 12\nThe proposed amendment of Article 12 aims\nat removing legal uncertainty that currently exists in relation to the possible\nuse of information collected through mutual assistance as evidence in national\ncriminal proceedings.\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information related to\nmovements of containers \u2013 Article 18a and new Articles 18c, 18d, 18e and 18f\nArticle 18a of Regulation (EC) No 515/97\nprovides for the establishment of a directory to collect data on container\nmovements and to analyse these data. However, the wording of this article does\nnot oblige the relevant economic operators (i.e. carriers) to supply the\nCommission with the information to be inserted in the directory (i.e. Container\nStatus Messages \u2014 CSMs). Consequently, while the Commission has tested the effectiveness\nof such a directory and the analysis system is of proven quality, it is limited\nin quantity due to insufficient access to necessary data.\nThe proposed amendments aim to ensure that\nthe necessary data are provided, by creating an obligation in a new Article 18c\nfor the relevant service providers to supply the information in question. This\ninformation can substantially contribute to the fight against various types of\ncustoms fraud including misdeclaration of origin, and to the management of\nother customs risks identified in Article 4(25) of the Community Customs Code. \nArticle 18d specifies that for containers\ndestined to be brought into the customs territory of the Union, the time period\nof reporting is delimited by the empty status of the container. In practice,\nthis means that carriers will have to report the CSMs for containers imported\ninto the EU from the most recent moment when the container was empty before\nbeing brought into the customs territory of the Union until the moment the\ncontainer is again reported empty after leaving the customs territory of the\nUnion. For containers leaving the customs territory of the Union the time\nperiod of reporting is limited to the moment the container is reported empty\noutside the customs territory of the Union. If it is not possible to determine\nspecific empty container events, carriers may report CSMs according to the following\ntime periods:\n(a)                   \nfor containers destined to arrive in the customs\nterritory of the Union: 3 months prior to arrival in the customs territory of\nthe Union and 1 month after the arrival in the customs territory of the Union\nor when a non-EU location is reached (whichever comes first).\n(b)                   \nfor containers leaving the customs territory of\nthe Union: during 3 months after the container has left the customs territory\nof the Union.\nWithout prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing\nanalysis, it may be envisaged that the main elements of the future delegated\nacts would be as follows:\nThe delegated act envisaged in Article 18f(1)\nwill set out, inter alia, the exact events for which CSMs will have to be\nreported to the Commission. These may include the following: confirmation of\nbooking, arrival at a loading or unloading facility, departure from a loading\nor unloading facility, loading on or unloading from a conveyance, instruction\nof stuffing or stripping, confirmation of stuffing or stripping, intra-terminal\nmovements, terminal gate inspection and sending for heavy repair.\nAs far as the frequency of reporting is\nconcerned, each carrier may choose either: \n(a)         \nto submit, on a daily basis, all new CSMs\ngenerated or collected in the carrier\u2019s electronic equipment tracking system within\nthe previous 24 hours, regardless of whether the CSMs concern containers which are\ndestined to be brought in/taken out of the customs territory of the Union or\nnot (\u2018data dump\u2019); or\n(b)         \nto submit, on a daily basis, CSMs specifically related\nto containers (whether laden or not) destined to be brought into/taken out of\nthe customs territory of the Union, generated or collected in the carrier\u2019s\nelectronic equipment tracking system within the previous 24 hours.\nThe minimum data elements of the CSM\nmessaging will also be determined by means of delegated acts. The message\nformats and methods of transmission of the CSMs will be determined by means of\nimplementing acts. \n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data related to import, export\nand transit \u2013 new Article 18g\nWith a view to achieving more targeted\ncontrols and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against customs fraud,\nit is proposed to introduce a legal basis for the processing of import and\nexport data. \nWith regard to data related to transit, an\nadministrative arrangement on the Anti-Fraud Transit Information System was put\nin place in 2011 between the Commission and the Member States[5]. Under this arrangement OLAF\nautomatically receives the information on the movement of goods placed in transit.\nOLAF analyses these data and provides reports that are regularly shared with\nthe Member States and the interested Commission services. However, while acknowledging\nthe Commission\u2019s efforts, several Member States feel that the Commission should\ndefine a clear legal basis for this activity replacing the present arrangement.\nThe proposal introduces the appropriate legal basis. This does not put any\nadditional reporting burden on the Member States, as the electronic data are already\ncirculated and exchanged among Member States in an electronic system operated\nby the Commission. The proposal involves replicating the data from the systems\noperated by the Commission and analysing these data in order to trace\nfraudulent cases and build patterns useful for identifying potential instances\nof customs fraud and protecting the financial interests of the European Union.\nThe proposed database will be available for use by the Commission and the customs\nadministrations of the Member States. The Commission is the responsible data\ncontroller for this directory.\nArticle 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC)\nNo 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code requires that customs\ncontrols (other than spot checks) be based on risk analysis using automated data processing techniques, and provides for the\nestablishment of a common risk management framework in that context. Article\n4(25) defines the risks concerned, and Article 4(26) provides for risk\nmanagement activities to include \u2018collecting data and information, analysing\nand assessing risk, prescribing and taking action and regular monitoring and\nreview of the process and its outcomes, based on international, Community and\nnational sources and strategies.\u2019 It is appropriate\ntherefore to ensure that the data collected can be used in risk management for\nall customs risks and to provide for their availability to the relevant\nauthorities at EU and Member State level for this purpose in appropriate\ncircumstances.\n3.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supporting documents \u2013 new\nArticle 18h\nIn cases where OLAF requires customs-related\nsupporting documents for the purposes of its investigations, it cannot request\nthem directly from the economic operators but needs the intermediation of\nnational authorities. This leads to delays in investigations and, frequently,\nto failure of investigations due to time barring. This is particularly\nproblematic in customs-related cases where the limitation period of three years\napplies. The situation has worsened since 1 January 2011 with the introduction\nof e-Customs, as the documents supporting import and export declarations (invoice,\ncertificate of origin, etc.) are no longer kept by the customs administrations\nbut by the economic operators. \nWith a view to accelerating investigation\nprocedures, a new provision is proposed to empower the Commission to obtain\ndirectly from private sector companies, the documents supporting import and\nexport declarations, for purposes of the investigations based on Regulation (EC)\nNo 515/97. \n3.4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restricted visibility and\npublication of the authorities \u2013 Articles 29 and 30\nIt is expected that introduction of the\npossibility to select the potential users of data (restricted visibility) would\nsignificantly increase the use of databases by Member States and consequently\ncontribute to efficiency. Therefore, it is proposed to amend Article 29 accordingly.\nThe proposed amendment also includes a more flexible way of publishing the updates\nof the lists of the relevant authorities mentioned in Articles 29 and 30.\n3.4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data protection \u2013 Articles 18b,\n33, 37 and 38\nThe complex structure of the supervision of\ndata protection rules results from the dual legal structure of the customs\ninformation system: Regulation (EC) No 515/97, Article 37(3)(a); and Council\nDecision 2009/917/JHA, Article 25(2) which reflect the pre-Lisbon structure.\nHence, two separate bodies have been established: CJSA and EDPS ensure that\ndata protection rules are implemented according to the legislation. However, as\nrecommendations are applicable to both parts of the IT system, it is clearly\ndifficult to implement different opinions and recommendations. This creates\nredundancies in the use of resources. \nTo address this problem, the proposal\nintroduces a provision which aims at simplifying and harmonising the rules for\nthe supervision of data protection rules applicable to each of the systems. The\nobjective is to ensure coherence during the supervision process and encourage\nthe use of common audits, leading to joint reports.\nIn addition, the proposal clarifies that\nthe EDPS is responsible for data protection supervision of the technical\nsystems established by the Commission on the basis of this Regulation.\nThe proposal also introduces a maximum\nretention period of ten years for data stored in the CIS, stipulating additionally\nthat in cases where personal data are stored for a period exceeding five years,\nthe EDPS should be informed accordingly.\nFinally, in order to safeguard the rules\ngoverning data protection, a specific provision is introduced in Article 38 on\nthe security of processing.\n3.4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the Lisbon\nTreaty \u2013 Article 23(4), Article 25(1), Article 33, Article 38, Article 43 and\nArticle 43a\nIn order to ensure increased consistency of\nRegulation (EC) No 515/97 with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, the proposed amendment takes account of the necessary adjustments as\nregards granting the Commission delegated powers (Article 290 TFEU) or implementing\npowers (Article 291 TFEU).\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Entry into force\nThe proposed Article 18c(1) introduces an\nobligation for public or private sector operators active in the international\nchain to send to the Commission data on container movements. Given that this\nprovision may conflict with contractual obligations between companies and their\nclients relating to non-disclosure and confidentiality, the Article concerning\nentry into force provides for an appropriate transitional period, during which\ncarriers should renegotiate their private law contracts in order to comply with\nthe amended Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe budgetary effort concerns mainly the IT\ncosts to maintain and further develop the existing AFIS system. The costs\nrelated to the implementation of this proposal will be handled within the\nframework of the existing forecast in the context of Multiannual Financial\nFramework and therefore no additional request for budgetary allocation is\nrequired. The overall costs of the proposal are comparable to those of the\nprevious period and are considered as a mere continuation of recurrent costs.\nThe budgetary development related to this proposal is in line with the\nMultiannual Financial Framework.\n2013/0410 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13\nMarch 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the\nMember States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure\nthe correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33 and 325 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nAfter having consulted the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nAfter having consulted the Court of\nAuditors,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that Regulation\n(EC) No 515/97 covers all possible movements of goods in relation to the\ncustoms territory of the Union, it is appropriate to clarify the definition of\ncustoms legislation with regard to the concepts of entry and exit of goods.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to further\nenhancing administrative and criminal procedures for dealing with irregularities,\nit is necessary to ensure that evidence obtained through mutual assistance can\nbe considered as admissible in proceedings before the administrative and\njudicial authorities of the Member State of the applicant authority.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission Communication\non Customs Risk Management and Supply Chain Security COM(2012) 793 recognises\nan urgent need to improve the quality and availability of data for use in\npre-arrival risk analysis, in particular for the effective identification and\nmitigation of safety and security risks at national and EU levels, within the\nCommon Risk Management Framework established under Article 13(2) of Council\nRegulation (EEC) No 2913/92. The integration of data on container movements in\npre-arrival risk management will greatly improve supply chain visibility and\nwill significantly enhance the capacity of the EU and the Member States to\ntarget higher-risk consignments for controls, while facilitating the flow of\nlegitimate trade.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to increasing clarity,\nconsistency and transparency, it is necessary to define in more concrete terms\nthe authorities which should have access to the directories established on the\nbasis of this Regulation; for that purpose a uniform reference to competent\nauthorities will be established.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data concerning container\nmovements make it possible to identify fraud and risk trends with regard to\ngoods that are moved in and out of the customs territory of the Union. Such\ndata serve to assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting operations\nwhich are or appear to constitute breaches of customs\nlegislation, and to assist the competent authorities in\nmanaging customs risks defined in Article 4 point 25 of Regulation (EEC) No\n2913/92. In order to collect\nand use a set of data as complete as possible, while avoiding potential\nnegative impacts on small and medium sized enterprises in freight forwarding\nsector, it is necessary that public or private sector providers active in the\ninternational supply chain submit to the Commission data concerning container\nmovements in so far as they collect such data in electronic formats via their\nequipment tracking systems or have access to such data.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detection of fraud,\nidentification of risk trends and the implementation of effective risk\nmanagement procedures depend significantly on the identification and\ncross-analysis of relevant operational data sets. It is necessary therefore to establish,\nat European Union level, a directory containing data on import, export and transit\nof goods including transit of goods within the Member States and direct export.\nFor that purpose, Member States should allow systematic replication of data on\nimport, export and transit of goods from the systems operated by the Commission\nand should supply to the Commission data relating to transit of goods within a Member\nState and direct export.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the implementation of Article\n18b, the Commission has created a number of technical systems enabling the\nprovision of technical assistance, training or communication activity and other\noperational activity to the Member States. These technical systems need to be\nexplicitly referred to in this Regulation and covered by data protection\nrequirements.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction of the\ne-Customs in 2011, by which documents supporting imports and exports are no\nlonger kept by the customs administrations but by the economic operators, has\nled to delays in the conduct of European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF)\ninvestigations in the customs area, as OLAF needs the intermediation of these\nadministrations to obtain such documents. Moreover, the 3-year limitation\nperiod applicable to customs documents held by the administration, puts\nadditional constraints to the successful conduct of investigations. In order to\naccelerate the conduct of investigations in the area of customs the Commission\nshould therefore have the right to request documents supporting import and\nexport declarations directly from the economic operators concerned. These\neconomic operators should be obliged to provide the Commission with the\nrequested documents.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nconfidentiality of the inserted data, provision should be made for limiting\naccess to inserted data to specific users only.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure up-to-date\ninformation and to secure transparency and information right of data subjects\nas enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Directive 95/46/EC, the\npossibility of publishing on the internet updates of the lists of competent\nauthorities designated by the Member States and the Commission departments to\nhave access to the Customs Information System (CIS) should be introduced.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 45/2001\non the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data\nby the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data applies\nto the processing of personal data by Union institutions, bodies, offices and\nagencies.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to improve\nconsistency of data protection supervision, the European Data Protection\nSupervisor needs to cooperate closely with the Joint Supervisory Authority\nestablished under Council Decision 2009/917 JHA, with a view to achieving coordination\nof the audits of the CIS.\u00a0 \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions governing\nthe storage of data in the CIS frequently result in unjustifiable loss of\ninformation; this is because Member States do not systematically carry out the\nyearly reviews due to the administrative burden involved. It is therefore\nnecessary to simplify the procedure governing the storage of data in the CIS by\nremoving the obligation to review data annually and by setting maximum retention\nperiod of ten years, corresponding to periods provided for the directories\nestablished on the basis of this Regulation. This period is necessary due to\nthe long procedures for processing irregularities and because these data are needed\nfor the conduct of joint customs operations and of investigations. Furthermore,\nto safeguard the rules governing data protection, the European Data Protection Supervisor\nshould be informed about cases where personal data are stored in CIS for a\nperiod exceeding five years.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to further enhance\nthe possibilities for analysis of fraud and facilitate the conduct of\ninvestigations, data concerning current investigation files stored in the Files\nIdentification Database (FIDE) should be rendered anonymous, after one year\nsince the last observation, and retained in a form in which identification of\nthe data subject is no longer possible.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of enhancing\ncustoms risk management as defined in Article 4 points 25 and 26, and Article\n13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 laying down the Community Customs Code,\nand of improving detection, investigation and prevention of customs-related\nfraud in the Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States themselves,\nthe Union may act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\nin Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go\nbeyond what is necessary to achieve the stated objectives.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public or private service providers\nactive in the international supply chain who, at the time of the entry into\nforce of this Regulation, are bound by private contract obligations as regards the\nsupply of data on container movements, should be entitled to benefit from a\ndeferred application of Article 18c in order to renegotiate their contracts and\nensure that future contracts are compatible with the obligation to provide data\nto the Commission.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 515/97\nconfers powers on the Commission to implement some of the provisions of that\nRegulation; as a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the\npowers conferred on the Commission under this Regulation need to be aligned to\nArticles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement\ncertain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 and in particular\nto create a streamlined and structured directory of CSMs, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission\nin respect of the events for which CSMs should be reported, the minimum data elements\nto be reported in CSMs and the frequency of reporting. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement\ncertain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 and in particular\nto specify the information to be inserted into the CIS, the power to adopt acts\nin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of determining the operations concerning the application\nof agricultural legislation for which information has to be introduced into the\ncentral database of the CIS. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission in respect of the format of the data and method of\ntransmission of CSMs. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms\nfor control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing\npowers[6].\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission in respect of the specific elements to be included\nin the CIS under each of the categories referred to under items (a) to (h) in\nArticle 24. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU)\nNo 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanism for control\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[7]. The examination procedure\nshould be used for the adoption of implementing acts.

assistance between the\nadministrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the\nlatter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on\ncustoms and agricultural

\n\u00a8 The\nproposal/initiative relates to an action redirected towards a new action \nObjectives\nThe Commission's multiannual strategic\nobjective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \nThe\nproposed amendment will contribute to the Union\u2019s commitment to fighting fraud\nand other illegal activities in the area of customs and to strengthening the\nprotection of the financial interests of the European Union. \nSpecific objective(s) and ABM/ABB\nactivity(ies) concerned \nSpecific\nobjective No 5: prevent, deter and combat fraud and\ncorruption\nSpecific\nobjective 5a. Develop anti-fraud policy and legislation\nABM/ABB\nactivity concerned\n24 04\nAnti-fraud information system (AFIS)\nExpected result(s) and impact\nSpecify the\neffects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups\ntargeted.\nOn the Commission:\nthe proposed amendments will allow the Commission to improve risk management\nincluding risk-based customs controls and to make detection, investigation and\nanalysis of customs fraud more effective. It is also expected that this\nproposal will contribute to greater efficiency in the area of data protection\nand will further enhance the cooperation by optimising systems and processes\nthat should lead to better use of the existing tools.\nOn Member\nStates: the proposed amendments will further facilitate customs cooperation\nbetween individual Member States and between Member States and the Commission.\nIn the long\nterm, the revised Regulation presents an opportunity to significantly increase\nthe number of detected fraud cases and other irregularities in relation to customs\nmatters, thereby helping to protect the financial interests of the European\nUnion and to guard against other risks as defined in the Community Customs\nCode.\nIndicators of results and impact \nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nExport/import/transit\ndata/CSMs: \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 number\nof detected breaches of legislation\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 number\nof investigations opened based on these data\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 number\nof requests for use of data by investigators\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 amounts\nrecovered on the basis of such information\nDuration of\nrelated OLAF investigations \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether\nthe change resulted in faster procedures \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether\nit increased the number of investigations and the amounts recovered\nGrounds for the proposal/initiative \nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or\nlong term \nThe\nobjectives that are to be met in a short and long term include:\n- creating\nconditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misdeclaration of\ngoods origin \n- creating\nconditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misdescription of\ngoods \n- creating\nconditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misuse of the\ntransit system \n- speeding-up\nOLAF investigations.\nAdded value of EU involvement\nNational\ncustoms authorities alone cannot effectively share information and conduct a large-scale\nfight against breach of customs legislation at reasonable cost. Systematic collection of the data required to analyse customs risks\nwhich pose a threat to the EU and its Member States would constitute a\ndisproportionate effort for 28 individual Member States and can be achieved\nmore effectively and efficiently by action at EU level.\nThe need\nfor more efficient customs risk management, particularly in relation to safety\nand security risks, is recognised in the Commission Communication on Customs\nRisk Management and Supply Chain Security (COM (2012) 793).\nLessons learned from similar experiences in\nthe past\nThe \u2018ConTraffic\u2019\npilot project developed by OLAF in collaboration with the Commission's Joint\nResearch Centre demonstrates that by analysing container movements, it is\npossible to effectively identify inconsistencies between the origin declared by\nthe importer and the geographical origin/dispatch country derived from the\ncontainer routing data. Preliminary results have demonstrated that more than\n50% of the cases identified using such indicators do indeed involve breach of\ncustoms legislation. This pilot project illustrates perfectly the added value\nof the data that are currently not available to the Commission.\nATIS, which\nis a joint project by OLAF and Member States, illustrates the importance of\ninformation on transit for detecting customs-related fraud. It is used for the\nanalysis of transit-related data in order to detect abnormal patterns in a transit\nmovement and diversion of destination. \nCoherence and possible synergy with other\nrelevant instruments\nEnhanced\nsynergy with Regulation (EU) No 883/2013 is expected, in particular, as regards\naccess to supporting documents. Under the current regulatory set-up, if an investigation\nis based on either Regulation (EU) No 883/2013 or Regulation (EC) No 2185/96, economic\noperators are obliged to provide the Commission with the supporting documents.\nHowever, in cases where the investigation is premised on Regulation (EC) No 515/97\nthe Commission is required to request the supporting documents from the\nnational authorities. The proposal aims to remove those inconsistencies in\norder to ensure a unified approach.\nProvision\nfor use of the new data collections in risk management will significantly\nsupport the agenda proposed in the Commission Communication on Customs Risk\nManagement and Supply Chain Security and the Council Conclusions (8761/3/13) on\nthe same subject.\nDuration and financial impact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to\n[DD/MM]YYYY \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nn Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\nImplementation with a start-up period from\nYYYY to YYYY,\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\nManagement mode(s) envisaged[11] \nn Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[12] \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service\nmission \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific\nactions pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in\nthe relevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial\nRegulation \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \nMonitoring and reporting rules \nSpecify\nfrequency and conditions.\nStarting\nfrom the date of this Regulation's entry into force, the Commission will report\nevery three years on the Regulation's application to the European Parliament,\nthe Court of Auditors and the Council.\nManagement and control system \nRisk(s) identified \n- Expenses\ninvoiced without contract:\nAs contracts\nare awarded after having completed a procurement process, this risk is narrowed\nsince a large part of the expenditure will be legally and financially covered\nby a framework contract. \nIn line\nwith the Commission requirements, a risk assessment exercise will be performed\neach year.\n- Implementation\nof the transfer of data may turn out to be technically challenging.\nControl method(s) envisaged \nThe control\nprocedures of this initiative are in compliance with the Financial Regulation.\nEx-ante\nverifications on commitments & payments\nOLAF has\nchosen a financial management plan which is a partially decentralised model,\nfor which all of the ex-ante verification is done in the central Budget Unit.\nIn OLAF, all files are verified by at least three agents (the file manager and\nfinancial verifying agent in the budget unit and the operational verifying\nagent in the unit responsible for the expenditure) before they are accepted by\nthe Authorising Officer by sub-delegation.\nEvery head\nof unit has been granted a sub-delegation from the Director-General and consequently\nevery head of unit is responsible for the implementation of his part of the\nprogramme.\n- Ex-ante\ncontrols are carried out by the FVA on every transaction which requires\napproval of the AOSD. \n- Controls\nare done on the sensitive variables following the results of the risk\nassessment carried out in the context of the Accounting Quality Report (such\nas: LE and BA, G/L accounts, budget lines, amounts and calculations, etc).\n- Detailed\nterms of reference are drafted and form the basis of the specific contract.\nAnti-fraud measures are provided for in all contracts concluded between OLAF\nand the external party.\n-OLAF\nperforms controls of all deliverables and supervises all operations and\nservices carried out by our frame work contractor.\nMeasures to prevent fraud and\nirregularities \nSpecify\nexisting or envisaged prevention and protection measures.\nAudits may\nbe carried out during the contract and for a period of five years following the\nlast payment in order to lead, where appropriate, to recovery decisions by the\nCommission. The rights of access of Commission staff as well as outside authorised\npersonnel are defined and the Court of Auditors and OLAF will enjoy the same\nrights.\nThe\ncontrols established enable OLAF to have sufficient assurance of the quality\nand regularity of the expenditure and reduce the risk of non-compliance. The depth\nassessment reaches level four for all contracts and agreements signed. The\nabove-mentioned controls reduce the potential risks virtually to zero and reach\n100 % of the beneficiaries.\nOn-the-spot\nchecks could be considered.\nThe\nprogramme control strategy is deemed efficient to limit the risk of\nnon-compliance and is proportionate with the risk entailed. \nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \nHeading(s) of the multiannual financial\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \nExisting expenditure budget lines \nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
