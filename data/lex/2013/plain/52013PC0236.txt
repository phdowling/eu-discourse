It is one of the core values of the European Union and a fundamental\nelement of EU citizenship. Article 45 TFEU enshrines the right of EU citizens\nto move to another Member State for work purposes. It specifically includes the\nright not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality as regards\naccess to employment, remuneration and other conditions of work. It also includes\nthe removal of unjustified obstacles to the freedom of\nmovement of workers within the European Union. The Charter of Fundamental\nRights of the European Union confirms in Article 15(2) that every citizen of\nthe Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of\nestablishment and to provide services in any Member State.\nRegulation (EU) No\n492/2011[1] details the rights derived from the freedom of movement of workers,\nand defines the specific areas where discrimination on the grounds of\nnationality is prohibited, in particular as regards[2]:\n\u2013              \naccess to employment\n\u2013              \nworking conditions\n\u2013              \nsocial and tax advantages \n\u2013              \naccess to training\n\u2013              \nmembership of trade unions \n\u2013              \nhousing\n\u2013              \naccess to education for children \nArticle 45 TFEU\nand Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 are directly applicable in all Member States.\nThis means that there is no need to adopt national legislation to transpose\nthose provisions. Any national authority at any level and any employer, whether\npublic or private, must apply and respect the rights stemming from those\nprovisions. \nIn spite of this, EU\ncitizens who want to move or who actually move from one Member State to another\nfor work purposes continue to face problems in exercising their rights. The\ndifficulties they face go some way to explaining why geographical mobility\nbetween EU Member States has remained at a relatively low level: according to\nthe EU-Labour Force Survey, in 2011, only 3.1% of the working-age European\ncitizens (15-64) lived in an EU Member State other than their own[3]. \nA Eurobarometer survey\nin 2009 showed that while 60% of European citizens considered free movement of\nworkers to be a good thing for European integration, only 48% thought it was positive\nfor individuals. Moreover, according to the results of a more recent\nEurobarometer (September 2011)[4], 15% of European citizens would not consider working in another\nMember State because they feel there are too many obstacles. \nSimilarly, the\nEuropean Parliament's report on 'Problems and prospects concerning European\ncitizenship' of 20 March 2009 detailed persisting obstacles to the cross-border\nenjoyment of rights. It called on the Commission to produce a list of obstacles\nto the exercise of EU citizens' rights, based on the results of a public consultation, and make specific proposals\nto address those obstacles. \nMore recently the\nEuropean Parliament by its Resolution on promoting workers' mobility\nwithin the European Union of 25 October 2011 calls on the Commission and Member\nStates to take measures in order to \"to guarantee\u2026the correct\nimplementation of the existing legislation on non-discrimination, to take\npractical measures to enforce the principle of equal treatment of mobile\nworkers\u2026\"[5]\nIn\nits Conclusions of EPSCO Council of March 2009 on Professional and geographical\nmobility of the workforce and the free movement of workers within the European\nUnion, the Council invited the Commission and the Member States 'to promote\nmeasures supporting labour and social mobility as well as the equal treatment\nand non-discrimination of migrant workers in line with the acquis' and to 'further\ndevelop appropriate strategies and tools for the identification and analysis of\nbarriers to geographical and professional worker mobility and to effectively\ncontribute to the removal of existing barriers, in accordance with the Treaties'.\nThe report delivered by Mr Monti on 9 May\n2010 (\u2018A new Strategy for the Single Market\u2019) underlines the fact that the overall\nfreedom of movement of workers is a success from a legal point of view, but it\nis the least used of the four freedoms of the Single Market. The report points\nout that the majority of Europeans see too many obstacles to working elsewhere\nin the EU and a number of legal and administrative barriers still remain in the\nfield of free movement of workers. According to the report, obstacles in this\narea are the hardest to overcome. \nIn July 2010, in its Communication on\n\"Reaffirming the free movement of workers: rights\nand major developments\"[6]\nthe Commission pointed out that it will explore ways of tackling the new needs\nand challenges (in particular in the light of new patterns of mobility) facing\nEU migrant workers and their family members, and in the context of the new\nstrategy for the single market will consider how to promote and enhance\nmechanisms for the effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment\nfor EU workers and members of their families exercising their right to free\nmovement.\nThis objective was reinforced in the 2010\nEU Citizenship Report \"Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens\nrights\"[7]\nof 27 October 2010. The Commission identified the divergent and incorrect\napplication of EU law on the right to free movement as one of the main\nobstacles that EU citizens are confronted with in the effective exercise of\ntheir rights under EU law. Accordingly, the Commission announced its intention\nto take action to 'facilitate free movement of EU citizens and their\nthird-country national family members by enforcing EU rules strictly, including\non non-discrimination, by promoting good practices and increased knowledge or\nEU rules on the ground and by stepping up the dissemination of information to\nEU citizens about their free movement rights'[8].\n\nIn its Employment package of 18 April 2012\n(Communication from the Commission \"Towards a job-rich recovery\")[9], the Commission announced its\nintention to \"present a legislative proposal (information and advice) in\norder to support mobile workers in the exercise of rights derived from the\nTreaty and Regulation 492/2011 on freedom of movement for workers within the\nUnion\".\nPresident Barroso (Political guidelines for\nthe 2010-2014 Commission) has also underlined the gap between theory and\npractice and has called for the principle of free movement and equal treatment\nto become a reality in peoples\u2019 everyday lives. In his State of the Union address\non 12 September 2012, President Barroso underlined the need to create a\nEuropean labour market, and make it as easy for people to work in another\ncountry as it is at home[10].\nThe gap between the rights that EU citizens have in theory and what\nhappens in practice has also been underlined in several reports from\ninstitutions and, increasingly, the European Union is being called upon to act\nin this regard[11].\n2013 has been designated as the European Year of Citizens[12]. It will focus on citizens'\nrights and on EU action ensuring that these rights are effectively enforced for\nthe benefit of citizens and the EU as a whole.\nOver the\nyears, the Commission has received a lot of complaints from citizens who want\nto move, or who have actually moved to another EU country for work purposes,\nand whose rights are not respected. Citizens feel unprotected in the host\nMember State and unable to overcome the obstacles they face. \nThe Problem\nThere are many\ndifferent examples of obstacles and problems: \n(a) Public\nauthorities not complying with EU law (non-conforming legislation or incorrect application) and the effect on EU migrant workers\nProblems with compliance of\nnational legislation and general practices still persist in Member States and\ncontinue to be reported to the Commission. These include:\n\u2013              \ndifferent conditions applied for recruitment of\nEU nationals;\n\u2013              \nnationality conditions for access to posts which\nare not covered by the exception in Article 45(4) TFEU;\n\u2013              \nintroduction of nationality quotas for EU\ncitizens (e.g. in the field of sport at professional level);\n\u2013              \ndifferent working conditions for EU nationals (remuneration,\ncareer prospects, grade, etc.); \n\u2013              \naccess to social advantages made subject to\nconditions which are more easily met by nationals than by EU citizens (e.g. a\nresidence condition);\n\u2013              \nprofessional qualifications and experience acquired\nin other Member States are not taken into account or they are taken into\naccount in a different way than those obtained in the host Member State for the\npurpose of access to employment (e.g. additional points are awarded to the\nlatter);\n\u2013              \nresidence condition required by national\nlegislations for access to study grants for EU migrant workers and members of\ntheir families despite well-established case law of the CJ in this area; \n\u2013              \ndiscrimination against frontier workers.\n(b) Employers\nand legal advisors not complying with EU law \nInformation\ncollected by experts and by the Commission[13]\nsuggests that there is a recurrent problem with public and private employers' awareness\nof EU rules, regardless of whether the legislation at national level is\ncompliant or not. Being unaware of the rules and lack of understanding seem to\nbe the main reasons for this problem, especially when it comes to private\nemployers (e.g. only residents for a certain period can apply for a job\nvacancy, no recognition of previous professional experience or professional\nqualifications acquired in another Member State, excessive language requirements\netc.).\nLegal advisors are also\nnot always aware or familiar with Union law on free movement of workers.\n(c) EU migrant workers not having access to\ninformation or the means to ensure their rights\nIn several surveys[14], citizens have mentioned that\nthey do not know where to turn to when faced with problems concerning their EU\nrights. There is also evidence that migrants find it difficult to access the protection\navailable to them, for example, they are not aware of national procedures and systems,\nthey lack the linguistic ability to access services or the\ncost of legal advice and assistance is too high. \nThe problems\nidentified affect EU citizens who move to another Member State for employment\npurposes and come back to their Member State of origin in order to work. \nObjectives\nIn order to tackle\nthese problems specific objectives have been identified:\n\u2013                        \nlessening discrimination against EU migrant workers\non the grounds of nationality;\n\u2013                        \nclosing the gap between EU migrant workers'\nrights on paper and their exercise in practice by facilitating the correct\nimplementation of existing legislation; \n\u2013                        \nreducing the incidence of unfair practices\nagainst EU migrant workers; \n\u2013                        \nand empowering EU migrant workers to ensure their\nrights are respected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATION WITH INTERESTED\nPARTIES AND OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation with\ninterested parties\n(a) Network of experts on free movement\nof workers\nThe\nnetwork of legal experts in the field of free movement of workers reports annually\non the legal situation pertaining in the European Union[15]. \nThe first report[16], finalised in January 2011, focused on the enforceability of the right\nto equal treatment on the basis of nationality as regards EU migrant workers and\non the existing legal framework in each Member State. The report came to the\nconclusion that this right is rarely given the same level of protection and\nguarantees as the right to equal treatment on other grounds (such as race, age\nand sex). EU migrant workers are still perceived in most of the EU countries as\nholding a status closer to that of third-country national workers than to that\nof national workers. Many EU migrant workers facing discrimination based on\ntheir nationality have to rely on a generous interpretation of national law adopted\nto implement the EU equality Directives combating discrimination on other\ngrounds. \nThe second report, submitted in October\n2011, presented an overview of the main problems surrounding application of the\nrules on free movement of workers identified in each Member State. There are\nsome problems, apparently of a systemic nature in some Member States, which\nsimply constitute unlawful discrimination. Most of the problems stem from indirect\ndiscrimination or unjustified restrictions on the exercise of workers' right to\nfree movement. For example, residence criteria governing eligibility for certain\nsocial and tax advantages, excessive language requirements, or Member States failing\nto take into account years worked in a similar post in other EU Member States\nfor the purpose of calculating a public-sector employee\u2019s seniority and\nassociated advantages.\n(b) Discussion within the Advisory Committee on free movement of\nworkers \nBarriers to free movement of workers, problems of discrimination on\nthe grounds of nationality and the need to better enforce the current EU rules\nwere discussed at a series of meetings of the Advisory Committee on Free Movement\nof Workers between October 2010 and October 2012. The members of the Advisory\ncommittee, made up of representatives of Member States and Social Partners\nrepresented at European and national level, were also asked to reply to a\nquestionnaire issued by the Commission. The questionnaire was designed to\nidentify what action is being taken at national level to inform, assist,\nsupport and protect EU workers in relation to the implementation of Regulation (EU)\nNo 492/2011.\nThe members of\nthe Committee acknowledged the importance of the real and effective application\nof existing rights. Suggested responses to this need ranged from awareness raising\nactivities to stronger enforcement of the rules and better access to\ninformation and support for EU migrant workers. During the meeting of the\nAdvisory Committee on free movement of workers of 30th October 2012,\nSocial partners, both ETUC and Business Europe,\nexpressed broadly favourable positions to the proposal of a Directive. \n(c) Public consultation\nThe Commission carried out a public consultation between June and August\n2011. Citizens, national authorities, labour unions, employers\u2019 organisations,\nand associations (NGOs, associations of independent professionals, etc.) gave\ntheir views on the main problems workers face when exercising their right to free\nmovement, on the current level of workers' protection and on the need for the\nEU to act in order to help workers fully enjoy their rights. \nA total of 243 replies were received, of which 169 were from\ncitizens and 74 were from organisations, including national authorities. Among the\nresponses from organisations, trade unions were the most active in providing\ncontributions (27% of the respondents), followed by NGOs (17%), national\nauthorities (15%) and employers' organisations (12%).\nThe majority of respondents agreed that EU workers should be better\nprotected against discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Adoption of EU\nlegislation was the most important course of action suggested by trade unions,\nNGOs, private companies, regional and local authorities and citizens. National\nauthorities were divided. Employers clearly indicated that awareness-raising is\nvery important. Setting up contact points or structures in the Member States\nwas seen as an important measure by the majority of respondents. Exchanges of\npractice between EU countries was also considered an important tool, while\nnon-profit organisations, trade unions, private companies and regional\nauthorities[17]saw\nsupporting organisations as important.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nIn line with its policy on better regulation, the Commission\nconducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, based on an external\nstudy[18],\nwhich concluded in April 2012.[19] \nThe different policy alternatives contain a range of options\nrepresenting different degrees of EU intervention: maintaining the status quo,\neffecting change without regulation, or regulating. With respect to the latter,\nthe options provide differentiated scenarios ranging from soft intervention (non-binding\nlegal instrument such as a Recommendation) to maximum intervention in the form\nof a binding legal instrument such as a Directive.\nAll these options were analysed against the general objectives. \nThe Impact Assessment demonstrated that a binding legislative\ninitiative would impact tangibly on the exercise of free movement rights. A binding\nlegal instrument imposing obligations on Member States to adopt appropriate\nmeasures to ensure that there are effective mechanisms for the dissemination of\ninformation and advice to citizens is an effective and efficient way of achieving\nthe stated objectives.\nThe preferred option is a Directive combined\nwith other initiatives, such as common guidelines on specific subjects to be\nadopted by the Technical Committee[20]\non free movement of workers. A Common Guidance document would address the specific\nissue of the application of EU law in the field of the free movement of workers.\n\nA Directive introducing measures intended to\nsupport EU migrant workers confronted with problems of free movement would aim\nto raise national authorities' awareness of the issue and increase their action\nagainst discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Through increased visibility\nof the issue, citizens would become more informed about their rights and public\nand private sector employers and other stakeholders' (NGOs, Social Partners\u2026)\nwould also become more aware. Moreover, without creating additional burdens on\nemployers, a Directive would significantly contribute to better understanding and\nenforcement of EU law by specifically requiring Member States to ensure that stakeholders\nare better informed. Additionally, by providing a specific means of redress\nagainst any breach of rights under Article 45 TFEU and allowing third parties\nto intervene on behalf of EU migrant workers, it will become easier for\ncitizens to exercise their rights and receive support in doing so. \nThe draft impact assessment was endorsed by\nthe Impact Assessment Board (\u2018IAB\u2019) in July 2012. The opinion of the IAB as\nwell as the final Impact Assessment and its executive summary are published together\nwith this proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context \u2014 summary\nof the proposed action\nThe present proposal for a Directive aims to improve and reinforce\nthe way in which Article 45 TFEU and Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 are applied in\npractice across the European Union by establishing a general common framework\nof appropriate provisions and measures for facilitating a better and more\nuniform application of rights conferred by EU law on workers and members of\ntheir families exercising their right to free movement. \nThe proposal for a Directive introduces, in particular, legal\nobligations in order to:\n- guarantee EU migrant workers an appropriate\nmeans of redress at national level. Any EU worker who believes that he/she has been\nthe victim of discrimination on the grounds of nationality should be able to\nmake use of appropriate administrative and/or judicial procedures to challenge\nthe discriminatory behaviour;\n- further protect workers by ensuring that\nassociations, organisations or other legal entities with a legitimate interest\nin the promotion of the rights to free movement of workers may engage in any\nadministrative or judicial procedure on behalf or in support of EU migrant workers\nwhere there has been a violation of their rights;\n- set up structures or bodies at a national\nlevel which will promote the exercise of the right to free movement by providing\ninformation and supporting and assisting EU migrant workers who suffer from\nnationality based -discrimination;\n- raise awareness by providing employers,\nworkers, and any other interested parties with easily accessible relevant\ninformation;\n- promote dialogue with appropriate\nnon-governmental organisations and the social partners.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThis proposal is based on Article 46 TFEU, the\nsame legal base as Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, which allows for the adoption\nof Regulations or Directives under the ordinary legislative procedure.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality principles\nThe problems identified with respect to the\napplication and enforcement of EU Law on the free movement of workers, and in\nparticular of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, are linked to the objectives set out\nin Article 3(3) TEU, under which the European Union established an internal\nmarket based on a highly competitive social market economy, aimed at full\nemployment and social progress, and in Articles 45 (freedom of movement and non-\ndiscrimination on the grounds of nationality for EU workers) and 18 TFEU (non-\ndiscrimination on the grounds of nationality for EU citizens).\nThe applicable EU rules need to be applied\nappropriately and effectively. Differences and disparities in the way Regulation\n(EU) No 492/2011 is applied and enforced in the different Member States are detrimental\nto the proper functioning of free movement as a fundamental freedom. There is\nevidence to suggest it is very difficult to create the required level playing\nfield for workers exercising their right to free movement throughout the EU. Under these circumstances, the necessary legal\nclarity and certainty can only be achieved at EU level.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by Member States and action at EU level is therefore\nrequired.\nIn line with the principle of\nproportionality, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve the objectives. In order to improve the application and enforcement\nof Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 in practice, it proposes preventive measures,\nsuch as the guarantee of appropriate means of redress and the provision of information\nsupport and advice in accordance with national traditions and practices. \nBearing in mind the nature of the proposed\nmeasures, it will give Members States the freedom to choose the implementing\nmeasures best suited to their national judicial systems\nand procedures.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER I GENERAL\nPROVISIONS\n3.4.1.1.\u00a0 Article 1 - Subject matter\nArticle 45 TFEU is a provision of EU law\nwhich is directly applicable in the national judicial order of Member States\nand which directly confers on European citizens the right to move to another Member\nState for work purposes and to accept offers of employment,\nto work there without needing a work permit, to reside there for that purpose\nand to stay there even after employment has finished. It also confers the right\nto enjoy equal treatment with nationals as regards access to employment,\nremuneration and other conditions of work and employment. Thus it implies the\nabolition of any discrimination (direct or indirect) based on nationality in\nthe exercise of these rights as well as of any unjustified obstacle which\nimpedes the exercise of the right to free movement[21].\nRegulation (EU) No 492/2011 is also a legal instrument which by its nature is directly\napplicable and Member States do not have to take implementing measures in order\nfor their citizens to be able to rely on the rights conferred by that\nRegulation.\nThe rights conferred by that Regulation\non individuals, which will be easier to enforce under the present proposal, are\nthose contained in Chapter I \u201cEmployment, Equal treatment and Workers\u2019 families,\nin Articles 1 to 10. They concern in particular access to employment (Section 1,\nEligibility to employment, Articles 1 to 6), equal treatment in relation to\nemployment and working conditions (Section 2, Employment and equality of\ntreatment, Articles 7 to 9) and the family members of the worker (Section 3, Workers\u2019\nfamilies, article 10).\nThe present proposal for a Directive does\nnot concern Chapter II of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, Clearance of\nvacancies and applications for employment (Articles 11 to 20), Chapter III,\nCommittees for ensuring close cooperation between the Member States in\nmatters concerning the freedom of movement of workers and their employment (Articles\n20 to 34) or Chapter IV, Final provisions (Articles 35 to 42).\n3.4.1.2.\u00a0 Article 2-Scope\nThe proposal does not modify the scope of\napplication of the Regulation (EU) No 492/2011. It only applies in cases of\ndiscrimination on the grounds of nationality in relation to the matters covered\nby that Regulation, by introducing the provisions of protection, information\nand support, in accordance with Articles 3 to 7 of the present proposal for a\nDirective. It underpins the guarantee of equal treatment and reinforces\nremedies in cases of\nunjustified obstacles in relation to eligibility and access to employment for\nworkers exercising their right to free movement within the European Union.\nIn this context the proposal for a\nDirective covers the following matters:\n- access to employment;\n-\nconditions of employment and work in particular as regards remuneration and\ndismissal\n-\naccess to social and tax advantages;\n-\nmembership of trade unions;\n-\naccess to training;\n-\naccess to housing;\n- access to\neducation for workers' children.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER II - ENFORCEMENT\n3.4.2.1.\u00a0 Article 3- Defence of rights\n- Means of redress - Time limits\nThis Article imposes a legal obligation on Member States to\nprovide EU migrant workers with appropriate means of redress at national level.\nIt also relates to the enforcement and defence of rights, which in itself\nconcerns a fundamental right. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion confirms the right to an effective remedy for everyone whose rights and\nfreedoms guaranteed by the law of the European Union are violated or not\nrespected. The proposal covers both judicial and extra-judicial means of\nredress, including alternative dispute settlement mechanisms such as conciliation\nand mediation. Ombudsmen and equality bodies or other similar structures may\nalso provide an alternative to the general courts. In accordance with Article\n47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union this Article\nprovides that, in case where Member States only provide for administrative\nprocedures, they shall ensure that any administrative decision may be\nchallenged before a tribunal.\nIn conformity with the case-law of the CJ[22], paragraph 2 of this Article\nspecifies that the previous paragraph is without prejudice to national rules\nrelating to time limits for bringing actions as regards the principle of equal\ntreatment, provided that these time limits are such\nthat they cannot be regarded as capable of rendering virtually impossible or\nexcessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Union law on free\nmovement of workers.\n3.4.2.2.\u00a0 Article 4 - Action of\nassociations, organisations or other legal entities\nThis Article introduces an obligation for Member States to ensure that\nassociations, organisations or legal entities (such as trade unions, NGOs or\nother organisations) may engage in any administrative or judicial procedure on\nbehalf or in support of EU migrant workers in the event of violations of their\nrights under either the Directive or under Regulation (EU) No 492/2011. It\nwould be left to Member States' discretion to define the way this provision\nshould be implemented in practice, according to the national judicial systems\nand procedures.\nAssociations,\norganisations or other legal entities can play a significant role in the\ndefence of rights on behalf of or in support of a worker and members of his/her\nfamily[23].\nThe assistance could be different from one Member State to another according to\ntheir judicial system, procedures, traditions and practices (e.g. the trade unions\ncould intervene, or bear the costs or assisting victims of discrimination).\nMirroring\nArticle 3 the second paragraph of Article 4 specifies that the first paragraph is without prejudice to national rules relating\nto time limits for bringing actions.\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER III - PROMOTION OF\nEQUAL TREATMENT - CONTACT POINTS, STRUCTURES OR BODIES - DIALOGUE \n3.4.3.1.\u00a0 Article 5 \u2013 Contact\npoints, structures or bodies.\nThis Article provides for structures on information, promotion and\nsupport or for bodies to be established at national level to support EU migrant\nworkers and promote, analyse and monitor the rights conferred on them and the\nmembers of their families by EU law. These functions may, however, also be\nexercised by existing bodies already established by Member States to fight\ndiscrimination on other grounds in the context of the implementation of EU\nlegislation, or agencies with responsibility at national level for the defence\nof human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights. In this case Member\nState must ensure allocation of sufficient resources to the existing body for\nthe performance of additional tasks. To this end the training of experts could\nbe eligible under the European Social Fund.\nThe tasks of these structures or bodies should include:\n(a)                   \nProviding information to all relevant\nstakeholders and increasing support for EU migrant workers; providing advice\nand assistance to alleged victims of discrimination pursuing their complaints,\nwithout prejudice to the rights of the legal entities referred to in Article 4.\nWhilst in some countries equality bodies established under EU Directives\nfighting discrimination on other grounds have legal standing and can bring a\ncase to court, in others, they can only provide assistance to the claimant, or\nprovide observations to the court.\n(b)                   \nConducting independent surveys concerning\ndiscrimination on the basis of nationality;\n(c)                   \nPublishing independent reports and making\nrecommendations in relation to equality of treatment and the fight against nationality\nbased discrimination.\n(d)                   \nPublishing information on any issue relating to\nthe application at national level of EU rules on free movement of workers.\nIt would be left to each Member State to decide whether creating a\ncompletely new structure is necessary, or whether existing bodies can be\nassigned the tasks described above for the promotion of\nnon-discrimination exist in all Member States. At\npresent 'nationality' could be covered by the competence of existing Equality\nbodies in 19 Member States[24].\n\nMoreover, this Article provides for synergies between existing or\nnew structures or bodies with other information, promotion and support tools at\nEU level, such as Your Europe, SOLVIT, EURES, Enterprise Europe Network and the\nPoints of Single Contact. \nBuilding on existing structures has the advantage of benefiting of\nthe existing knowledge and experience. It also increases simplicity and accessibility\nsince it avoids the risk of creating confusion and uncertainty as to where to\nturn in case of problems.\n3.4.3.2.\u00a0 Article 6 - Dialogue\nThis Article requires Member States, in accordance with national\ntraditions and practices, to take adequate measures to encourage and promote\ndialogue with social partners and non-governmental organisations which have, in\naccordance with their national law and practice, a legitimate interest in\ncontributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of nationality. \n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER IV - ACCESS TO\nINFORMATION\n3.4.4.1.\u00a0 Article 7 - Dissemination of\ninformation\nThis\nArticle provides for the appropriate dissemination of information about the rights\nof workers and members of their families in relation to equal treatment arising\nfrom the Directive and from Articles 1 to 10 of Regulations (EU) No 492/2011. The\nmore effective the system of public information and prevention is, the less\nneed there should be for individual remedies. The proposal for a Directive\nleaves the choice of information tools to the Member States, but on line or\ndigital information with links to the existing information tools at EU level,\nYour Europe and EURES websites should be made compulsory.\nHowever,\nthis can be complemented by any other public information activities reflecting the\nbest practices noted by the national experts and stakeholders such as\nawareness-raising campaigns or specific information. The active role of social\npartners, equality bodies, NGOs and other associations could also be very\nimportant in the dissemination of the information. \n3.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER V - FINAL\nPROVISIONS\n3.4.5.1.\u00a0 Article 8 - Minimum\nrequirements\nThe first\nparagraph is a standard 'non-regression' provision which specifies that Member\nStates may have, or may wish to adopt, legislation providing for a higher level\nof protection than that guaranteed by the proposed Directive. \nThe second paragraph expressly\nindicates that Member States have the discretion to extend the competencies of\nthe bodies referred to in Article 5 to encompass also non-discrimination on\ngrounds of nationality for all EU citizens and their family members exercising\ntheir right to free movement, as enshrined in Article 21 TFEU and Directive\n2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on\nthe right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside\nfreely within the territory of the Member States[25]. \nThe third\nparagraph provides that Member States should not lower any existing level of\nprotection against discrimination when implementing this Directive.\n3.4.5.2.\u00a0 Article 9 - Transposition\nMember States are\nrequired to adopt the necessary implementing measures within a period of 2\nyears after the entry into force of the Directive, and to fulfil certain information\nrequirements, such as communicating to the Commission how the Directive is\ntransposed into national law and making reference to the Directive in any\nimplementing measures.\nIn this context\nin accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of\nMember States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28 September 2011,\nit would be appropriate that Member States accompany the notification of their\ntransposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship\nbetween the components of the present Directive and the corresponding parts of\nnational transposition instruments. Bearing in mind that for some provisions of\nthis Directive, such as those on structures or bodies foreseen in Article 5\nseveral Member States dispose already legislation to fight discrimination on\nother grounds in the context of the implementation of EU legislation, or\nagencies with responsibility at national level for the defence of human rights\nor the safeguard of individuals' rights, the explanatory documents would permit\nto better identify the specific measures adopted or already in place in order\nto fight discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n3.4.5.3.\u00a0 Article 10 - Report\nThe Commission has to present a report to\nthe European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social\nCommittee on the implementation of this Directive no later than two years after\nthe expiry of the deadline for its transposition. It can also make appropriate\nproposals for further measures where necessary. Therefore, in the context of\nits implementation report and experience gained on the ground, the Commission will\nalso monitor the way Member States opted to extend the competencies of\nthe structures and bodies referred to in Article 5 to the right to equal\ntreatment without discrimination on grounds of nationality of all Union\ncitizens and their family members exercising their right to free movement under\nUnion law.\n3.4.5.4.\u00a0 Article 11 - Entry into\nforce\nThis is a standard\nclause specifying that this Directive will enter into force on\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\n3.4.5.5.\u00a0 Article 12 - Addresses\nThis is a standard provision specifying that the Directive is\naddressed to the Member States.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThis proposal is expected to have limited\nimplications on the Union budget. Expenses for an evaluation study in 2015 are\nestimated to not exceed 0,300 million EUR and will be covered by funds\navailable from the budget line financing the free movement of workers, coordination\nof social security systems and measures for migrants, including migrants from\nthird countries. Costs for human resources (0,131 million EUR p.a.) will be\ncovered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Details are\ngiven in the financial statement annexed to this proposal.\n2013/0124 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non measures facilitating the exercise of\nrights conferred on workers in the context of freedom of movement for workers \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, and in particular Article 46 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national\nParliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social\nCommittee[26],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[27],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of\nworkers is a fundamental freedom of EU citizens and one of the pillars of the\ninternal market in the Union enshrined in Article 45 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union. Its implementation is further developed by\nUnion law aimed at guaranteeing the full exercise of rights conferred on Union citizens\nand the members of their families. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of\nworkers is also a key element to the development of a genuine Union labour\nmarket, allowing workers to move from high unemployment areas to areas where\nthere are labour shortages, helping more people find posts better suited to\ntheir skills and overcoming bottlenecks in the labour market. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The free movement of\nworkers gives every citizen the right to move freely to another Member State to\nwork and reside there for that purpose. It protects them against discrimination\non the grounds of nationality as regards employment, remuneration and other\nworking conditions by ensuring their equal treatment in comparison to nationals\nof that Member State. It needs to be distinguished from the freedom to provide\nservices, which includes the right of undertakings to provide services in\nanother Member State, for which they may send (\u2018post\u2019) their own workers to\nanother Member State temporarily to carry out the work necessary to provide\nthese services there.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to workers\nand workers' families exercising their right to free movement, Article 45 of\nthe Treaty confers substantial rights for the exercise of this fundamental\nfreedom, specified in Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 5 April 2011 on freedom of movement for workers within\nthe Union[28].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the effective\nexercise of the freedom of movement of workers is still a major challenge and\nmany workers are very often unaware of their rights to free movement. They\nstill suffer from discrimination on the grounds of nationality when moving\nacross European Union borders of the Member States. There is, therefore, a gap\nbetween the legislation and its application in practice that needs to be\naddressed.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nJuly 2010, in its Communication on \"\nReaffirming the free movement of workers: rights and major developments\"[29] the Commission pointed\nout that it will explore ways of tackling the new needs and challenges\n(in particular in the light of new patterns of mobility) facing EU migrant\nworkers and their family members, and in the context of the new strategy for\nthe single market will consider how to promote and enhance mechanisms for the\neffective implementation of the principle of equal treatment for EU workers and\nmembers of their families exercising their right to free movement.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the 2010 EU Citizenship\nReport \"Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens rights\" of 27\nOctober 2010[30],\nthe Commission identified the divergent and incorrect application of Union law\non the right to free movement as one of the main obstacles that Union citizens\nare confronted with in the effective exercise of their rights under Union law.\nAccordingly, the Commission announced its intention to take action to \"facilitate\nfree movement of EU citizens and their third-country national family members by\nenforcing EU rules strictly, including on non-discrimination, by promoting good\npractices and increased knowledge or EU rules on the ground and by stepping up\nthe dissemination of information to EU citizens about their free movement\nrights\"(action 15 of the 2010 EU Citizenship Report). \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nits Employment package of 18 April 2012 (Communication from the Commission \"Towards\na job-rich recovery\")[31],\nthe Commission announced its intention to \"present a legislative proposal\n(information and advice) in order to support mobile workers in the exercise of\nrights derived from the Treaty and Regulation 492/2011 on freedom of movement\nfor workers within the Union\".\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adequate\nand effective application and enforcement are key elements in protecting the\nrights of workers, whereas poor enforcement undermines the effectiveness of the\nUnion rules applicable in this area. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A more effective and\nuniform application of rights conferred by Union rules on free movement of\nworkers is also necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application and\nmonitoring of the Union rules on free movement should be improved to ensure\nworkers are better informed about their rights, to assist and to protect them\nin the exercise of those rights, and to combat circumvention of these rules by\npublic authorities and public or private employers.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\ncorrect application of, and to monitor compliance with, the substantive rules\nconcerning workers' rights to free movement for work purposes, Member States\nshould take the appropriate measures to protect them against both discrimination\non grounds of nationality and any unjustified obstacle to the exercise of that\nright.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nthat end it is appropriate to provide specific rules for effective enforcement of the substantive rules governing the freedom\nof movement of workers, and to facilitate better and\nmore uniform application of Article 45 of the Treaty and of Regulation (EU) No\n492/2011.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis context, workers who have been subject to discrimination on the grounds of\nnationality, or to any unjustified restriction in exercising their right to\nfree movement, should have adequate and effective means of legal protection and\nredress. When Member States only provide for\nadministrative procedures they shall ensure that any administrative decision\nmay be challenged before a tribunal in the sense of Article 47 of the Charter.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\nprovide more effective levels of protection, associations and legal entities\nshould also be empowered to engage, as the Member States determine, on behalf\nof or in support of any victim in proceedings, without prejudice to national\nrules of procedure concerning representation and defense before the courts. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrelation to time limits foreseen in Articles 3(2) and 4(2) and in accordance\nwith the case law of the European Court of Justice[32] these time limits should be\nsuch that they cannot be regarded as capable of rendering virtually impossible\nor excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Union law, \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protection\nagainst discrimination based on the grounds of nationality would itself be\nstrengthened by the existence of organisations in each Member State with\ncompetence to promote equal treatment, to analyse the problems involved in\ncitizen's cases, to study possible solutions and to provide specific assistance\nto Union workers exercising their right to free movement. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is up to each Member\nState to decide whether the tasks referred to in Article 5 of this Directive\nare attributed to an already existing body covering a wider range of\ndiscrimination grounds. In the case the tasks under Article 5 will be covered\nby expanding the mandate of an already existing body or structure, the Member\nState should ensure allocation of sufficient resources to the existing body for\nthe performance of additional tasks in order to ensure that the performance of\nalready existing tasks of these bodies will not suffer.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\nthe promotion of synergies with existing information and support tools at the\nUnion level and to this end they should ensure that existing or newly created\nbodies are aware, make use of and co-operate with the existing information and\nassistance services, such as Your Europe, SOLVIT, EURES, Enterprise Europe\nNetwork and the Points of Single Contact.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should promote dialogue with non-governmental organisations and between\nsocial partners to address and combat different forms of discrimination on the\ngrounds of nationality.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should make information about employment terms and conditions more\nwidely available to workers from other Member States, to employers and to other\ninterested parties. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should establish how employers, workers and other people can be provided\nwith easily accessible, relevant information on the\nprovisions of this Directive and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No\n492/2011. This information should also be easily\naccessible through Your Europe and EURES.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive lays down\nminimum requirements, thus giving the Member States the option of introducing\nor maintaining more favourable provisions. Member States also have the\npossibility to extend the competencies of the organisations entrusted with\ntasks related to the protection of Union migrant workers against discrimination\non grounds of nationality so as to cover the right to equal treatment without discrimination\non grounds of nationality of all Union citizens and their family members\nexercising their right to free movement, as enshrined in Article 21 TFEU and\nDirective 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April\n2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and\nreside freely within the territory of the Member States[33]. The implementation of the\npresent Directive should not serve to justify any regression in relation to the\nsituation which already prevails in each Member State.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effective\nimplementation of the provisions of this Directive implies that Member States, when\nadopting the appropriate measures to comply with their obligations under this\nDirective, should provide a reference to this Directive or accompanied by such\na reference on the occasion of the official publication of implementing\nmeasures.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory\ndocuments of 28 September 2011, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in\njustified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or\nmore documents explaining the relationship between the components of a\ndirective and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\nWith regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such\ndocuments to be justified.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After a sufficient time of\nimplementation of the Directive has elapsed, the Commission should prepare a\nreport on its implementation, evaluating in particular the opportunity to\npresent any necessary proposal aiming to guarantee a better enforcement of the\nUnion law on free movement. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the freedom to choose an\noccupation and the right to engage in work (Article 15), the right to\nnon-discrimination (Article 21 and in particular Paragraph 2 concerning\nnon-discrimination on the grounds of nationality), the right to collective\nbargaining and action (Article 28), fair and just working conditions (Article\n31), the right to freedom of movement and residence (Article 45) and the right\nto an effective remedy and a fair trial (Article 47). It has to be implemented\nin accordance with those rights and principles.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective, namely to establish a general common framework of appropriate\nprovisions, measures and mechanisms necessary for the better and more uniform\napplication and enforcement in practice of rights conferred by the Treaty and\nRegulation (EU) No 492/2011, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\nStates, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effect of the action, be\nbetter achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with\nthe principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve that objective.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down provisions facilitating uniform application\nand enforcement in practice of rights conferred by Article 45 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and by provisions of Articles 1 to\n10 of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 5 April 2011 on freedom of movement for workers within the\nUnion. \nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Directive applies\nto the following matters in the area of freedom of movement for workers:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 access to employment;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conditions of employment and\nwork, in particular as regards remuneration and dismissal;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 access to social and tax\nadvantages;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 membership of trade unions;\n(e)              \naccess to training;\n(f)                \naccess to housing;\n(g)              \naccess to education for workers' children.\nCHAPTER II\nENFORCEMENT\nArticle 3\nDefence of rights - Means of redress - Time limits\n1. Member States shall ensure that judicial\nand/or administrative procedures, including where they deem it appropriate,\nconciliation procedures, for the enforcement of the obligations under Article\n45 of the Treaty and Articles 1 to 10 of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, are\navailable to all workers and members of their families who consider they have\nsuffered or are suffering from unjustified restrictions to their right to free\nmovement or consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of\nequal treatment to them, even after the relationship in which the\ndiscrimination is alleged to have occurred has ended.\n2. Paragraph 1\nshall apply without prejudice to national rules on time limits for enforcement\nof those rights. These time limits shall be such that they cannot be regarded\nas capable of rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the\nexercise of rights conferred by Union law. \nArticle 4\nAction of associations, organisations or other legal entities\n1.

Paragraph 1\nshall apply without prejudice to national rules on time limits for enforcement\nof those rights. These time limits shall be such that they cannot be regarded as\ncapable of rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise\nof rights conferred by Union law. \nCHAPTER III\nPROMOTION OF\nEQUAL TREATMENT-STRUCTURES, BODIES-DIALOGUE\nArticle 5\nStructures - bodies \n1. Member States shall designate a\nstructure, a body or bodies for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support\nof equal treatment of all workers or members of their families without\ndiscrimination on grounds of nationality and make the necessary arrangements\nfor functioning of such bodies. These bodies may form part of agencies at a national\nlevel with similar objectives but covering a wider range of discrimination\ngrounds. In that case, the Member State shall ensure allocation of sufficient\nresources to the existing body for the performance of additional tasks in order\nto ensure that the performance of already existing tasks of these bodies will\nnot suffer.\n2. Member States shall ensure that the\ncompetences of these bodies include:\n(a)                   \nwithout prejudice to the right of workers or the\nmembers of their family and associations and organisations or other legal\nentities referred to in Article 4, the provision of independent legal and/or\nother assistance to workers or the members of their family in pursuing their\ncomplaints;\n(b)                   \nconducting independent surveys concerning\ndiscrimination on the basis of nationality;\n(c)                   \npublishing independent reports and making\nrecommendations on any issue relating to such discrimination;\n(d)                   \npublishing information on any issue relating to\nthe application at national level of EU rules on free movement of workers.\n3. Member States shall ensure that existing\nor newly created bodies are aware, make use of and co-operate with the existing\ninformation and assistance services at Union level, such as Your Europe,\nSOLVIT, EURES, Enterprise Europe Network and the Points of Single Contact.\nArticle 6\nDialogue \nMember States\nshall encourage dialogue with appropriate non-governmental organisations and\nthe social partners which have, in accordance with their national law and\npractice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against\ndiscrimination on grounds of nationality with a view to promoting the principle\nof equal treatment. \nCHAPTER IV\nACCESS TO INFORMATION\nArticle 7\nDissemination of information\n1. Member States shall ensure that the\nprovisions adopted pursuant to this Directive together with the relevant provisions\nalready in force in Articles 1 to 10 of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, are\nbrought to the attention of the persons concerned by all appropriate means\nthroughout their territory.\n2. Member States shall provide clear,\neasily accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date information on the rights\nconferred by the Union law on free movement of workers. . This information\nshould also be easily accessible through Your Europe and EURES.\nCHAPTER V\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 8\nMinimum requirements\n1. Member States may introduce or\nmaintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the\nprinciple of equal treatment than those laid down in this Directive.\n2. Member States may provide that the\ncompetencies of the structures and bodies referred to in Article 5 for the promotion,\nanalysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all workers or members\nof their families without discrimination on grounds of nationality, also cover the\nright to equal treatment without discrimination on grounds of nationality of\nall EU citizens and their family members exercising their right to free\nmovement, as enshrined in Article 21 TFEU and Directive 2004/38/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of\ncitizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within\nthe territory of the Member States.\n3.

Member States shall bring into force the\nlaws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this\nDirective by [2 years after its entry into force-specific date to be inserted\nby the OPOCE] at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission\nthe text of those provisions. \n2. When Member States adopt those\nprovisions they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied\nby such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member\nStates shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n3. Member States shall communicate to the\nCommission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in\nthe field covered by this Directive. \nArticle 10\nReport\nNo later than two

Expected result(s) and\nimpact\nSpecify the\neffects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups\ntargeted.\nThe proposal aims at a better application and enforcement in\npractice of free movement rights, combating discrimination on the basis of\nnationality and reducing the obstacles migrant workers still face.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nSeveral\nindicators, both quantitative (e.g.; the number of complaints or the degree of\nraise awareness) and qualitative (the reports on the application of the\nDirective and of free movement legislation) will be used for monitoring\npurposes. The supporting bodies set up according to this proposal for a\nDirective will also have a monitoring role and will be able to provide more qualitative\ndata on discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\nMoreover\nthe Commission intends to evaluate the impact of this Directive with:\n-a systematic evaluation by the Commission\nservices with the involvement of the Advisory Committee on free movement of\nworkers;\n-the presentation of a report 2 years after the\ndeadline of transposition;\n-assess the activities developed by the\nsupporting bodies and associations;\n-assess whether the Directive has led to positive\nchanges\n-identify the difficulties faced by equality\nsupporting bodies, associations and organisations.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe\nproposal will aim at improving and reinforcing the, application and enforcement\nin practice of the EU rules on free movement of workers (Article 45TFEU and\nRegulation (EU) No 492/2011 Articles 1 to 10 relating to access to employment\nand employment and working conditions). By providing specific tools and\nmechanisms of information and advice, it ensures at the same time guarantees\nfor a more effective exercise in practice of these rights in order to reduce\ndiscriminations on the grounds of nationality and to contribute to the removal\nof unjustified obstacles to the freedom of movement of workers which is one of\nthe principal components for the realisation of the Internal Market.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThe\nproblems identified are linked to the objectives set out by Article 3(3) TEU\nand Articles 45 TFEU. The existing legal framework, application and enforcement\nin practice as well as previous attempts to address existing problems by the\nway of non-binding measures have not been sufficient to solve the identified\nproblems. Therefore, it is necessary to address the existing problems at EU\nlevel in order to better achieve the objectives of the Treaty.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nPrevious\nattempts to solve problems of implementation and enforcement in practice of the\nEU law on free movement of workers and in particular of Regulation (EU) No 492/2011\nby non-legislative means have not reached their objectives. The issues have\nbeen addressed by interpretative Legal Commission\u2019s Communications in 2002 and in\n2010. The respective Communications provided, in the light of the case law of\nthe CJ further clarifications for Member States. However, the monitoring\nexercise of application of EU law on free movement showed that there were\nalways a number of deficiencies; Since October 2010, the Commission launched several\nex-post evaluation studies of the problems faced by EU workers when exercising\ntheir right to free movement: (two independent reports of the Network of\nexperts on free movement of workers discussed within the Advisory committee on\nfree movement of workers which concluded that the right for an equal treatment\non the basis of nationality is rarely offered the same level of protection and\nguarantees as the right on equal treatment on other grounds (race, sex\u2026) in the\nMember States. EU workers are still considered in most Member states as holding\na status closer to that of third country national and not to that of a\nnational. Moreover, if sometimes they benefit, in cases of nationality based\ndiscrimination, from these guarantees and protection is due to a broader\ninterpretation of national law which assimilates nationality to ethnic origin.\nTherefore there is a need for a stronger protection of nationality based\ndiscrimination.\nIn order to\nprepare the Impact Assessment an ex-ante evaluation study has been carried out\nby an external consultant in 2012.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nFundamental\nrights: The proposal is consistent with the EU's fundamental rights strategy, COM(2010)\n573 final.\nEurope 2020\nstrategy: The initiative will contribute to the creation of employment within\nthe strategy for smart, sustainable and socially inclusive growth (Europe\n2020).\nSingle\nMarket Act: The proposal will in particular facilitate the free movement of\nwork force and will contribute to a better functioning of the Internal market.\nIt will contribute to better match workers with jobs, allowing more persons to\nfind jobs corresponding to their skills and overcoming bottlenecks in the\nEuropean labour market.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \nx Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \nx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 2013 to 2020\nThe implementation of the directive is of\nunlimited duration but will be reassessed after two years after the deadline\nfor transposition has expired.\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013              \nImplementation with a start-up period from 2013\nto 2014,\n\u2013              \nfollowed by full-scale operation\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[36]\n\nx Centralised direct management by the Commission \n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[37] \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service\nmission \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nSpecify\nfrequency and conditions.\nTwo years\nafter the deadline for transposition there will be an on-going evaluation.
