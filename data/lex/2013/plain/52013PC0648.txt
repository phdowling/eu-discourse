At the end of these negotiations a draft of the new Protocol was\r\ninitialled by the negotiators on 24 July 2013. The new protocol covers a\r\nperiod of four years from its entry into force. \nThe main aim\r\nof the Protocol to the Agreement is to provide fishing opportunities for\r\nvessels from the European Union in the waters of the Kingdom of Morocco within\r\nthe limits of the surplus available. The Commission based itself in part on the\r\nresults of an ex-post evaluation carried out by external experts.\nThe general\r\naim is to strengthen the cooperation between the European Union and the Kingdom\r\nof Morocco, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a policy\r\nof sustainable fisheries and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the\r\nMoroccan fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.\nMore specifically, the\r\nProtocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories:\n\u2013     \r\nSmall-scale pelagic fishing in the north: 20\r\nseiners,\n\u2013     \r\nSmall-scale fishing in the north: 35 bottom\r\nlongliners,\n\u2013     \r\nSmall-scale fishing in the south: 10 vessels (rods\r\nand lines),\n\u2013     \r\nDemersal fishing: 16 vessels (bottom longliners\r\nand bottom trawlers), \n\u2013     \r\nTuna fishing: 27 vessels (pole-and-line),\n\u2013     \r\nIndustrial pelagic fishing: 80 000 tonnes of\r\ncatches, 18 vessels. \nThe previous Protocol, applied\r\nprovisionally from 28 February 2011, was not approved by the\r\nParliament which considered that its cost-benefit ratio was too low, that it\r\ndid not guarantee the sustainability of the stocks exploited and that it did\r\nnot respect international law insofar as it did not prove that the local\r\npopulations would benefit from the economic and social benefits of that\r\nProtocol.\nThe Parliament's concerns have been\r\naddressed, notably by\n- drastically improving the cost-benefit\r\nration of the new Protocol, under which the fishing opportunities have\r\nincreased in relation to the previous Protocol while the European Union's\r\nfinancial contribution has decreased;\n- underscoring the principle of\r\nsustainability as an essential condition for the activity envisaged, a\r\nprinciple based on sound scientific advice and reiterated several times in the\r\ntext;\n- requiring Morocco to provide regular,\r\ndetailed reports on the use of the financial contribution for the fisheries\r\nsector, including the economic and social benefits on a geographical basis, and\r\nproviding for a mechanism for the possible suspension of the Protocol,\r\nincluding in the event of violations of human rights and democratic principles.\nThe Commission proposes, on this basis,\r\nthat the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt a Decision\r\nconcluding the Agreement.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe interested parties were consulted\r\nduring the evaluation of the Protocol for the period 2007-11. Experts from the\r\nMember States were also consulted in technical meetings. These consultations led\r\nto the conclusion that it would be beneficial to maintain a fishing protocol\r\nwith the Kingdom of Morocco.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThis procedure\r\nis being initiated in parallel with the procedures relating to the Council\r\nDecision concluding the Protocol itself, as well as with the Council Regulation\r\nconcerning the allocation of the fishing opportunities between the Member\r\nStates of the EU. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe annual\r\nfinancial contribution of EUR 30 000 000 is based on: a) an amount of\r\nEUR 16 000 000 linked to access and b) support for the\r\ndevelopment of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\namounting to EUR 14 000 000.

monitoring\r\nimplementation of the proposal/initiative.\nRates of\r\nutilisation of fishing opportunities (annual uptake of fishing authorisations\r\nas a percentage of availability under the

\nThe new Protocol\r\nis expected to apply once it comes into force. \nThe new\r\nProtocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European\r\nfleet in the Moroccan fishing zone and will authorise European vessel owners to\r\napply for fishing licences allowing them to fish in Moroccan waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between\r\nthe EU and the Kingdom of Morocco, with a view to promoting the development of\r\na sustainable fishing policy. It provides, in particular, for vessels to be\r\nmonitored via VMS and for the electronic transmission of catch data. Sectoral\r\nsupport has been strengthened to help the Kingdom of Morocco with its national\r\nfisheries strategy (\u2018Halieutis\u2019) and in the fight against IUU fishing.\nAdded\r\nvalue of EU involvement\nAs regards\r\nthis new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow the emergence of private\r\nagreements which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The European Union\r\nalso hopes that with this Protocol, the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to\r\ncooperate effectively with the EU particularly as regards the fight against\r\nillegal fishing.\nLessons\r\nlearned from similar experiences in the past\nAnalysis of\r\ncatches under the previous Protocol has led the Parties to increase the\r\nreference tonnage. Sectoral support has been strengthened taking account of the\r\npriorities of the national fisheries strategy and requirements in terms of\r\nbuilding the capacity of the Moroccan fishing authorities. \nCompatibility\r\nand possible synergy with other appropriate instruments\nFunds paid\r\nout under FPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third-country\r\npartners. However, allocating some of those funds for implementing measures as\r\npart of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition for the conclusion and\r\nmonitoring of FPAs. These financial resources are compatible with other sources\r\nof funding from other providers of international funding for carrying out\r\nprojects and/or programmes at national level in the fisheries sector.\nDuration\r\nand financial impact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in force from\r\nthe date of signature of the Protocol and for a duration of three years.\nX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2017\r\n(4 years)\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\nImplementation with a start-up period from\r\nYYYY to YYYY,\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\nManagement\r\nmode(s) planned[9]\r\n\nX Centralised\r\ndirect management by the Commission\n\u00a8 Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[10]\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service\r\nmission \n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific\r\nactions pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in\r\nthe relevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial\r\nRegulation\n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States\n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \nMonitoring\r\nand reporting rules \nSpecify frequency and conditions\nThe\r\nCommission (DG MARE, in collaboration with its fisheries counsellor in the European\r\nUnion\u2019s Delegation at Rabat) will ensure regular monitoring of the\r\nimplementation of this Protocol, particularly as regards operators\u2019 use of\r\nfishing opportunities and in terms of catch data. \nThe Fisheries\r\nPartnership Agreement provides for at least one annual meeting of the Joint\r\nCommittee, at which the Commission and the third country concerned review the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto and, if necessary,\r\nadjust the programming and, where applicable, the financial contribution.\nManagement\r\nand control system \nRisk(s)\r\nidentified \nThere is\r\nsome risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, particularly with regard to the\r\namounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming).\r\nThese difficulties were not encountered with the Kingdom of Morocco during the\r\nimplementation of the 2007-11 Protocol. \nControl\r\nmethod(s) envisaged \nExtensive\r\ndialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral\r\npolicy.
