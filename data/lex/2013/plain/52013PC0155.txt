The results it produces on employment,\nunemployment and persons outside the labour market form the backbone of the\nstatistical information system on labour markets in the European Union. In\nparticular, the LFS provides the indicators for three of the Europe 2020\nheadline targets.\nThe national statistical institutes are\nresponsible for selecting the sample, preparing the questionnaires, conducting\nthe direct interviews among households, and forwarding the results to Eurostat\nin accordance with the common coding scheme.\nEach year, the core LFS is supplemented with a so-called ad hoc\nmodule. While the core part of the survey is of equal interest at national and\nEuropean levels, the annually changing ad hoc modules serve predominantly\nEuropean policy initiatives, amongst them the European Employment Strategy, the\nYouth on the Move flagship initiative, the\nStrategy for Equality between Women and Men, the European agenda for\nintegration and the Employment Package.\nThe sustainable production of high-quality\nad hoc module data is of utmost importance to EU decision-makers, and thus a\nprovision on financing is proposed to be integrated into the Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Directors of Social Statistics and the European\nStatistical System Committee were consulted.\nThere was no need for impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe objectives of this proposal are:\n(i) to modify Regulation (EC) No 577/98 and\nalign it to the new institutional context. In particular, the aim is to\nidentify what powers the Commission has and establish the appropriate procedure\nfor adopting measures on the basis of these powers.\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU in order to\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No\n577/98. In particular, the Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts,\nthe content of the ad hoc modules, the definitions and any adjustment of the\nlist of survey variables made necessary by the evolution of techniques and\nconcepts. In addition, the Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts,\nthe list of structural variables, including the minimum sample size and the\nsurvey frequency. The Commission should ensure that these delegated acts do not\nimpose a significant additional administrative burden on the Member States and\non the respondent units.\nImplementing powers are conferred upon the\nCommission with a view to ensuring uniform conditions concerning the\ntransmission of statistical information, in particular by adopting the rules on\nthe edits to be used, the codification of the variables and the list of\nprinciples for the formulation of the questions concerning the labour status,\nin accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(ii) to put the Commission in a position to\nallow for a financial contribution. This is proposed in\nview of the importance of the Labour Force Survey ad hoc modules in support of\nUnion policies. Such contribution by the Union to the financing of their\nimplementation is proposed through grant procedures, without calls for\nproposals. The grants are to be awarded to the national statistical institutes\nand other national authorities referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 11 March 2009 on European statistics[4]. In order to allow for significantly simplified administrative\nprocedures and for a substantially reduced risk of error relating to the\nmanagement of grants, the use of lump sums may be proposed in accordance with\nArticle 124(1) of the Financial Regulation.\n\u00b7       \nLegal basis\nArticle 338(1) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n\u00b7       \nChoice of instrument\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe budgetary implications are set out in\nthe financial statement.\n\u00b7       \nEuropean Economic Area\nThe proposed act concerns an EEA matter and\nshould therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0084 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98\non the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\nentry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),\nthe powers conferred on the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and\n291 of the TFEU.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has\ncommitted itself[5],\nunder Regulation (EU) No\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\nby Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers[6], to reviewing legislative acts which currently contain\nreferences to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny in the light of the\ncriteria laid down in the Treaty.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should have\nthe power to adopt delegated acts under Article 290 of the TFEU in order to\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of particular legislative\nacts, notably to take account of economic, social and technical developments.\nThe Commission should ensure that these delegated acts do not impose a\nsignificant additional administrative burden on the Member States or on the\nrespondent units.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\n577/98 of 9 March 1998 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in\nthe Community[7]\ncontains references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny and should\ntherefore be reviewed in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should have\nthe power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU in\norder to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC)\nNo 577/98 as regards the content of the ad hoc modules, the definitions, and\nany adjustment of the list of survey variables made necessary by the evolution\nof techniques and concepts.

The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\ndelegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission\nof relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission.

Grants that are provided for purposes of\ncarrying out labour force surveys may take the form of lump sums. In this\ncontext, the use of lump sums should be a principal means of simplifying grant\nmanagement.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By derogation from Article\n126(3)(e) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the\ngeneral budget of the Union[9],\nin view of the increased administrative burden related to the additional\ninformation to be collected for the Labour Force Survey\u00a0 which will contribute\nto providing the indicators for three of the Europe 2020 headline targets, it\nis necessary to cofinance the salary costs of the personnel of national\nadministrations even if the relevant public authority would have carried out\nthe supported action without an EU grant.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nprinciple of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate, for achieving\nthe basic objective of alignment of the powers conferred on the Commission to\nArticles 290 and 291 of the TFEU, to lay down rules on such alignment in\nRegulation (EC) No 577/98. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary\nin order to achieve that objective, in accordance with Article 5(4) of the\nTreaty on European Union.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\ncertainty, it is necessary that procedures for the adoption of measures which\nhave been initiated but not completed before the entry into force of this\nRegulation are not affected by this Regulation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 577/98\nshould therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 577/98 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 4 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\n7c, concerning the definitions and any adjustment of the list of survey\nvariables made necessary by the evolution of techniques and concepts.\nThe Commission\nshall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 7c,\nconcerning a list of variables (hereinafter referred to as \u2018structural\nvariables\u2019), including the minimum sample size and the survey frequency, from\namong the survey characteristics specified in paragraph 1 which need to be\nsurveyed only as annual averages with reference to 52 weeks rather than as\nquarterly averages.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall, by means of implementing\nacts, adopt rules on the edits to be used, the\ncodification of the variables and the list of principles for formulation of the\nquestions concerning labour status.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination\nprocedure referred to in Article 8(2).\u2019\n(b) paragraph 4 is deleted.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfollowing Articles 7a, 7b and 7c are inserted:\n\u2018Article 7a\nAd hoc modules\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall be\nempowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 7c concerning an\nadditional set of variables (hereinafter referred to as \u2018ad hoc module\u2019) in\norder to supplement the information described in Article 4(1), including the\nsubject, the reference period, the sample size (equal to or less than the\nsample size determined according to Article 3) and the deadline for\ntransmission of the results (which may be different from the deadline according\nto Article 6).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndetailed list of information to be collected in an ad hoc module shall be drawn\nup at least 12 months before the beginning of the reference period for that\nmodule.
