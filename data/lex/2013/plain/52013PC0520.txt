It is a crucial step to overcome the current financial\nfragmentation and uncertainty, to ease funding conditions for vulnerable\nsovereigns and banks and break the link between the two, and to re-launch\ncross-border banking activity in the internal market to the benefit of both\nEuro Area and non-Euro Area Member States. Building on the regulatory framework\ncommon to the 28 members of the internal market (single rulebook), the European\nCommission has therefore taken an inclusive approach and proposed a roadmap for\nthe Banking Union with different instruments and steps, potentially open to all\nMember States but in any case including the 18 currently within the Euro Area.\nIn March 2013, the European Council\ncommitted to complete the Banking Union via the following steps. First, the\nremaining legislative procedures to set up the Single Supervisory Mechanism\n(SSM) conferring powers on the ECB to supervise Euro Area banks[4] should be concluded as a\npriority. Second, agreement should be reached in the summer months on how the\nEuropean Stability Mechanism (ESM) could, following the establishment of the\nSSM and a review of bank balance sheets including the definition of \u201clegacy\nassets\u201d, recapitalise banks directly. Likewise in summer 2013, agreement should\nbe reached on the Commission\u2019s proposals for a Directive of the European\nParliament and of the Council of [ ] establishing a framework for the recovery\nand resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (hereinafter \u2018Directive\n[ ] of the European Parliament and of the Council\u2019[5]). Finally, the Commission\u2019s\nproposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) together with appropriate and\neffective backstop arrangements should be examined as a matter of priority with\nthe intention of adopting them during the current parliamentary cycle.\nAs established, the Banking Union will\ncover all Euro Area Member States and those non-Euro Area Member States that\nchoose to join. The same EU-wide single rulebook of prudential requirements[6] and rules on bank resolution\nwill apply within the Banking Union and in all other Member States. The\nintegrity of the internal market will thus be preserved. The enhanced financial\nstability generated by the Banking Union will also boost confidence and the\nprospects for growth across the internal market. Central and uniform\napplication of prudential and resolution rules in the Member States\nparticipating in the Banking Union will benefit all Member States. By\novercoming the financial fragmentation currently hampering economic activity,\nit will help ensure fair competition for and remove obstacles to the free\nexercise of fundamental freedoms not only in the participating Member States\nbut in the whole of the internal market.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Single Resolution\nMechanism and financing arrangements as key elements of Banking Union\nThe swift agreement on a Single Supervisory\nMechanism in April 2012, only seven months after the Commission's proposal of\nSeptember 2012 has laid the ground for a Banking Union, as integral part of the\nEconomic and Monetary Union.\nReinforced supervision within the SSM will\nrestore confidence in the health of banks. The ECB will assume ultimate\nresponsibility for the supervision of all Euro Area banks in 2014. In practice,\nthe ECB will directly supervise the largest and most internationally active\nbanks with the possibility to \u201ccall up\u201d direct supervision for the others,\nwhile the national authorities will be in charge of the day-to-day supervision\nof smaller banks.\nBuilding on the SSM, in order to set up the\nsustainability of the banking markets in the participating Member States in the\nSSM, the EU must put in place a Single Resolution Mechanism to deal with\nfailing banks. The risk of a bank experiencing a severe liquidity or solvency\nproblem can never be totally excluded. It is therefore necessary to set out a\nframework that allows for the in-depth restructuring of banks by authorities\nwhilst avoiding the very significant risks to economic stability and costs\nderived from their disorderly liquidation under national insolvency laws, and\nputting an end to the need to finance the process with public resources.\nThe Directive on Bank Recovery and\nResolution, when adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, will\ndetermine the rules for how EU banks in serious financial difficulties are\nrestructured, how vital functions for the real economy are maintained, and how\nlosses and costs are allocated to the banks\u2019 shareholders, creditors and\nuninsured depositors. Bail-in, a key instrument in the resolution directive,\nwould sequentially allocate losses and write down the claims of shareholders, subordinated\ncreditors, and senior creditors. Depositors below \u20ac100 000 are in any case excluded\nfrom suffering losses, their claims being protected by national Deposit\nGuarantee Schemes.\nThe directive relies on a network of\nnational authorities and resolution funds to resolve banks. While this is a\nmajor step forward to minimise differing national approaches and to protect the\nintegrity of the internal market, it is not sufficient for those Member States\nwhich share the supervision of credit institutions within the SSM. As\nrecognised by the European Council, in the Banking Union, bank supervision and\nresolution need to be exercised by the same level of authority. Otherwise\ntensions between the supervisor (ECB) and national resolution authorities may\nemerge over how to deal with ailing banks, while market expectations about\nMember States\u2019 (in)ability to deal with bank failures nationally could\ncontinue, reinforcing feedback loops between sovereigns and banks and\nfragmentation and competitive distortions across the internal market.\nCompared to a network of resolution authorities,\na Single Resolution Mechanism with a central decision-making body and a Single\nBank Resolution Fund will provide key benefits for Member States, taxpayers,\nbanks, and financial and economic stability in the entire EU:\n\u00b7       \nstrong central decision-making will ensure that\nresolution decisions across participating Member States will be taken\neffectively and quickly, avoiding uncoordinated action, minimising negative\nimpacts on financial stability, and limiting the need for financial support;\n\u00b7       \na centralised pool of bank resolution expertise\nand experience will be able to deal with failing banks in a more systematic and\nefficient way than individual national authorities with more limited resources\nand experience;\n\u00b7       \na Single Bank Resolution Fund will be able to pool\nsignificant resources from bank contributions and therefore protect taxpayers\nmore effectively than national funds, while at the same time providing a level\nplaying field for banks across participating Member States. A Single Fund will\nprevent coordination problems arising in the deployment of national funds and\nwill be instrumental in eliminating the dependence of banks on sovereign\ncreditworthiness.\nThe Single Resolution Mechanism must be\ncreated within the EU legal and institutional framework. The European Council\nConclusions of 14 December 2012 state that \u201cthe process of completing EMU will\nbuild on the EU\u2019s institutional and legal framework.\u201d While the deployment of\nad hoc inter-governmental tools outside the EU framework has been necessary to\ntackle exceptional market circumstances and governance flaws in the original\nconstruction of EMU, it threatens to undermine the democratic quality of EU\ndecision-making and the coherence of the EU legal system. The creation of the\nSRM within the EU legal and institutional framework, like the SSM before it, is\ntherefore a necessary step to complete EMU in line with the European Council\u2019s\nconclusions and, more broadly, in order to protect the democratic and institutional\norder of the EU.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition to Banking\nUnion\nThe Single Supervisory Mechanism is set to\nenter into force in mid-2014. The Single Resolution Mechanism meanwhile should\ncommence operations in January 2015, when Directive [ ] which will provide the\nrulebook governing bank resolution across the internal market is set to enter\ninto force[7].\nThe SRM would thereafter apply the rules of this Regulation which are in line\nwith the rules of Directive [ ] for Member States participating in the Banking\nUnion, while national authorities would apply the rules of Directive [ ] for\nthose outside.\nIn any case the State aid rules on\nburden-sharing will apply if resolution actions involve government support. In\norder to implement the burden-sharing by shareholders and junior creditors, the\nSRM would be able to apply as of the entry into application of this Regulation,\nrules allowing the write down of shares and subordinated debt to the extent\nnecessary in order to apply the State aid rules.\nIn addition, Member States may decide to implement the new rules set out in Directive [ ] in their national\nlaw, even before the deadline for transposition of that directive. In any event, the State aid competences of the Commission will be\npreserved in all resolution cases involving support which qualifies as State\naid. In fact, to the extent that the use of the Single Bank Resolution Fund by\nthe SRM does not constitute State aid pursuant to the specific criteria laid\ndown by the Treaty those criteria would still remain applicable, by way of\nanalogy, to ensure that where the Resolution Fund is used, the same rules apply\nto its intervention as if the national resolution authorities were to use\nnational financing arrangements.\nAt the European level, this process of\nconvergence is furthered, on the one hand, by the revised State aid guidelines\nfor support to banks and, on the other hand, by the agreement on how the\nEuropean Stability Mechanism could recapitalise ailing banks. The revised State\naid guidelines impose stricter requirements for burden sharing for shareholders\nand junior creditors in any Member State providing public support to their\nbanks. This would counter the on-going fragmentation of the internal market\ndepending on the strength of the sovereign and the presence of legacy assets.\nThe ESM guidelines would meanwhile specify under what conditions, and subject\nto State aid rules, Member States unable to provide public support to banks\ncould get loans or if necessary how banks could be directly recapitalised by\nthe ESM. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RATIONALE FOR A SINGLE RESOLUTION\nMECHANISM\nThe Commission has taken into account the\nanalysis carried out in the Impact Assessment conducted for the adoption of the\nproposal for Directive [ ] which assessed operational and legal aspects\nrelevant to the establishment of a single resolution mechanism (SRM).\nAdditional analysis has been conducted on\nthe proposed features of the SRM on the basis of updates of the information\ncomprised in the Impact Assessment. With regard to the ability of the SRM to\nproduce effective decisions, time is critical for two important reasons:\nex-ante, to enhance the credibility of the newly-established SRM as a\nresponsive tool, contributing to minimize the sources of uncertainty in the\nmarkets; and where resolution is triggered, for the SRM to preserve the value\nof the assets which can be eroded by unnecessary delays in the resolution\nprocess. A network of national authorities would require additional procedural\ntime for each deliberation regarding cross-border institutions. On the\ncontrary, the proposed division of responsibilities between a central\ndecision-making level and local implementing authorities will result in time\nsavings. At the national level, it will take shorter time than at the central\nlevel to accumulate all the expertise to manage implementation, because the\napplicable law is national; at the central level, there will be scope for a\nlarger critical mass to attract and develop the best specialized human capital\nmore promptly.\nWith regard to the ability of the SRM to\nproduce efficient decisions, a central decision-making level will contribute to\nminimizing the costs of resolution both since it can attain significant\nadvantages in terms of economies of scale over a network, and because it is\ninstrumental to the enforceability and optimality of the resolution decision. Structurally,\na system which does not overcome national authorities\u2019 mandate to minimize the\ncost to their own Member State fails to fully consider cross-border\nexternalities. A burden-sharing mechanism to minimize global welfare losses in\nthese situations has been envisioned by Member States since the beginning of\nthe crisis[8].\nA single resolution mechanism is better suited than a network to guarantee the\nenforceability of burden transfers, a necessary condition for the functioning\nof a burden-sharing agreement. It will also guarantee the external\nenforceability of the optimal resolution policy, which allows agreeing on a\nburden-sharing rule ex-ante that allocates the costs of resolution according to\nequitable and balanced criteria.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\nArticle 114 of the TFEU, which allows the adoption of measures for the\napproximation of national provisions aiming at the establishment and\nfunctioning of the internal market.\nThe proposal aims to preserve the integrity\nand enhance the functioning of the internal market. Uniform application of a\nsingle set of resolution rules, together with access to a single European\nresolution fund by a central authority will restore the orderly functioning of\nthe Union banking markets, will remove obstacles to the exercise of fundamental\nfreedoms and will avoid significant distortion of competition at least in those\nMember States which share the supervision of credit institutions at the\nEuropean level.\nWhilst Directive [ ] brings a high level of\nharmonisation, it still allows flexibility to Member States which means that a\ncertain fragmentation in the internal market could remain. The SRM provides\ninstead for an integrated decision-making structure aligning resolution under\nthe SRM with supervision under the SSM to eliminate the competitive\ndisadvantage that banks in the participating Member States in the SSM have\ncompared to banks in the non-participating Member States because of the lack of\na centralized system to deal with failing banks. To ensure that all\nparticipating Member States have full confidence in the quality and\nimpartiality of the bank resolution process notably as regards local economic\nimplications, resolution decisions will be prepared and monitored centrally by\na Single Resolution Board to ensure a coherent and uniform approach and the\nresolution process will be initiated by the Commission. The Commission will\nalso decide on the framework of the resolution tools that shall be applied in\nrespect of the entity concerned and on the use of the Fund to support the\nresolution action.\nIn addition, to support the resolution\nprocess and enhance its effectiveness, the proposed Regulation establishes a\nSingle Bank Resolution Fund. The proposed regulation is directly enforceable in\nall Member States, but applies to all entities supervised by the SSM. The\nsingle rulebook established by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for\ncredit institutions and investment firms[9],\nDirective 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential\nsupervision of credit institutions and investment firms[10], and Directive [ ] will apply\nto the participating Member States as they apply within the whole internal\nmarket.\nArticle 114 of the TFEU is, therefore, the\nappropriate legal base.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\nUnder the principle of subsidiarity set out\nin Article 5.3 of the TEU, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive responsibility,\nthe Union should act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed\naction cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central\nlevel or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or\neffects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.\nOnly action at European level can ensure\nthat failing banks are resolved with minimal spill over effects and in a\nconsistent manner pursuant to a single set of rules. The SRM will bring\nsignificant economies of scale and will avoid the negative externalities that\nmay derive from purely national decisions and funds. Substantial differences\nbetween resolution decisions taken at national level, and subject to local\nspecificities and funding constraints, may undermine the stability and\nintegrity of the internal market.\nWhilst the establishment of the Single\nSupervisory Mechanism ensures a level playing field in the supervision of banks\nand diminishes the risk of forbearance, the SRM ensures that when a bank\nfailure occurs, restructuring can be carried out at the least cost, creditors\nreceive fair and equal treatment, and funding can be quickly deployed to its\nmost productive use across the internal market.\nTherefore, it is appropriate that the Union\nshould propose the necessary legislative action to establish such resolution\narrangement for banks supervised by the SSM. A regulation is the appropriate\nlegal instrument to avoid discrepancies in national transposition and to ensure\na unified institutional mechanism and level playing field for all the banks in\nthe participating Member States.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality\nUnder the principle of proportionality, the\ncontent and form of Union action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve\nthe objectives of the Treaties.\nIn the Banking Union, bank supervision and\nresolution need to be exercised by the same level of authority. Otherwise\ntensions between the European supervisor and national resolution authorities\nmay emerge over how to deal with and cover the costs of ailing banks. These\ntensions could undermine the effectiveness of both supervision and resolution\nand distort competition between Member States.\nThe recent crisis highlighted the need for\nswift and decisive action backed by European level funding arrangements to\navoid nationally conducted bank resolution from having disproportionate impacts\non the real economy, and in order to curb uncertainty and prevent bank runs and\ncontagion within the internal market. The Single Resolution Mechanism would\nensure that the same rules are applied in the same manner to any failing bank\nin participating Member State. Adequate backup funding would mitigate problems\nin individual banks from translating into a loss of confidence in the entire\nbanking system of the Member State or of others perceived by markets to be\nexposed to similar risks.\nThe added legal certainty, properly aligned\nincentives in the Banking Union context, and economic benefits of central and\nuniform resolution action entail that the proposal complies with the principle\nof proportionality and it does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the\nobjectives pursued.\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental\nrights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental\nRights of the European Union, notably the right to the protection of personal\ndata, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and\nto a fair trial, and has to be implemented in accordance with those rights and\nprinciples.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Single Resolution\nMechanism\n4.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles, structure and\nscope\nThe Single Resolution Mechanism must entail\ndecision-making structures which are legally sound and effective in times of\ncrisis. Decision-making must ensure European decisions, but involving MS,\nrecognising significance of bank resolution for national economies.\nThe Single Resolution Mechanism will apply\nthe single Rulebook on bank resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution\nDirective in respect of ailing banks from the participating Member States in\nthis mechanism. The Single Resolution Mechanism will consist of uniform rules and procedures to be applied by the Single Resolution\nBoard (\u2018the Board\u2019), together with the Commission and the resolution\nauthorities of the participating Member States.\nThe European Commission will participate in\nthe SRM only in so far as needed to perform specific tasks provided for in this\nRegulation and in relation to State aid scrutiny under the Treaty or for the\npurpose of application, by way of analogy, the criteria established for the\napplication of Article 107 of the TFEU.\nHowever, the Single Resolution Mechanism\ndoes not follow the differentiated approach of the Single Supervisory Mechanism\nfor different types of banks due to the characteristics of the resolution\nprocess. Contrary to the on-going task of day-to-day supervision, only a number\nof banks are likely fail and be in resolution at any given time. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive scope for the Single Resolution Mechanism is fully consistent\nwith the logic whereby the ECB can assume direct supervision for any bank in\ncase of problems, including in view of its possible resolution. Finally, the\ncrisis has shown that it is not only the large international banks that require\na resolution framework at European level. The existence of differentiated\nresolution authorities for different sizes of banks would also imply\ndifferentiated funding and backstop mechanisms which could again entrench links\nbetween sovereigns and banks and distort competition.\n4.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles of SRM actions\nTo ensure an objective and fair resolution\nprocess, any discrimination by the Commission, the\nBoard and the national resolution authorities against\nbanks, their depositors, creditors or shareholders on grounds of nationality or\nplace of business is forbidden. Resolution of cross-border groups is guided by\na number of principles to ensure equality of treatment between the different\nentities of the group, to allow for proper\nconsideration of the interests of the Member States involved in the resolution,\nto avoid that the cost imposed on the creditors goes beyond what it would be\nunder normal insolvency proceedings. Where only parts of a group are under\nresolution, the proposal aims at ensuring that the resolution process will not\nnegatively impact the entities of the group that are not under resolution. As a\nprinciple, the cost of resolution will be borne by bail-in and the banking\nsector. Therefore, the proposal ensures that the Commission, the Board and the\nnational resolution authorities decide upon resolution funding arrangements in\nsuch a manner that the use of extraordinary public support is minimised.\n4.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interaction with the State\naid control of the Commission\nWithin the SRM, the State aid control of\nthe Commission would be preserved in all circumstances. This means that once\nthe ECB notifies the Commission and the Board that a bank or group is failing\nor likely to fail, the resolution procedure within the SRM should run in\nparallel with the State aid procedure where applicable, so that the Member\nState or Member States concerned should be invited to notify the envisaged\nmeasures to the Commission in accordance with Article 108 of the TFEU. This\nrequires the establishment of a continuous cooperation and exchange of\ninformation between the Board and the Commission for the completion of the\nState aid procedure. Moreover, the decision of the Commission under State aid\nrules would be the precondition for the adoption by the Commission of a\ndecision to place a bank under resolution. Where no State aid is present in the\nuse of the Fund, the criteria established for the application of Article 107 of\nthe TFEU should be applied, by way of analogy, as a precondition for the adoption\nof a decision to place a bank under resolution, in order to preserve the\nintegrity of the internal market between participating and non-participating\nMember States.\n4.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tasks and decision-making\nstructure\nThe single resolution mechanism covers all\nkey resolution tasks that are indispensable to resolve failing banks. Such\ntasks include, inter alia, the authorisation to apply simplified obligations in\nrelation to the requirement of drafting resolution plans, drawing up resolution\nplans, reviewing resolution plans, assessing the resolvability of banks,\ndeciding to place a bank under resolution, exercising resolution powers in\nrelation to an institution under resolution, and implementing resolution\nschemes. Furthermore, the SRM covers decisions on the use of resolution funding.\nThe composition of the SRM ensures that its\ndecision-making structures are legally sound and effective, including in times\nof crisis. They are designed to ensure that the decisions are European and\ninvolve Member States in view of the significance of bank resolution for\nnational economies.\nThe decision-making structures of the\nSingle Resolution Mechanism include the Single Resolution Board, the national\nresolution authorities of participating Member States and the European\nCommission. The tasks of the SRM are shared between Single Resolution Board and\nthe national resolution authorities.\nTo ensure the effectiveness and\naccountability of the Single Resolution Mechanism and in compliance with legal\nrequirements, the European Commission, as an EU institution, has the power to\ninitiate the resolution of a bank, based on a recommendation by the Resolution\nBoard or on its own initiative. If the Commission initiates a resolution\nprocedure, it would also decide on the framework of the resolution tools that\nwill be applied in each case and on the use of the Fund. The Single Resolution\nBoard would take all other decisions under the SRM Regulation and would address\nthem to the national resolution authorities for execution at the national level\nin accordance with the SRM Regulation and Directive [ ]. The Board would\nmonitor the execution by the national resolution authorities of its decisions\nat the national level and, should a national resolution authority not comply\nwith its decision, it could directly address decisions to banks.\n4.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision-making process\nPursuant to the Rulebook set out in Directive\n[ ], a bank would be placed into resolution when it is failing or likely to\nfail, when no private sector arrangement can avert failure, and when resolution\nis in the public interest because the bank is systemic in that its failure\nwould damage financial stability. The objective of resolution is to ensure the\ncontinuity of the bank\u2019s critical functions, to protect financial stability, to\nminimise reliance on taxpayers\u2019 money, and to protect depositors.\nResolution is triggered following a process\nensuring that a justified and impartial decision is taken in respect of any failing\nbank:\n\u2013     \nthe ECB, as bank supervisor, notifies that a\nbank is failing to Commission, to the Resolution Board and to the relevant\nnational authorities and ministries;\n\u2013     \nthe Resolution Board assesses if there is a\nsystemic threat and no private sector solution;\n\u2013     \nif so, the Resolution Board recommends to the Commission\nto initiate resolution;\n\u2013     \nthe Commission decides to initiate resolution\nand indicates to the Resolution Board the framework for applying the resolution\ntools and for using the Fund to support the resolution action. The Resolution\nBoard adopts, through a decision addressed to the national resolution\nauthorities, a resolution scheme setting out the resolution tools, actions, and\nfunding measures, and instructing the relevant national resolution authorities\nto execute the resolution measures;\n\u2013     \nthe national resolution authorities execute the\nresolution measures decided by the Board according to the national law. If the\nnational resolution authorities do not comply with the decisions of the Board,\nthe Board has the power to supersede the national resolution authorities and\naddress certain decisions for the implementation of the resolution measures\ndirectly to the banks.\n4.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accountability and budget\nEach individual component of the Single\nResolution Mechanism will be independent in the performance of its tasks and\nwill be subject to strict accountability provisions to ensure that it uses its\npowers in a correct and impartial way, within the boundaries set by this\nregulation and Directive [ ]. The Resolution Board will therefore be accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council\nfor any decisions taken on the basis of this proposal. The national Parliaments\nof the participating Member States will also be informed of the activities of\nthe Resolution Board. The Board will have to respond to any observations or\nquestions addressed to it by the national Parliaments of the participating\nMember States. The SRM budget, which includes the single resolution fund, is\nnot part of the Union budget. Expenditures relating to the SRM tasks, the\nmanagement and use of the Fund will be financed by contributions from the banking sector.\n4.1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relationship with non-participating\nMember States\nDirective [ ] establishes resolution\ncolleges among national resolution authorities for dealing with banking groups,\nensuring appropriate and balanced involvement of the resolution authorities of\nall the Member States where the bank operates. The EBA has a mediation role\nwhere home and host national resolution authorities are in disagreement on the\npreparation of resolution plans and on the resolution itself. Within the SRM\ncontext, for entities and groups established only within the SSM participating\nMember States, the SRM replaces the resolution colleges provided for in the Directive\n[ ] establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions\nand investment firms. Instead, representatives from national resolution\nauthorities are instead involved in the Resolution Board.\nFor banks established in non-participating\nMember States as defined by the SSM Regulation, Directive [ ] continues to\napply fully. Similarly, the interaction between the SRM and national resolution\nauthorities in non-participating Member States will be governed fully by Directive\n[ ]. Provisions on the interaction between different resolution funds\n(mutualisation and voluntary mutual borrowing and lending) also fully apply\nbetween the Single Resolution Fund and national resolution funds of\nnon-participating Member States. The proposal also clarifies that the role of\nthe EBA provided for by Directive [ ] and the EBA Regulation, including its\nmediation powers, will apply fully to the Resolution Board.\nIn addition, the proposal takes into\naccount the situation of banks which are established in Member States that do\nnot participate in the SRM in three ways.\nFirst, the proposal sets out the principle\nof non-discrimination by any of the SRM components against credit institutions,\ndeposit holders, investors or other creditors on grounds of their nationality\nor place of business.\nSecond, the proposal foresees that where a\ngroup includes credit institutions established in a participating Member State\nand in a non-participating Member State, the Board replaces the national\nresolution authorities of the participating Member States in the resolution\ncolleges provided for under Directive [ ].\nThird,\nnon-participating Member States have always the possibility to join the SSM,\nand thereby also ensure that banks established within their territory are\nsubject to the SRM.\n4.1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relationship with Directive\n[ ] of the European Parliament and of the Council of [ ] establishing a\nframework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment\nfirms\nWithin the Single Resolution Mechanism, the\nRulebook set out in Directive [ ] establishing a framework for the recovery and\nresolution of credit institutions and investment firms will apply to the\nparticipating Member States as it applies within the whole internal market.\nExceptions to this can only be made where the procedures or provisions provided\nfor in this Regulation supersede the relevant provisions of Directive [ ] (for\nexample provisions on cross-border colleges, which are superseded by the\ndecision-making within the SRM).\nThe SRM proposal integrates certain\nprovisions which are parallel to Directive [ ], as the Resolution Board and the\nCommission must base their actions on directly applicable Union law. Other\nprovisions of this proposal make specific cross-references to the Commission\nproposal on Directive [ ]. Some of these provisions have been amended by the\nreport voted by the European Parliament\u2019s ECON committee on May and by the\nCouncil\u2019s general approach of 26 June. The SRM regulation must ultimately be\nfully in line with the agreement on Directive [ ] found between the European\nParliament and the Council. This proposal refers to the Council general\napproach, as the latest available document. As the negotiations are on-going between\nthe European Parliament and the Council and the Directive is not yet finalised,\nthe objective of the Commission is to replace those substantial provisions with\nthe final outcome of the negotiations between the co-legislators on Directive [\n].\nFor certain aspects already covered by Directive\n[ ], a further alignment is indispensable for the proper functioning of an SRM\nwith a Single Bank Resolution Fund. First, the hierarchy of claims should be\nfully harmonised for resolution, based on the principle of depositor\npreference. Article 15 proposes to harmonise the hierarchy of claims in\nresolution, based on the principle of depositor preference. The Commission\nconsiders that such a harmonisation is necessary for all entities subject to Directive\n[ ], in order to ensure a level playing field within the internal market.\nSecond, within an SRM any flexibility for the use of bail in must be tightly\nframed and subject to the same conditions for all banks. Article 24 of the\nproposal therefore includes an additional tight framing, based on the general\napproach of the Council of 26 June 2013, and excludes in this context the use\nof any derogations provided for by Directive [ ] (in particular on the\ncalculation of the threshold for bail-in).\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Resolution Board\n4.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governance\nIn order to ensure an effective and\naccountable resolution decision-making\nprocess, the structure and operating rules of the Resolution Board provide for the appropriate involvement of\nall directly concerned Member States. The Board is\ncomposed of the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, the\nrepresentatives appointed by the Commission and the ECB, and the members\nappointed by each participating Member States, representing the national\nresolution authorities. The Board, chaired by an\nExecutive Director, will meet\nand operate in two sessions: an executive one and a plenary one. Observers\ncould be invited to attend the\nBoard meetings.\nIn its plenary session, the Board would\ntake all decisions of general nature. In its executive session, the Board takes\ndecisions in respect of individual entities or banking groups. Such decisions\nrange from resolution planning, early intervention powers to decisions on\nresolution schemes, including on the use of the Fund for financing the\nresolution process, and instructing the national resolution on how to implement\nthe resolution decisions.\nIn its executive session, the Board\ncomprises the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director and\nrepresentatives appointed by the Commission and the ECB.\nDepending on the banks or groups to be\nresolved in each case, when meeting in its executive session, the Board will\nalso convene in addition to the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive\nDirector and representatives appointed by the Commission and the ECB, members\nappointed by the relevant national resolution authorities. Therefore, in case of resolution of cross-border banking groups,\nboth the member appointed by the Member State in which the group level\nresolution authority is situated, and the members appointed by the Member\nStates in which subsidiaries or entities covered by consolidated supervision\nare established participate in the meetings and the decision-making process.\nThe voting rules applying to the Board take into account the need to consider\nthe interest of all Member States concerned by a resolution decision. None of\nthe participants in the deliberation has a veto.\nHowever in view of the sovereignty of\nMember States to decide on the use of national budgets, the proposal explicitly\nforesees that the SRM cannot require Member States to provide extraordinary\npublic support to any entity under resolution. Moreover, in order to take fully\ninto account any fiscal implications on Member States, the members appointed by\nthe relevant national resolution authorities in the Executive session of the\nBoard may request one further deliberation to discuss such potential\nimplications.\n4.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Powers\nThe Resolution Board centralises the information\nthat the ECB and national resolution authorities have on the financial\nsoundness of banks under their jurisdiction. Compared to a network of national\nauthorities operating within national mandates, this allows assessing better\nthe circumstances that might lead to the need to put a bank under resolution\nand avoid cross-border spill-overs. The proposal builds on the framework of the\nBank Recovery and Resolution Directive and empowers the Resolution Board to\nintervene promptly where the financial situation of a bank or group is\ndeteriorating.\nThe Resolution Board is vested with powers\nto determine when to recommend to the Commission to place a bank or a group\nunder resolution. Once the Commission decides that the conditions are met and\nplaces a bank under resolution, the Board decides within the framework\nestablished by the Commission the details of the resolution tools to be applied\nand how to allocate the Fund resources. Such powers allow the Resolution Board\nto select and apply the resolution tools, rules and procedures in a uniform\nmanner. In particular, where banks operate cross-border, this will lead to the\nelimination of the current divergences in Member States\u2019 rules and approaches,\ntogether with the negative consequences they have on the functioning of the\nUnion banking markets.\nSuch direct responsibility for the\nResolution Board will ensure an equal treatment of banks across the\nparticipating Member States and the predictability and confidence in the\nimplementation of the single Rulebook on bank resolution. This will increase\nlegal certainty and better preserve the value of financial assets by avoiding\nunnecessary disruptions in the flow of funds. It will also ensure that the\nassets of the failing institution are used in the most productive way to\nminimise losses for creditors across the participating Member States, and not\naccording to individual Member States\u2019 concerns.\nThe Resolution Board ensures that the\nresolution decisions are implemented faithfully by the national resolution\nauthorities, according to national law. For this purpose, the Board has the\npower to oversee and assess the implementation by the national resolution\nauthorities by the ability, where necessary, to obtain information directly\nfrom banks or to perform investigations or on-site inspections. Where a\nnational resolution authority does not implement a resolution decision\naccording to the agreed resolution scheme, the Board is empowered to directly\naddress certain decisions to the bank concerned requiring the necessary action\nfor the implementation of the resolution decision.\n4.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European and international\ncooperation\nFor the purpose of carrying out its tasks,\nthe Resolution Board will cooperate with the ECB and the other authorities\nempowered to supervise credit institutions within the SSM, as well as with\nother authorities which form part of the European System of Financial\nSupervision. The Resolution Board will also closely cooperate with the national\nresolution authorities as they play a key role in the preparation and implementation\nof resolution measures.\nAs many credit institutions operate not\nonly within the Union, but internationally, the Resolution Board will be\nexclusively empowered to conclude, on behalf of the national authorities of the\nparticipating Member States, non-binding cooperation agreements with third\ncountry authorities.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Single Bank Resolution\nFund\n4.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Principles,\nestablishment and missions\nThe principle underlying the action of the\nBoard is that any losses, costs or other expenses incurred in connection with\nthe use of the resolution tools shall be first borne by the shareholders and\nthe creditors of the institution under resolution and ultimately, if necessary,\nby the financial industry. However, even if the cost of the restructuring of an\ninstitution should be allocated to their internal resources, there needs to be\na mechanism enabling the institution (either in its original form, through a\nbridge bank or as an asset management vehicle \u2013 bad bank) to continue\noperating. It is therefore important to establish a bank resolution fund to\nensure the effectiveness of the resolution actions, such as providing short\nterm funding to an institution under resolution or guarantees to potential\nbuyers of an institution under resolution.\nThe primary objective of the Single\nResolution Fund is to ensure financial stability, rather than to absorb losses\nor provide capital to an institution under resolution. The Fund should not be\nconsidered as a bailout fund. There might be however exceptional circumstances\nwhere, after sufficiently having exhausted the internal resources (at least 8%\nof the liabilities and own funds of the institution under resolution), the\nprimary objective could not be achieved without allowing the Fund to absorb\nthose losses or provide the capital. It is only in these circumstances when the\nFund could act as a backstop to the private resources.\nThe creation of the Single Resolution Fund\nis primarily justified by the fact that in integrated financial markets any\nfinancial support to resolve a bank enhances the financial stability and the\nhealth of other banks not only in the Member State concerned, but also in other\nMember States. Since banks throughout participating Member States are indirect\nbeneficiaries of such support, contributions to finance the support should not\nbe limited to banks from a single Member State.\nIn terms of effectiveness, the Fund\u2019s\nability to pool the resources from all Euro-area banks provides a much more\neffective buffer against banking crises where losses are concentrated\nasymmetrically in some Member States and in this regard serves as a Euro\narea-wide insurance mechanism. The recent crisis showed that losses arose in a\ndifferentiated manner in the Member States.\nSince losses from any future shocks in the\nbanking industry are likely to be concentrated at a specific moment of time in\nsome Member States, a common European private backstop mechanism, as opposed to\nnational backstops taken individually, will be more effective in absorbing such\nshocks through ex-ante and, in extreme cases, ex post contributions from the\nwhole Euro-area banking industry. Therefore, by pooling\nresources at the European level, the Fund will provide a bigger \u201cfirepower\u201d and\nwill increase the resilience of the banking system. At the same time, spreading\nextraordinary ex-post contributions evenly across banks in all participating\nMember States will reduce the level of such contributions for each bank,\nlimiting any pro-cyclical effect of such contributions.\nMoreover, a mechanism where loss absorption\nreaches beyond national borders can effectively break the vicious circle of the\ninterdependence between the banking crisis in a given Member State and the\nfiscal position of the sovereign. In this manner, the current burden on some\nMember States would have been mitigated if a Single Resolution Fund had existed\nsince the start of the financial crisis.\nFurthermore, a Single Resolution Fund\nhaving the ability to pool funds from the banking industry across the\nparticipating Member States will rely on a larger contribution base and\ntherefore will have an increased reputational base allowing the Board, if\nneeded, to borrow more on the market and at a lower cost. A greater ability to\nobtain finance externally on the market will reduce the need for the Fund to\nrely on public finances in extreme loss cases, which would further contribute\nto breaking the link between sovereigns and banks and to protecting taxpayers\nfrom the costs of resolution.\nFinally, the proper alignment of incentives\nacross the institutions of the Banking Union also calls for a single fund. If,\nespecially in the case of cross-border banking groups, the means for covering\nthe costs of resolution in excess of those absorbed by shareholders and\ncreditors had to be provided by national funds, the effectiveness of not only\nthe Single Resolution Mechanism but also of the Single Supervisory Mechanism\nwould be impaired.\nThe establishment of a Single Resolution\nMechanism requires that the Resolution Board have swift and effective access to\na Single Bank Resolution Fund. The Fund creates a private external layer which\ncan provide mid and long-term funding to avoid or minimise the use of public\nmoney in resolving banks. Moreover, it increases the effectiveness of the\nresolution process by preventing coordination issues that arise in the\ndeployment of national funds, especially in the case of cross-border groups.\n4.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financing\nof the Fund\nTo ensure sufficient funding, avoid the\npro-cyclicality of pay-as-you go systems and minimise the need to request\nexternal financial support, the Fund needs readily available resources. To this end, the target size of\nthe Fund should be at least 1% of covered deposits in the banking system of the\nparticipating Member States would be sufficient to ensure an orderly resolution\nin the future crisis provided that creditors are bailed in at least up to 8% of\nthe total liabilities and own funds of the institution under resolution.\nOn the basis of 2011 data on banks and an\nestimated amount of covered deposits held in banks in the euro-area, the 1%\ntarget level for the Single Resolution Fund would correspond to around 55\nbillion Euros. The target size of the Fund in absolute amounts (Euros) will\nremain dynamic and will increase automatically if the banking industry grows.\nA transitional period of 10 years is\nforeseen before the Fund reaches its full target level. This could be extended\nto 14 years if the Fund makes disbursements exceeding half of the target size\nof the Fund. If no disbursements are made from the Fund during the initial\nbuild-up phase, the banking industry would annually contribute around one tenth\nof the target amount or in absolute terms around 5.5 billion Euros.\nAfter the initial phase to build-up the\nFund, banks will be subject to additional contributions if their contribution\nbasis grows or there are disbursements from the Fund. If available financial\nmeans of the Fund become lower than half of its target size, banks will become\nsubject to a minimum annual contribution of at least one fifth of the total\nliabilities (excluding regulatory capital and covered deposits) of all banks in\nMember States participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism.\nThe contributions will be calculated in\nline with the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive on the basis of bank\u2019s liabilities excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted to their risk profile. This means that banks which are financed almost exclusively by\ndeposits will in practice have very low contributions. Of course, these banks will\ncontribute to national deposit guarantee schemes.\nSafeguards are foreseen in order to avoid\nthat levying of contributions create financial stability issues in healthy\ninstitutions, i.e. temporary exemption from the obligation to pay ex-post\ncontributions.\nWhere the ex-ante contributions are\nnot sufficient and the ex-post contributions not immediately accessible,\nadditional backup funding may be needed, especially in the transitional phase,\nto ensure the continuity of systemic functions of the bank(s) throughout the\nrestructuring process. The Fund will be able to contract borrowings or other\nforms of support from financial institutions or other third parties if\nnecessary to finance resolution (including from the public resources). This\nsupport will be paid back in principle by the institution under resolution\nitself. However, should this be not possible, the Regulation foresees that the\nlosses are allocated to all the banks subject to the mechanism by ex-post\ncontributions. This will ensure that any use of public resources is neutral in\nthe medium term.\nTo avoid creating a disadvantage for the\nMember States that have put in place a resolution fund upon the entry into\nforce of this proposal, the Regulation leaves it up to the Member States\nconcerned to decide in which manner the existing national resolution funds\nwould be used for the purpose of fulfilling their banks\u2019 obligations under this\nRegulation.\n4.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Role\nof deposit guarantee schemes in the context of\nresolution\nWhere a bank is resolved, the national\ndeposit guarantee scheme to which the bank is affiliated will contribute, up to\nthe amount of covered deposits, for the amount of losses that it would have had\nto bear if the bank had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. This\nis a role already fully provided for by Directive [ ].\nMoreover, the SRM does not affect\nInstitutional Protection Schemes and other intragroup financing support\nmechanisms set up by certain groups of credit institutions. The SRM will only\nintervene when such private sector solutions are not successful in dealing with\na bank failure.\n4.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Role of the Fund in the\nresolution of groups involving institutions outside the SRM\nFor the purpose of resolution of groups\ninvolving both institutions subject to the SRM, the Fund\u2019s contribution will\ncorrespond to the parts of the group that are subject to the SRM, while the\nnational financing arrangements outside the SRM contribution will cover the\nrest.\nTo strengthen the resolution funding\nthroughout the internal market, the proposal allows the Fund to borrow from or\nlend to other resolution financing arrangements, on a voluntary basis. This\nwill allow the Fund to bear important disbursements not covered by ex-ante\nand ex-post contributions. It will also support resolution financing arrangements\nin Member States outside the SRM.\n4.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replacement of national\nresolution financing arrangements\nAs the Fund\nreplaces the national resolution financing arrangements of the Member States\nparticipating in it, Member States which have already established national\nresolution financing arrangements at the time of entry into force of this\nRegulation may decide upon the use of such arrangements according to their\nnational law. Member States could also decide that those national resolution\nfinancing arrangements pay the contributions due to the Fund on behalf of their\nbanks until those arrangements fully depleted.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe Resolution Board will be fully financed from contributions from the financial institutions. However,\nthere will be some minor implications on the Union\u2019s budget in the start-up\nphase of the Board. The details are set out in the financial statement\nattached. \n2013/0253 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing uniform rules and a uniform\nprocedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment\nfirms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Bank\nResolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU) \nNo 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Central Bank[11],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[12],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having a better integrated\ninternal market for banking services is essential in order to foster economic\nrecovery in the Union. However, the current financial and economic crisis has\nshown that the functioning of the internal market in this area is under threat\nand that there is an increasing risk of financial fragmentation. Interbank\nmarkets have become less liquid and cross-border bank activities are decreasing\ndue to fear of contagion, lack of confidence in other national banking systems\nand in the ability of Member States to support banks.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Divergences in national\nresolution rules between different Member States and corresponding\nadministrative practices and the lack of a unified decision making process at\nUnion level for the resolution of cross-border banks contribute to this lack of\nconfidence and market instability, as they do not ensure certainty and\npredictability as to the possible outcome of a bank failure. Resolution\ndecisions taken at the national level only may lead to distortions of\ncompetition and ultimately to the undermining of the internal market.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, the\ndifferent practices of Member States in the treatment of creditors of banks in\nresolution and in the bail-out of failing banks have an impact on the perceived\ncredit risk, financial soundness and solvency of their banks. This undermines\npublic confidence in the banking sector and obstructs the exercise of the\nfreedom of establishment and the free provision of services within the internal\nmarket because financing costs would be lower without such differences in\npractices of Member States.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Divergences in national\nresolution rules between different Member States and corresponding\nadministrative practices may lead banks and customers to have higher borrowing\ncosts only because of their place of establishment and irrespective of their\nreal creditworthiness. In addition, customers of banks in some Member States\nface higher borrowing rates than customers of banks in others irrespective of\ntheir own creditworthiness.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As long as resolution\nrules, practices and approaches to burden-sharing remain national and the\nfinancial resources needed for funding resolution are raised and spent at\nnational level, the internal market will remain fragmented. Moreover, national\nsupervisors have strong incentives to minimise the potential impact of bank\ncrises on their national economies by adopting unilateral action to ring-fence\nbanking operations, for instance by limiting intra-group transfers and lending,\nor by imposing higher liquidity and capital requirements on subsidiaries in\ntheir jurisdictions of potentially failing parent undertakings. This restricts\nthe cross-border activities of banks and thus creates obstacles to the exercise\nof fundamental freedoms and distorts competition in the internal market.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive [ ] of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[13]\nhas harmonised to a certain extent national bank resolution rules and has\nprovided for cooperation among resolution authorities when dealing with the\nfailure of cross-border banks. However, the harmonisation provided by the Directive\n[ ] is not complete and the decision making process is not centralised. Directive\n[ ] essentially provides for common resolution tools and powers available for\nthe national authorities of every Member State but leaves discretion to\nnational authorities in the application of the tools and in the use of national\nfinancing arrangements in support of resolution procedures. Directive [ ] does\nnot avoid the taking of separate and potentially inconsistent decisions by\nMember States regarding the resolution of cross-border groups which may affect\nthe overall costs of resolution. Moreover, as it provides for national\nfinancing arrangements, it does not sufficiently reduce the dependence of banks\non the support from national budgets and does not prevent different approaches\nby Member States to the use of the financing arrangements.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring effective uniform\nresolution decisions for failing banks within the Union, including on the use\nof funding raised at Union level, is essential for the completion of the internal\nmarket in financial services. Within the internal market, the failure of banks\nin one Member State may affect the stability of the financial markets of the\nwhole Union. Ensuring effective and uniform resolution rules and equal\nconditions of resolution financing across Member States is in the best interest\nnot only of the Member States in which banks operate, but also of all Member\nStates in general as a means to preserve competition and improve the\nfunctioning of the internal market. Banking systems in the internal market are\nhighly interconnected, bank groups are international and banks have a large\npercentage of foreign assets. In the absence of a single resolution mechanism,\nbank crises in Member States participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism\n(SSM) would have stronger negative systemic impact also in non-participating\nMember States. The establishment of the single resolution mechanism will\nincrease stability of the banks of the participating Member States and prevent the\nspill-over of crises into non-participating Member States and will thus\nfacilitate the functioning of the whole of the internal market.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the\nestablishment of the SSM by Council Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [14] where banks in the\nparticipating Member States are centrally supervised by the European Central\nBank (ECB), there is a misalignment between the Union supervision of such banks\nand the national treatment of those banks in the resolution proceedings pursuant\nto Directive [ ].\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst banks in Member\nStates remaining outside the SSM benefit at national level from supervision,\nresolution and financial backstop arrangements which are aligned, banks in\nMember States participating in the SSM are subject to Union arrangements for\nsupervision and national arrangements for resolution and financial backstops.\nThis misalignment creates a competitive disadvantage for the banks in the\nMember States participating in the SSM compared to those in the other Member\nStates. Because supervision and resolution are at two different levels within\nthe SSM, intervention and resolution in banks in the Member States\nparticipating in the SSM would not be as rapid, consistent and effective as in\nbanks in the Member States outside of the SSM. This has negative repercussions\non the funding costs for these banks and creates a competitive disadvantage\nwith detrimental effects for the Member States in which those banks operate and\nfor the overall functioning of the internal market. Therefore, a centralised\nresolution mechanism for all banks operating in the Member States participating\nin the SSM is essential to guarantee a level playing field.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sharing of resolution\nresponsibilities between the national and the Union levels should be aligned to\nthe sharing of supervision responsibilities between those levels. As long as\nsupervision remains national in a Member State, that Member State should remain\nresponsible for the financial consequences of a bank failure. The single\nresolution mechanism should therefore only extend to banks and financial\ninstitutions established in Member States participating in the SSM and subject\nto the supervision of the ECB within the framework of the SSM. Banks\nestablished in the Member States not participating in the SSM should not be\nsubject to the single resolution mechanism. If such Member States became\nsubject to the single resolution mechanism, this would create the wrong\nincentives for them. In particular, supervisors in these Member States may\nbecome more lenient towards banks in their jurisdictions as they would not have\nto bear the full financial risk of their failures. Therefore, in order to\nensure parallelism with the SSM, the single resolution mechanism should apply\nto Member States participating in the SSM. As Member States join the SSM, they\nshould also automatically become subject to the single resolution mechanism.\nUltimately, the single resolution mechanism is expected to extend to the entire\ninternal market.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A single bank resolution\nfund (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Fund\u2019) is an essential element without\nwhich a single resolution mechanism could not work properly. Different systems\nof national funding would distort the application of uniform bank resolution\nrules in the internal market. The Fund should help to ensure a uniform\nadministrative practice in the financing of resolution and to avoid the\ncreation of obstacles for the exercise of fundamental freedoms or the distortion\nof competition in the internal market due to divergent national practices. The\nFund should be financed directly by banks and should be pooled at Union level\nso that the resolution resources can be objectively allocated across Member\nStates thus increasing financial stability and limiting the link between the\nperceived fiscal position of individual Member States and the funding costs of\nbanks and undertakings operating in those Member States.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore necessary\nto adopt measures to create a single resolution mechanism for all Member States\nparticipating in the single supervisory mechanism in order to facilitate the\nproper and stable functioning of the internal market.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A centralised application\nof the bank resolution rules set out in Directive [ ] by a single Union\nresolution authority in the participating Member States can only be ensured\nwhere the rules governing the establishment and functioning of a single\nresolution mechanism are directly applicable in the Member States to avoid\ndivergent interpretations across the Member States. This should bring benefits\nto the internal market as a whole because it will contribute to ensuring fair\ncompetition and to preventing obstacles to the free exercise of fundamental\nfreedoms not only in the participating Member States but in the whole internal\nmarket.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mirroring the scope of the\nCouncil Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026, a single resolution mechanism should cover all\ncredit institutions established in the participating Member States. However,\nwithin the framework of a single resolution mechanism, it should be possible to\nresolve directly any credit institution of a participating Member State in\norder to avoid asymmetries within the internal market in the treatment of\nfailing institutions and creditors during a resolution process. To the extent that\nparent undertakings, investment firms and financial institutions are included\nin the consolidated supervision by the ECB, they should be included in the\nscope of the single resolution mechanism. Although the ECB will not supervise\nthose institutions on a solo basis, it will be the only supervisor that will\nhave a global perception of the risk to which a group, and indirectly the\nindividual members, is exposed to. To exclude entities which form part of the\nconsolidated supervision within the scope of the ECB from the scope of the\nsingle resolution mechanism would make it impossible to plan for the resolution\nof banking groups and to adopt a group resolution strategy, and would make any\nresolution decisions much less effective.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the single resolution\nmechanism, decisions should be taken at the most appropriate level.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECB, as the supervisor\nwithin the SSM, is the best placed to assess whether a credit institution is\nfailing or likely to fail and whether there is no reasonable prospect that any\nalternative private sector or supervisory action would prevent its failure\nwithin a reasonable timeframe. The Board, upon notification of the ECB, should\nprovide a recommendation to the Commission. Given the need to balance the\ndifferent interests at stake the Commission should decide whether or not to\nplace an institution under resolution and should also decide on a clear and\ndetailed resolution framework establishing the resolution actions to be taken\nby the Board. Within this framework, the Board should decide on a resolution\nscheme and instruct the national resolution authorities on the resolution tools\nand powers to be executed at national level.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board should be\nempowered to take decisions, in particular, in connection with resolution planning,\nthe assessment of resolvability, the removal of impediments to resolvability\nand the preparation of resolution actions. National resolution authorities\nshould assist the Board in resolution planning and in the preparation of\nresolution decisions. In addition, as the exercise of resolution powers\ninvolves the application of national law, national resolution authorities\nshould be responsible for the implementation of resolution decisions.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is instrumental for the\ngood functioning of the internal market that the same rules apply to all\nresolution measures, regardless of whether they are taken by national\nresolution authorities under Directive [ ] or within the framework of the\nsingle resolution mechanism The Commission will assess those measures under\nArticle 107 of the TFEU. Where the use of resolution financing arrangements\ndoes not involve State aid pursuant to Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, the\nCommission should, in order to ensure a level playing field within the internal\nmarket, assess those measures by analogy to Art 107 of the TFEU. If a\nnotification under Article 108 of the TFEU is not necessary as no state aid\npursuant to Article 107 of the TFEU is entailed in the proposed use of the Fund\nby the Board, in order to ensure the integrity of the internal market between\nparticipating and non-participating Member States, the Commission should apply\nthe relevant State aid rules under Article 107 of the TFEU by way of analogy\nwhen assessing the proposed use of the Fund. The Board should not decide on a\nresolution scheme until the Commission has ensured, by way of analogy with\nState aid rules, that the use of the Fund follows the same rules as\ninterventions by national financing arrangements.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a swift\nand effective decision making process in resolution, the Board should be a specific\nUnion agency with a specific structure, corresponding to its specific tasks,\nand which departs from the model of all other agencies of the Union. Its\ncomposition should ensure that due account is taken of all relevant interests\nat stake in resolution procedures. The Board should operate in executive and\nplenary sessions. In its executive session, it should be composed of an\nExecutive Director, a Deputy Executive Director, and representatives of the Commission\nand the ECB. Considering the missions of the Board, the Executive Director and\nDeputy Executive Director should be appointed by the Council on a proposal from\nthe Commission and after hearing the European Parliament. When deliberating on\nthe resolution of a bank or group established within a single participating\nMember State, the executive session of the Board should also convene and\ninvolve in the decision-making process the member appointed by the Member State\nconcerned representing its national resolution authority. When deliberating on\na cross-border group, the members appointed by the home and all host Member\nStates concerned representing the relevant national resolution authorities\nshould also be convened and involved in the decision-making process of the\nexecutive session of the Board. However, home authorities and host authorities\nshould have a balanced influence on the decision, so host authorities should\nhave jointly one single vote. Observers, including a representative of the ESM\nand of the Euro Group, may also be invited to attend the meetings of the Board.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the Board\u2019s\nmissions and the resolution objectives which include the protection of public\nfunds, the functioning of the Board should be financed from contributions paid\nby the institutions in the participating Member States.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board and the\nCommission, where relevant, should replace the national resolution authorities\ndesignated under Directive [ ] in respect of all aspects related to the\nresolution decision-making process. The national resolution authorities\ndesignated under Directive [ ] should continue to carry out activities related\nto the implementation of resolution schemes adopted by the Board. In order to\nensure transparency and democratic control, as well as to safeguard the rights\nof the Union institutions, the Board should be accountable to the European\nParliament and to the Council for any decisions taken on the basis of this\nproposal. For the same reasons of transparency and democratic control, national\nparliaments should have certain rights to obtain information about the\nactivities of the Board and to engage in a dialogue with it.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Directive [ ] provides\nfor the possibility of applying simplified obligations or waivers by the\nnational resolution authorities in relation to the requirement of drafting\nresolution plans, a procedure should be provided for whereby the Board could\nauthorise the application of such simplified obligations.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure a uniform\napproach for institutions and groups the Board should be empowered to draw up\nresolution plans for such institutions and groups. The Board should assess the\nresolvability of institutions and groups, and take measures aimed at removing\nimpediments to resolvability, if any. The Board should require national\nresolution authorities to apply such appropriate measures designed to remove\nimpediments to resolvability in order to ensure consistency and the\nresolvability of the institutions concerned.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resolution planning is an\nessential component of effective resolution. The Board should therefore have\nthe power to require changes to the structure and organization of institutions\nor groups in order to remove practical impediments to the application of\nresolution tools and ensure the resolvability of the entities concerned. Due to\nthe potentially systemic nature of all institutions, it is crucial in order to\nmaintain financial stability that authorities have the possibility to resolve\nany institution. In order to respect the right to conduct business laid down by\nArticle 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Board's discretion should\nbe limited to what is necessary to simplify the structure and operations of the\ninstitution solely to improve its resolvability. In addition, any measure imposed\nfor such purposes should be consistent with Union law. Measures should neither\ndirectly nor indirectly be discriminatory on ground of nationality, and should\nbe justified by the overriding reason of the public interest in financial\nstability. To determine whether an action was taken in the general public\ninterest, the Board, acting in the general public interest, should be able to\nachieve the resolution objectives without encountering impediments to the\napplication of resolution tools or its ability to exercise the powers conferred\non it. Furthermore, an action should not go beyond the minimum necessary to\nattain the objectives.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The single resolution\nmechanism should be constructed on the frameworks of Directive [ ] and the SSM.\nTherefore, the Board should be empowered to intervene at an early stage where\nthe financial situation or the solvency of an institution is deteriorating. The\ninformation that the Board receives from the national resolution authorities or\nthe ECB at this stage is instrumental in making a determination on the action\nit might take in order to prepare for the resolution of the institution\nconcerned.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure rapid\nresolution action when it becomes necessary, the Board should closely monitor,\nin cooperation with the relevant competent authority or the ECB, the situation\nof the institutions concerned and the compliance of those institutions with any\nearly intervention measure taken in their respect.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise\ndisruption to the financial market and to the economy, the resolution process\nshould be accomplished in a short time. The Commission should, throughout the\nresolution procedure, have access to any information which it deems necessary\nto take an informed decision in the resolution process. Where the Commission\ndecides to put an institution under resolution, the Board should immediately\nadopt a resolution scheme establishing the details of the resolution tools and\npowers to be applied, and the use of any financing arrangements.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Liquidation of a failing\ninstitution under normal insolvency proceedings could jeopardise financial\nstability, interrupt the provision of essential services, and affect the\nprotection of depositors. In such a case there is a public interest in applying\nresolution tools. The objectives of resolution should therefore be to ensure\nthe continuity of essential financial services, to maintain the stability of\nthe financial system, to reduce moral hazard by minimising reliance on public\nfinancial support to failing institutions, and to protect depositors.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the winding up of\nan insolvent institution through normal insolvency proceedings should always be\nconsidered before a decision could be taken to maintain the institution as a\ngoing concern. An insolvent institution should be maintained as a going concern\nfor financial stability purposes and with the use, to the extent possible, of\nprivate funds. That may be achieved\neither through sale to or merger with a private sector purchaser, or after\nhaving written down the liabilities of the institution, or after having\nconverted its debt to equity in order to do a recapitalisation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When exercising resolution\npowers, the Commission and the Board should make sure that shareholders and\ncreditors bear an appropriate share of the losses, that the managers are\nreplaced, that the costs of the resolution of the institution are minimised,\nand that all creditors of an insolvent institution that are of the same class are\ntreated in a similar manner.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The limitations on the\nrights of shareholders and creditors should comply with Article 52 of the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution tools should therefore be applied\nonly to those institutions that are failing or likely to fail, and only when it\nis necessary to pursue the objective of financial stability in the general\ninterest. In particular, resolution tools should be applied where the\ninstitution cannot be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings without\ndestabilizing the financial system and the measures are necessary in order to\nensure the rapid transfer and continuation of systemically important functions\nand where there is no reasonable prospect for any alternative private solution,\nincluding any increase of capital by the existing shareholders or by any third\nparty sufficient to restore the full viability of the institution.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interference with property\nrights should not be disproportionate. As a consequence, affected shareholders\nand creditors should not incur greater losses than those which they would have\nincurred had the institution been wound up at the time that the resolution\ndecision is taken. In the event of partial transfer of assets of an institution\nunder resolution to a private purchaser or to a bridge institution, the\nresidual part of the institution under resolution should be wound up under\nnormal insolvency proceedings. In order to protect existing shareholders and\ncreditors of the institution during the winding up proceedings, they should be\nentitled to receive in payment of their claims not less than what it is\nestimated they would have recovered if the whole institution had been wound up\nunder normal insolvency proceedings.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to protect the\nright of shareholders and ensure that creditors do not receive less than what\nthey would receive in normal insolvency proceedings, clear obligations should\nbe laid down concerning the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the\ninstitution and sufficient time should be allowed to estimate properly the\ntreatment that they would have received if the institution had been wound up\nunder normal insolvency proceedings. There should be the possibility to start\nsuch a valuation already in the early intervention phase. Before any resolution\naction is taken, an estimate should be carried out of the value of the assets\nand liabilities of the institution and of the treatment that shareholders and\ncreditors would receive under normal insolvency proceedings.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important that losses\nbe recognised upon failure of the institution. The guiding principle for the valuation\nof assets and liabilities of failing institutions should be their market value\nat the moment when the resolution tools are applied and to the extent that\nmarkets are functioning properly. When markets are truly dysfunctional,\nvaluation should be performed at the duly justified long term economic value of\nassets and liabilities. It should be possible, for reasons of urgency, that the\nBoard makes a rapid provisional valuation of the assets or liabilities of a\nfailing institution which should apply until an independent valuation is\ncarried out.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as to ensure that the\nresolution process remains objective and certain, it is necessary to lay down\nthe order in which unsecured claims of creditors against an institution put\nunder resolution should be written down or converted. In order to limit the\nrisk of creditors incurring greater losses than if the institution had been\nwound up under normal insolvency proceedings, the order to be laid down should\nbe applicable both in normal insolvency proceedings and in the write down or\nconversion process under resolution. This would also facilitate the pricing of\ndebt.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nprovide the framework for the resolution action to be taken depending on the\ncircumstances of the case and should be able to designate for use all necessary\nresolution tools. Within that clear and precise framework, the Board should\ndecide on the detailed resolution scheme. The relevant resolution tools should\ninclude the sale of business tool, the bridge institution tool, the bail-in\ntool and the asset separation tool, which are also provided for by Directive [\n]. The framework should also make it possible to assess whether the conditions\nfor the write-down and conversion of capital instruments are met.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sale of business tool\nshould enable the sale of the institution or parts of its business to one or\nmore purchasers without the consent of shareholders.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The asset separation tool\nshould enable authorities to transfer under-performing or impaired assets to a\nseparate vehicle. That tool should be used only in conjunction with other tools\nto prevent an undue competitive advantage for the failing institution.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An effective resolution\nregime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a failing institution\nborne by the taxpayers. It should also ensure that even large institutions of\nsystemic importance can be resolved without jeopardising financial stability.\nThe bail-in tool achieves that objective by ensuring that shareholders and\ncreditors of the entity suffer appropriate losses and bear an appropriate part\nof those costs. To this end, statutory debt write down powers should be\nincluded in a framework for resolution as an additional option in conjunction\nwith other resolution tools, as recommended by the Financial Stability Board.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nnecessary flexibility to allocate losses to creditors in a range of\ncircumstances, it is appropriate that the bail-in tool be applicable both where\nthe objective is to resolve the failing institution as a going concern if there\nis a realistic prospect that the institution\u2019s viability may be restored, and\nwhere systemically important services are transferred to a bridge institution\nand the residual part of the institution ceases to operate and is wound up.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the bail-in tool is\napplied with the objective of restoring the capital of the failing institution\nto enable it to continue to operate as a going concern, resolution through\nbail-in should always be accompanied by the replacement of management and a\nsubsequent restructuring of the institution and its activities in a way that\naddresses the reasons for its failure. That restructuring should be achieved\nthrough the implementation of a business reorganisation plan.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is not appropriate to\napply the bail-in tool to claims in so far as they are secured, collateralised\nor otherwise guaranteed. However, in order to ensure that the bail-in tool is\neffective and achieves its objectives, it should be possible to apply it to as\nwide a range of the unsecured liabilities of a failing institution as possible.\nNevertheless, it is appropriate to exclude certain kinds of unsecured liability\nfrom the scope of application of the bail-in tool. For reasons of public policy\nand effective resolution, the bail-in tool should not apply to those deposits\nthat are protected under Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council[15],\nto liabilities to employees of the failing institution or to commercial claims\nthat relate to goods and services necessary for the daily functioning of the\ninstitution.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Depositors that hold\ndeposits guaranteed by a deposit guarantee scheme should not be subject to the\nexercise of the bail-in tool. The deposit guarantee scheme, however,\ncontributes to funding the resolution process to the extent that it would have\nhad to indemnify the depositors. The exercise of the bail-in powers would\nensure that depositors continue having access to their deposits which is the\nmain reason why the deposit guarantee schemes have been established. Not\nproviding for the involvement of those schemes in such cases would constitute\nan unfair advantage with respect to the other creditors which would be subject\nto the exercise of the powers by the resolution authority.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to implement the\nburden-sharing by shareholders and junior creditors, as required under State\naid rules, the single resolution mechanism would be able to apply, by way of\nanalogy, as of the entry into application of this Regulation, the bail-in tool.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid institutions\nstructuring their liabilities in a manner that impedes the effectiveness of the\nbail in tool, the Board should be able to establish that the institutions hold\nan aggregate amount of own funds, subordinated debt and senior liabilities\nsubject to the bail-in tool expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities\nof the institution, that do not qualify as own funds for the purposes of\nRegulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[16] and of Directive 2013/36/EU of\n26 June 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[17], which institutions should\nhave at all times.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The best method of\nresolution should be chosen depending on the circumstances of the case and for\nthis purpose, all the resolution tools provided for by Directive [ ] should be\navailable.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive [ ] has conferred\nthe power to write down and convert capital instruments on national resolution\nauthorities, since the conditions for the write-down and conversion of capital\ninstruments may coincide with the conditions for resolution and in such a case,\nan assessment is to be made of whether the sole write-down and conversion of\nthe capital instruments is sufficient to restore the financial soundness of the\nentity concerned or it is also necessary to take resolution action. As a rule,\nit will be used in the context of resolution. The Commission should replace\nnational resolution authorities also in this function and should therefore be\nempowered to assess whether the conditions for the write-down and conversion of\ncapital instruments are met and to decide whether to place an entity under\nresolution, if the requirements for resolution are also fulfilled.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The efficiency and\nuniformity of resolution action should be ensured in all the participating\nMember States. For this purpose, the Board should be empowered in exceptional\ncases and where a national resolution authority has not or not sufficiently\napplied the decision of the Board to transfer to another person specified\nrights, assets or liabilities of an institution under resolution or to require\nthe conversion of debt instruments which contain a contractual term for\nconversion in certain circumstances. Any action by national resolution\nauthorities that would restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of\nthe Board should be excluded.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to enhance the\neffectiveness of the single resolution mechanism, the Board should closely\ncooperate with the European Banking Authority in all circumstances. Where\nappropriate the Board should also cooperate with the European Securities and\nMarkets Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority\nand the European Systemic Risk Board, and the other authorities which form part\nof the European System of Financial Supervision. Moreover, the Board should\nclosely cooperate with the ECB and the other authorities empowered to supervise\ncredit institutions within the SSM, in particular for groups subject to the\nconsolidated supervision by the ECB. To effectively manage the resolution\nprocess of failing banks, the Board should cooperate with the national\nresolution authorities at all stages of the resolution process. Thus,\ncooperation with the latter is necessary not only for the implementation of\nresolution decisions taken by the Board, but also prior to the adoption of any\nresolution decision, at the stage of resolution planning or during the phase of\nearly intervention.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the Board replaces\nnational resolution authorities of the participating Member States in their\nresolution decisions, the Board should also replace those authorities for the\npurposes of the cooperation with non-participating Member States as far as the\nresolution functions are concerned. In particular, the Board should represent\nall authorities from the participating Members in the resolution colleges\nincluding authorities from non-participating Member States.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As many institutions\noperate not only within the Union, but internationally, an effective resolution\nmechanism needs to set out principles of cooperation with the relevant third\ncountry authorities. Support to third country authorities should be provided in\naccordance with the legal framework provided by Article 88 of Directive [ ].\nFor this purpose, as the Board should be the single authority empowered to\nresolve failing banks in the participating Member States, the Board should be\nexclusively empowered to conclude non-binding cooperation agreements with those\nthird country authorities, on behalf of the national authorities of the\nparticipating Member States.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to carry out its\ntasks effectively, the Board should have appropriate investigatory powers. It\nshould be able to require all necessary information either directly or through\nnational resolution authorities, and to conduct investigations and on-site inspections,\nwhere appropriate in cooperation with national competent authorities. In the\ncontext of resolution, on-site inspections would be available for the Board to\neffectively monitor implementation by national authorities and to ensure that\nthe Commission and the Board take their decisions on the basis of fully\naccurate information.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as to ensure that the\nBoard has access to all relevant information, the employees should not be able\nto invoke professional secrecy rules to prevent the disclosure of information\nto the Board.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\ndecisions adopted within the framework of the single resolution mechanism are\nrespected, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions should be imposed in case of\ninfringement. The Board should be entitled to instruct national resolution\nauthorities to impose fines or periodic penalty payments on undertakings for\nfailure to comply with obligations under its decisions. In order to ensure\nconsistent, efficient and effective enforcement practices the Board should be\nentitled to issue guidelines addressed to national resolution authorities\nconcerning the application of fines and penalty payments.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a national resolution\nauthority infringes the rules of the single resolution mechanism by not using\nthe powers conferred on it under national law to implement an instruction by\nthe Board, the Member State concerned may be liable to make good any damage\ncaused to individuals, including where applicable to the entity or group under\nresolution, or any creditor of any part of that entity or group in any Member\nState, in accordance with that case law.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appropriate rules should be\nlaid down governing the budget of the Board, the preparation of the budget, the\nadoption of internal rules specifying the procedure for the establishment and\nimplementation of its budget, and the internal and external audit of the\naccounts.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are circumstances\nwhen the effectiveness of the resolution tools applied may depend on the\navailability of short-term funding for the institution or a bridge institution,\nthe provision of guarantees to potential purchasers, or the provision of\ncapital to the bridge institution. It is therefore important to set up a fund\nto avoid that public funds are used for such purposes.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\nthat the Fund is fully available for the purpose of the resolution of failing\ninstitutions. Therefore, the Fund should not be used for any other purpose than\nthe efficient implementation of resolution tools and powers. Furthermore, it\nshould be used only in accordance with the applicable resolution objectives and\nprinciples. Accordingly, the Board should ensure that any losses, costs or\nother expenses incurred in connection with the use of the resolution tools are\nfirst borne by the shareholders and the creditors of the institution under\nresolution. It is only if the resources from shareholders and creditors are\nexhausted, that the losses, costs or other expenses incurred with the\nresolution tools should be borne by the Fund.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a rule, contributions\nshould be collected from the financial industry prior to and independently of\nany operation of resolution. When prior funding is insufficient to cover the\nlosses or costs incurred by the use of the Fund, additional contributions\nshould be collected to bear the additional cost or loss. Moreover, the Fund\nshould be able to contract borrowings or other forms of support from financial\ninstitutions or other third parties where its available funds are not\nsufficient to cover the losses, costs and other expenses incurred by the use of\nthe Fund and the extraordinary ex post contributions are not immediately\naccessible.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reach a\ncritical mass and to avoid pro-cyclical effects which would arise if the Fund\nhad to rely solely on ex post contributions in a systemic crisis, it is\nindispensable that the ex-ante available financial means of the Fund amount to\na certain target level.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An appropriate time frame\nshould be set to reach the target funding level for the Fund. However, it\nshould be possible for the Board to adjust the contribution period to take into\naccount significant disbursements made from the Fund.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where participating Member\nStates have already established national resolution financing arrangements,\nthey should be able to provide that the national resolution financing\narrangements use their available financial means, collected from institutions\nin the past by way of ex-ante contributions, to compensate institutions for the\nex-ante contributions which those institutions should pay into the Fund. Such\nrestitution should be without prejudice to the obligations of Member States\nunder Directive 94/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[18].\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure a fair\ncalculation of contributions and provide incentives to operate under a model\nwhich presents less risk, contributions to the Fund should take account of the\ndegree of risk incurred by credit institutions.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nproper sharing of resolution costs between deposit guarantee schemes and the\nFund, the deposit guarantee scheme to which an institution under resolution is\naffiliated may be liable, up to the amount of covered deposits, for the amount\nof losses that it would have had to bear if the institution had been wound up\nunder normal insolvency proceedings.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as to protect the value\nof the amounts held in the Fund, these amounts should be invested in\nsufficiently safe, diversified and liquid assets.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\nempowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in order\nto determine the type of contributions to the Fund and the matters for which\ncontributions are due, the manner in which the amount of the contributions is\ncalculated and the way in which they are to be paid; specify registration, accounting,\nreporting and other rules necessary to ensure that the contributions are fully\nand timely paid; determine the contribution system for institutions that have\nbeen authorized to operate after the Fund has reached its target level;\ndetermine the criteria for the spreading out in time of the contributions;\ndetermine the circumstances under which the payment of contributions may be\nadvanced; determine the criteria for establishing the annual contributions;\ndetermine the measures to specify the circumstances and modalities under which\nan institution may be partially or entirely exempted from ex post\ncontributions, and the measures to specify the circumstances and modalities\nunder which an institution may be partially or entirely exempted from ex-post\ncontributions.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To preserve the\nconfidentiality of the work of the Board, its members, staff of the Board,\nincluding the staff exchanged with or seconded by participating Member States\nfor the purpose of carrying out resolution duties should be subject to\nrequirements of professional secrecy, even after their duties have ceased. For\nthe purpose of carrying out the tasks conferred upon it, the Board should be\nauthorized, subject to conditions, to exchange information with national or\nUnion authorities and bodies.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nBoard is represented in the European System of Financial Supervision, Regulation\n(EU) No 1093/2010 should be amended in order to include the Board in the\nconcept of competent authorities established by that Regulation. Such\nassimilation between the Board and competent authorities pursuant to Regulation\nNo 1093/2010 is consistent with the functions attributed to EBA pursuant to\nArticle 25 of Regulation No 1093/2010 to contribute and participate actively in\nthe development and coordination of recovery and resolution plans and to aim at\nthe facilitation of the resolution of failing institutions and in particular\ncross border groups.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until the Board is fully\noperational, the Commission should be responsible for the initial operations\nincluding collecting contributions necessary to cover administrative expenses\nand the designation of an interim executive director to authorise all necessary\npayments on behalf of the Board.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to property, the\nprotection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an\neffective remedy and to a fair trial, and has to be implemented in accordance\nwith those rights and principles. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nthis Regulation, namely setting up an efficient and effective single European\nframework for the resolution of credit institutions and ensuring the consistent\napplication of resolution rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved at the Member\nState level and can therefore be better achieved at the Union level, the Union\nmay adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\nin Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nPART I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes uniform rules\nand a uniform procedure for the resolution of the entities referred to in\nArticle 2 that are established in the participating Member States referred to\nin Article 4.\nThose uniform rules and procedure shall be\napplied by the Commission together with a Board and the resolution authorities\nof the participating Member States within the framework of a single resolution\nmechanism established by this Regulation. The single resolution mechanism shall\nbe supported by a single bank resolution fund (hereinafter called the Fund).\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to the\nfollowing entities:\n(a)                   \ncredit institutions established in participating\nMember States;\n(b)                   \nparent undertakings established in one of the\nparticipating Member States, including financial holding companies and mixed\nfinancial holding companies when subject to consolidated supervision carried\nout by the ECB in accordance with Article 4(1)(i) of Council Regulation (EU)No[\n] conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies\nrelating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions;\n(c)                   \ninvestment firms and financial institutions\nestablished in participating Member States when they are covered by the\nconsolidated supervision of the parent undertaking carried out by the ECB in\naccordance with Article 4(1)(i) of Council Regulation (EU)No[ ].\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the\ndefinitions laid down in Article 2 of Directive [ ] and Article 3 of Directive\n2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19] shall apply. In addition, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \n\u2018national competent authority\u2019 means any\nnational competent authority as defined in Article 2(2) of Council

Uncoordinated national responses to the failure of banks have\nintensified the fragmentation of the internal market in lending and funding. As\na result the transmission of the common monetary policy is impaired and\nring-fencing jeopardises lending to businesses and consumers.\nThis is particularly damaging within the Euro\nArea. With little room to use monetary tools to deal with weaknesses in the\nbanking sector, reliance on national fiscal resources in managing bank failures\ncontinues to link banks and sovereigns in a negative feedback loop. Businesses\nin Member States with a lowered perceived ability to rescue ailing banks in\ntheir territory are at a severe competitive disadvantage. Moreover, as seen in\nthe crisis, problems in some Euro Area Member States can rapidly spread via\ndoubts and financial links to other perceived by markets to be vulnerable to\nsimilar risks.\nThe European Council stated in its conclusions\nof December 2012 that \u201cIn a context where bank supervision is effectively moved\nto a single supervisory mechanism, a single resolution mechanism will be\nrequired, with the necessary powers to ensure that any bank in participating\nMember States can be resolved with the appropriate tools\u201d.\nSwift progress towards a Banking Union is\nindispensable to ensure financial stability and growth in the Euro Area.\nBuilding on the strong regulatory framework common to the 28 members of the internal\nmarket (single rulebook), the European Commission has therefore taken an\ninclusive approach and proposed a roadmap for the Banking Union with different\ninstruments and steps, potentially open to all Member States but in any case\nincluding the 17 currently within the Euro Area.\nThe first step, the Single Supervisory\nMechanism (SSM) for Euro Area banks and those from the Member States that wish\nto join empowers the ECB to exercise key supervisory tasks over such banks.\nAnother key aspect of the Banking Union, the\nproposal for a Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and\nresolution of credit institutions and investment firms (Bank Recovery and\nResolution Directive) adopted in 2012 is currently under negotiation by the\nco-legislators. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive will establish the\nrules for how resolution will be carried out across the internal market and\nprovide the national resolution authorities with powers and procedures allowing\nfor the resolution of banks.\nIn line with the conclusions of the European\nCouncil, the integration of the Union banking markets requires a Euro Area-wide\nresolution mechanism to deal with banks in distress and thus to manage\ncontagion risk in order to safeguard Euro Area financial stability to the\nbenefit of the whole internal market.\nIn line with the Commission\u2019s Blueprint of\n2012, the long-term objective is to build a Banking Union for the banks in all\nMember States. Direct supervision by the ECB combined with a single resolution\nmechanism for banks and effective and solid deposit guarantee schemes in all\nMember States will contribute to keeping up confidence in the sustainable\nstability of the Union.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nUnder the principle of subsidiarity set out in\nArticle 5.3 of the TEU, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive\ncompetence, the Union should act only if and in so far as the objectives of the\nproposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at\ncentral level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the\nscale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.\nOnly action at European level can ensure that\nfailing banks are resolved in a non-discriminatory manner and pursuant to a\nsingle set of rules to improve the functioning of the Economic\nand Monetary Union and that of the internal market. Despite the deep integration of the Union\u2019s\nbanking sector, substantial differences between resolution decisions taken at\nnational level may result in unacceptable risks to financial stability.\nThe single currency compels single oversight\nand resolution of banks for the Euro Area to avoid destructive economic\nfragmentation. A Single\nResolution Mechanism will be more effective than a network of national\nresolution authorities, in particular in respect of\ncross-border banking groups for which speed and coordination are crucial to\nminimise costs and restore confidence. It will also entail significant\neconomies of scale, and avoid the negative externalities that may derive from\npurely national decisions.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe first step, the Single Supervisory\nMechanism (SSM) for Euro Area banks and those from the Member States that wish\nto join empowers the ECB to exercise key supervisory tasks over such banks.\nAnother key aspect of the Banking Union, the\nproposal for a Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and\nresolution of credit institutions and investment firms (Bank Recovery and\nResolution Directive) adopted in 2012 is currently under negotiation by the\nco-legislators.

Differently\nfrom many other bodies set up by the Communities, the services provided by the\nBoard will be exclusively financed by financial institutions.\nSecondly, Board will be responsible for\nensuring the management of the Single Bank Resolution Fund. In this regard, a\nset of internal control procedures will have to be developed and established.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\ninternal control system set up\nThe framework and rules for internal control\nshould follow the pattern applied by other authorities established by the\nCommission, except for the management of the Single Bank Resolution Fund, which\nwill require the establishment of a specif set of rules.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\nInternal controls shall be embedded in the\nBoard\u2019s procedures relevant to the discharge of its responsibility and the\nimplementation of the tasks conferred to it.

Around\n6000 Eurozone banks, in addition to their annual contributions to the Single\nBank Resolution Fund, will pay a fixed prorata of this amount to fully cover\nthe Boards\u2019 budgetary expenses. The contribution rate together with a Board\u2019s\nbudget will be approved on the annual basis. The contribution rate to finance\nthe Board will be adapted each year to ensure a balanced budget of the Board.\nThe Board will carry out tasks related to the\npreparation and execution of resolutions and the contributions to and the\nmanagement of the Resolution Fund. With respect to the preparation of\nresolutions, the Board will draw up or review resolution plans, participate in\ncross-border resolution colleges, and prepare an actual resolution. For a\nsignificant number of institutions and groups the Board, in cooperation with\nthe (consolidating) supervisor and with the national resolution authorities,\nwill have to draw up resolution plans, which provide for the resolution actions\nthat may be taken when the conditions for resolution are met, and at least\nannually review and where appropriate update the plans. The Board will also\nhave to assess the resolvability of the institutions and groups and address any\npotential substantive impediment to the resolvability.\nThe national resolution authorities will also\nhave to draw up resolution plans for the other entities and groups, which the\nBoard will have to review. In case a group includes entities not only\nestablished in participating Member States, the Board shall represent the\nnational resolution authorities of the participating Member States in the\nresolution college. Resolution colleges are established to ensure cooperation\nand coordination among relevant authorities and perform inter alia tasks\nregarding the development of resolution plans, the assessment of resolvability\nand actual resolution.\nIn case the Commission has decided to put an\nentity under resolution, the Board will monitor the execution of the resolution\nand it will also assess the feasibility of the entity's business reorganization\nplan.\nWith respect to the Fund, the Board will have\nto levy annual contributions on almost 6,000 institutions, will have to make\nsure that the contribution basis in individual banks is correctly determined,\nthat the contributions are paid on time and that unpaid amounts are effectively\nrecovered. To this end, the Board will conduct inspections of bank records. The\namount to be collected and managed would exceed half of the yearly annual\nUnion\u2019s budget. The Board will also have to manage funds in such a manner that\nthe risks are low and that it is possible, if necessary, to quickly make the\nresources available to finance resolution. This implies a thought-out, long\nterm investment strategy, taking into account among other things the kind,\ngeography and maturity of the investments. Of course, these line functions of\nthe Board will have to be supported by the staff functions, including inter\nalia information technology and communications.\nMain assumptions\nEstimated staff and costs structure of\nthe Board:\n\u00b7       \nThe Board is expected to be at full capacity at\nthe end of its first year of operation, meaning that all the staff has to be\nhired in the course of the first year: budget impact is estimated at 50% in the\nfirst year and 100% as from the second year of operation.\n\u00b7       \nGiven the lack of national resolution\nauthorities with a substantial historic record in Europe, an estimation of the\nhuman resources needs for the Board has been derived from benchmarking the\ntasks of the Board with those of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) \u2013 see table 1 below.\n\u00b7       \nIn terms of the covered deposits and the target\nsize of the resolution funds, the amounts are comparable between the US and the\neuro area, whereas the bank assets falling under a resolution mechanism are\nsubstantially higher within the euro area than in the US.\n\u00b7       \nWith respect to overhead costs, the comparison\nhas been made with European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). However, given the\nfact that the share of overhead cost in the ESAs has been higher than those\nestimated under benchmarking with FDIC, the latter, i.e. a more conservative\nratio of 11,5%, has been used. Further assumptions and their clarifications on\nbenchmarking with FDIC are provided below in table 1. As of 2012, FDIC had\n7,476 ftes.\n\u00b7       \nSince FDIC has a wider mandate than the Board,\nonly the relevant divisions of the FDIC have been taken into the benchmarking\nexercise. \n\u00b7       \nOn the basis of the benchmarking exercise, the\nnumber of required staff is estimated at 309. It should be noted that FDIC has\n21% of non-permanent employees. Under the most conservative assumption that in\na non-crisis scenario the FDIC would have been left only with permanent staff,\nwould reduce the target size of the Board by 75 employees to 244 in a\nnon-crisis situation. Therefore it is important to ensure that the Board has\nsufficient flexibility to contract additional staff or externalise the\nworkload.\n\u00b7       \nThe following distribution of personnel is\nsuggested:\n\u2013     \n80% of TAs (68% of ADs and 12% of ASTs);\n\u2013     \n10% of ENDs;\n\u2013     \n10% of CAs.\n\u00b7       \nStaff Regulation of EU institutions will be\napplied, which is reflected in the used per head rates:\n\u2013     \naverage yearly cost of a TA: EUR 131,000;\n\u2013     \naverage yearly cost of an END: EUR 78,000;\n\u2013     \naverage yearly cost of a CA: EUR 70,000.\nIn addition to the salary, this cost\nincludes indirect costs such as building, training, IT and socio-medical\ninfrastructure costs. \n\u00b7       \nConsidering that the location of the Board is\nnot known at this stage, a salary correction coefficient of 1 has been used.\nThe different location of the Board would likely require the reassessment of\ncosts.\n\u00b7       \nThe other staff, administrative and operating\nexpenditure have been estimated based on a benchmarking exercise with the\ncurrent costs structure of the ESAs.\n\u00b7       \nOperational expenditures are expected to amount\nto 25% of total Board\u2019s costs, notably for the development and maintenance of\ninformation systems, building relationship and the common supervisory culture\nwith national resolution authorities in the light of the European Resolution\nMechanism, where there should be a close and effective relationship between the\nBoard and the national resolution authorities primarily involved in the\nimplementation of resolution decisions.\n\u00b7       \nThe estimated costs structure of the Board is\nsummarized in the table 2 below.\nTable 1.

This division is not only involved in collecting contributions and managing the fund, but also in more general activities, like controlling, financial operations and financial planning. For this reason, it is assumed that 50% of the number of employees of the FDIC's Division of finance will be required at the central Board level to manage contributions and the fund. 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resolution planning of the large Euro area banks is a responsibility of the Board. The Board has the possibility to ask national authorities to provide a draft resolution plan. For that reason, it is assumed that 50% of employees will work at the central Board level. 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FDIC's Legal division is not only involved in resolutions and receiverships and the management of the Fund, but also for example in the FDIC's supervisory responsibilities. For that reason, the percentage of employees of the Legal division to total employees is used to estimate the number of employees necessary at the Board. 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The percentage of non-permanent employees has been calculated on the basis of the total number of employees of the FDIC, excluding the employees of the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, who are mostly employed on the regional level. \nTable 2.

On the basis of 2011 data on banks, an estimated target size of\nthe fund would be around 55 billion EUR.\n\u00b7       \nParticipating banks will pay their risk-adjusted\nshare to the Single Bank Resolution Fund within 10 year period. Thus the annual\naccumulation of resolution funds should reach around 5.5 billion EUR, not\ntaking into account returns and possible outflows.\n\u00b7       \nIn absolute amounts, the largest banks will make\nthe biggest contributions to the Single Bank Resolution Fund. Roughly, without\ntaking into account the risk profile of banks, the estimations of Commission\nservices on the basis of 2011 data show that 17 largest European banks will\nmake up around 40% of all banks\u2019 contributions to the Fund.\n\u00b7       \nWith respect to the management of the Fund, it\nshould be noted that the costs estimation for the Board have only included the\nhuman resource implications. Other costs, such as investment costs, have been\nassumed to be directly deducted from the Fund.\nFinancial impact at Commission Level:\n\u00b7       \nIt is estimated that a temporary allocation of 15\nposts specialised in human resources issues, budgetary matters and other\nadministrative matters relevant for the establishment of the Board will be\nnecessary at Commission level in the first year of operation (2014) to set up\nand accompany the start-up phase (estimated 6 months) of the Board, which has\nbeen assumed to be based in Brussels. The financial assessment below might\nchange depending on the selected location of the Board.\n\u00b7       \nAs from 2015, it is estimated that 10 posts could\nbe necessary within the Commission to implement the tasks conferred to it in\nthe Regulation, notably the preparation of resolution decisions. This will be\nsubject to a decision taking on the annual budgetary procedure.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the multiannual\nfinancial framework and expenditure budget
