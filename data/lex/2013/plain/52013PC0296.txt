At the same time, the port sector is very\nheterogeneous and characterised by a wide diversity in types and organisation. This\nRegulation respects this diversity and does not seek to impose a uniform model\nfor ports.\nOver 1.200 commercial seaports operate along\nsome 70.000 kilometres of the Union\u2019s coasts. In 2011, around 3.7 billion\ntonnes of cargo (more than 60 000 port calls of merchant ships) transited\nthrough European ports. \nWhile the EU is highly dependent on its ports\nfor its trade with the rest of the world, its ports also play a key role for\nits own internal market. Thus short sea shipping represents 60% of the tons\nhandled in EU ports. Seaports are key nodal points of the EU intermodal\ntransport chains using short sea shipping as an alternative to saturated land\ntransport routes and as a way to connect peripheral or island areas.\nIn terms of passengers transport, EU ports handled 385 million maritime passengers in 2011. \nPort activities contribute directly to\nemployment, inward investment and GDP growth. 2,200 port operators currently\nemploy around 110,000 port dockers. In total, ports represent up to 3 million (direct\nand indirect) jobs in the 22 maritime Member States and are a major source of\ntax revenues for local, regional or national governments.\n96% of all freight and 93% of all passengers\nthrough the EU ports transit through the 319 seaports identified in the\nCommission's proposal for Guidelines on the trans-European transport network\n(TEN-T)[1].\n\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Challenges\nWhile the need to\ndevelop hinterland connections is well identified as a key challenge and\nalready addressed through the TEN-T policy, other key challenges for TEN-T ports\nremain unresolved. First, there is the fact that today not all TEN-T ports are\noffering the same high-level service. Second, the current port governance\nframework is not in all cases attractive enough for investors. This together\nrelates to five specific challenges:\n1.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sub-optimal port services\nand operations in some TEN-T seaports\nEfficient port services are crucial for the\nperformance of the TEN-T seaports. The Commission, together with the sector,\nhas identified three issues that may prevent port services from being organised\nin an optimal way: (1) many of the port services are subject to a weak\ncompetitive pressure due to market access restrictions; (2) monopolistic or\noligopolistic, although justified in a number of situations, may lead to market\nabuses and (3) in some ports users are faced with too much administrative\nburden due to a lack of coordination within ports.\n1.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Port governance frameworks are\nnot attractive enough for investments in all TEN-T\nseaports\nThe investments\nrequired to adapt the port capacities to changing needs are only possible only\nin a stable policy and regulatory framework that will reduce economic\nuncertainties and ensure a level playing field. This however does not seem to\nbe the case in all TEN-T ports. Several factors explain it: a) the legal\nuncertainties created by the market restrictions described above and b) the\nneed for better infrastructure planning which can be tackled through stricter\nTEN-T rules. \nBut two other fundamental issues explain this\ncurrent and overall unattractive investment climate in several TEN-T ports: (4)\nunclear financial relations between public authorities, port authorities and\nport services providers and (5) the weak autonomy of ports to define\ninfrastructure charges and non-transparent links with the costs related to\naccess infrastructure of ports.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objective\nThe objective is to contribute to the goal of\na more efficient, interconnected and sustainable functioning of the TEN-T by\ncreating a framework which improves the performance of all ports and helps them\nto cope with changes in transport and logistics requirements. The TEN-T ports must\nhelp develop short sea shipping as part of intermodal routes, hence\ncontributing to sustainable transport, one of the key goals of the Transport White\nPaper and contribute to the EU 2020 strategy for a resource efficient growth\nwhich will stimulate growth of trade and cargo.\nThis initiative ensures a balanced approach\nbetween legislative action and a soft approach, exemplified by the Social\nDialogue. This is the result of an intensive and pertinent consultation of the\nstakeholders that allowed to focus the Regulation on measures with a high EU\nadded value. This Regulation will avoid additional burden for those ports\nalready functioning well and will create the conditions for the other ports to\ndeal with their structural challenges.\n1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other EU\npolicies and objectives\nThe proposal fits within the policy\nannounced by the Commission in the White Paper on Transport (2011) and has been\nexplicitly announced under the heading of a Single European Transport Area and\nmarket access to ports. The White Paper clearly states the intention of the\nCommission to review restrictions on provisions of port services and to enhance\nthe transparency on ports' financing, clarifying the destination of public\nfunding to the different port activities, with a view to avoid any distortion\nof competition. The proposal has also been identified as one of the key actions\nof the Single Market Act II and will contribute to the completion of the\nEuropean Single Market.\nThe proposal completes and supplements\non-going policies or proposals already made: the proposals on the trans-European\ntransport network guidelines and the Connecting Europe Facility which provides\na framework to support the development of hinterland connections to ports, the\nproposal for a Directive on the awards of concession contracts which applies to\nconcession contracts in ports and the preparatory work on a Blue Belt initiative\naiming at simplifying the customs procedures applied to EU goods carried by\nvessels calling at EU ports.\nThe proposal applies to all the ports of\nthe TEN-T since by their very nature they all play a significant role in the\nEuropean transport system either to facilitate the exchanges between Member\nStates or to improve the regional accessibility of island or peripheral areas.\nIt should however be stressed that the principles of non-discrimination and\nfreedom of establishment of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union\nand the competition rules also apply to the other ports, which although not in\nthe trans-European network may have an important role at local level or for\nother sectors than transport like fishing or tourism. Member States may also\ndecide to apply the provision of this proposed Regulation to these ports.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nDG MOVE has maintained\na dialogue with the national administrations in charge of the ports' policy\n(Ministries of Transport). It held meetings with the main industry associations\nin the port sector, inter alia: port authorities (ESPO), private terminal\noperators (FEPORT), inland ports (EFIP), ship-owners (ECSA), pilots (EMPA), tug\nowners and operators (ETA), mooring operators (EBA), ship's agents (ECASBA),\nshippers (ESC), dredgers (EuDA) and logistic operators (CLECAT). DG MOVE also\nheld meetings with the two main Unions of port workers, the International\nDockers Council (IDC) and the dock workers' section of the European Transport\nWorkers Federation (ETF). A sectoral social dialogue committee could not be\nconsulted, as this is still in the process of being set up. \nThe preparatory work\nwas supported by an economic study on the quality and efficiency of European\nports (PwC). The work took account of extensive research on transport\neconomics, ports and logistics and involved several discussions with industry\nand research experts.\nStakeholders were\nconsulted extensively through two on-line surveys and an open stakeholders'\ntwo-day conference in Brussels (25-26 Sept. 2012). A final targeted public\nhearing, presenting the key problems and discussing policy options and their\npossible impacts was held on 18 January 2013. The main results of the consultation\nprocess (2012-2013) can be summarised as follows: \n\u2013                        \nAll stakeholders stressed the need for a stable\nand fair level playing field both for inter-port (competition between ports)\nand intra-port (competition between providers of a same port service within a\nport) competition in the EU. The need for legal certainty and a business\nfriendly environment with as less administrative burden as possible is a\npriority for all stakeholders.\n\u2013                        \nThere is a major concern about unfair\ncompetition between ports linked to public funding practices of port\ninfrastructures. Member States and port authorities request a tight control of\nstate aid. \n\u2013                        \nA significant part of the users of port\nservices, shipping companies and export-import industries, consider that port\nservices in many EU ports are not satisfactory in terms of price, quality and\nadministrative burden.\n\u2013                        \n30% of European port authorities do not consider\nthat the current situation is satisfactory. However, the majority of them\noppose the introduction of EU procedures limiting the capacities of public\nauthorities to grant contracts and permissions to operators of port services\nthrough direct award. Applying EU concession rules to certain contracts granted\nin ports is highly controversial in certain Member States. \n\u2013                        \nPort workers' trade unions extremely oppose any\nEU provision touching on the existing port labour regimes in certain Member\nStates . Representatives of pilotage services argue that pilotage, although\nprovided against remuneration, is not an economic service and should be\nexcluded from competitive pressure.\n\u2013                        \nMost stakeholders agree that the EU port system\nhas to evolve and adapt to significant challenges in terms of scarce funding\nresources, competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis ports in neighbouring third countries and\nother world regions, creation of added value and jobs as well as coping with\nenvironmental impacts. They all agree on the importance to secure and, if\npossible, increase, EU funding expenditure in support of ports and maritime\ntransport.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Impact Assessment identified five operational\nobjectives related to the two main challenges identified above.\n2.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modernise port services and\noperations: \nFirst, by better optimising port services\nand operations, a number of TEN-T ports should be able to handle or attract\nmore cargo and passengers with the existing infrastructure. This translates\ninto three operational objectives:\n(1)                   \nClarify and facilitate access to the port\nservices market: \nThis should reduce access restrictions to\nthe port services market while clarifying and suppressing the current legal\nuncertainties stemming from horizontal rules from the Treaty and on public\nprocurement.\n(2)                   \nPrevent market abuse by designated port service\nproviders: \nThis should ensure that designated service\nproviders offer their services in a cost-efficient manner while continuing to\nfulfil their role and possible their mission of public service, notably in the\nfield of safety, security and environment.\n(3)                   \nImprove coordination mechanisms within ports: \nThis should facilitate smooth operations\nfor shippers, logistic operators and cargo-owners, reducing the time and money\nrequired for using the port. The coordination effort should also benefit\noperators established in the port, facilitating synergies and avoiding\nduplication of efforts for serving the same customers. \n2.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create framework conditions\nto attract investments in ports: \nSecond, a greater financial transparency\nand autonomy of ports should create a level playing field, encourage more\nefficient charging, and eventually attract more investments. This in turn\ntranslates in two additional operational objectives:\n(4)                   \nMake the financial relations between public\nauthorities, port authorities and providers of port services transparent: \nThis should ensure a financial transparency\nbetween public authority functions and commercial operations in order to\nprevent that ports and service providers benefit from unfair competitive\nadvantages. \n(5)                   \nEnsure autonomously set and transparent port\ninfrastructure charges: \nThis should achieve a more efficient use of\ninfrastructure and more economic rationality in the planning, investment,\nmaintenance, and operation of port infrastructures, while enabling\nenvironmental and societal price signals.\nOn the basis of this 4 policy options where\nconsidered:\n(1)                   \nPolicy Package 1:\n\u201cTransparency\u201d \nPolicy Package 1 (PP1) applies a soft measure\n(non-binding communication) to clarify and facilitate the market access of\nports services. Binding provisions are however introduced in monopolistic or\noligopolistic situations: in those cases the services should be subject to\nprice supervision in order to avoid excessive or discrminatory charging. The\nfinancing and setting of port charges is left over to the competent authorities\non the condition of basic transparency. Coordination of the services inside the\nport is guaranted by a port users' committee.\n(2)                   \nPolicy Package 2:\n\u201cRegulated competition\u201d \nPolicy Package 2\n(PP2) introduces the principle of freedom to provide services under a scheme of\nregulated market access. Under this regulated market access, the freedom to\nprovide services can be restricted if it is warranted by the lack of space in\nthe port area or by public service obligations (availability, accessibility,\netc.). In such cases, newly attributed and designated services are made subject\nto a public tendering procedure and in the case of in-house operations, the\nservice needs to remain confined. Services under a monopolistic or\noligopolistic situation are subject to price supervision. The transparency of\nfinancial relations between public authorities, ports authorities and port\nservice providers is accommodated by separated accounts and rules link the\nsetting of the port infrastructure charges to actual costs. Coordination of the\nservices inside the port is facilitated by a port users' committee.\n(3)                   \nPolicy Package 2a: \u201cRegulated competition and port autonomy\u201d \nPolicy Package 2a (PP2a) consists of PP2 with\nthe following differences: \nThe obligation to have recourse to public\ntenders in case of space restrictions or public service obligations applies not\nonly to new contracts but also in the event of substantial changes to existing\ncontracts. The regulatory oversight of service providers in monopolistic\nposition is more limited in scope: it only applies to the markets which can not\nbe contested, i.e. the markets for which no public tender is organised. Greater\nautonomy is given to ports: on infrastructure charging, instead of imposing\nthat charges are linked to actual costs, each port is given the right to set\nitself the structure and level of port dues, provided that the charging policy is\ntransparent. The initiative also encourages a differentiation according to the\nenvironmental performance of ships.\n(4)                   \nPolicy Package 3: \u201cFull\ncompetition and port autonomy\u201d \nPolicy Package 3 (PP3) builds on PP2a by\nobliging additionally at least two competing and independent operators for\nevery port service where the number of operators is limited as a result of\nspace constraint. There would also be a functional/legal separation. This\nseparation would result in a multiplication of port actors: to ensure that the\nport keeps functioning, strengthening the central coordination role of the port\nauthorities would be necessary. As in PP2a each port authority would be free to\ndetermine the structure and level of infrastrustructure charges according to its\nown commercial practices. \nAfter analysis of the different options and\npotential impact the Commission concluded that the best option should be PP2a\nwith a variant for cargo handling and passenger services. As regards the\nmeasures related to the market access to cargo handling and passenger services,\nthere is no need to propose new legal provisions. Existing rules and\nrequirements will be clarified in a Communication. The rules on the regulatory\noversight of the price of the service providers in monopolistic or\noligopolistic position and on the transparency of accounts would however apply\nto cargo handling and passenger services. \nThe impact assessment highlights the\npotential benefits in terms of costs savings (\u20ac 10 billion until 2030),\ndevelopment of short sea shipping and reduction of road congestion and creation\nof jobs. The impact assessment indicates that this proposal does not lead to\ndirect significant changes of the administrative burden in ports. The introduction\nof the freedom to provide services will reduce the administrative cost for\nports, while the supervision of prices in certain cases and the consultation of\nusers may require new administrative efforts. However it should be stressed\nthat this proposal will indirectly contribute to the simplification by lifting\nrestrictions. Further simplification efforts will also be proposed in the forthcoming\ninitiative on the Blue Belt.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the measures\nproposed\nThe proposal contains the following main\nelements:\n\u2013                        \nThe Regulation applies to all the seaports\nidentified in the Commission's proposal for Union Guidelines on the\ntrans-European transport network. \n\u2013                        \nThe freedom to provide services will be\napplicable to port services. However managing bodies of a port may impose minimum\nrequirements on the providers of specific port services. When imposed, these\nrequirements shall only relate to professional qualifications, the necessary\nequipment or maritime safety, general safety and security in the port and\nrelevant environmental requirements. These requirements should not be used as a\nway of implicitly introducing market barriers and therefore the criteria should\nbe objective and proportionate ensuring a fair treatment of all operators,\nexisting and potential ones. Potential operators should have access to training\nto acquire relevant specific local knowledge. \n\u2013                        \nThe above mentioned provision will not be\nimposed to cargo handling services and passengers terminals. These services are\noften organised by means of concession contracts falling in the scope of the\nfuture Directive on the award of concession contracts proposed by the\nCommission[2].\nMoreover additional legal provisions could undermine efforts being made to\ninitiate a Social Dialogue at Union level. Contrary to pilotage services to\nenter and exit ports, pilotage services performed in the deep sea have no\ndirect impact on the efficiency of port and therefore do not need to be\nincluded in this Regulation. \n\u2013                        \nWhere relevant the stated freedom to provide\nservices could be subjected to a limitation of the number of service providers.\nThis restriction should be based on two elements: either in the case of space\nconstraints or reservation which if clearly documented in a formal port development\nplan can justify to limit the number of operators active in the port perimeter or\nin the case of a public service obligation imposed to an operator and for which\nthe intention should be clear and publicly available.\n\u2013                        \nA Member State should have the possibility to designate\nauthorities competent to impose public service obligation, in line with the\napplicable State aid rules. The obligations of public services must be clearly\ndefined transparent, non-discriminatory and verifiable and must relate to the\navailability (no-interruption), the accessibility (to all users) or the\naffordability (of certain categories of users) of the port service. \n\u2013                        \nIn the case of public service obligations being\nimposed by a competent authority in a port or in several ports such an\nauthority will have the opportunity to organise and commercially exploit\nspecific port services itself under the condition that its activity remains\nconfined to the port or ports where it imposes public service obligations. \n\u2013                        \nEmployees' rights should be safeguarded and the\nMember States should have the option to further strengthen these rights in the\nevent of a transfer of undertakings and the relevant staff working for the old\nundertaking.\n\u2013                        \nIn those case where managing bodies of the port\nbenefit from public funds there shall be a transparent accounting in order to\nshow the effective and appropriate use of these public funds.\n\u2013                        \nIn those cases where designated port service\nproviders have not been subject to an open public tendering procedure and in\nthe case of internal operators, it should be ensured that the price for the\nservice is transparent, non-discriminatory and that it is set according to\nnormal market conditions, in particular in such way that the total charges do\nnot exceed the total incurred costs and a reasonable profit.\n\u2013                        \nManaging bodies of the port shall define the\nport infrastructure charges in an autonomous way and according to its own\ncommercial and investment strategy. \n\u2013                        \nThe port infrastructure charges may be varied in\naccordance to commercial practices related to the frequent use of the port or\nin order to promote a more efficient use of the port infrastructure, short sea\nshipping or a high environmental performance, energy efficiency or carbon\nefficiency of transport operations.\n\u2013                        \nA port users' advisory committee shall be set up\nin every port. This committee will bring together representatives of operators\nof waterborne vessels, cargo owners or other port users which are requested to\npay a port infrastructure charge or port service charge. This committee shall\nbe consulted on the structure and the level of the port infrastructure charges\nand in certain cases the port service charges. \n\u2013                        \nThe managing body of the port shall consult\nstakeholders such as undertakings established in the ports, providers of port\nservices, and port users on issues like the coordination of port services,\nhinterland connections or administrative procedures. \n\u2013                        \nMember States shall ensure that an independent\nsupervisory body monitors and supervises the application of this Regulation. It\ncan be an existing body. The different national independent supervisory bodies\nshall exchange information about their work and decision-making principles and\nshall cooperate closely for the purpose of mutual assistance in their tasks.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nThe legal basis for this proposal is\nArticle 100 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nArticles 58, 90 and 100 of the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union extend to ports the objectives of a genuine internal\nmarket in the context of the Common Transport Policy. \nThe overwhelming share of seaborne trade\nhandled in TEN-T ports results from trade between Member States or at\ninternational level. Ports have a clear European function. approximately one out of every two tonnes of volume handled in ports\ncomes from or goes to, by sea or land, a Member State which is different from\nthe one of the port in which the goods transit[3]. Actions by Member States alone cannot ensure a level playing field\nwithin the EU internal market, nor can they take actions to improve the\nperformance of ports located on the same trans-European corridor but in other\nMember States. \nTherefore, although the specific nature of\nthe port sector and its long-lasting local history and culture is recognised, because\nof internal market reasons, network effects and the international dimension of\nthe port sector, the proposed initiative is in line with the subsidiarity\nprinciple.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe Regulation only covers TEN-T seaports. This will ensure\nproportionality insofar as it will avoid imposing unnecessary rules on very\nsmall ports which do not have a significant role for the European transport\nsystem. By contrast the TEN-T seaports deal with the overwhelming majority of\nthe traffic and by definition are essential for the international and\nintra-European trade exchanges, and therefore for the European internal market,\nand/or the cohesion within the EU. Moreover TEN-T ports are eligible to EU\nfunding. \nThe scope has not been further limited to the core ports in order\nnot to risk creating distortions of competition between core ports and other\nTEN-T ports. Moreover an efficient functioning of the network requires both\ncore ports (typically hub) and non-core TEN-T ports for the regional\ndistribution.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nWhilst the Member States, regional and\nlocal public authorities have traditionally been the main actors involved in\nport infrastructure development and management this situation has been\nprogressively changing. Transport operators, autonomous public bodies and\nentities and other private and public entities have also become key actors in\nthe development, management and organisation of port. Therefore, it is\nimportant to ensure that this legislation on market access to port services and\nfinancial transparency of ports is generally applicable. Moreover, to ensure a uniform\nimplementation, enforcement and a level playing field in the internal market, the\nlegislation should be directly binding in its entirety. The Commission has\ntherefore chosen a Regulation as the appropriate legal instrument for this\nproposal. This will also prevent additional administrative burden for Member States and the Commission.\n3.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Economic Area\nThe proposed Regulation concerns an EEA\nmatter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.\n2013/0157 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing a framework on market access\nto port services and financial transparency of ports\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100 (2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full integration of\nports in seamless logistic and transport chains is needed to contribute to\ngrowth and a more efficient use and functioning of the trans-European transport\nnetwork and the internal market. This requires modern port services contributing\nto an efficient use of ports and a climate favourable to investments to develop\nports in line with current and future transport and logistics requirements.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Communication on\nthe Single Market Act II Together for new growth[6],\nthe Commission has recalled that the attractiveness of maritime transport is\ndependent on the availability efficiency and reliability of port services and\nthe necessity of addressing questions regarding the transparency of public\nfunding and port charges, administrative simplification efforts in ports and\nreviewing restrictions on the provision of services at ports.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Facilitating access to the\nport services market at Union level and introducing the financial transparency\nand autonomy of seaports will improve the quality and efficiency of service\nprovided to users of the port and contribute to a climate more favourable to\ninvestments in ports, and thereby help reduce costs for transport users and\ncontribute to promoting short sea shipping and a better integration of maritime\ntransport with rail, inland waterway and road transport. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overwhelming majority\nof Union maritime traffic transits through the seaports of the trans-European\ntransport network. In order to achieve the aim of this Regulation in a\nproportionate way without imposing any unnecessary burden on other ports, this\nRegulation should apply to the ports of the trans-European transport network,\neach of which playing a significant role for the European transport system\neither because it handles more than 0.1% of the total EU freight or the total\nnumber of passengers or because it improves the regional accessibility of\nisland or peripheral areas, without prejudice, however, to the possibility of\nMember States deciding to apply this Regulation to other ports as well. Pilotage\nservices performed in the deep sea do not have a direct impact on the\nefficiency of the ports as they are not used for the direct entry and exit of the\nports and therefore do not need to be included in this Regulation. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of Article\n56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is to eliminate\nrestrictions on freedom to provide services in the Union. In accordance with\nArticle 58 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\nachieved within the framework of the provisions of the Title relating to\ntransport, more specifically Article 100 (2). \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The self-provision of\nservice which entails shipping companies or providers of port services to\nemploy staff of their own choice and to provide themselves port services is regulated\nin a number of Member States for safety or social reasons. The stakeholders\nconsulted by the Commission when preparing its proposal highlighted that\nimposing a generalised allowance of the self-provision of service at Union level\nwould require additional rules on safety and social issues in order to avoid\npossible negative impacts in these areas. It appears therefore appropriate at\nthis stage not to regulate this issue at Union level and to leave it to the\nMember States to regulate the self-provision of port services or not. Therefore,\nthis Regulation should only cover the provision of port services for\nremuneration. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of\nefficient, safe and environmentally sound port management, the managing body of\nthe port should be able to require that port service providers can demonstrate\nthat they meet minimum requirements to perform the service in an appropriate\nway. These minimum requirements should be limited to a clearly defined set of conditions\nconcerning the professional qualifications of the operators, including in terms\nof training, and the equipment required insofar as these requirements are\ntransparent, non-discriminatory, objective and relevant for the provision of the\nport service. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having the necessary\nequipment at his disposal should imply that the provider of the port service\nowns, rents or leases it and that in any case it has a direct and indisputable\ncontrol of the equipment, in order to ensure that it can use such equipment whenever\nneeded. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedure to grant\nwith the right to provide port services when compliance with minimum\nrequirements is required should be transparent, objective and\nnon-discriminatory and should allow the providers of port services to start the\nprovision of their port services in a timely manner.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since ports are constituted\nof limited geographical areas, access to the market could, in certain cases, be\nsubject to limitations relating to the scarcity of land or in case the land is\nreserved for certain type of activities in accordance with a formal development\nplan which plans in a transparent way the land use and with relevant national\nlegislation such as those related to town and country planning objectives. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any intention to limit the\nnumber of port service providers should be published in advance by the\ncompetent authority and should be fully justified, in order to give the\ninterested parties the opportunity to comment. The criteria for any limitation\nshould be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to be open and\ntransparent, the procedure to select the providers of port services and its\nresult should be made public and full documentation should be communicated to\ninterested parties.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The selection procedure for\nproviders of port service in the case the number of those providers is limited\nshould follow the principles and approach determined in Directive ../../\u2026 [concession][7], including the threshold and\nmethod for determining the value of the contracts as well as the definition of\nsubstantial modifications and the elements related to the duration of the\ncontract. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recourse to public\nservice obligations leading to a limitation in the number of providers of a\nport service should only be justified for reasons of public interest in order\nto ensure the accessibility of the port service to all users, the availability\nof the port service all year long or the affordability of the port service to\ncertain category of users. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where there is a need to\nlimit the number of port service providers, the decision on that limitation may\nbe entrusted by the Member state to a different authority in order to safeguard\ncompetition. Any limitation in the number of providers of port services should\nfollow a procedure which is open, transparent and non-discriminatory. This\nshould however not be the case when public service obligations are to be\nentrusted directly to a competent authority or an internal operator.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation does not\npreclude the possibility of competent authorities to grant compensation for the\naccomplishment of the public service obligations provided that it complies with\nthe applicable State aid rules. Where public service obligations qualify as\nSGEI compliance should be ensured with Commission Decision of 20 November 2011 on\nthe application of Article 106(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted\nto certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general\neconomic interest[8],\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 360/2012 of 25 April 2012 on the application of\nArticles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to de\nminimis aid granted to undertakings providing services of general economic\ninterest[9]\nand the European Union framework for State aid in the form of public service\ncompensation[10].\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The managing body of the port\nshould not discriminate between providers of port services, in particular in\nfavour of an undertaking or body in which it holds an interest. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authorities\ndesignated in a Member State should have the choice to decide to provide port services\nwith public service obligations themselves or to entrust directly the provision\nof such services directly to an internal operator. In the case that a competent\nauthority decides to provide the service itself, this may cover the provision\nof services through agents employed by the competent authority or commissioned\nby the competent authority. When such limitation is applied in all the TEN-T\nports in the territory of a Member State, the Commission should be informed. In the cases where the competent authorities in a Member State prevail on such a choice, the provision of port services by the internal operators\nshould be confined only to the port or ports for which those internal operators\nwere designated. Moreover, in such cases, the port service charges applied by\nsuch an operator should be subject to supervision by the independent\nsupervisory body. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\nStates should retain the power to ensure an adequate level of social protection\nfor the staff of undertaking providing port services. This Regulation shall not\naffect the application of the social and labour rules of the Member States. In cases of limitation of the number of port service providers, where\nthe conclusion of a port service contract may entail a change of port service\noperator, it should be possible for the competent authorities to ask the chosen\nservice operator to apply the provisions of Council Directive 2001/23/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to\nthe safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of\nundertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses[11].\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In many ports, the market\naccess for providers of cargo-handling and terminal passenger services is\ngranted by means of public concession contracts. This type of contracts will be\ncovered by the Directive ..../\u2026[concessions]. Consequently, Chapter II of this\nRegulation should not apply to the provision of cargo-handling and passenger\nservices, but Member States should remain free to decide to apply nevertheless the\nrules of this Chapter to these two services. For other types of contracts used\nby public authorities for granting market access to cargo handling and terminal\npassenger services, the Court of Justice of the European Union has confirmed\nthat the competent authorities are bound by the principles of transparency and\nnon-discrimination when concluding these contracts. These principles are fully\napplicable as regards the provision of any port service.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial relations between\nseaports which receive public funds and providers of port services on the one\nhand, and public authorities on the other should be made transparent in order\nto ensure a level playing field and to avoid market distortions. In this\nrespect, this Regulation extends to other categories of addressees the\nprinciples of transparency of financial relations as set out in Commission\nDirective 2006/111/EC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain\nundertakings[12]\nwithout prejudice to its scope.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to impose\non the managing body of the port which receives public funds, when it is also\nacting as a service provider, an obligation to keep separate accounts for\nactivities carried out in their capacity as managing body of the port from\nthose carried out on a competitive basis in order to ensure a level playing\nfield, transparency in the allocation and use of public funds and to avoid\nmarket distortions. In any case compliance with the State aid rules should be\nensured.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Port\nservice charges applied by providers of port services which are not designated in\naccordance with an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure entail a\nhigher risk of price abuse given their monopolistic or oligopolistic situation\nand the fact that their market cannot be contested. The same is true for\ncharges levied by internal operators in the meaning of this Regulation. For\nthose services, in the absence of fair market mechanisms, arrangements should\nbe established to ensure that the charges they levy reflect the normal\nconditions of the relevant market and are set in a transparent and\nnon-discriminatory way. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to be efficient, the\nport infrastructure charges of each individual port should be set in a\ntransparent and autonomous way in accordance with that port's own commercial\nand investment strategy.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The variation of port\ninfrastructure charges should be allowed in order to promote short sea shipping\nand to attract waterborne vessels having an environmental performance or energy\nand carbon efficiency of the transport operations, notably the off-shore or\non-shore maritime transport operations, that is better than average. This should\nhelp to contribute to the environmental and climate change policies and the\nsustainable development of the port and its surroundings notably by contributing\nto reducing the environmental footprint of the waterborne vessels calling and\nstaying in the port.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adequate facilities should\nbe in place to ensure that the users of the ports which are requested to pay a\nport infrastructure charge and/or a port service charge are regularly consulted\nwhen the port infrastructure charge and the port service charge are defined and\nchanged. The managing bodies of the ports should also regularly consult other\nstakeholders on key issues related to the sound development of the port, its performance\nand its capacity to attract and generate economic activities such as the\ncoordination of port services within the port area and the efficiency of the\nconnections with the hinterland and of the administrative procedures in ports. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nproper and effective application of this Regulation, an independent supervisory\nbody, which could be an already existing body, should be designated in every Member State.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The different independent\nsupervisory bodies should exchange information on their work and cooperate in\norder to ensure a uniform application of this Regulation.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of this\nRegulation and in particular to promote the uniform\napplication of environmental charging, reinforce the Union-wide coherence of\nenvironmental charging and to ensure common charging principles in relation to\nthe promotion of short sea shipping, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of common classifications of vessels,\nfuels and types of operations according to which to vary the infrastructure\ncharges and common charging principles for port infrastructure charges. It is\nof particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when\npreparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament\nand Council.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation\nimplementing powers relating to appropriate arrangements for the exchange of\ninformation between independent supervisory bodies should be conferred on the\nCommission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the\nMember States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers [13].\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of\nthis Regulation, namely ensuring the modernisation of port services and the\nappropriate framework to attract necessary investments in all the ports of the\ntrans-European transport network, cannot\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the European\ndimension, international and cross-border nature of port and related maritime\nbusiness and can therefore, by reason of the need for a European level playing\nfield, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\nTreaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality,\nas set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is\nnecessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nRegulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles\nrecognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I \u2013 Subject matter, scope and\ndefinitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation establishes:\n(a)         \na clear framework for access to the market of\nport services;\n(b)         \ncommon rules on the financial transparency and charges\nto be applied by managing bodies or providers of port services.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply to the provision of the following categories of port services, either\ninside the port area or on the waterway access to and from the ports.\n(a)         \nbunkering\n(b)         \ncargo handling;\n(c)         \ndredging;\n(d)         \nmooring;\n(e)         \npassenger services;\n(f)           \nport reception facilities; \n(g)         \npilotage and;\n(h)         \ntowage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall\napply to all seaports of the trans-European transport network, as defined in\nAnnex I of Regulation XXX [regulation on the TEN-T Guidelines]. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States may also\napply this Regulation to other seaports.
