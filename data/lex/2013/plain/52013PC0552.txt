The government of the Kingdom of Spain has made a request\r\nthe prolongation of the measures under the aformentioned regulation. \nThe exceptional geographical situation of the\r\n Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of fishery products which\r\nare essential for domestic consumption entails costs that are a severe burden\r\nfor this sector. The negative effects of this natural handicap can be remedied\r\nby temporarily suspending customs duties on imports of the products in question\r\nfrom third countries. The proposed reductions in import duties, in combination\r\nwith other measures specific for the outermost regions, will help the Canary Islands to overcome the structural difficulties they face.\nGeneral context\nThe Canary Islands are one of the outermost regions\r\nof the European Union, for which special measures may be foreseen, pursuant to\r\nArticle 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to\r\novercome the economic disadvantages these regions suffer due to their\r\ngeographical situation.\nSince 1991 the European Union has suspended,\r\npartially or in full, the Common Custom Tariff duties on imports of certain\r\nfishery products into the Canary Islands. The following regulations were\r\nadopted in the past to suspend duties on imports of fish products into the Canary Islands:\na) Council Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 of 26\r\nJune 1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands. \nb) Council Regulation (EEC) 3621/92 of 14\r\nDecember 1992 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff\r\nduties on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands;\nc) Council Regulation (EC) 704/2002 of 25\r\nMarch 2002 temporarily suspending autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on\r\nimports of certain industrial products and opening and providing for the\r\nadministration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain\r\nfishery products into the Canary Islands, and\nd) Council Regulation (EC) 645/2008 of 08\r\nJuly 2008 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community\r\ntariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands.\nExisting provisions on autonomous\r\ntariff reductions\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 of 8 July\r\n2008 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community\r\ntariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands\r\nexpires on 31 December 2013.\nSimilar tariff reductions (suspensions) apply\r\non imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands.for the Canary Islands. They are implemented with Council Regulation (EU) No 1386/2011 of 19\r\nDecember 2011 temporarily suspending autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on\r\nimports of certain industrial products.\nRegulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council, of 13 March 2013, laying down specific measures\r\nfor agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and repealing Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006, i.e. the so called\r\n\"POSEI\" Regulation, includes specific supply arrangements aimed at\r\nmitigating the additional costs for the supply of essential products for human\r\nconsumption, for processing and as agricultural inputs. As part of this supply\r\narrangements imports of certain agrcultural products from third countries are\r\nexempted from duties. This regulation applies to all the regions mentioned in\r\nArticle 349 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, including the Canary Islands.\nConsistency with the other policies\r\nand objectives of the Union\nThe proposed duty free tariff quotas are to\r\nbe seen, in terms of support to the Canary Islands' fish industry, as\r\ncomplementing other measures, in particular the scheme to compensate for the\r\nadditional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the\r\noutermost regions (Council Regulation (EC) 791/2007 of 21 May 2007).\nThis proposal is also\r\nin line with Union policies, in particular the Common Fisheries Policy.\nConsultation of interested parties and\r\nimpact assessment\nConsultation of interested parties\nArticle 2 of Council Regulation (EC) 645/2008\r\nspecified that the Spanish authorities had to submit two implementation reports\r\n(in May 2010 and in May 2012) and required the Commission to assess the impact\r\nof the measures following the receipt of these reports. \nThe Spanish authorities fulfilled the above\r\nmentioned reporting obligations and submitted two reports: one in July 2010 and\r\nanother in June 2012. The Commission requested additional information necessary\r\nto carry out the examination of the impacts of the measures, as required by the\r\nRegulation. The information requested was provided by the Spanish authorities,\r\nallowing the Commission to complete the examination of the measures.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThe evaluation report[1] on the compensation regime\r\nimplemented with Council Regulation (EC) 791/2007 was also used in the\r\nassessment. This evaluation report provides relevant information on the Canary Islands on areas that are of relevance when examining the impacts of the tariff\r\nquotas (e.g. population, structure of the fisheries sector, production,\r\nprocessing and marketing of fish.) This report also addressed the possible\r\ninteractions between the tariff quotas for fish products and the compensation\r\nregime as applied in the Canary Islands with Council Regulation (EC) 791/2007. \nThe 2009 evaluation report[2] of the POSEI programmes and\r\nspecific measures in favour of the smaller Aegean islands was also used. This\r\nreport, besides presenting factual information about the Canary Islands'\r\neconomy, provided an analysis of the interaction between measures allowing for\r\nduty free imports of certain agricultural products and EU financial support of\r\nlocal agriculture. \nImpact assessment\nOwing to the very\r\nlimited scope of the measures and the fact that the proposal concerns the\r\ncontinuation of measures that have been applied in the past there is no added\r\nvalue to carry out an impact assessment. \nThe examination of the\r\nreports by the Spanish authorities provided the necessary basis for the preparation\r\nof the Commission proposal.\nLegal elements of the proposal\nSummary of the proposed action\nTo extend the existing\r\nautonomous tariff quotas for another 7 year period, i.e. from 2014 to 2020.\r\nThis 7 year period synchronises the measures with other actions of the Union in\r\nfavour of the Canary Islands, in particular those proposed in the context of\r\nthe Commission's poposal for a European Maritime and Fisheries Fund[3]. \nLegal basis\nArticle 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe proposed tariff quotas would cover the\r\nneeds of the Canary Islands' domestic market, while ensuring that flows of\r\nreduced-duty imports into the Union remain predictable and clearly\r\nidentifiable.\nThe suspension of duties only applies to\r\ncertain fishery products, for a limited volume and for a limited period. The\r\neffects of the measures are also circumscribed as the products are intended\r\nsolely for the Canary island's market.\nThe administrative burden for both Member\r\nStates' national and regional authorities and the Commission services is kept\r\nto a minimum, especially with regard to the reports to be submitted on the\r\nimplementation of the measures.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nThe Treaty does no allow any other means for\r\nthe implementation of such measures.\nBudgetary implication\nThe proposal has\r\nimplications for the Union budget since the duty suspensions will lead to loss\r\nin revenue of the Union's own resources.\nAdditional information\nThe proposal includes a\r\nreview clause.\nThe proposal includes a\r\nsunset clause.\n2013/0266 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nopening and providing for the\r\nadministration of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union on imports of certain\r\nfishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[4],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],\r\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[6],\r\n\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exceptional\r\ngeographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of\r\nsupply of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption\r\nentails additional costs for this sector. This natural handicap, as recognised\r\nin Article 349 of the Treaty, resulting from insularity, remoteness and\r\noutermost location can be remedied, inter alia, by temporarily suspending\r\ncustoms duties on imports of the products in question from third countries\r\nwithin Union autonomous tariff quotas of an appropriate volume.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008[7] opened and provided for the administration\r\nof autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products\r\ninto the Canary Islands for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In September 2012 Spain requested the extension of Union tariff quotas on\r\nimports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands in accordance with\r\nArticle 349 of the Treaty.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Spanish authorities\r\nsubmitted in July 2010 and June 2012 reports on implementation of the measures\r\nreferred in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 645/2008. The Commission has\r\nexamined the impact of the measures on the basis of the aforementioned reports.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reports submitted by\r\nthe Spanish authorities included information on the utilisation rate of the\r\ntariff quotas for the period 2007-2011. This information showed that, on\r\naverage, over the aforementioned period, the tariff quota with order number\r\n09.2997 was almost fully utilised and that the tariff quota with order number\r\n09.2651 was not exhausted.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the tariff quota\r\nwith order number 09.2997 was almost fully utilised and the non-exhaustion of\r\nthe tariff quota with order number 09.2651 could be linked to temporary and exogenous\r\nfactors, it is appropriate to set the quantity of the quotas at the same level.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sharp decline in local\r\ndemand for products covered by tariff quota 09.2651, due to the difficult economic\r\nconditions in the Canary Islands following the economic and financial crises,\r\nmight explain the underutilisation of this quota.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tariff quotas similar to\r\nthose opened with Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 for certain fishery\r\nproducts are warranted because they would cover the needs of the Canary\r\nIslands' domestic market, while ensuring that flows of reduced-duty imports\r\ninto the Union remain predictable and clearly identifiable.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, with the aim of\r\ngiving a long term perspective to economic operators to reach a level of\r\nactivities which stabilises the economic and social environment on the islands,\r\nit is appropriate to extend, for an additional period, the autonomous tariff\r\nquota of the Common Customs Tariff duties for certain goods as detailed in the\r\nAnnex of Regulation (EC) No 645/2008.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid\r\nundermining the integrity and the coherence of the internal market, measures\r\nshould be taken to ensure that fishery products for which suspension is granted\r\nare intended solely for the Canary Islands\u2019 domestic market. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures should be taken to\r\nensure that the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports\r\nin question so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any speculative\r\nmovement or deflection of trade.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers\r\nshould be conferred on the Commission allowing the Commission to temporarily\r\nwithdraw the suspension in case of a deflection of trade. Those powers should\r\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\r\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the\r\nCommission's exercise of implementing powers[8].\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions to be\r\nadopted should ensure continuity with the measures set out in Regulation (EC) No 645/2008,\r\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From 1 January 2014 to 31\r\nDecember 2020, the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the fishery products listed in the Annex shall be suspended in full for\r\nthe quantity indicated in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The suspension referred to\r\nin paragraph 1 shall be granted exclusively for products intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market. It shall only apply to fishery products which are unloaded\r\nfrom ship or aircraft before the customs declaration for release into free\r\ncirculation is submitted to the customs authorities in the Canary Islands.\nArticle 2\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Article 1\r\nshall be managed in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c (1) of Commission\r\nRegulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the\r\nimplementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the\r\nCommunity Customs Code [9].\r\n\nArticle 3\nBy 30 June 2019, the Commission shall\r\nexamine the impact of the measures provided for in Article 1 and, on the basis\r\nof its findings, submit any relevant proposals for the period after 2020.\nArticle 4\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the Commission has\r\nreasons to believe that the suspensions laid down in this Regulation have led\r\nto a deflection of trade for a specific product it may adopt implementing acts,\r\ntemporarily withdrawing the suspension for a period not longer than 12 months.\r\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination\r\nprocedure referred to in Article 5(2).\nImport duties for products for which the\r\nsuspension has been temporarily withdrawn shall be secured by a guarantee, and\r\nthe release of the products concerned for free circulation in the Community of\r\nthe Canary Islands shall be conditional upon the provision of such guarantee.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the 12 month period\r\nreferred to in paragraph 1, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission and\r\nafter consulting the European Parliament should adopt a definitive decision as\r\nto whether maintain or withdraw the suspension.
