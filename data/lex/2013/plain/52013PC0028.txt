The European Council conclusions of January\n2012 highlighted the importance of unleashing the growth potential of a fully\nintegrated Single Market, including measures with regard to network industries.\nThe Commission Communication on Action for Stability, Growth and Jobs adopted\non 30 May 2012 stressed the importance of further reducing the regulatory\nburden and barriers to entry in the rail sector. Likewise, the Commission\nCommunication on strengthening the governance of the Single Market[2], adopted on 6 June 2012, stressed\nthe importance of the transport sector.\nIn the last decade, three legislative \u2018railway\npackages\u2019 have aimed at opening up national markets and making railways more\ncompetitive and interoperable at EU level. Regulation 1370/2007 on public\npassenger transport services by rail and by road, published in December 2007,\nset out a framework for awarding public service contracts and compensating for public\nservice obligations but not a common approach to awarding contracts for rail\npassenger transport. Despite the new EU legislation, the modal share of rail in\nintra-EU transport has remained modest. \n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Problems to be addressed\nStakeholders consider that, under the\ncurrent legal framework, rail passenger services are underperforming in terms\nof quality of service and operational efficiency. 54 % of respondents to the\n2012 Eurobarometer survey were not satisfied with their national and regional\nrail systems. Within the Consumer Scoreboard 2011[3] the overall satisfaction of\ntrain passengers was 6.7/10, well below of the most consumer goods and\nservices. Among consumers rail services score worse than all other transport\nmodes (urban transport and airlines in particular scored better) and are ranked\n27th out of 30 services markets. There are considerable gaps in operational\nefficiency between the best and the worst performing railway systems. These\ngaps reflect significant differences in asset utilisation such as rolling stock\nand infrastructure as well as labour productivity. These operational efficiency\ngaps lead to a substantial need of public funding compared to other economic\nsectors (leaving infrastructure funding aside) as many railway undertakings are\nloss making.\nThere are a number of obstacles to\nimproving railway companies\u2019 quality of service and operational efficiency. These\nrelate first of all to access to the market for domestic passenger services and\nthe lack of competitive pressure. In many Member States this market is closed\nto competition, which not only limits growth, but creates disparities between those\nMember States that have opened their markets and those that have not. Different\nnational approaches to opening of the market for domestic passenger transport\nservices by rail prevent the emergence of a genuine Internal Market for rail\npassenger services.\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of\ndomestic passenger services is not provided on a commercial basis, and is\ntherefore performed under public service contracts. Given that no common EU\nrules on the award of such contracts apply, some Member States have introduced\ncompetitive tendering for these contracts, while others award them directly.\nThis patchwork of regulatory systems in the EU makes it difficult for railway\ncompanies to exploit the full potential of operating in a Internal Market. Therefore,\nthis legislative package also covers competition for public service contracts,\nbarriers to competition such as the availability of suitable rolling stock for\npotential bidders for such contracts, and non-discriminatory access to\ninformation systems and integrated ticketing systems where they benefit the\npassenger.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Objectives\nThe main objective of the European Union\u2019s\ntransport policy is to establish an internal market for transport contributing\nto a high degree of competitiveness and the harmonious, balanced and\nsustainable development of economic activities. The 2011 Transport White Paper stated\nthat rail should account for the majority of medium-distance passenger\ntransport by 2050. This \u2018modal shift\u2019 would contribute to the 20 %\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions provided for in the Europe 2020 Agenda\nfor smart, sustainable and inclusive growth[4].\nThe White Paper concluded that no major change in transport would be possible\nwithout the support of an adequate rail infrastructure and a smarter approach\nto using it.\nThe overall objective of this proposal, as part\nof the Fourth Railway Package, is to improve the quality of rail passenger\nservices and to enhance their operational efficiency, thereby improving the\ncompetitiveness and attractiveness of rail vis-\u00e0-vis other modes and developing\nfurther the Single European Railway Area.\n1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific Objectives\nThis proposal encompasses common rules on\nthe award of public service contracts for passenger transport by rail, together\nwith accompanying measures to increase the success of competitive tendering procedures.\nThe objective of mandatory competitive tendering\nfor public service contracts is to intensify competitive pressure on domestic\nrail markets, in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of\npassenger services. Competitive tendering for rail contracts can also ensure\nbetter value for money spent on public transport services. Common rules on the\naward procedure contribute to creating more uniform business conditions for\nrailway companies. These proposals have to be seen in connection with the\nproposed amendments to Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area\n(recast)[5],\nwhich introduce open access rights for railway undertakings and strengthen\nprovisions on non-discriminatory access to the rail infrastructure.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn order to support the Commission in the\nimpact assessment process, an external consultant was asked to prepare a\nsupport study and to undertake a targeted consultation. The study started in\nDecember 2011 and the final report was delivered in September 2012.\nTo gather the views of stakeholders, a\nbroad mix of targeted consultation methods was preferred to an open\nconsultation. Between 1 March and 16 April 2012, tailored questionnaires were\nsent to 427 rail-related stakeholders (railway undertakings, infrastructure\nmanagers, public transport ministries, safety authorities, ministries,\nrepresentative bodies, workers\u2019 organisations etc.). The views of passengers\nwere collected through a Eurobarometer survey of 25 000 respondents evenly\nspread over the 25 Member States with railways. The network of the Committee of\nthe Regions was used to reach local and regional authorities.\nConsultations were complemented by a\nstakeholder hearing held on 29 May 2012 (with some 85 participants), a\nconference (with some 420 participants) on 24 September 2012 and by interviews\nwith specific stakeholders throughout 2012. Commission staff met\nrepresentatives from Community of European Railways (representing railway companies),\nthe European Passenger Transport Operators, the European Transport Workers Federation,\nthe European Passengers\u2019 Federation, the European Rail Infrastructure Managers\nand UITP \u2014 the International Association of Public Transport). Dedicated\nmeetings with stakeholders were also organised in France, Germany, Netherlands,\nPoland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nThe majority of respondents (60 %)\nagreed that additional new open access rights, compulsory competitive tendering\nor a mix thereof could stimulate market integration. Open access for domestic\nrail passenger transport subject to an economic equilibrium test assessing its possible\nimpact on the viability of public service contracts was the most popular option\n(55 % of respondents) The current arrangements were viewed very negatively\n(with only 20 % supporting them).Workers representatives expect that any opening\nof the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail will result in\nworse working conditions and more strikes.\nRegarding compulsory competitive tendering,\n45 % of respondents favoured flexible options akin to those of the\nnegotiated procedure for public procurement and transitional periods for\ngradually putting all public service contracts out to tender (80% of\nrespondents).\nThe majority of respondents (60 %)\nagreed that the creation of rolling stock leasing companies would help to\nimprove access to rolling stock and a large majority (75 %) called for\nfull access to technical information to be provided by the infrastructure\nmanager. As regards integrated ticketing, there was a preference for\nnon-binding provisions or enabling clauses for voluntary agreements rather than\ncompulsory measures at EU level or at Member State level.\nThe Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee on\nrailways was consulted on 26 March and 19 June, in particular on the options\nand the assessment of their social impact.\nBased on the external study mentioned above\nand on the conclusions of the consultation process, the Commission made a qualitative\nand quantitative assessment of the impacts of the various options for modernising\nthe existing regulatory framework.\nThe impact assessment showed that a\ncombination of the following would fare best in terms of economic,\nenvironmental and social impacts, generating a net present value of between \u20ac21\nand \u20ac29 billion from 2019 to 2035:\n\u2013                        \nbroadly defined open access rights subject to a\ntest of their impact on the economic equilibrium of public service contracts; \n\u2013                        \ncompetitively awarded public service contracts;\n\u2013                        \nvoluntary national integrated ticketing systems;\nand\n\u2013                        \nan obligation on Member States to ensure\nnon-discriminatory access to suitable rolling stock for railway undertakings which\nwant to participate in a public tender procedure. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definition of competent local\nauthority (Article 2, point c)\nThis amendment increases legal certainty by\nspecifying that a \u2018competent local authority\u2019 covers urban agglomerations or rural\ndistricts, not large parts of the national territory.\n3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specifications on how competent\nauthorities define public service obligations and the geographical scope of\npublic service contracts (Article 2, point (e) and new Article 2a)\nThis Article provides a flexible but\nformalised and transparent procedure for defining public service obligations\nand the geographical scope of public service contracts, if competent\nauthorities consider that public intervention is necessary to ensure a\npolitically desirable level of mobility in the territory under their\nresponsibility. It requires competent authorities to establish public transport\nplans defining the objectives of public passenger transport policy and supply\nand performance patterns for public passenger transport. It also requires competent\nauthorities to justify the kind and extent of public service obligations they\nintend to impose on public transport operators and the scope of the public\nservice contract with a view to achieving the objectives defined in the public\ntransport plans. They must apply criteria based on general Treaty principles\nsuch as appropriateness, necessity and proportionality, as well as economic\ncriteria such as cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability. This Article\nalso requires the competent authority to ensure appropriate consultation of\ninterested parties, e.g. passenger and employee organisations and transport\noperators. For rail transport, it requires independent rail regulatory bodies to\nensure legal review of the procedure. In addition, it sets a threshold for the\nmaximum volume of passenger transport by rail under each public service\ncontract, in a flexible manner, in order to ensure effective competition while\ntaking account of the varying size and administrative structure of rail\npassenger markets in Member States.\n3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision of operational,\ntechnical and financial information about passenger transport covered by a\npublic service contract to be put out to tender (Article 4(6) and new Article 4(8))\nThis new provision in Article 4(8) obliges\ncompetent authorities to provide certain operational, technical and financial\ndata to potential bidders for a public service contract so that they can make a\nwell-informed bid and hence ensure enhanced competition. The amendment of\nArticle 4(6) clarifies that competent authorities have to clearly indicate in\nthe tender documents whether they require public service operators to comply\nwith social standards or criteria.\n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upper limits for the direct award\nof small volume contracts and direct awards to small or medium-sized\nenterprises (Article 5(4))\nThis provision introduces specific upper limits\non the value of direct awards for small volume contracts for rail transport.\nThe existing limits are geared to transport by bus and track-based transport\nmodes other than rail. The proposed limit for rail follows the logic of\npermitting direct award if the cost of organising a tender procedure outweighs\nthe expected benefits. The corresponding limit in terms of train-kilometres reflects\nthe average unit cost of rail transport provision.\n3.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mandatory competitive award of\nrail contracts (Article 5(6) and Article 4)\nDeleting Article 5(6) denies competent\nauthorities the option of deciding whether to award a public service contract\nfor rail directly or based on a competitive tender. The general rule of\ncompetitive tendering will also apply to rail. \n3.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restrictions\non award (new Articles 5(6))\nIn order to enhance competition after the\nintroduction of competitive tendering for rail contracts, this provision\nenables competent authorities to decide that contracts for rail passenger\ntransport covering parts of the same network or package of routes will be\nawarded to different railway undertakings. To this end, the competent\nauthorities may decide to limit the number of contracts to be awarded to the\nsame railway undertaking following a competitive tendering procedure.\n3.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Access to rail rolling stock (new\nArticle 5a and new Article 9a)\nIntroducing an obligation on Member States\nto ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to suitable rail rolling\nstock for operators wishing to provide public passenger services by rail\naddresses a major barrier to effective competition for public service\ncontracts. In Member States where there are no well-functioning leasing markets\nfor rail rolling stock it is up to competent authorities to take measures to\nensure access to rolling stock in order to open up the market. However, as the\nsituation and needs may vary from country to country, the new provision leaves\ncompetent authorities broad scope to choose the most appropriate ways of\nachieving the objective, while indicating the most frequently used measures.\nThe details of the procedure and measures to ensure access to rolling stock\nshall be defined in implementing acts based on the examination procedure\nreferred to in Article 9a of this Regulation.\n3.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Publication of certain\ninformation on public service contracts (Articles 7(1) and 7(2))\nThis provision obliges competent authorities\nto include information about the starting date and duration of public service\ncontracts in their annual reports on public service obligations as well as in\ntheir prior information notices on envisaged tender procedures. This additional\ninformation and the obligation on Member States to facilitate access to the\nannual reports published by competent authorities will increase transparency regarding\nthe public service contracts awarded and likely new awards, and hence help transport\noperators prepare for future tender procedures.\n3.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition period applied to\ncompetitive tendering (Article 8(2))\nThis provision makes it clear that the ten-year\ntransitional period to 2 December 2019 applies only to Article 5(3) on the\nobligation on competent authorities to organise a competitive tendering procedure.\nAll other provisions of Article 5 (e.g. on the option of making a direct award\nto an internal operator, for a small-volume contract or as an emergency measure,\nand legal review of the award decision) are immediately applicable.\n3.10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition period for existing\ndirectly awarded rail contracts (new Article 8(2a))\nThis provision introduces an additional\ntransitional period for public service rail contracts that are directly awarded\nbetween 1 January 2013 and 2 December 2019. Those contracts may remain in place\nuntil they expire but only up to 31 December 2022 at the latest. This gives\nthose railway undertakings that have been directly awarded a public service\ncontract sufficient time to adapt and prepare for competitive tendering procedures.\n3.11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adaptions of provisions of\nRegulation 1370/2007 related to the exemption of state aid notification and the\nconditions of state aid compatibility due to Treaty requirements\nIn its proposed draft amendments to\nRegulation (EC) No 994/98 (Enabling Regulation)[6],\nthe Commission proposed also an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007\nbringing, in accordance with the procedures foreseen in Articles 108(4) and 109\nof the Treaty, aid for the coordination of transport or reimbursement for the\ndischarge of certain obligations inherent in the concept of a public service as\nreferred to in Article 93 of the Treaty under the scope of the Enabling\nRegulation. The Commission currently expects a\nconsequential, future block exemption Regulation to reproduce the substance of\nthe current exemption, except to the extent that Regulation 1370/2007 is\namended by this legislative proposal relating to the rail sector.\n2013/0028 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007\nconcerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services\nby rail\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[7],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[8],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the past decade, the\ngrowth of passenger traffic by rail has been insufficient to increase its modal\nshare in comparison to cars and aviation. The 6% modal share of passenger\ntransport for rail in the European Union has remained fairly stable. Rail\npassenger services have not kept pace with evolving needs in terms of\navailability and quality.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union market for\ninternational passenger transport services by rail has been opened to\ncompetition since 2010. In addition, some Member States have opened their\ndomestic passenger services to competition, by introducing open access rights\nor tendering for public service contracts or both.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its White Paper on\ntransport policy of 28 March 2011[9]\nthe Commission announced its intention to complete the internal railway market,\nallowing railway undertakings of the Union to provide all types of rail\ntransport services without unnecessary technical and administrative barriers. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When competent authorities\norganise their public passenger transport services they need to ensure that\npublic service obligations and the geographical scope of public service\ncontracts are appropriate, necessary and proportionate to achieve the\nobjectives of the public passenger transport policy in their territory. This\npolicy should be set out in public transport plans leaving scope for market\nbased transport solutions. The process of defining public transport plans and\npublic service obligations should be made transparent to relevant stakeholders\nincluding potential market entrants.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure sound financing\nto meet the objectives of public transport plans, competent authorities need to\ndesign public service obligations to attain public transport objectives in a\ncost-effective manner taking account of the compensation for the net financial\neffect of those obligations and they need to ensure long-term financial sustainability\nof public transport provided under public service contracts.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is particularly\nimportant that competent authorities comply with these criteria for public\nservice obligations and the scope of public service contracts if the market for\npublic passenger transport by rail is to run smoothly, because open access\ntransport operations need to be well coordinated with those under public\nservice contract. For this reason, the independent rail regulatory body should\nensure that this process is correctly applied and transparent.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A maximum annual volume of\na public service contract for passenger transport by rail needs to be set to\nfacilitate competition for such contracts while allowing competent authorities\nsome flexibility to optimise the volume according to economic and operational\nconsiderations.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To facilitate the\npreparation of tenders, and hence enhance competition competent authorities\nneed to ensure that all public service operators interested in making such a\nsubmission receive certain information on the transport services and\ninfrastructure covered by the public service contract.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain upper limits for\nthe direct award of public service contracts need to be adapted for rail\ntransport to the specific economic conditions under which tender procedures\ntake place in this sector.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The establishment of an\nInternal Market for passenger transport services by rail requires common rules\non competitive tendering for public service contracts in this sector to be\napplied in a harmonised manner in all Member States.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of creating\nframework conditions for enabling society to fully reap the benefits of\neffective opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by\nrail it is important that Member States ensure an adequate level of social\nprotection for the staff of public service operators.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the market does not\nensure it under suitable economic and non-discriminatory conditions, public\nservice operators' access to rail rolling stock needs to be facilitated by competent\nauthorities through adequate and effective measures.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain key features of\nupcoming tender procedures for public service contracts need to be fully\ntransparent to enable a better organised market response.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistent with the\ninternal logic of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007, it should be made clear that\nthe transitional period until 2 December 2019 refers only to the obligation to\norganise competitive tendering procedures for public service contracts.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preparing railway\nundertakings for mandatory competitive tendering for public service contracts\nrequires some extra time to allow effective and sustainable internal\nrestructuring of companies to which such contracts were directly awarded in the\npast. Transitional measures are therefore necessary for contracts directly\nawarded between the date of entry into force of this Regulation and 3 December\n2019.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once opening of the market\nfor domestic passenger transport services by rail is achieved, as competent\nauthorities may need to take measures to ensure a high level of competition by\nlimiting the number of contracts that it awards to one railway undertaking,\nadequate provisions should be provided for.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of Article 5a of this Regulation,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and\ngeneral principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of\nthe Commission's exercise of implementing powers[10].\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of\namendments to the Regulation (EC) No 994/98 (Enabling Regulation)[11],\nthe Commission proposed also an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007\n(COM(2012) 730/3). In order to harmonize the approach to block exemption\nregulations in the field of State aid and, in accordance with the procedures\nforeseen in Articles 108(4) and 109 of the Treaty, aid for the coordination of\ntransport or reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations inherent in\nthe concept of a public service as referred to in Article 93 of the Treaty\nshould be brought under the scope of the Enabling Regulation.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\n(EC) No 1370/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1370/2007 is amended as\nfollows:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a) Point (c) of Article 2\nis replaced by the following:\n\"(c) \"competent local authority\"\nmeans any competent authority whose geographical area of competence is not\nnational and which covers the transport needs of an urban agglomeration or a\nrural district;\"\nb) Point (e) of Article 2 is complemented by\nthe following:\n\"The scope of public service obligations\nshall exclude all public transport services that go beyond of what is necessary\nto reap local, regional or sub-national network effects. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following Article 2a is\ninserted:\n\"Article 2a \nPublic transport plans and public service\nobligations\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent authorities shall establish\nand regularly update public passenger transport plans covering all relevant\ntransport modes for the territory for which they are responsible.
