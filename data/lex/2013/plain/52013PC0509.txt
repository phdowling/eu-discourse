Its\nstrong commitment to supporting\npartner countries dates back to 1957, when the Treaties of Rome first\nestablished a European development policy.\nThe Lisbon Treaty has firmly anchored development\npolicies, with their overall objective of poverty eradication, in the EU\u2019s\nexternal action in support of its interest in a stable and prosperous world. Development\ncooperation is also part of the Europe 2020 Strategy.\nLastly, important\nEU policy initiatives such as Policy Coherence for Development and Aid\nEffectiveness have consistently contributed to improving the programming and\nimplementation of EU development cooperation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A EUROPEAN YEAR FOR\nDEVELOPMENT\n\u00b7      Challenges\nDespite this strong commitment to supporting\npartner countries, EU citizens often lack information on development\ncooperation, why it is needed and on the added value of development policies at\nEU level. The October 2012 Eurobarometer\nsurvey highlighted significant areas of ignorance, with 53 % of respondents\nindicating that they know nothing about where EU aid goes (44 % are unaware\nof where their country\u2019s bilateral aid goes)[2].\nThe survey also showed that\npersonal commitment is decreasing slightly and that perceptions of development\ncooperation and the importance attached to it differ across the EU.\nIn a rapidly changing\nworld, people need information as to how an outward-looking Europe can help to\nensure global sustainability. It is important to raise European citizens\u2019 awareness\nof our global interdependence. In general, EU citizens are keen to understand how\nthey can make a difference and being informed is the first step towards taking action.\nDevelopment policies have undergone\na paradigm shift in recent years. Moving away from the traditional\ndonor-beneficiary relationship, the emphasis today is increasingly on an\napproach to global challenges of mutual interest which is based on parity with\npartner countries.\nNevertheless, major EU\ndevelopment policy objectives need public commitment. Given the strains of the\nglobal crisis, for instance, strong public opinion may help to achieve the target\nof channelling 0.7 % of GNP to development funding[3].\nFurthermore, the importance\nattached to development cooperation varies from one Member State to the next.\nThe EYD2015 is an opportunity to improve the level of information in all Member\nStates. The approach will address the different national target groups. With\nthis in mind, the involvement of Member States and the EU Representations will\nbe particularly important.\nThe fact that the EU is a\nglobal player and vector for change is important to continued support for its development\npolicy. The EU needs to be seen to be coordinating and cooperating with Member\nStates and other donors. Citizens are largely unaware of the effectiveness and\npositive effects of aid and this needs to be presented in less technical terms.\n\u00b7      Opportunities\nOrganising the European Year of Development specifically\nin 2015 will require significant additional effort, but also represent an\nopportunity to mobilise Europe-wide momentum both among policy-makers and EU\ncitizens at large. The EYD2015 can generate greater public awareness and put the\nEU\u2019s international development role in the spotlight. It can also raise the level\nof knowledge in the population at large as to how development, sustainable\ndevelopment, climate change, food security, biodiversity, and other relevant\nissues are interrelated, and how this affects the poorest people on the planet\nand promote the concept of policy coherence. It can tie in with all the\ncommunication initiatives that Member States and other actors in development\ncooperation are no doubt planning for that year in particular.\nAs shown in the\nEurobarometer, the evident need to improve communications on the EU\u2019s\ndevelopment cooperation is matched by an overall receptiveness on the part of\nEU citizens to helping the poor in partner countries. Support for helping\npartner countries is consistently high (85 %). More than six out of ten\nEuropeans think that aid to partner countries should be increased. However,\ncommunication strategies on EU development cooperation always need to be geared\nto national circumstances.\nThe EU has a broad and\nactive network of non-governmental development cooperation organisations which\nliaise closely with EU institutions. The NGOs have a key role to play in\naddressing and involving EU citizens.\nThe private sector and\ninternational foundations are increasingly active in development cooperation\nand international opinion leaders are becoming important players as regards development\naid. They are influential in creating synergies, including in terms of\ncommunicating on development cooperation to a wider audience.\nThe dense network of\nEuropean Union Delegations all over the world makes it possible to gather information\non the results of EU development cooperation and disseminate it in partner\ncountries.\nThe EYD2015 will help to give leverage to the\nongoing communication efforts on EU development cooperation. It will reinforce the\nvisibility and results-based focus of that cooperation.\n\u00b7      Objectives and proposed activities\nThe aim of the EYD2015 is to inform EU citizens\nabout EU development cooperation, highlighting what the European Union can\nalready achieve as the biggest aid donor in the world and how it could do even\nmore with the combined strength of its Member States and its institutions.\nThe EYD2015 seeks to\nstimulate the active interest of European citizens in development cooperation\nand foster a sense of responsibility and opportunity as regards their participation\nin policy formulation and implementation.\nIt will raise awareness of the role of EU development\ncooperation, which brings a wide range of benefits not only for recipients but\nalso for EU citizens, in a changing and increasingly interdependent world.\nThe main messages to be conveyed during the year\nshould flow from the recent Communications Increasing the impact of EU\nDevelopment Policy: an Agenda for Change and A decent life for all,\nending poverty and giving the world a sustainable future[4].\nA broad approach, covering both EU development\ncooperation and humanitarian aid, will be taken to communicating about EU aid\nin during the EYD2015. Where possible, action for the\nEYD2015 will be designed and implemented with strategic partners. Existing fora\nwill be used to promote the EYD2015, therefore, but innovative partnerships\nshould also be sought.\nAll activities should be as close as possible\nto citizens in and outside the EU and be easily understood by them. Specific\ntarget groups, including young people, will be addressed in order to have a\ngreater impact.\nAs far as possible, advantage\nwill be taken of existing communication initiatives, e.g. European\nDevelopment Days, the Development Education and Awareness Raising (DEAR)\ninitiative, awards such as the Lorenzo Natali Prize or publications on EU\ndevelopment cooperation such as EuropeAid\u2019s Annual Report.\nActivities in other policy\nfields, e.g. external relations, trade, enlargement, employment and social\npolicy, education and culture, health, agriculture, and research and innovation,\nalready contribute directly or indirectly to promoting development. The\nCommission will draw on these activities to add to the impact of the EYD2015.\nAs in previous European\nYears, additional measures will include communication campaigns, conferences,\nevents, initiatives, studies and surveys at European, national, regional and\nlocal level, to convey key messages, disseminate information on EU development\ncooperation and invite EU citizens to participate and actively contribute. The\nCommission may identify other activities to contribute to the objectives of the\nEYD2015.\nAction under the EYD2015 needs to be tailored\nto the needs and circumstances of individual Member States. Lessons from\nprevious European Years will be taken into account. Member States are invited\nto appoint a national EYD2015 coordinator. National coordinators will consult closely\nwith a wide range of stakeholders and, where appropriate, act as the national\nagencies or contact points for the relevant EU activities.\nEYD2015 action taken together with Member\nStates will take into consideration each country\u2019s existing communication\nstrategies. Member States will thus be invited to communicate on EU development\ncooperation in the widest sense.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF\nCONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES\nIn May 2011, responding to an initial proposal\nby the European NGO Confederation for Relief and Development (CONCORD), the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee proposed designating 2015 the European\nYear for Development.\nIn October 2012, the European Parliament called\non the Commission to make 2015 the European Year for Development, expressing\nits hope that this would raise the profile of development cooperation.\nThe Commission services and the External Action\nService have been informally consulted on the idea of the EYD2015.\nThe European Parliament and Member States have\nbeen informally contacted on the organisation of the EYD2015.\nThe EYD2015 is an item on the agenda for the\nregular meeting with Member States\u2019 Directors-General responsible for\ndevelopment in June 2013.\nDiscussions on organisation have been held with\nthe inter-institutional EYD2015 task force made up of representatives of\nCONCORD, the European Economic Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions,\nMembers of the European Parliament and Member States.\nPlans for the EYD2015 have been shared with the\nDevelopment Education Awareness Raising (DEAR) forum, which aims to strengthen\nNGOs\u2019 awareness-raising capacities and educate and involve the European public in\nworldwide poverty eradication and social inclusion. The substance of the\ninitiative is widely welcomed, and the growing number of requests for further\ninformation and active support indicate that there is strong demand for it.\nGiven the external relations dimension of the\nEYD2015, informal discussions have also taken place with international\norganisations.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticle 209 TFEU provides the legal basis for\nthe development and implementation by the EU of its development policy, as\ndefined in Article 208.\nArticle 210 TFEU provides that, in order to\npromote the complementarity and efficiency of their action, the Union and the\nMember States should coordinate their development cooperation policies and consult\neach other on their aid programmes, including in international organisations\nand during international conferences. They may undertake joint action. Member\nStates should contribute if necessary to the implementation of Union aid\nprogrammes. The Commission may take any useful initiative to promote the\ncoordination.\nThe main purpose of the proposal for a decision\non the EYD 2015 is to raise public awareness of the added value of a European\ndimension in cooperation in view of global interdependence and changing EU development\npolicy.\nAs such, this objective falls within the ambit\nof both articles mentioned above.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe primary responsibility for raising\ncitizen\u2019s awareness of development issues rests with Member States. Action at\nUnion level complements and supplements national actions in this respect, as\nhighlighted in the political declaration Communicating Europe in Partnership\nsigned on 22 October 2008 by the European Parliament, the Council and the\nCommission[5]. Since, due to the need for multilateral partnerships,\ntransnational exchange of information and Union-wide awareness-raising and\ndissemination of good practices, the objectives of the European Year of\nDevelopment cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore,\ngiven the scale of the European Year of Development, be better achieved at\nUnion level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. \n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe action to be implemented in the proposed\nEuropean Year does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.\nThe proposal therefore respects the principle of proportionality, as set out in\nArticle 5 TEU.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe flexibility for annual or multiannual\npriority-setting based on the Commission\u2019s budget lines and programmes provides\nsufficient financial margin for running the EYD2015 under the current preliminary\nplanning (see Annex).\n2013/0238 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Year of Development (2015)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 209 and Article\n210(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[7],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development cooperation\nconsists of promoting human development and the fulfilment of human beings in\nall respects, including the cultural dimension[8].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union has\nbeen providing development cooperation aid since 1957 and is the largest donor\nof official development aid in the world.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Lisbon Treaty has\nfirmly anchored development policy within EU external action in support of the EU\u2019s\ninterest in a stable and prosperous world. Development policy also helps\naddress other global challenges and contributes to the EU-2020 Strategy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU has been a leader\nin formulating and implementing the concept of policy coherence for development,\nwhich aims at strengthening synergies between non-aid policies and development\nobjectives. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fight against poverty\nremains the primary objective of the European Union\u2019s development policy, as\nlaid down in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 208 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2000, the international\ncommunity undertook to take concrete steps by 2015 to fight poverty, with the\nadoption of the Millennium Development Goals, objectives which were accepted by\nthe Union and its Member States.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The world has undergone\nenormous change over recent years, including major shifts in the global\neconomic and political balance. New actors, including private and other\nnon-governmental players, have emerged in the global arena. While developed and\nemerging economies account for most of global GDP, the latter have now become\nthe key drivers of global growth and already have a significant impact on the\nworld economy.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continued support for\ndevelopment cooperation is vital in a rapidly changing world. Around 1.3\nbillion people still live in extreme income poverty and the human development\nneeds of many more are still not being met. Inequalities within countries have\nincreased in most parts of the world. The natural environment is under\nincreasing pressure and the developing countries are hit particularly hard by\nthe effects of climate change. These challenges are universal and inter-related\nand need to be addressed by all countries acting together.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discussions on the post-2015\nframework have started and the European Commission has set out its views in the\nCommunication A decent life for all, ending poverty and giving the world a\nsustainable future[9].\nThis policy proposal aims to address the shortcomings of the current\ndevelopment framework and set out a common approach to bringing together poverty\neradication and sustainability concerns in an overarching international\nframework. It builds on the 2011 Communication Increasing the impact of EU\nDevelopment Policy: an Agenda for Change[10],\nwhich has already resulted in a major reorientation of EU development policies.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A European Year of\nDevelopment in 2015 will provide a timely opportunity to raise general public awareness\nof the current orientation of European development policy. Information is\nneeded on how an outward-looking Europe can help to ensure global\nsustainability. This includes raising awareness of global interdependence and\nillustrating that development is more than just aid.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2015 should be an\nemblematic and pivotal year, being the last year for achieving the collectively\nagreed Millennium Development Goals and thus offering a unique opportunity to\ntake stock of the international commitments from 2000. 2015 will also be the\nyear in which a major international decision should be taken on the development\nframework that will replace the MDG framework over the coming decades.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same year could also be\nthe appropriate time to present the results of EU development policy following\nimplementation of the principles set out in the Agenda for Change Communication\nadopted in 2011.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key to the successful\nimpact of Union action for development is the extent to which it enjoys broad\npopular and political support. The European Year should therefore act as a\ncatalyst for raising awareness, building momentum and exchanging best practices\nbetween Member States, local and regional authorities, civil society, social\npartners and international entities and organisations involved in development\nissues. It should help to focus political attention and mobilise everyone\nconcerned in order to drive forward and promote further action and initiatives\nat Union and Member State level, in association with the beneficiaries of aid\ndevelopment and their representatives.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nOctober 2012 Eurobarometer[11] showed strong support from EU citizens for helping people in\npartner countries (85 %). In spite of the current economic climate, more\nthan six out of ten Europeans think that aid for people in partner countries should\nbe increased. At the same time, the Eurobarometer showed clearly that there is\na lack of knowledge on EU development cooperation, which calls for better communication.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its resolution of 23\nOctober 2012[12],\nthe European Parliament invited the Commission to make 2015 the European Year\nof Development, expressing its hope that this would raise the profile of development\ncooperation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Efficient coordination between\nall partners contributing at Union, national, regional and local levels is a\nfundamental prerequisite for an effective European Year. Local and regional\npartners have a particular role to play in promoting EU development policy.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The differing national\nsocioeconomic and cultural contexts and sensitivities call for some of the\nactivities of the European Year to be decentralised to national level, in\naccordance with Article 58 of the Financial Regulation[13]. However,\nthe setting of policy priorities at national level should be coordinated by the\nCommission with a view to guaranteeing consistency with the strategic\nobjectives of the European Year.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in the European\nYear activities to be financed should be open to the Member States and the candidate\ncountries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, in accordance with the\ngeneral principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of\nthose countries in Union programmes as laid down in the Framework Agreement and\nin Association Council decisions, respectively.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency and\ncomplementarity with other Union action should be ensured, in particular with\nthe Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) including the Development\nEducation and Awareness Raising programme (DEAR) programme, the European\nDevelopment Fund (EDF), the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument (ENPI)\nand other EU financing instruments for external action where relevant to\ndevelopment policy.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfinancial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate\nmeasures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection\nand investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid\nor incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial\npenalties in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 966/2012[14] of the European Parliament and\nof the Council on the financial rules applicable to the annual budget of the\nUnion.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to optimise the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the activities envisaged for the European Year\nof Development, it is important that a set of preparatory actions be carried\nout in 2013 and 2014.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has already\ntaken various initiatives to promote development policies and inform citizens\nabout its development cooperation. These existing initiatives should be used as\nmuch as possible for the European Year 2015.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The primary responsibility\nfor raising citizens\u2019 awareness of development issues rests with Member States.\nAction at Union level complements and supplements national actions in this\nrespect, as highlighted in the political declaration Communicating Europe in\nPartnership signed on 22 October 2008 by the European Parliament, the\nCouncil and the Commission[15].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since, due to the need for\nmultilateral partnerships, transnational exchange of information and Union-wide\nawareness-raising and dissemination of good practices, the objectives of the\nEuropean Year of Development cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\nStates and can therefore, given the scale of the European Year of Development,\nbe better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSubject\n2015 shall be designated the \u2018European Year\nof Development\u2019 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the European Year\u2019).\nArticle 2\nObjectives\nThe general purpose of the European Year\nshall be:\n\u2013                        \nto inform EU citizens about EU development\ncooperation, highlighting what the European Union can already achieve as the\nbiggest aid donor in the world and how it could do even more with the combined\nstrength of its Member States and its institutions.\n\u2013                        \nto stimulate the active interest of European\ncitizens in development cooperation and foster a sense of responsibility and\nopportunity as regards their participation in policy formulation and\nimplementation; and\n\u2013                        \nto raise awareness of the role of EU development\ncooperation, which brings a wide range of benefits not only for recipients but\nalso for EU citizens, in a changing and increasingly interdependent world.\nArticle 3\nInitiatives involved\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures taken to\nachieve the objectives set out in Article 2 may include the following\ninitiatives organised at Union, national, regional or local level, as detailed\nin the Annex to this Decision:\n\u2013              \ncommunication campaigns to disseminate key\nmessages targeted at the general public and more specific audiences, including\nthrough social media;\n\u2013              \nthe organisation of conferences, events and\ninitiatives with all relevant stakeholders, to promote active participation and\ndebate, and to raise awareness at European level;\n\u2013              \nconcrete initiatives in the Member States aimed\nat promoting the objectives of the European Year, in particular through the exchange\nof information and sharing of experience and good practices among national,\nregional, local administrations and other organisations;
