Barriers to investment and\nmarket entry can be lowered by allowing for more intensive usage of existing\nphysical infrastructures, enhanced cooperation on planned civil works,\nstreamlining permit granting procedures and by removing obstacles to\nhigh-speed-ready in-building infrastructure.\nThis initiative therefore addresses four\nmain problem areas: (1) inefficiencies or bottlenecks concerning the use of\nexisting physical infrastructure (such as, for example, ducts, conduits, manholes,\ncabinets, poles, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions),\n(2) bottlenecks related to co-deployment, (3) inefficiencies regarding\nadministrative permit granting, and, finally (4) bottlenecks concerning\nin-building deployment.\nAs each problem area is linked to a\nspecific step in the rollout process, tackling these problems areas together\nwill result in a set of coherent and mutually reinforcing actions. A study\nestimates that if measures were taken to address the identified set of problem\nareas, the potential Capex savings to operators are in the range of 20\u201330% of\ntotal investment costs[2],\ni.e. up to 63 billion \u20ac by 2020[3].\nIn order to maximise synergies across\nnetworks, the regulation is addressed not only to electronic communications\nnetwork providers but to any owner of physical infrastructures, such as\nelectricity, gas, water and sewage, heating and transport services, suitable to\nhost electronic communications network elements, \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\ncontext\nAccording to the 2010 report on the Single\nMarket,[4]\ntelecommunications services and infrastructures in the EU are still highly\nfragmented along national borders. A more recent report on the cost of\nnon-Europe in the electronic communications sector [5] has shown that the untapped\npotential of the Single Market corresponds to a yearly amount of 0.9% GDP, or\n110 billion euros. \nHigh-speed broadband infrastructure is the\nbackbone of the Digital Single Market and a precondition for worldwide\ncompetitiveness, i.a. in the field of e-Commerce. As recalled in the Single\nMarket Act II Communication,[6]\na 10% increase in broadband penetration can result in a 1-1,5 % increase in the\nGDP annually and 1,5% labour productivity gains,[7]\nand broadband-induced innovation in companies creates\nemployment and has the potential to generate 2 million extra jobs by 2020.[8]\nA significant fraction of this untapped\npotential can be found at the level of network infrastructures: different\nregulatory approaches to network roll-out increase the cost of access to\nnational markets, prevent the exploitation of economies of scale at services\nand equipment level and hinder the development of innovative services which\ncould emerge on very high-speed networks running in a seamless fashion across\nborders. While the deployment of access networks often involves provisions and\nprocedures administered at local level, such measures, including local\nsecondary legislation may indirectly affect the freedom to provide services and\njustify Union intervention[9].\nFurthermore, based on Article 114 of the TFEU, the Union has previously\nlegislated, in order to foster local network infrastructure deployment, through\nunbundling of the local loop[10]\n\nThe Union cannot afford to leave citizens\nand businesses outside the footprint of such infrastructures and has subscribed\nto ambitious broadband targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe: by 2013, basic\nbroadband for all Europeans, and by 2020, (i) access to speeds of above 30 Mbps\nfor all Europeans, and (ii) subscription of internet connection above 100 Mbps for\n50% or more of European households. These goals will only be achieved if the\ninfrastructure deployment costs are lowered across the EU. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Political\nbackground \nThe Digital Agenda for Europe is a flagship\ninitiative under the Europe 2020 Strategy aimed at delivering sustainable\neconomic and social benefits from a digital single market based on fast and\nultra-fast Internet and interoperable applications. \nIt identified in particular the need to\nlower the costs of broadband deployment in the entire Union territory,\nincluding by achieving proper planning and coordination and by reducing\nadministrative burdens.[11]\nThe European Council of 1 and 2 March 2012\ncalled for action at the Union level to provide better broadband coverage,\nincluding by reducing the cost of high-speed broadband infrastructure.[12] \nThe Communication \"Single Market Act\nII: Together for new growth\" identified the initiative as one of 12 key\nactions that will boost growth, employment and confidence in the Single Market\nand generate real effects on the ground[13].\nIn the Single Market Act II, adoption of the Commission proposal is foreseen\nfor the first quarter of 2013. The European Council of 13 and 14 December 2012\ncalled on the Commission to present all key proposals by the spring of 2013.[14]\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public\nconsultation of interested parties\nThe Commission services held a public\nconsultation from 27 April to 20 July 2012, inviting interested parties to give\ntheir views on five sets of questions, covering the entire chain of network\ndeployment, from the planning phase to the connection of end-users.[15] \nOver a hundred written replies were\nsubmitted by different types of stakeholders from 26 countries across the EU\nand EFTA. The largest categories of respondents were electronic communications\nproviders (27) and their trade associations (14) as well as public bodies,\nincluding central (22, including 6 National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs)) and\nlocal authorities (9). Other utilities (7) provided their input mainly via\ntrade associations. Equipment manufacturers (5) and engineering and ICT trade\nassociations (6) also replied. \nIn general terms, the respondents\nfavourably received the Commission's intention for an initiative to address\ncivil engineering costs for broadband roll-out across the single market. A\nmajority of the respondents confirmed existing inefficiencies and bottlenecks\nas well as the potential for cost reduction. The existence of problems and the\nneed for action were clearly admitted by stakeholders. Several solutions were\nproposed, some very ambitious and some more moderate.\nIn addition to the public consultation, the\nCommission services established an Internet discussion platform for\ncrowdsourcing ideas of interested parties.[16]\nThe Commission services have maintained\nregular contacts with major stakeholders, both public and private, across the\nsectors concerned.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Studies\nand other sources of information\nThe Commission services commissioned two\nstudies, respectively, by Deloitte on cost reduction practices with regard to\nbroadband passive infrastructure roll-out,[17]\nand by Analysys Mason to support an impact assessment to accompany the present\nproposal.[18]\nFurthermore, the Commission services drew\nupon additional information sources, studies and national best practices\n(including of Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden and United Kingdom)[19].\nDetailed information was also collected by the responsible Commission services\nvia the National Regulatory Authorities.\n2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assessment\nof the impact of the proposed Regulation\nThe Commission services have carried out an\nimpact assessment.[20]\nFour policy options were chosen for further analysis: \nOption 1: Business as usual: maintaining\nthe current approach of monitoring, enforcement and guidance.\nOption 2: Promote efficiency gains within\nthe telecom sector: recommending measures towards a more coherent and\nharmonised application by National Regulatory Authorities of the regulatory framework\nfor electronic communications.\nOption 3: Enable efficiency gains across\nsectors: proposal for a Regulation aiming at unlocking the potential of\ncross-sector cooperation (two sub-options, 3a and 3b, foresee, respectively, a\nRegulation only and a combination of a Regulation and a Recommendation).\nOption 4: Mandate efficiency gains:\nproposal for legislation complementing the current regulatory framework to\nmandate measures going beyond option 3, such as infrastructure atlases,\ncost-oriented infrastructure access, mandated cooperation in civil engineering\nworks even when not financed by public means, and installation of\nhigh-speed-ready infrastructure also in old buildings. \nThe analysis of the options focuses in\nparticular on the costs and benefits incurred by direct stakeholders, the\nexpected effects on network investment and broadband rollout, and broader\nmacro-economic analysis of effects on consumer welfare, growth,\ncompetitiveness, and the Single Market.\nThe Impact Assessment Report concludes that\noption 3a is the best option available, given its effectiveness towards the\nidentified objects, costs-benefits analysis, efficiency and coherence of\nexploiting the cost reduction potential with general EU policy objectives, in\naccordance with proportionality and subsidiarity principles. \nFor the choice of the proposed instrument,\nsee section 3.4, below.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\nbasis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This is justified by the\nobjectives of the proposal, which seek to improve the conditions for the\nestablishment and functioning of the internal market.\nFurthermore, as confirmed by case law, this\narticle confers on the legislature of the Union the discretion, depending on\nthe general context and the specific circumstances of the matter to be\nharmonised, as regards the harmonisation technique most appropriate for\nachieving the desired result, in particular in fields that are characterised by\ncomplex technical features.[21]\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\n\nThe proposed European intervention to\nreduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications\ninfrastructure is justified by the subsidiarity principle. \nThe subsidiarity principle pursues two\naims. On the one hand, it allows the Union to act if a problem cannot be\nadequately settled by the Member States acting on their own. On the other hand,\nit seeks to uphold the authority of the Member States in those areas that\ncannot be dealt with more effectively by Union action. The purpose is to bring\ndecision-making within the Union as close to the citizen as possible.\nThe proposed Regulation focuses on the\ndefinition of specific directly applicable rights and obligations in order to\nfacilitate the planning and execution of physical infrastructure rollout and\ncivil works, including ancillary provisions to ensure transparency of relevant\ninformation and coordination of administrative procedures. In addition to this,\nit provides requirements for in-building physical infrastructure for new buildings\nand major renovations.\nThe envisaged measures build on existing\nbest practice in several Member States, such as those concerning the re-use of\nexisting physical infrastructures in Lithuania and Portugal, transparency of\nexisting infrastructure in Belgium and Germany, co-deployment in Finland and\nSweden, the streamlining of rights of way and administrative procedures in the\nNetherlands and Poland, and high-speed broadband infrastructure in new\nbuildings in Spain and France[22].\nSome Member States have introduced measures that to some extent go even beyond\nthe ones proposed, such as the one-stop-shop in Greece. The proposed Regulation\nis without prejudice to such more detailed provisions set out by national law. \nThe proposed Regulation is also without prejudice\nto any specific regulatory measure, including the imposition of remedies on\nundertakings having significant market power, taken by the national regulatory\nauthorities under the Union regulatory framework for electronic communications.\n\nThe proposed measures are necessary at the\nlevel of the Union to improve the conditions for the establishment and\nfunctioning of the internal market, in order to:\n\u2013                        \nremove barriers to the functioning of the Single\nMarket caused by the patchwork of rules and administrative practices at\nnational and sub-national levels, which impedes the development and growth of\nEuropean companies, has a negative impact on European competitiveness, and\ncreates barriers to invest and operate cross-border, and thus obstructs the\nfreedom to provide electronic communications services and networks as\nguaranteed under existing Union legislation. As an illustration, scattered and\nnon-transparent regulatory approaches to network rollout increase the cost of\naccess to each national market. Such fragmentation constitutes an obstacle for\nmultinational companies as well as national companies, willing to reach\neconomies of scale at European level in the face of increasingly global\ncompetition. It also hinders the development of innovative services which could\nemerge on very high-speed networks running in a seamless fashion across\nborders. \n\u2013                        \nstimulate ubiquitous broadband coverage, which\nis a pre-condition for the development of the Digital Single Market, thus\ncontributing to the removal of an important obstacle to the completion of the\nSingle Market while at the same time contributing to territorial cohesion.\nThese goals will only be achieved if the infrastructure deployment costs are\nlowered across the EU;\n\u2013                        \nturn into reality the significant untapped potential\nof cost-reduction and facilitation of broadband rollout, including by scaling\nup existing best practices across the EU whenever available.\n\u2013                        \nstreamline the efficient planning and investment\nprocesses on a large scale, thus facilitating the development of pan-European\noperators. \n\u2013                        \nensure equal treatment and non-discrimination of\nundertakings as well as of investors, in line with \"those objectives and\ntasks closely linked to the subject-matter\"[23] of several instruments already\nprovided for in the EU law, in particular concerning the electronic\ncommunications sector[24]\nbut also concerning other sectors (e.g. utility companies seeking to make\nprofit from their physical infrastructure, synergies in setting up smart\ngrids).\nSeveral arrangements have been made for this\nproposal to comply with the principle of subsidiarity. \n\u2013                        \nFirstly, Member States may maintain or adopt\nmore detailed provisions further specifying or complementing the obligations\nprovided for in the proposed Regulation, e.g. with regard to access to existing\ninfrastructures, coordination of civil works and co-deployment. \n\u2013                        \nMoreover, while the tasks created by the\nproposed Regulation are assigned by default to the independent NRA under the\nelectronic communications regulatory framework, in view of its expertise and\nindependence, Member States may appoint different competent bodies in\naccordance with the domestic constitutional system of attribution of\ncompetences and powers[25],\nat an optimal level of aggregation, where valuable efficiencies may be ensured\nin view of the tasks assigned. This applies to all of the tasks foreseen under\nthe regulation: the information point on permit granting, transparency and\ndispute resolution. \n\u2013                        \nSecondly, with regard to transparency of\nexisting physical infrastructure, while a number of Member States have put in\nplace different mapping initiatives, in the form of GIS (Geographic Information\nSystems) applications covering in some Member States not only the electronic\ncommunications infrastructure, but also physical infrastructure of other\nutilities, this proposal does not require Member States to undertake such a\nmapping exercise. Neither does it require that data is aggregated or stored at\na point of single contact. The obligation imposed upon Member States is to\n'make available' such data at a single information point, which could be made\nby providing hyperlinks to other locations. Similarly, the proposal does not\nimpose any general obligation of pre-notification of planned civil works. It\nrather enables electronic communications providers to require this information\nfrom network providers, in view of deploying high-speed electronic\ncommunications networks.\n\u2013                        \nThirdly, with regard to permit granting, this\nproposal does not affect the procedural autonomy of the Member States to allocate\ncompetences internally. While information on different permit granting\nprocedures must be available and applications submitted via the contact point,\nits role is limited to dispatching the different permits and coordinating the\npermit granting process. Furthermore, the different deadlines are only\nharmonised by default, while Member States are allowed to keep or introduce\ntheir specific deadlines, without prejudice to other specific deadlines or\nobligations laid down for the proper conduct of the procedure which are\napplicable in accordance with national or EU law. \n\u2013                        \nLastly, with regard to in-building equipment,\nthe proposed regulation allows Member States to adjust the obligations provided\nby the Regulation to the national and local particularities, by exempting\ncategories of buildings, such as single-dwelling buildings or renovations from\nits scope of application, in full compliance with the principles of\nsubsidiarity and proportionality. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality\n\nThe proposed measures are also justified on\ngrounds of proportionality. \nThe proposed cost reduction measures focus\non increasing coordination and transparency, and on harmonising minimum tools,\nenabling the relevant stakeholders to exploit synergies and reduce\ninefficiencies in the rollout. Also, while the proposed measures aim at\nreducing barriers to access to physical infrastructures, they do not unduly\nimpair ownership rights and preserve commercial negotiation in the first place.\n\nThe proposed measures do not impose\nspecific business models. They also leave open the possibility for Member\nStates to adopt more detailed provisions, and thus will rather complement than\naffect on-going national initiatives. In contrast, they will allow Member\nStates to build on their current measures and select the organisation of any\nexisting or new measure which best suits their particularities, without\nnecessarily imposing further costs. \nWhile the proposed regulation affects\nownership rights to some extent, this is done in respect of the principle of\nproportionality. \nThe proposal enables commercial\nnegotiations for access to the physical infrastructure, without mandating\naccess at pre-defined or cost-oriented terms and conditions. It provides for\nindicative reasons where the refusal to grant access may be deemed reasonable,\nsuch as the technical suitability of the physical infrastructure to which\naccess has been requested to host any of the elements of electronic\ncommunications networks, the lack of availability of space to host the\nelements, or network integrity and security. \nWhile it provides for dispute resolution in\ncase of unreasonable denial of access, it takes into consideration several\nparameters in setting the price for access, such as the impact of the requested\naccess on the business plan underpinning the investments made by the network\noperator, in particular in case of recently built physical infrastructures used\nfor the provision of high-speed electronic communications services.\nWith regard to transparency of existing\nphysical infrastructure, the proposal concerns infrastructure which is suitable\nfor high-speed network deployment and not any physical infrastructure in\ngeneral. It also allows Member States to provide for general exemptions for\ninfrastructures which are technically unsuitable. Furthermore, the proposal\nseeks to make available information at the lowest cost. For this reason, it\nincludes gradual obligations, allowing organising access to already available\ninformation and resorting to surveys only when this information is not readily\navailable with public authorities or the electronic communications providers.\nConcerning co-ordination of civil\nengineering works, the proposal does not limit the economic freedom of\nundertakings \u2013 in particular, it does not mandate co-deployment by parties that\nhave not chosen this commercial model, unless publicly financed. On the\ncontrary, it seeks to enable commercial co-deployment arrangements, by enabling\na better dissemination of information on future civil engineering works. \nWith regard to in-building physical\ninfrastructure, the obligation to equip buildings with high-speed-ready\nphysical infrastructure is limited to new and majorly renovated buildings. This\nis because in these cases the cost is incremental, compared to the high cost of\nretrofitting existing, unequipped buildings with passive infrastructure and\nlikely to be compensated by the higher value of the asset. Moreover, the\nproposal further reduces the scope of application of this obligation to major\nrenovations necessitating a building permit. General exemptions by the Member\nStates for proportionality reason are also foreseen. \n3.4 Fundamental Rights \nThe impact on fundamental rights of the\nproposed measures has been analysed. \nWhile the obligation of network operators\nto meet all reasonable requests for access to their physical infrastructure\ncould restrict their right to conduct a business as well as their property\nright, the adverse effect in this respect is however mitigated by the provision\nthat such access should be granted on fair terms and conditions, including\nprice. Furthermore, this limitation must be considered justified and\nproportionate to the aim of reducing the cost of deploying high-speed\nelectronic communications networks since it would reduce the need to perform\ncivil engineering works, which account for almost 80% of the cost of network\ndeployment. With regard to the obligation on network operators to provide\nminimum information on existing infrastructures, safeguards as concerns the\nright to privacy and the protection of business secrets are provided through\nthe provision of exemptions for the purpose of operating and business secrets.\nThe obligation on undertakings performing\ncivil works fully or partially financed by public means, to meet any reasonable\nrequest for access in view of deploying elements of high-speed electronic\ncommunications networks, could restrict their right to conduct a business as\nwell as their property right. However, any such obligation would only apply if\nit would not entail any additional costs for the initially envisaged civil\nworks and if the request to coordinate is filed as soon as possible and in any\ncase at least one month before the submission of the final project to the\ncompetent authorities for permit granting. Furthermore, this limitation must be\nconsidered justified and proportionate to the aim of reducing the cost of\ndeploying high-speed electronic communications networks since it would\nallow electronic communications network operators to cover only part of the\ncost of the civil engineering works.\nThe obligation to equip all newly\nconstructed buildings, with a high-speed-ready in-building physical\ninfrastructure could have an impact on the property rights of the owners of the\nproperty concerned. This limitation must be considered justified and proportionate\nto the aim of reducing the cost of deploying high-speed electronic\ncommunications networks since it would exclude any need for retrofitting\nbuildings with physical infrastructure. \nThe right of a provider of public\ncommunications networks to terminate its network at the concentration point in\nview of accessing the high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure,\ncould have an impact on the right of property of the owners of private property\nconcerned. Such restrictions are however limited by the obligation on the\npublic communications network providers to minimise the impact on the private\nproperty and to cover any costs incurred. Furthermore, this limitation must be\nconsidered justified and proportionate to the aim of reducing the cost of deploying\nhigh-speed electronic communications networks since it would allow electronic\ncommunications operators to achieve economies of scale, when they deploy their\nnetworks.\nThe right of public communications network\nproviders to access any existing high-speed-ready in-building physical\ninfrastructure could affect the property rights of the holder of the right to\nuse the in-building physical infrastructure. This restriction is however\nlimited since such access would have to be granted on reasonable terms and as\nit would only apply in cases where duplication is technically impossible or\neconomically inefficient.\nThe right to an effective remedy for the\nparties concerned by the limitations outlined above are guaranteed by the\npossibility of referral to a competent national dispute settlement body, which\nshould be without prejudice to the right of any of the parties to refer the\ncase to a court. \n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice\nof instrument \nThe Commission proposes a Regulation as it\npresents the guarantee of a comprehensive, directly applicable solution,\nincluding for all permits necessary to rollout networks. It ensures the rapid\navailability of cost reduction tools, in keeping with the momentum of the\ntargets in the Digital Agenda for Europe due to be achieved by 2020. \nContrary to a Directive, which would imply\ngranting additional time for transposition by Member States, the regulation\nwill rapidly install the basic rights and obligations for network deployment\nthroughout the single market. Moreover, a directive would by its nature allow a\nsignificant degree of differentiation in the implementation of those rights and\nobligations hence perpetuating the emerging patchwork. In contrast a directly\napplicable legal instrument will reduce existing and prevent further\nfragmentation, by focusing on removing a selected number of barriers to the\ndevelopment of a single market for electronic communications networks, building\non best practices but leaving organisational issues very much to the discretion\nof Member States. Providers need to be granted a set of directly applicable\nrights in relation to all phases of planning and rolling out a network, which\nthey can invoke before the national courts, not only against Member States, but\nalso against other private parties, such as owners of infrastructure. \nHaving in mind that the core of the\nproposal is the definition of rights and obligation directly applicable across\nthe Single Market, a Regulation rather than a Directive appears to be the\npreferable legal instrument since it has clear advantages in terms of\nefficiency and effectiveness and creates a level playing field for citizens and\nbusiness, with greater potential for private enforcement[26]. Accordingly, a directly\napplicable Regulation, unlike a Directive that requires national transposition,\nbetter guarantees the immediate impact needed in order to contribute to the\nDigital Agenda objectives on broadband availability by 2020.\nThe considerable advantages of the cost\nreduction measures, both in terms of economic benefit as in societal advantages,\nfar outweigh any administrative burden. \n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structure\nof the proposal and main rights and obligations\nArticle 1 \u2013\nObjective and scope\n\u2013

impact on the private\nproperty and at its own costs.\nArticles 9 \u2013\n11\n\u2013                        \nThese Articles contain final provisions,\nincluding the designation of competent bodies

Regulation has no implications\nfor the budget of the Union.\n2013/0080 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non measures to reduce the cost of\ndeploying high-speed electronic communications networks \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[27],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[28],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The digital economy is\nchanging the Single Market profoundly. With its innovation, speed and reach\nacross borders it has the potential to take Single Market integration to a new\nlevel. The Union's vision is a digital economy that delivers sustainable\neconomic and social benefits based on modern online services and fast Internet\nconnections. A high quality digital infrastructure underpins virtually all\nsectors of a modern and innovative economy and is of strategic importance to\nsocial and territorial cohesion. Therefore, all citizens and businesses must\nhave the opportunity to be part of the digital economy. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acknowledging the\nimportance of high-speed broadband rollout, Member States have endorsed the\nambitious broadband targets set out in Communication from the Commission to the\nEuropean Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee\nand the Committee of the Regions \"The Digital Agenda for Europe- Driving\nEuropean growth digitally\"[29]\n(\"the Digital Agenda\"): 100% broadband coverage by 2013 and increased\nspeeds of 30MBps for all households, with at least 50% of the households\nsubscribing to Internet connections above 100MBps by 2020.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Digital Agenda has\nalso identified the need for policies to lower the costs of broadband\ndeployment in the entire territory of the Union, including proper planning and\ncoordination and reducing administrative burdens.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\nneed for action at the EU level to provide better broadband coverage, including\nby reducing the cost of high-speed broadband infrastructure[30], the Single Market Act II[31] stresses the need for\nadditional efforts in order to achieve quickly the objectives set in the\nDigital Agenda for Europe by inter alia addressing the high-speed\nnetwork investment challenge. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rolling out of\nhigh-speed fixed and wireless electronic communications networks across the Union requires substantial investments a significant portion of which is represented by the\ncost of civil engineering works. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A major part of these\ncosts can be attributed to inefficiencies in the rollout process related to the\nuse of existing passive infrastructure (such as ducts, conduits, manholes,\ncabinets, poles, masts, antenna installations, towers and other supporting\nconstructions), bottlenecks related to co-ordination of civil works, burdensome\nadministrative permit granting procedures, and bottlenecks concerning\nin-building deployment of networks.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures aiming at\nincreasing efficiency in the use of existing infrastructures and at reducing\ncosts and obstacles in carrying out new civil engineering works should provide\na substantial contribution to ensure a fast and extensive deployment of\nhigh-speed electronic communications networks while maintaining effective\ncompetition. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some Member States have\nadopted measures intended to reduce the costs of broadband rollout. Scaling up\nthese best practices across the Union could significantly contribute to the\nestablishment of a digital single market. However those practices remain scarce\nand scattered. Moreover differences in regulatory requirements sometimes\nprevent cooperation across utilities and may raise barriers to entry for new\nnetwork operators and new business opportunities, hindering the development of\na single market for use and deployment of physical infrastructures for high-speed\nelectronic communications networks. Finally, the initiatives at Member State level do not always seem to be holistic, whereas it is essential to take\naction across the whole rollout process, and across sectors, in order to\nachieve a coherent and significant impact. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation aims at\nproviding some minimum rights and obligations applicable across the Union in order to facilitate the rollout of high-speed electronic communications networks\nand cross-sector coordination. While ensuring a minimum level playing field,\nthis should be without prejudice to existing best practices and measures\nadopted at national and local level entailing more detailed provisions and\nconditions as well as additional measures complementing those rights and\nobligations, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the lex\nspecialis principle, when more specific regulatory measures in conformity\nwith EU law apply, these should prevail over the minimum rights and obligations\nprovided for in this Regulation. Therefore this Regulation should be without\nprejudice to EU law and in\nparticular to any specific regulatory measure, including the imposition of\nremedies on undertakings having significant market power, applied in accordance\nwith the Union regulatory framework for electronic communications (Directive\n2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a\ncommon regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services\n(Framework Directive)[32],\nDirective 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March\n2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services\n(Authorisation Directive)[33],\nDirective 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March\n2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks\nand associated facilities (Access Directive)[34],\nDirective 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March\n2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications\nnetworks and services (Universal Service Directive)[35] and Commission Directive\n2002/77/EC of 16 September 2002 on competition in the markets for electronic\ncommunications networks and services[36]).\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It can be significantly\nmore efficient for electronic communications network operators, in particular\nnew entrants, to re-use existing physical infrastructures, including those of\nother utilities, in order to roll-out electronic communications networks, in\nparticular in areas where no suitable electronic communications network is\navailable or where it may not be economically feasible to build-up a new\nphysical infrastructure. Moreover, synergies across sectors may significantly\nreduce the need for civil works due to the deployment of electronic communications\nnetworks and therefore also the social and environmental costs linked to them,\nsuch as pollution, nuisances and traffic congestion. Therefore this Regulation\nshould be applicable not only to electronic communications network providers\nbut to any owner or holder of rights to use extensive and ubiquitous physical\ninfrastructures suitable to host electronic communications network elements,\nsuch as physical networks for the provision of electricity, gas, water and\nsewage, heating and transport services. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of their low degree\nof differentiation, physical facilities of such networks can often host at the\nsame time a wide range of electronic communications network elements, including\nthose capable of delivering broadband access services at speeds of at least 30\nMbps in line with the technological neutrality principle, without affecting the\nmain service conveyed and with minimum adaptation costs. Therefore a physical\ninfrastructure that is intended to only host other elements of a network without\nbecoming itself an active network element, can be in principle used to\naccommodate electronic communications cables, equipment or any other element of\nelectronic communications networks, regardless of its actual use or its\nownership. Without prejudice to the pursuit of the specific general interest\nlinked to the provision of the main service, synergies across network operators\nshould be encouraged in order to contribute at the same time to achieving the\ntargets of the Digital Agenda.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While this Regulation\nshould be also without prejudice to any specific safeguard needed to ensure the\nsecurity and integrity of the networks as well as to ensure that the main\nservice provided by the network operator is not affected, general rules in\nnational legislation prohibiting network operators to negotiate access to\nphysical infrastructures by electronic communications network providers could\nprevent the establishment of a market for access to physical infrastructures\nand should therefore be abolished. At the same time, the measures provided in\nthis Regulation are without prejudice to the possibility of the Member States\nto render the provision of infrastructure access by utilities operators more\nattractive by excluding revenues stemming from this service from the basis for\nthe calculation of end-users tariffs for their main activity or activities, in\naccordance with applicable EU law. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A network operator may\nrefuse access to specific physical infrastructures due to objective reasons. In\nparticular, a physical infrastructure may not be technically suitable in view\nof specific circumstances concerning infrastructures for which access has been\nrequested, including lack of available space. Similarly, in specific\ncircumstances, sharing the infrastructure may jeopardise network integrity and\nsecurity or may endanger the provision of services that are primarily provided\nover the same infrastructure. Moreover, when the network operator already\nprovides wholesale physical network infrastructure access that would meet the needs\nof the access seeker, access to the underlying physical infrastructure may have\nan adverse economic impact on its business model and incentives to invest while\npossibly entailing an inefficient duplication of network elements. At the same\ntime in the case of physical infrastructure access obligations imposed pursuant\nto the Union regulatory framework for electronic communications, such as those\non undertakings having significant market power, this would be already covered\nby specific regulatory obligations that should not be affected by this\nRegulation. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When electronic\ncommunications networks providers request access in a specified area, network\noperators should make available an offer for the shared use of their facilities\nunder fair terms and conditions, including price, unless access is refused\nbased on objective reasons. Depending on circumstances, several elements could\ninfluence the conditions under which such access is granted, such as: any\nadditional maintenance and adaptation costs; any preventive safeguards to be\nadopted to limit adverse impacts on network security and integrity; any\nspecific liability arrangements in the event of damages; the use of any public\nsubsidy granted for the construction of the infrastructure, including specific terms\nand conditions attached to the subsidy or provided under national law in\ncompliance with Union law; any constraints stemming from national provisions\naiming at protecting the environment, public health, public security or to meet\ntown and country planning objectives. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event of\ndisagreement in commercial negotiation on technical and commercial terms and\nconditions each party should be able to call on a dispute resolution body at\nnational level to impose a solution to the parties, in order to avoid\nunjustified refusals to deal or the imposition of unreasonable conditions. When\ndetermining prices for granting access, the dispute resolution body should take\ninto account the investments made on the physical infrastructure. In the\nspecific case of access to physical infrastructures of electronic\ncommunications network operators, the investments made in this infrastructure\nmay directly contribute to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe and\ndownstream competition may be influenced by free-riding. Hence, any access\nobligation should take into account the economic viability of these investments\nbased on any time schedule for the return on investment, any impact of access\non downstream competition, any depreciation of the network assets at the time\nof the access request, any business case underpinning the investment done, in\nparticular in recently built physical infrastructures used for the provision of\nhigh-speed electronic communications services, and any possibility offered to\nthe access seeker to co-deploy.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to effectively\nplan the deployment of high-speed electronic communications networks and to\nensure the most effective use of existing infrastructures suitable for rolling\nout electronic communications networks, undertakings authorised to provide\nelectronic communications networks should be able to have access to minimum\ninformation concerning physical infrastructures available in the area of\ndeployment. Such minimum information should allow for the assessment of the\npotential for using existing infrastructure in a specific area as well as to\nreduce damages to any existing physical infrastructures. In view of the number\nof stakeholders involved and in order to facilitate access to that information,\nalso across sectors and borders, such minimum information should be made\navailable via a single information point. That information point should allow\naccess to minimum information already available in electronic form subject to\nlimitations to ensure network security and integrity or to safeguard legitimate\noperating and business secrets. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While not imposing any new\nmapping obligation on Member States, this Regulation provides that minimum\ninformation already collected by public sector bodies and available in\nelectronic form pursuant to national initiatives as well as under Union law\n(such as Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the\nEuropean Community (INSPIRE)[37])\nshould be made available , e.g. via hyperlink, to a single information point\nwith a view to allow a coordinated access to information on physical\ninfrastructures for electronic communications network providers while at the\nsame time ensuring the security and integrity of any such information. Such\nprovision of information should be without prejudice to the transparency\nrequirements already applicable to the re-use of public sector information\npursuant to Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information[38]. Where information available\nto the public sector does not ensure adequate knowledge of the existing\nphysical infrastructures in a specific area or of a certain type, network\noperators should make the information available to the single information point\nupon request. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where minimum information\nis not available via a single information point, the possibility of electronic\ncommunications network operators to directly request such specific information\nfrom any network operator in the area concerned should be nevertheless ensured.\nIn addition to that, if the request is reasonable, in particular if needed in\nview of the possibility to share existing physical infrastructures or to\ncoordinate civil works, electronic communications network operators should be\ngranted the possibility to make in-site surveys and to request information\nconcerning planned civil works under transparent, proportionate and\nnon-discriminatory conditions and without prejudice to the safeguards adopted\nto ensure network security and integrity as well as protecting operating and\nbusiness secrets. Advanced transparency of planned civil works by network\noperators themselves, or by proactive single information points empowered to request\nsuch information, should be incentivised, in particular for areas of greatest\nutility, by redirecting authorised operators to such information whenever\navailable.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where disputes concerning\naccess to the information on the physical infrastructures in view of deploying\nhigh-speed electronic communications networks arise, the single information\npoint should be able to solve such disputes by means of a binding decision,\nwithout prejudice to the possibility of any party to refer the case to a court.\n\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coordination of civil works\nconcerning physical infrastructures may ensure significant savings and minimise\ninconvenience to the area affected by the deployment of new electronic\ncommunications networks. For this reason, regulatory constraints preventing as\na general rule the negotiation among network operators with a view to\ncoordinate such works in order to deploy also high-speed electronic\ncommunications networks should be prohibited. In the event of civil works not\nfinanced by public means, however, this should be without prejudice for the\nstakeholders to conclude civil works coordination agreements according to their\nown investment and business plans and their preferred timing.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Civil works fully or\npartially financed by public means should aim at maximising the positive\ncollective outcome, by exploiting the positive externalities of these works\nacross sectors and ensuring equal opportunities to share the available and\nplanned physical infrastructure in view of deploying electronic communications\nnetworks. While this should not negatively affect the main purpose of the civil\nworks financed by public means, timely and reasonable requests to coordinate\ndeployment of elements of high-speed electronic communications networks,\nensuring for example the coverage of any additional costs and the minimisation\nof changes to the original plans, should be met by the undertaking carrying out\nthe civil works concerned under proportionate, non-discriminatory and\ntransparent terms, without prejudice to applicable State aid rules. Specific\nsettlement procedures should be available to ensure the rapid resolution of\ndisputes concerning the negotiation of these coordination agreements under\nreasonable, proportionate, non-discriminatory and transparent terms. Such provisions\nshould be without prejudice to the right of the Member States to reserve\ncapacity for electronic communications networks even in the absence of specific\nrequests, in view of meeting future demand for physical infrastructures to\nmaximise the value of civil works, or to adopt measures entailing similar\nrights to coordinate civil works for operators of other types of networks, such\nas gas or electricity. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of different\npermits concerning the deployment of electronic communications networks or new\nnetwork elements may be necessary, including building, town planning,\nenvironmental and other permits, in order to protect national and Union general\ninterests. The number of permits required for the deployment of different types\nof electronic communications networks and the local character of the deployment\nmay entail the application of a variety of procedures and conditions. While\npreserving the right of each competent authority to be involved and maintain\nits decision making prerogatives in accordance with the subsidiarity principle,\nthe establishment of a single point providing information about all procedures\nand general conditions applicable to civil works could reduce complexity and\nincrease efficiency and transparency, in particular for new entrants or smaller\noperators not active in that area. Moreover undertakings deploying electronic\ncommunications networks should have the right to submit their permit request\nthrough a single contact point, entrusted with the responsibility of\ncoordinating the different procedures and monitoring whether the decisions are\nadopted within the legal deadlines. Such a contact point should act as a\none-stop-shop, without necessarily exercising decision-making powers unless so\nentrusted by national law \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that permit\ngranting procedures do not act as barriers to investment, and that they do not\nhave an adverse effect on the single market, a decision on whether or not to\ngrant permit requests should be in any case available at the latest within six\nmonths, without prejudice to other specific deadlines or obligations laid down\nfor the proper conduct of the procedure which are applicable to the permit\ngranting procedure in accordance with national or Union law. Such decision may\nbe tacit or explicit in character according to the applicable legal provisions.\nMoreover, any delay in deciding on permits granting should trigger the right of\ncompensation to undertakings that have requested such permits if they can prove\nthat they have suffered damages due to such a delay. Such a right should be\nexercised in accordance with the procedural and substantive safeguards provided\nin national laws. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nsuch permits granting procedures are completed within reasonable deadlines,\nMember States may establish several safeguards, such as tacit approval, or take\nmeasures to simplify granting procedures by inter alia reducing the\nnumber of permits needed to deploy electronic communications networks or by\nexempting certain categories of small or standardised civil works from permit\ngranting. Authorities, at national, regional or local level, should justify any\nrefusal to grant such permits in their competence, on basis of transparent,\nnon-discriminatory, objective and proportionate criteria and conditions. This\nshould be without prejudice to any measure adopted by the Member States, in\nview of exempting certain elements of electronic communications networks,\nwhether passive or active, from permit granting. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Achieving the targets of\nthe Digital Agenda requires that the infrastructure rollout is brought close to\nthe end-users location, while fully respecting the principle of proportionality\nas regards any limitation brought to the right of property in view of the\ngeneral interest pursued. Existence of high-speed electronic communications\nnetworks up to the end-user should be facilitated while ensuring at the same\ntime technological neutrality, in particular by high-speed-ready in-building\nphysical infrastructure. In view of the fact that providing for mini-ducts\nduring the construction of the building has only a limited incremental cost\nwhile retrofitting buildings with high-speed infrastructure may represent a\nsignificant part of the cost of high-speed network deployment, all new or\nmajorly renovated buildings should be equipped with physical infrastructure,\nallowing the connection of end-users with high-speed networks. In order to\nroll-out high-speed electronic communications network, moreover, new\nmulti-dwelling buildings, as well as majorly renovated multi-dwelling buildings\nshould be equipped with an access or concentration point, by which the provider\nmay access the in-building network. In practice, this would mean that building\ndevelopers should foresee that empty ducts are provided from every dwelling to\na concentration point, located in or outside the building. There may be cases\nsuch as new single dwellings or categories of major renovation works in\nisolated areas where the prospect of high-speed connection is considered, on\nobjective grounds, too remote to justify the additional costs of deploying\nin-house high-speed-ready physical infrastructures and/or a concentration\npoint.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When providers of public\ncommunications networks deploy high-speed networks in a specific area, there\nare significant economies of scale if they can terminate their network to the\nbuilding concentration point, irrespective of whether the owners, condominium\nor residents have expressed explicit interest for the service at that moment in\ntime, but provided that impact on private property is minimised, by using\nexisting physical infrastructure and restoring the affected area. Once the\nnetwork is terminated at the concentration point, the connection of an\nadditional customer is possible at a significantly lower cost, in particular by\nmeans of access to a high-speed-ready vertical segment inside the building,\nwhere it already exists.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the social\nbenefits stemming from digital inclusion and taking into account the economics\nof deployment of high-speed electronic communications networks, where there is\nneither existing passive or active high-speed-ready infrastructure serving\nend-users premises nor alternatives to provide high-speed electronic\ncommunications networks to end-users, any provider of public communications networks\nprovider should have a right to terminate its network to a private premise at\nits own costs, when it has obtained the agreement of the subscriber, and\nprovided that it minimises the impact on private property, for example, when\npossible, by reusing existing physical infrastructure available in the building\nor ensuring full restoration of the affected areas. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to the\ntasks entrusted to national regulatory authorities provided under the Union\nregulatory framework for electronic communications, in the absence of specific\ndesignations by Member States, in order to ensure consistent dispute settlement\ndecisions, such functions provided for in this Regulation should be assigned to\nthe authorities fulfilling the tasks provided in Article 20 of Directive\n2002/21/EC, taking into account the expertise available and the guarantees of\nindependence and impartiality. However, in line with the principle of\nsubsidiarity, this Regulation should be without prejudice to the possibility of\nMember States to allocate the regulatory tasks provided herewith to authorities\nbetter suited to fulfil them in accordance with the domestic constitutional\nsystem of attribution of competences and powers and with the requirements set\nforth in this Regulation. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever body be designated\nby the Member State for dispute settlement, it should ensure impartiality and\nindependence vis-\u00e0-vis the parties involved. Also, the designated\nauthorities should have appropriate resources and sanctioning powers in the\nevent of lack of compliance with the decisions adopted. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\neffectiveness of the information points provided for in this Regulation, Member\nStates deciding to appoint different bodies from the national regulatory\nauthority fulfilling the tasks provided in Article 20 of Directive 2002/21/EC\nshould ensure adequate resources as well as that the relevant information\nconcerning a specific area is made available at such information points at an optimal level of aggregation where valuable\nefficiencies may be ensured in view of the tasks assigned (such as the\ncadastre). In this regard, Member States may consider the possible synergies\nand economies of scope with the Points of Single Contact within the meaning of\nArticle 6 of Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006 on services in the\ninternal market (the Services Directive), with a view to build on existing\nstructures and maximising the benefits for end-users. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of the\nproposed action aiming at facilitating the deployment of physical\ninfrastructures suitable for high-speed electronic communications networks\nacross the Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\ntherefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle\nof subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably the right\nto privacy and the protection of business secrets, the freedom to conduct\nbusiness, the right to property and the right to an effective remedy. This\nRegulation has to be applied by the Member States in accordance with those\nrights and principles.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1. This Regulation aims to facilitate and\nincentivise the roll-out of high-speed electronic communications networks by promoting\njoint use of existing and enabling more efficient deployment of new physical\ninfrastructure so that such networks can be rolled out at lower cost. \n2.

Thus, indirectly, they\naffect distribution of the wide range of services transmitted by satellite \u2013\nwhich, by their very nature, cross borders \u2013 such as television and radio\nbroadcasts, together with interactive services (\u201cinformation society\nservices\u201d). Such national measures must therefore comply with the fundamental\nprinciples of the Treaty, such as the free movement of goods and the freedom to\nprovide services within the Single Market.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) n\u00b0 2887/2000 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 18 December 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop,\nOJ, 30.12.2000, L336/4.\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Digital Agenda for Europe, Communication from the\nCommission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and\nSocial Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2010)245 of 19.5.2010,\nin particular section 2.4.1.\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions of the European Council of 1/2 March 2012,\nEUCO 4/2/12, http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/12/st00/st00004-re02.en12.pdf,\nitem 15.\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Communication from the Commission to the European\nParliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of\nthe Regions, COM(2012)573 of 3.10.2012, Key Action 9.\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions of the European Council of 13/14 December\n2012, EUCO 205/12, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/134353.pdf,\nitem 17. \n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A report on the outcome of the public consultation can\nbe found as part of the Impact Assessment Report that is attached to this\nproposal (Annex I to the Report).\n[16]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See http://daa.ec.europa.eu/content/special/crowdsourcing.\n[17]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Report that builds on the study prepared by Deloitte,\nas further cross-checked with other sources, can be found as part of the Impact\nAssessment Report that is attached to this proposal (Annex II to the Report).\n[18]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Report can be found as part of the Impact\nAssessment Report that is attached to this proposal (Annex III to the Report).\n[19]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A complete list of these sources can be found in the\nbibliography of the Impact Assessment Report.\n[20]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Impact Assessment Report is attached to this\nproposal.\n[21]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See Case C-66/04, paragraph 45,\nand Case C-217/04, paragraph 43.\n[22]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See Analysys Mason, Final report for the DG Information\nSociety and Media, European Commission Support for the preparation of an impact\nassessment to accompany an EU initiative on reducing the costs of high-speed\nbroadband infrastructure deployment (SMART 2012/0013)\n[23]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See Case C-217/04 paragraph 47.\n[24]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See for example Recital 8 of the Better Regulation\nDirective 2009/140/EC, Recital 22 of the Framework Directive, Recital 1 and 4\nof Regulation 2887/2000/EC.\n[25]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See Case 272/83 paragraphs 25 and 27.\n[26]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 European Parliament resolution of 14 June 2012 on \"Single\nMarket Act: The Next Steps to Growth\" (2012/2663(RSP)), point 10. \n[27]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[28]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[29]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM (2010)245;
