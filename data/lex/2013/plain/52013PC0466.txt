If the EU\noffices are closed, Gabon may send the provisional list directly to the vessel\nowner or their consignee with a copy to the EU.\n5.\nIssuing of the licence \nGabon shall issue the licence to vessel\nowners within 15 days of receiving the full application file.\nWhere a licence is renewed during the\nperiod in which the Protocol applies, the new licence must contain a clear\nreference to the initial licence. \nThe EU shall forward the licence to the\nvessel owner or to the consignee. If the EU offices are closed, Gabon may send\nthe licence directly to the vessel owner or their consignee with a copy to the\nEU.\n6. List of vessels authorised to fish\n\nOnce the licence is issued, Gabon shall\ndraw up immediately for each category of vessel the final list of vessels which\nare authorised to fish in the Gabonese zone. This list shall be sent\nimmediately to the national body responsible for monitoring fishing and to the\nEU and shall replace the provisional list referred to above.\n7. Period of validity of the licence \nFishing authorisations shall be valid for one\nyear and be renewable.\nIn order to establish the start of the period\nof validity, \u2018annual period\u2019 shall mean:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for the first year of application\nof the Protocol, the period between the date of its entry into force and 31\nDecember of the same year;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 then, each complete calendar\nyear;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for the last year of application\nof the Protocol, the period between 1 January and the date of expiry of the\nProtocol;\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for the\nfirst and last years of the Protocol, the national fee shall be calculated pro\nrata temporis.\nLicences shall\nbe issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable.\nHowever, where force majeure is proven,\ne.g. in the event of the loss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a\nserious technical failure, and at the request of the EU, the licence shall be\nreplaced by a new authorisation for another vessel of the same fishing category\nas the vessel being replaced, as referred to in Article 1 of the Protocol, with\nno further fee due. In this case, the calculation of the catch levels to\ndetermine whether an additional payment should be made shall take account of\nthe sum of the total catches of the two vessels. \nThe transfer shall involve the licence to\nbe replaced being returned by the vessel owner or their consignee in Gabon, and\nGabon drawing up the replacement authorisation as soon as possible. The\nreplacement authorisation shall be issued as soon as possible to the vessel\nowner or their consignee when the authorisation to be replaced is returned. The\nreplacement authorisation shall take effect on the day on which the\nauthorisation to be replaced is returned.\n8. Keeping a licence on board\nThe licence, or failing that, a copy valid\nfor 45 days after the issue date, must be kept on board at all times.\nHowever, vessels shall be authorised to\nfish as soon as they are included on the provisional list referred to in point\n4. Vessels must keep a copy of the provisional list on board at all times until\ntheir licence is issued. \nGabon shall update the list of vessels\nauthorised to fish as soon as possible. The new list shall be sent without\ndelay to the national body responsible for supervising fishing, and to the EU.\nCHAPTER\nIII\nTechnical measures\nTechnical measures applicable to the\nvessels holding a licence, relating to the zone, fishing gear and additional\ncatch, shall be defined for each fishing category in the technical sheets\ncontained in Appendix 2 to this Annex. \nThe vessels\nshall comply with all the recommendations adopted by ICCAT (International Commission\nfor the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) and the provisions under the relevant\nGabonese legislation.\nDuring fishing\noperations in the Gabonese fishing zone, and with the exception of natural\ndrifting fish aggregating devices (FADs), the use of fishing supports which\nchange the behaviour of highly migratory species and encourage in particular\ntheir concentration near to or beneath the fishing support, shall be limited to\nso-called green artificial drifting FADs, designed, built and used in a way which\nhelps to avoid cetaceans, sharks or turtles being caught accidentally by the\nsupport. These supports must be made from biodegradable materials. The\ndeployment and use of such artificial drifting FADs shall be subject to the\nadoption by the European Union of a management plan in line with the provisions\nadopted by ICCAT.\nCHAPTER IV \nCatch reporting\n1. Fishing log\nThe master of an EU vessel fishing under\nthe Agreement shall keep a fishing logbook in French, for which the model for\neach category of fishing is included in Appendix 3 to this Annex. \nThe fishing logbook shall be completed by\nthe master for each day the vessel is present in the Gabonese fishing zone. \nEach day the master shall record in the\nfishing logbook the quantity of each species, identified by its FAO alpha 3\ncode, caught and kept on board, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where\nnecessary, the number of individual fish. For each main species, the master\nshall also include the bad catch. \nWhere applicable, the master shall also\nrecord each day in the fishing logbook the quantities of each species thrown\nback into the sea, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary,\nthe number of individual fish.\nThe fishing logbook shall be filled in\nlegibly, in block capitals, and signed by the master. \nThe master shall be responsible for the\naccuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook.\n2. Catch reporting \nThe master shall notify the vessel\u2019s catch\nby submitting to Gabon its fishing logbooks for the period of its presence in the\nGabonese fishing zone. \nThe fishing logbooks shall be transmitted\nin one of the following ways: \n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when passing through a Gabonese\nport, the original of each fishing logbook shall be submitted to the local\nrepresentative of Gabon, who shall confirm receipt thereof in writing;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when leaving the Gabonese\nfishing zone without first passing through a Gabonese port, the original of\neach fishing logbook shall be sent within a period of 14 days after arrival in\nany other port, and in any case within a period of 30 days after leaving the\nGabonese zone. \n(a) by letter sent to Gabon,\n(b) or by fax, to the number given by\nGabon,\n(c) or by e-mail.\nThe two Parties shall make every effort to\nestablish a system for reporting catches based on the electronic exchange of\nall the data, in view of accelerating its transmission.\nAs soon as it is possible for catch\ndeclarations to be sent by e-mail, the master shall send the fishing logbooks\nto Gabon at the e-mail address given by Gabon. Gabon shall confirm receipt\nthereof immediately by return e-mail. \nThe master shall send a copy of all the\nfishing logbooks to the EU Delegation to Gabon. For tuna seiners and\npole-and-line tuna vessels, the master shall also send a copy of all the\nfishing logbooks to the Gabonese Institut de Recherche Agricole et\nForesti\u00e8re (Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Research \u2013 IRAF) and one\nof the following scientific institutes:\ni) IRD (Institut de recherche pour le\nd\u00e9veloppement)\nii) IEO (Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de\nOceanografia),\niii) IPMA (Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da\nAtmosf\u00e8ra),\nThe return of the vessel into the Gabonese\nzone within the period of validity of its licence shall give rise to further\ncatch reporting. \nWhere the\nprovisions concerning catch reporting are not complied with, Gabon may suspend\nthe licence of the vessel concerned until the missing catch report is obtained\nand penalise the vessel owner in accordance with the relevant provisions under\nthe national legislation in force. If the offence is repeated, Gabon may refuse\nto renew the licence. Gabon shall inform the EU immediately of any penalty\napplied in this context.\n3.\nTransition to an electronic system\nThe two Parties\nindicate their shared willingness to ensure a transition to an electronic\nsystem for declaring catches based on the technical characteristics laid down\nin Appendix 6. The parties agree to determine together the transmission\narrangements with the aim of the system becoming operational as soon as\npossible. Gabon shall inform the EU as soon as the conditions for this\ntransition have been met. From the date this information is sent, the two\nParties shall agree to have the system fully operational within two months. \n4.\nFinal statement of fees for the tuna seiners and pole-and-line tuna vessels\nUntil the electronic system provided for\nunder point 3 is in place, the EU shall draw up for each tuna seiner and\npole-and-line tuna vessel, on the basis of its catch reporting confirmed by the\nabove scientific institutes, a final statement of the fees owed by the vessel\nin respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year. \nThe EU shall send this final statement to\nGabon and to the vessel owner before 31 July of the year in progress. \nFrom the date the electronic system\nprovided for under point 3 is actually in place, the EU shall draw up for each\ntuna seiner and pole-and-line tuna vessel, on the basis of the logbooks\narchived at the fisheries monitoring centre (FMC) of the flag State, a final\nstatement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the\nprevious calendar year. \nThe EU shall send this final statement to\nGabon and to the vessel owner before 31 March of the year in progress.\nIn both cases and within 30 days of being\nsent, Gabon may contest the final statement, on the basis of documentary proof.\nIn the case of disagreement, the Parties shall consult each other in the Joint\nCommittee. If Gabon does not object within 30 days, the final statement shall\nbe considered to be adopted.\nOn the date the final catch statement is\nsent to Gabon, the EU shall transmit a summary of the data on the catch and\neffort of EU vessels in respect of their fishing activity on FADs in the\nGabonese fishing zone, in accordance with the measures and requirements adopted\nby ICCAT, particularly in Recommendation 11-01. \nCHAPTER V\nLandings \n1.\nLanding procedure \nThe master of an EU vessel wishing to land\ncatch from the Gabonese zone in a Gabonese port must notify Gabon, at least 24\nhours before landing, of the following:\n(a) the name of the fishing vessel which is\nto land, \n(b) the port of landing,\n(c) the planned date and time of the\nlanding, \n(d) the quantity (expressed in kilograms of\nlive weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species to\nbe landed (identified by its FAO alpha 3 code).\nVessels must land in Gabonese ports all\ntheir by-catch caught in the Gabonese fishing zone. \nThe landing operation must be carried out\nin the waters of a Gabonese port authorised for this purpose. Transhipment is\nprohibited.\nNon-compliance with these provisions shall\nlead to the application of the relevant penalties provided for under Gabonese\nlegislation.\n2. Landing incentive \n(a) Tuna seiners\nOnce the port structures and tuna\nprocessing facilities are operational in Gabon, vessel owners shall undertake\nto land a minimum of 30 % of the catch from Gabonese waters, taking into\naccount the actual needs of the production unit. When landing, tuna-fishing\nvessels shall also land 100 % of the by\u2011catch kept on board, in order to\nsupply the local market. These landings in Gabon must be able to benefit from\nthe market price. Should the production unit be undersupplied, the Parties\nshall convene the Joint Committee in order to find a solution. \n(b) Pole-and-line vessels\nVessel owners shall undertake to land\n100 % of the catch from Gabonese waters in order to supply the local\nmarket. \n(c) The provisions referred to in paragraph\n2(a) shall apply subject to notification from the Gabonese Party that the\nrelevant infrastructure is in fact operational, and following examination by\nthe Joint Committee. \nCHAPTER VI \nChecks\n1. Entering and leaving the zone\nGabon must be notified of any EU vessel\nholding a licence which enters or exits the Gabonese fishing zone 6 hours\nbefore the entry or exit.\nWhen notifying its entry or exit, the\nvessel shall notify in particular: \n(i) the date, time and point of passage\nscheduled;\n(ii) the quantity of each species held on\nboard, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code and expressed in kilograms of live\nweight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;\n(iii) the product presentation. \nNotification shall be given preferably by\ne-mail or, failing that, by fax or radio, to an e-mail address, a telephone\nnumber or a frequency communicated by Gabon. Gabon shall confirm receipt\nthereof immediately by return e-mail. Gabon shall immediately inform the\nvessels concerned and the EU of any change to the e-mail address, telephone\nnumber or transmission frequency. \nAny vessel found to be fishing in the\nGabonese zone without having previously notified its presence shall be\nconsidered to be a vessel fishing illegally. \n2. Inspection at sea\nInspection at sea in the Gabonese zone of\nEU vessels holding a licence shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors\nfrom Gabon who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing\nchecks. \nBefore going on board, the Gabonese\ninspectors shall warn the EU vessel of their decision to carry out an\ninspection. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors,\nwho must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector\nbefore carrying out the inspection. \nThe Gabonese inspectors shall only stay on\nboard the EU vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the\ninspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the\nimpact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo.\nGabon may authorise the EU to participate\nin the inspection at sea as an observer.\nThe master of the EU vessel shall allow the\nGabonese inspectors to come on board and carry out their work.\nAt the end of each inspection, the Gabonese\ninspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the EU vessel\nshall have the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The\ninspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and\nthe master of the EU vessel.\nThe signature of the inspection report by\nthe master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner\u2019s right of defence in\nrespect of an infringement. If the master refuses to sign this document, he or\nshe shall specify the reasons for doing so in writing and the inspector shall\nwrite \u2018refusal to sign\u2019 on it. The Gabonese inspectors shall give a copy of the\ninspection report to the master of the EU vessel before leaving the vessel.\nGabon shall send a copy of the inspection report to the EU within 8 days\nof the inspection.\n3. Inspection in port\nThe inspection in port of EU vessels which\nland catch from the Gabonese zone in the waters of a Gabonese port shall be\ncarried out by designated inspectors from Gabon. . \nThe inspection shall be carried out by a\nmaximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and\nofficial position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The\nGabonese inspectors shall only stay on board the EU vessel for the time necessary\nto carry out the tasks related to the inspection and shall conduct the\ninspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, landing operation\nand cargo.\nGabon may authorise the EU to participate\nin the inspection in port as an observer.\nThe master of the EU vessel shall allow the\nGabonese inspectors to carry out their work.\nAt the end of each inspection, the Gabonese\ninspector shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the EU vessel shall\nhave the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection\nreport shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of\nthe EU vessel.\nThe signature of the inspection report by\nthe master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner\u2019s right of defence in\nrespect of an infringement. If the master refuses to sign this document, he or\nshe shall specify the reasons for doing so in writing and the inspector shall\nwrite \u2018refusal to sign\u2019 on it. \nThe Gabonese inspectors shall give a copy\nof the inspection report to the master of the EU vessel at the end of the\ninspection. Gabon shall send a copy of the inspection report to the EU within\n8 days of the inspection.\n4. Participatory monitoring in the\nfight against IUU fishing\nIn order to strengthen monitoring of\nfishing on the high seas and the fight against IUU fishing, European Union\nfishing vessels shall report the presence of any vessels in the Gabonese\nfishing zone which are not on the list of vessels authorised to fish in Gabon. \nWhere the master of an EU fishing vessel\nwitnesses a fishing vessel engaged in activities which may constitute IUU\nfishing, he or she may seek as much information as possible about what has been\nsighted. Sighting reports shall be sent without delay to the competent\nauthority of the Member State of the sighting vessel, which shall immediately\ntransmit them to the European Commission or to the body designated by it. The\nEuropean Commission shall provide Gabon with this information.\nGabon shall send the EU any sighting\nreports it has on fishing vessels engaged in activities which may constitute\nIUU fishing in the Gabonese fishing zone. \nCHAPTER VII \nSatellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS)\n1. Vessel\nposition messages \u2013 VMS system\nWhilst they are in the Gabonese zone, EU\nvessels holding a licence must be equipped with a satellite monitoring system\n(Vessel Monitoring System \u2013 VMS) to enable automatic and continuous\ncommunication of their position, at all times, to the fishing control centre\n(Fisheries Monitoring Centre \u2013 FMC) of their flag State. \nEach position message must contain:\n(a) the vessel identification;\n(b) the most recent geographical position\nof the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a position error of less than\n500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %;\n(c) the date and time the position is\nrecorded;\n(d) the speed and the course of the vessel.\nEach position message must be configured in\naccordance with the format included in Appendix 4 to this Annex.\nThe first position recorded after entry\ninto the Gabonese zone shall be identified by the code \u2018ENT\u2019. All subsequent\npositions shall be identified by the code \u2018POS\u2019, with the exception of the\nfirst position recorded after exit from the Gabonese zone, which shall be\nidentified by the code \u2018EXI\u2019.\nThe CSP of the flag State shall ensure the\nautomatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the\nposition messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner\nand kept for a period of three years.\n2. Transmission by the vessel in the\nevent of breakdown of the VMS\nThe master shall ensure at all times that\nthe VMS of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are\ncorrectly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State. \nIn the event of breakdown, the VMS of the\nvessel shall be repaired or replaced within 10 days. After that period, the\nvessel shall no longer be authorised to fish in the Gabonese zone. \nVessels fishing in the Gabonese zone with a\ndefective VMS must communicate their position messages by e-mail, radio or fax\nto the FMC of the flag State, at least every four hours, and must provide all\nthe compulsory information.\n3. Secure communication of the\nposition messages to Gabon\nThe FMC of the flag State shall\nautomatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of\nGabon. The FMCs of the flag State and Gabon shall exchange their contact e-mail\naddresses and inform each other without delay of any change to those addresses.\nThe transmission of position messages\nbetween the FMCs of the flag State and Gabon shall be carried out\nelectronically using a secure communication system.\nThe FMC of Gabon shall inform the FMC of\nthe flag State and the EU of any interruption in the reception of consecutive\nposition messages from a vessel holding a licence, where the vessel concerned\nhas not notified its exit from the zone. \n4. Malfunction of the communication\nsystem\nGabon shall ensure the compatibility of its\nelectronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the EU\nimmediately of any malfunction as regards the communication and reception of\nposition messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as\npossible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any possible dispute arising. \nThe master shall be considered responsible\nfor any proven tampering with a vessel\u2019s VMS aimed at disturbing its operation\nor falsifying its position messages. Any infringements shall be subject to the\npenalties provided for by the Gabonese legislation in force.\n5. Revision of the frequency of\nposition messages\nOn the basis of documentary evidence\nproving an infringement, Gabon may ask the FMC of the flag State, copying in\nthe EU, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to\nevery thirty minutes for a set period of investigation. This documentary\nevidence must be sent without delay by Gabon to the FMC of the flag State and\nthe EU. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately send the position messages\nto Gabon at the new frequency. \nAt the end of the set investigation period,\nGabon shall immediately inform the FMC of the flag State and the EU and\nsubsequently inform them of any follow-up.\nCHAPTER VIII\nInfringements\n1. Handling of infringements\nAny infringement committed by an EU vessel\nholding a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Annex must be\nreferred to in an inspection report. That report shall be sent to the EU and\nthe flag State as soon as possible.\nThe signature of the inspection report by\nthe master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner\u2019s right of defence in\nrespect of an infringement. The master of the vessel shall cooperate while the\ninspection procedure is being carried out.\n2. Detention of a vessel \u2013\nInformation meeting\nWhere permitted under the Gabonese\nlegislation in force regarding the infringement, any EU vessel having committed\nan infringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the\nvessel is at sea, to return to a Gabonese port.\nGabon shall notify the EU within 24 hours\nof any detention of an EU vessel holding a licence. That notification shall be\naccompanied by documentary evidence of the infringement. \nBefore taking any measure against the\nvessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed\nat protecting evidence, Gabon shall organise, at the request of the EU, within\none working day of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information\nmeeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to\nexplain what further action may be taken. A representative of the flag State of\nthe vessel may attend that information meeting. \n3.\nPenalties for infringements - Compromise procedure\nThe penalty for the infringement shall be\nset by Gabon according to the provisions of the national legislation in force.\nWhere settling the infringement involves\nlegal proceedings, before these are launched, and provided that the\ninfringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be\nundertaken between Gabon and the EU in order to determine the terms and level\nof the penalty. A representative of the flag State of the vessel and of the EU\nmay participate in that compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall\nfinish at the latest 3 days after the notification of the detention of the\nvessel.\n4. Legal proceedings \u2013 Bank security\nIf the compromise procedure fails and the\ninfringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel\nwhich committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank\ndesignated by Gabon, the amount of which, as set by Gabon, shall cover the\ncosts linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any\ncompensation. The bank security may not be recovered until the legal\nproceedings have been concluded.\nThe bank security shall be released and\nreturned to the vessel owner without delay after the judgment has been\ndelivered:\n(a) in full, if no penalty has been\nimposed;\n(b) for the amount of the remaining\nbalance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank\nsecurity.\nGabon shall inform the EU of the outcome of\nthe legal proceedings within 8 days of the judgment being delivered.\n5. Release of the vessel and the crew\nThe vessel and its crew shall be authorised\nto leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or\nonce the bank security has been deposited.\nCHAPTER IX \nSigning-on of seamen\n1. Owners of tuna seiners and pole-and-line\ntuna vessels shall employ ACP nationals, subject to the following conditions\nand limits:\n- for the fleet of tuna seiners, at least\n20 % of the seamen signed on during the tuna-fishing season in the fishing\nzone of third countries shall be of ACP origin;\n- for the fleet of pole-and-line tuna\nvessels, at least 20 % of the seamen signed on during the tuna-fishing\nseason in the fishing zone of third countries shall be of ACP origin. \n2. Vessel owners\nshall endeavour to sign on Gabonese seamen.\n3. The\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles\nand Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by EU vessels.\nThis concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective\nrecognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of\ndiscrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n4. The\nemployment contracts of seamen from the ACP countries shall be drawn up between\nthe vessel owners\u2019 representative(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions\nor representatives. A copy shall be given to the signatories. These contracts\nshall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them,\nincluding life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. \n5. The wages\nof the seamen from the ACP countries shall be paid by the vessel owners. They\nshall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement among the\nvessel owners or their representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to\nlocal seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Gabonese crews and shall\nunder no circumstances be below ILO standards.\n6. All seamen\nemployed aboard EU vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated\non the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to\nreport at the date and time agreed for embarkation, vessel owners shall be\nautomatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board.\nCHAPTER X \nObservers \n1.\nObservation of fishing activities \nVessels holding a licence shall be subject\nto a scheme for observing their fishing activities carried out within the\nframework of the Agreement.\nThis observation scheme shall conform to\nthe provisions provided for in the recommendations adopted by ICCAT\n(International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas). \n2.\nDesignated vessels and observers\nGabon shall designate the EU vessels which\nmust allow an observer to embark and the observer assigned to them at the\nlatest 15 days before the date provided for the embarkation of the observer. EU\nvessels shall, at the request of the Gabonese authorities, take on board one\nobserver in order to reach the cover rate of 25 % of licensed vessels. \nWhen the licence is issued, Gabon shall\ninform the EU and the vessel owner, or his consignee, of the designated vessels\nand observers and the times at which the observer will be present on board each\nvessel. Gabon shall immediately inform the EU and the vessel owner or his\nconsignee of any change in the designated vessels and observers.\nGabon shall\nendeavour not to designate observers for vessels which already have an observer\non board, or which are already formally obliged to allow an observer to embark\nduring the fishing season in question as part of their activities in fishing\nzones other than the Gabonese zone.\nThe observers\nshall not spend more time on board the vessel than is necessary to carry out\ntheir duties.\n3.\nFlat-rate financial contribution\nAt the time the\nannual flat-rate fee is paid, the vessel owner shall also pay Gabon a flat-rate\nsum of EUR 200 per year for each vessel.\n3. Observer\u2019s salary\nThe salary and social contributions of the\nobserver shall be borne by Gabon. \n4. Embarkation conditions\nThe embarkation conditions for the\nobserver, in particular the duration of presence on board, shall be defined by\nmutual agreement between the vessel owner or his consignee and Gabon.\nObservers shall be treated on board as\nofficers. However, receiving the observer on board shall take into account the\ntechnical structure of the vessel.\nThe vessel owner shall bear the costs of\nproviding accommodation and food for the observer on board. \nThe master\nshall take all the measures for which he is responsible to guarantee the\nphysical safety and general wellbeing of the observer.\nObservers shall\nbe offered every facility needed to carry out their duties.

It is intended that the new Protocol will apply provisionally from the\ndate of signature. To ensure the resumption of fishing operations, a procedure\nfor adoption by the Council of a Decision on the signing and provisional\napplication of the Protocol has been launched in parallel with this procedure.\nThe new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities\nof the European fleet in the Gabonese fishing zone and will, in particular,\nauthorise European vessel owners to apply for fishing licences allowing them to\nfish in Gabonese waters. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation\nbetween the EU and the Gabonese Republic, with a view to promoting the\ndevelopment of a sustainable fishing policy. It\nprovides, in particular, for vessels to be monitored via VMS and for the\nelectronic transmission of catch data. Sectoral\nsupport has been strengthened to help the Gabonese Republic with its national\nfisheries strategy and in the fight against IUU fishing.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU involvement\nAs regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the EU would allow\nprivate agreements to spring up which would not guarantee sustainable\nfisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, the Gabonese\nRepublic will continue to cooperate effectively with the EU particularly as\nregards the fight against illegal fishing.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAnalysis of catches under the previous Protocol led the Parties to\nincrease the reference tonnage.
