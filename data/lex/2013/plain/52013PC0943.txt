Since the insertion\nof such a recital\nwould have implied a substantive change, and would have therefore gone beyond\nstraightforward codification, it was considered necessary that point 8[6] of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994\n- Accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts -\nbe applied, in the light of the Joint Declaration on that point[7].\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light thereof,\ncodification of Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87, Regulation (Euratom)\nNo 944/89 and Regulation (Euratom) No 770/90 was transformed into a recast\nin order to incorporate the said amendment, and a relevant proposal was\nsubmitted to the legislative authority[8].\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its opinion of 4.6.2010\nthe Consultative Working Party of the legal services, acting in accordance with\npoint 9 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured\nuse of the recasting technique for legal acts[9],\nstated that the proposal referred to in point 5 did not comprise any\nsubstantive amendments other than those identified as such, and that, as\nregards the codification of the unchanged provisions of the earlier acts with\nthose substantive amendments, the proposal contained a straightforward\ncodification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the course of the\nlegislative procedure relating to that recast proposal, it became apparent that\ncertain existing provisions contained in Regulation (Euratom)\nNo 3954/87 have now become incompatible with the new\n\"Comitology\" system laid down in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member\nStates of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers. It has therefore\nbeen decided to withdraw the recast proposal and to draft a revised proposal of\nRegulation (Euratom) No 3954/87, which includes its consolidation and the\nimplementation of the new \"Comitology\" system.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the\nexperience gained from the nuclear accidents in Chernobyl and in particular in\nFukushima, the revised proposal provides that the Commission is assisted by a\nsection of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health -\nToxicological Safety of the Food Chain dealing with radioactive contamination\nof food and feed referred to in Article 58 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 28\nJanuary 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law,\nestablishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in\nmatters of food safety[10].\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking\ninto consideration the evolution of the primary and secondary law during the\nlast decades, in particular with regard to food safety under the TFEU, and in\norder to ensure legal certainty and coherence of all EU legislative measures\nwith regard to the conditions governing imports of food and feed from third\ncountries affected by a nuclear accident or a radiological emergency, the\nmeasures that were established in the post-Chernobyl context[11] will need to be\naligned with the regime of implementing powers and procedures defined in the\npresent regulation. This might also imply, where necessary, a change of the\nlegal basis. \n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that the\nGroup of Experts referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty,\nconfirmed in their Opinion dated 21 November 2012 their\nconclusion in 1998 (Publication Radiation Protection\n105), that the maximum permitted levels pre-established for future accidents in\nRegulation 3954/87 are still valid. However, as soon as new scientific\nknowledge on doses and risks would be published by ICRP, they considered that\nit should be checked whether there is a need for a review of these levels.\nTherefore, the Commission has not changed these maximum permitted levels in its\nrevised proposal[12].\n2013/0451 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nlaying down maximum permitted levels of\nradioactive contamination of food and feed following a nuclear accident or any\nother case of radiological emergency\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing\nthe European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Articles 31 and 32\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission, drawn up after obtaining the opinion of the group of\npersons appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee from among\nscientific experts in the Member States[13],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[14],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[15],\n\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 96/29/Euratom[16] lays down basic safety standards for the protection\nof the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising\nfrom ionizing radiation. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the accident at\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power-station on 26 April 1986, considerable\nquantities of radioactive materials were released into the atmosphere,\ncontaminating foodstuffs and feedingstuffs in several European countries to\nlevels significant from the health point of view. Measures were adopted to\nensure that certain agricultural products are only introduced into the Union according to the common arrangements which safeguard the health of the\npopulation while maintaining the unified nature of the market and avoiding\ndeflections of trade. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (Euratom)\nNo 3954/87[17]\nlays down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination to be applied\nfollowing a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which\nis likely to lead or has led to significant radioactive contamination of food\nand feed. Those maximum permitted levels are still in line with the latest scientific\nadvice as presently available internationally.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the accident at\nthe Fukushima nuclear power station on 11 March 2011, the Commission was\ninformed that radionuclide levels in certain food products originating in Japan exceeded the action levels in food applicable in Japan. Such contamination may constitute a\nthreat to public and animal health in the Union and therefore measures were\nadopted imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food\noriginating in or consigned from Japan, in accordance with the opinion of the\nStanding Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a need to set up\na system allowing the European Atomic Energy Community, following a\nnuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to\nlead or has led to a significant radioactive contamination of food and feed, to\nestablish maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in order to\nprotect the population.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maximum permitted levels\nof radioactive contamination should apply to food and feed originating in the Union or imported from third countries according to the location and circumstances of the\nnuclear accident or the radiological emergency.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission is\nto be informed of a nuclear accident or of unusually high levels of\nradioactivity according to Council Decision 87/600/Euratom[18], or under the IAEA Convention\non early notification of a nuclear accident of 26 September 1986.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount that diets of infants during the first six months period of life may\nvary significantly, and to allow for uncertainties in the metabolism of infants\nduring the second six months period of life, there is a benefit in extending\nthe application of lower maximum permitted levels for foods for infants, to the\nwhole first 12 months of age. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nadaptation of maximum permitted levels, in particular with regard to scientific\nknowledge, procedures for establishing the maximum permitted levels should\ninclude the consultation of the Group of Experts referred to in Article 31\nof the Treaty. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that\nfood and feed exceeding the maximum permitted levels are not placed on the\nmarket of the EU, compliance with these levels should be the subject\nof appropriate checks.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation as regards rendering\napplicable the pre-established maximum permitted levels, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles\nconcerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's\nexercise of implementing powers[19].\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The examination procedure\nshould be used for the adoption of acts rendering applicable the\npre-established maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of food\nand feed.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\nimmediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases\nrelating to certain radiological emergencies which are likely to lead or have\nled to a significant radioactive contamination of food and feed, imperative\ngrounds of urgency so require.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation lays down the maximum\npermitted levels of radioactive contamination of food as set out in Annex I,\nthe maximum permitted levels of minor food as set out in Annex II, and the\nmaximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of feed as set out\nin Annex III, which may be placed on the market following a nuclear\naccident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to\nor has led to significant radioactive contamination of food and feed, and the\nprocedures to render these maximum permitted levels applicable. \nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"food\" means any\nsubstance or product, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed,\nintended to be, or reasonably expected to be ingested by humans, including\ndrink, chewing gum and any substance, including water, intentionally\nincorporated into the food during its manufacture, preparation or treatment; \"food\"\ndoes not include:\n(a)                   \nfeed;\n(b)                   \nlive animals unless they are prepared for placing\non the market for human consumption;\n(c)                   \nplants prior to harvesting;\n(d)                  \nmedicinal products within the meaning of Article\n1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[20] ;\n(e)                   \ncosmetic products within the meaning of Article\n2(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil[21];\n(f)                    \ntobacco and tobacco products within the meaning of Directive\n2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[22] ;\n(g)                   \nnarcotic or psychotropic substances within the\nmeaning of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the\nUnited Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971;\n(h)                   \nresidues and contaminants.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"minor food\" means food of minor dietary importance which makes only a marginal\ncontribution to food consumption by the population;\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"feed\" means any\nsubstance or product, including additives, whether processed, partially\nprocessed or unprocessed, intended to be used for oral feeding to animals;\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"placing on the\nmarket\" means the holding of food or feed for the purpose of sale,\nincluding offering for sale or any other form of transfer, whether free of\ncharge or not, and the sale, distribution, and other forms of transfer\nthemselves.\nArticle 3\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event of the\nCommission receiving \u2014 in particular according to either the European\nAtomic Energy Community arrangements for the early exchange of information\nin case of a radiological emergency or under the IAEA Convention of\n26 September 1986 on early notification of a nuclear accident \u2014\nofficial information on accidents or on any other case of radiological\nemergency, substantiating that the maximum permitted levels for\nfood, minor food or feed are likely to be reached or have been reached,\nit shall adopt, if the circumstances so require, an implementing\nRegulation rendering applicable those maximum permitted levels.
