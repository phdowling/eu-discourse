The\nareas covered are the following: \n\u00b7                        \nAs regards flag States, coastal States and port\nStates: general provisions on implementation strategy, scope, initial actions,\ncommunication of information, record keeping and improvement;\n\u00b7                        \nAs regards flag States: implementation,\ndelegation of authority, enforcement, flag State surveyors, flag State\ninvestigations, evaluation and review;\n\u00b7                        \nAs regards coastal States: implementation,\nenforcement, evaluation and review;\n\u00b7                        \nAs regards port States: implementation,\nenforcement, evaluation and review.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The RO Code\nThe draft RO Code has the objective to\nprovide flag States with a standard for the assessment and authorisation of\nrecognised organisations as well as mechanisms for the consistent, efficient\nand effective oversight of recognised organisations, and to clarify the responsibilities\nof organisations authorised as recognised organisations and the scope of that\nauthorisation. \nThis concerns the following instruments: \n\u00b7                        \nThe International Convention for the Safety of\nLife at Sea, 1974, as amended (SOLAS 1974); \n\u00b7                        \nThe Protocol of 1978 relating to the\nInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973; \n\u00b7                        \nThe 1988 Protocol to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966. \nThe Code applies to all organisations being\nconsidered for recognition or that are recognised by a flag State to perform,\non its behalf, statutory certification and services under mandatory IMO\ninstruments and national legislation, and to all flag States that intend to\ngrant that recognition. \nThe Code contains mandatory provisions as\nregards delegation of authority and communication of information, and establishes:\n\u00b7                        \nThe mandatory requirements that an organisation\nshall fulfil to be recognised by a flag State;\n\u00b7                        \nThe mandatory requirements that a recognised\norganisation shall fulfil when performing statutory certification and services\non behalf of its authorising flag States;\n\u00b7                        \nThe mandatory requirements that flag States\nshould adhere to when authorising a recognised organisation; \n\u00b7                        \nGuidelines for flag State oversight of\nrecognised organisations.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of the Codes \n1.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of the III Code\nNow approved by the IMO Marine Environment\nProtection Committee in its 64th session (MEPC 64, October 2012) and\nby the IMO Maritime Safety Committee in its 91st session (MSC 91, November\n2012), the 28th IMO Assembly is expected to adopt the III Code in\nDecember 2013.\n1.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of the RO Code\nNow approved by the IMO Marine Environment\nProtection Committee in its 64th session (October 2012) and by the\nIMO Maritime Safety Committee in its 91st session (November 2012),\nthe RO Code is expected to be adopted by these committees in May and June 2013,\nin their 65th and 92nd sessions, respectively.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amendment of the relevant\ninternational conventions\n1.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments\nconcerning the III Code\nThe IMO Marine Environment Protection\nCommittee, at its 64th session, approved amendments to the protocols\nof 1978 and 1997 relating to the MARPOL convention with a view to rendering the\nIII Code mandatory, together with an associated flag State audit scheme. The\nCommittee is expected to adopt these amendments at its 66th session,\nin 2014.\nThe IMO Maritime Safety Committee, at its\n91st session, approved amendments to the SOLAS convention as well as\nto the protocol of 1988 relating to the Load Lines convention, with a view to\nrendering the III Code mandatory, together with an associated flag State audit\nscheme. At its 92nd Session, due to take place in June 2013, the\nCommittee is expected to approve amendments to the STCW Convention with the\nsame purpose. The Committee is expected to adopt the amendments referred to in\nthis paragraph at its 93rd session, in 2014. \nThe IMO Maritime Safety Committee, at its\n91st session, approved amendments to the Load Lines, COLREG and\nTonnage conventions with a view to rendering the said Code mandatory, together\nwith an associated flag State audit scheme, for consideration and adoption by\nthe 28th Assembly. \n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of amendments\nconcerning the RO Code\nThe IMO Marine Environment Protection\nCommittee, at its 64th session, approved amendments to the Protocol\nof 1978 relating to the MARPOL convention with a view to rendering the RO Code\nmandatory. The committee is expected to adopt these amendments at its 65th\nsession, due to take place in May 2013.\nThe IMO Maritime Safety Committee, at its\n91st session, approved amendments to the SOLAS convention and to the\nprotocol of 1988 relating to the Load Lines convention, with a view to\nrendering the RO Code mandatory. The committee is expected to adopt these\namendments at its 92nd session. \n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance and entry into\nforce. Reservations.\nOnce approved and adopted by the competent IMO\nCommittee or by the Assembly, as appropriate, the amendments to the above\nmentioned conventions will be submitted to the respective contracting parties in\norder for these to express their consent to be bound by the said amendments\neither tacitly or expressly, according to the relevant provisions of each\nconvention. \nNone of the above mentioned conventions\ncontains clauses excluding the formulation of reservations as regards amendments.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary table\nA summary table of the events described in\nthe preceding subsection is presented below for ease of reference:\u00a0\u00a0 \n Code or Convention || Approval || Expected Adoption || Type of acceptance || Circulation period || Expected acceptance || Expected entry into force of the amendments \n III Code || MEPC[1]64, October 2012 MSC[2]91, November 2012 || 28th IMO Assembly, December 2013 || -/- || -/- || -/- || -/- \n Load Lines convention 1966   (III Code)   || MSC91, November 2012 || 28th IMO Assembly, December 2013 || Unanimous and tacit, or || 3 years   || 1/1/2017 || 1/1/2018[3] \n 2/3 majority and explicit || Based on attainment of sufficient explicit acceptances ||   || On a date 12 months after the number of explicit acceptances have been received \n Tonnage convention 1969, (III Code)   || MSC91, November 2012 || 28th IMO Assembly, December 2013 || Unanimous and tacit, or || 2 years || 1/1/2016 || 1/1/2017[4] \n 2/3 majority and explicit || Based on attainment of sufficient explicit acceptances ||   || On a date 12 months after the number of explicit acceptances have been received \n Collision Regulations (III Code) || MSC91, November 2012 || 28th IMO Assembly, December 2013 || 2/3 majority Tacit || 18 months || 1/7/2015 || 1/1/2016 \n RO Code || MEPC64, October 2012 MSC91, November 2012 || MEPC65, May 2013 MSC92, June 2013 || -/- || -/- || -/- || -/- \n MARPOL protocol '78 (RO Code)   || MEPC64, October 2012 || MEPC65, May 2013 || 2/3 majority Tacit || \u226510 months || 1/4/2014 || 1/10/2014 \n SOLAS convention and Load Lines pro-tocol '88; (RO Code) || MSC91, November 2012 || MSC92, June 2013 || 2/3 majority Tacit || \u22651 year || 1/7/2014 || 1/1/2015 \n MARPOL protocols '78/'97 (III Code)   || MEPC64, October 2012 || MEPC66, March 2014 || 2/3 majority Tacit || \u226510 months || 1/2/2015[5] || 1/8/2015[6] \n SOLAS convention and Load Lines pro-tocol '88; (III Code) || MSC91, November 2012 || MSC93, May 2014 || 2/3 majority Tacit || \u22651 year || 1/7/2015 || 1/1/2016 \n STCW convention and part A of STCW code (III Code) || MSC92, June 2013 || MSC93, May 2014 || 2/3 majority Tacit || \u22651 year || 1/7/2015 || 1/1/2016 \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relevant EU legislation\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/15/EC\nDirective 2009/15/EC of the European Parliament\nand the Council on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey\norganisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations[7] (hereinafter referred to as\n\"the Directive\") repealed and partly replaced Council Directive 94/57/EC\nof 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and\nsurvey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime\nadministrations[8].\nThe Directive governs the relationship\nbetween the Member States and the recognised organisations which they authorise\nto carry out statutory tasks on their behalf. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation 391/2009\nRegulation (EC) N\u00b0 391/2009 of the European\nParliament and the Council on common rules and standards for ship inspection\nand survey organisations[9]\n(hereinafter \"the Regulation\") modified and replaced the system\nformerly laid down in Council Directive 94/57/EC for the recognition and\nassessment of classification societies.\nThe Regulation lays down a number of\ncriteria and obligations which an organisation must meet in order to obtain and\nthereafter maintain its EU recognition. These requirements concern both\nstatutory and classification activities and are laid down[10] in Articles 8(4), 9, 10 and 11\nas well as in Annex I of the Regulation. \nThe requirements provided in the Regulation\nhave the specific objective to enhance the safety of, and prevent pollution\nfrom, all ships in the class of recognised organisations[11]. They are formulated in\ngeneral terms and make no distinction based on flag. \nThe Regulation also governs the granting\nand withdrawal of EU recognition, provides for the periodic assessment of RO's\nby the Commission and lays down a system of sanctions in case of\nnon-compliance.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/21/EC \nDirective 2009/21/EC on flag State\nrequirements[12],\nwhich also formed part of the 3rd Maritime Safety Package, lays down\na number of obligations for the Member States as flag States. These include in\nparticular an obligation for Member States to take the necessary measures for\nan IMO audit of their administration to be carried out at least once every\nseven years. However, this provision shall expire \"at the latest on 17\nJune 2017 or at an earlier date, as established by the Commission in accordance\nwith the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 10(2), if a mandatory IMO\nMember State Audit Scheme has entered into force\".\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/106/EC \nDirective 2008/106/EC on the minimum level\nof training of seafarers[13]\nlays down inter alia a minimum level of training for seafarers in the Union\nbased on the standards of training contained in the STCW Convention and the\nassociated STCW guidelines, as well as provisions on minimum rest periods for\nwatchkeeping personnel in accordance with the same Convention. \nDirective 2008/106/EC also lays down a\nseries of specific obligations for the Member States as flag and port States,\nsuch as: a) procedures and common criteria for the recognition by the Member\nStates of certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and\ncertification requirements contained in the STCW Convention; b) criteria\nconcerning the inspection of maritime institutes, training programmes and\ncourses; c) provisions for the inspection of vessels by port authorities and\nPort State control; d) provisions for the enforcement by the Member States\nincluding the prevention of fraudulent practices and a system of sanctions.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU Competence\nIn view of the relevant EU legislation\nabove, the Commission considers that the adoption of the draft III Code and the\nRO Code as well as the amendments to the conventions referred to in section 1.1\nand 1.2 above come under exclusive EU competence which the Union has acquired\npursuant to Article 3 (2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption of the international instruments\nat stake may affect common rules or alter their scope. In this respect:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft III Code is\nmeant to replace Resolution A.973(24) which contains the existing Code for the\nimplementation of mandatory IMO instruments, which in turn replaced Assembly\nResolution A.847(20), which the\nMember States are obliged to apply by virtue of Article 3 (1) of Directive\n2009/15/EC. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matter of the RO Code\nis exhaustively regulated by the above mentioned Directive and by Regulation\n(EC) n\u00ba391/2009, either directly or by reference to a number of IMO resolutions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the first\nsubparagraph Article 7(2) of Directive 2009/15/EC: \"Following the adoption\nof new instruments or protocols to the international conventions referred to in\nArticle 2(d), the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall\ndecide, taking into account the Member States\u2019 parliamentary procedures as well\nas the relevant procedures within the IMO, on the detailed arrangements for\nratifying those new instruments or protocols, while ensuring that they are\napplied uniformly and simultaneously in the Member States.\" \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term\n\"international conventions\" is defined both in Directive 2009/15/EC\n(Article 2(d)) and in Regulation (EC) n\u00ba391/2009 (Article 2(b)) to include the\nSOLAS, MARPOL and Load Lines conventions, together with the protocols and\namendments thereto, and the related codes of mandatory application, in their\nup-to-date version. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligations incumbent\non the Member States as flag and port States under the STCW convention are\nexhaustively covered by Directive 2008/106/EC.\nConsistent with a well consolidated body of\ncase law, even if the Union is not a member of the IMO, the Member States are\nnot authorised to assume obligations likely to affect EU rules promulgated for\nthe attainment of the objectives of the Treaties, unless they are authorised to\ndo so by means of a Council decision, on a proposal by the Commission. The need\nfor authorisation therefore extends to any such obligations, regardless of the\nsubject-matter of the international instruments concerned.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Areas of conflict between\nthe draft IMO Codes and EU law\nThe Commission considers that the Codes are\ncompatible with EU law with the exception of the following areas:\n1.7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draft III Code\n1.7.1.1.\u00a0 Class and statutory\ncertificates\nSection 16, Part 2 of the Code provides for\na minimum list of resources and processes which flag States have to establish\nin order to administer a safety and environmental protection programme.\nAccording to point 1 of this section, this list has to include \"administrative\ninstructions to implement applicable international rules and regulations as\nwell as develop and disseminate any interpretative national regulations that\nmay be needed including certificates issued by a classification society, which\nis recognized by the flag State in accordance with the provisions of SOLAS\nregulation XI-1/1, and which certificate is required by the flag State to\ndemonstrate compliance with structural, mechanical, electrical and/or other\nrequirements of an international convention to which the flag State is a party\nor a requirement of the flag State's national regulations\".\nRegulation (EC) No 391/2009 and Directive\n2009/15/EC are defining two types of certificates that can be issued by\nclassification societies - 'statutory certificates' \u2013 which are those\ncertificates issued by or on behalf of a flag State in accordance with the\ninternational conventions and 'class certificates' which are those documents\nissued by a recognised organisation certifying the fitness of a ship for a\nparticular use or service in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down\nand made public by that recognised organisation. \nIn contrast to these provisions, Section 16\nof the Draft III Code seems to refer to all certificates issued by\nclassification societies as being required by the flag State and, consequently,\nhaving to comply with the administrative instructions provided by that State.\nThis has to be understood also as referring to what in the EU is considered as\nclass tasks and certificates, and in particular those required as proof of\ncompliance with SOLAS Ch. II-I, Part A-1, Reg. 3-1[14], which remain acts of the\nrecognised organisations and therefore cannot benefit from the protection due\nto acts of a State. There is therefore a risk that the requirements contained in\nthe above mentioned Regulation concerning classification tasks and\ncertificates, or action taken in order to ensure the implementation of those\nrequirements, be unduly contested by third States or by recognised\norganisations themselves based on different administrative instructions\nemanating from those States. \n1.7.1.2.\u00a0 Authorisation of Recognised\nOrganisations\nAccording to the introductory part of\nSection 18, Part 2 of the draft III Code, \"With regard only to ships\nentitled to fly its flag, a flag State authorising a recognised organisation to\nact on its behalf, in conducting the surveys, inspections and audits, issuing\nof certificates and documents, marking of ships and other statutory work\nrequired under the conventions of the Organization or under their national\nlegislation, must regulate such authorisation(s) in accordance with the\napplicable requirements of the international mandatory instruments [\u2026]\".\n\nAccording to Regulation (EC) No 391/2009,\nrecognition is provided at EU level and the recognised classification society,\nfollowing such recognition, can fulfil both statutory and classification tasks\nin the EU. Moreover, the recognition is provided for the worldwide activity of\nthe classification society. The list of minimum criteria and obligations as provided\nin the Regulation (many of which are of a structural nature) concern the entire\nactivity of the organisation, regardless of flag. \nThe above mentioned limitation in the draft\nIII Code of the flag State's capacity to regulate the activity of the organisation\nonly as regards ships flying its own flag, may be seen to be in conflict with\nthe set of criteria applied at EU level as a sine qua non condition for\nthe granting and maintenance of recognition. It must however be noted that\nrecognition is provided by the Commission, while Member States can only\nauthorise organisations recognised at EU level.\n1.7.1.3.\u00a0 Specific requirements\nSection 18 in the draft III Code seems to\nprovide an exhaustive list of areas in which the States can intervene in the\nactivity of a recognised organisation in order to ensure compliance with\ncertain standards. Even if these requirements are formulated in a broad manner,\nthey do not cover all the minimum criteria and obligations which are provided\nin the Regulation - like criterion B.5 (intellectual property) or obligations\nconcerning harmonisation of classification rules and mutual recognition under\nArticle 10 (1) of the Regulation; or deriving from the obligations of the\nMember States laid down in Directive 2009/15/EC - such as financial liability\nas provided for in Article 5(2)(b). \nHowever, it appears from the nature of the\nCode itself and its scope as stated in section 6 (\"The Code seeks to\naddress those aspects necessary for a Contracting Government or Party to give a\nfull and complete effect to the provisions of the applicable international\ninstruments to which it is a Contracting Government or Party \u2026\"), that,\nsave where an explicit prohibition is formulated, its provisions must be\nunderstood as setting minimum standards on which the individual States can\nelaborate and improve, which is the intent stated in recital 4 of Regulation\n391/2009. \n1.7.1.4.\u00a0 Application of\nclassification rules\nAccording to section 19, Part 2 of the\ndraft III Code, \"No flag State shall mandate its recognised\norganisations to apply to ships, other than those entitled to fly its flag, any\nrequirements pertaining to their classification rules, requirements, procedures\nor performance of other statutory certification processes beyond convention\nrequirements and the mandatory instruments of the organization.\"\nHence, the flag State will not be able to\nimpose on classification societies which they authorize requirements which go\nbeyond convention requirements and the mandatory IMO instruments, other than in\nthe case of the ships flying their flag. Per a contrario, any flag State\nmay impose such requirements which are in accordance with the IMO Convention or\nother mandatory IMO instruments, including the III and RO Codes themselves.\nAs can be seen from the preceding\nsubsection, a number of requirements contained in the above mentioned\nRegulation and Directive are not covered by this provision. \nFurthermore, the precedents in the\nelaboration of the Codes have shown that some of those requirements tend to be\nperceived by a number of States as impinging on their sovereignty. That\nperception is however unfounded, for the following reasons: \n\u00b7                        \nClassification societies remain free to\nestablish their own rules and procedures as they deem fit, provided they comply\nwith the goal-based standards laid down by the IMO. They adopt the said rules\nand procedures under their own and sole authority.\n\u00b7                        \nIt follows that classification surveys carried\nout and classification certificates delivered in order to establish and\nsubsequently attest to compliance with the said rules and procedures are\nactivities of a strictly private nature and therefore neither acts of any State\nnor carried out on any State's behalf;\n\u00b7                        \nThe private nature of classification tasks and\ncertification is a matter of fact that is not altered by their inclusion in the\ndefinition of \"statutory certification and services\". Nor is such\nprivate nature altered by the fact that SOLAS Ch. II-I, Part A-1, Reg. 3-1\nrequires the Contracting Parties to ensure that ships flying their flag comply\nwith the structural, mechanical and electrical requirements of a classification\nsociety which is recognized by the Administration: as is evident from the very\nwording of this provision, those remain requirements of the classification\nsociety and not of the recognizing State;\n\u00b7                        \nEvery classification society is free to choose\nwhether or not to enter into authorisation agreements with flag States, and\nhence to accept or refuse the conditions established by those States, as a\ncondition for recognition, with regard to the said classification rules and\nprocedures; \n\u00b7                        \nIt is therefore incumbent on each recognised\norganisation to ensure that the obligations entered into with different flag\nStates are compatible with one another. While it is perfectly conceivable that\nconditions for recognition as regards classification tasks and certification,\nas laid down by different States, may be incompatible with one another, this in\nno case implies a conflict of sovereign rights and has no other consequence\nthan the impossibility for an organisation to hold recognition from all or part\nof those States simultaneously.\nThe experience of past maritime\ncatastrophes such as the accidents of the \"Erika\" and the\n\"Prestige\", both ships flying the flag of (then) third countries but\nclassified by organisations holding EU recognition, has highlighted to what\nextent maritime safety and the protection of the environment in Europe depend\non the good performance of EU-recognised classification societies in both the statutory\nand classification domains and regardless of flag. The Union cannot ignore this\nneed, as it would otherwise fall in the contradiction that organisations\nentitled to certify the safety of EU ships, and thus benefitting from free\naccess to a market of considerable quality and size, would however be allowed\nto perform to lower standards when certifying ships flying the flag of third\nStates and which might pose a threat to legitimate, vital Union's interests\nsuch as safety and the protection of the environment. That is the reason why\nRegulation 391/2009, as is clear from its Articles 1 and 4 read in conjunction\nwith recital 13, requires compliance with appropriate criteria and obligations\nof a systemic nature, concerning both classification and statutory tasks and making\nno distinction based on ship flag, as a sine qua non condition for an\norganisation to be recognised at EU level and thereafter maintain that\nrecognition.\n1.7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draft RO Code\n1.7.2.1.\u00a0 Class and statutory\ncertificates\nAccording to section 1.3 of Part II of the\nRO Code, 'statutory certification and services' means \"certificates\nissued, and services provided, on the authority of laws, rules and regulations\nset down by the Government of a sovereign State. This includes plan review,\nsurvey, and / or audit leading to the issuance of or in support of the issuance\nof a certificate by or on behalf of a flag State as evidence of compliance with\nrequirements contained in an international convention or national legislation.\nThis includes certificates issued by an organization recognized by the flag\nState in accordance with the provisions of SOLAS regulation XI-1/1, and which\nmay incorporate demonstrated compliance with the structural, mechanical and\nelectrical requirements of the RO under the terms of its agreement of recognition\nwith the flag State\".\nTaking into account the definitions of the\n'statutory certificate' and 'class certificate' as provided in EU law, the\nconsiderations made further up under subsections 1.7.1.1 to 1.7.1.4 for the\ndraft III Code are equally applicable to the draft RO Code.\n1.7.2.2.\u00a0 Cooperation between\nrecognised organisations\nPoints 3.9.3.1 and 3.9.3.2 of Part II of\nthe draft RO Code provide for a mechanism of cooperation between recognised\norganisations, but under the framework established by the flag State.\nCooperation between recognised\norganisations is governed by Article 10 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009, and\nconcerns classification tasks and certificates without distinction based on\nflag. In contrast to these provisions included in EU law, points 3.9.3.1 and\n3.9.3.2 of Part II of the draft RO Code seem to create some limitations in the\ncooperation between recognised organisations, in the sense that the\nimplementation of the Code by the Member States would imply that (a) mutual\nrecognition would be possible only if a framework for that purpose exists\nwithin each Member State for the ships flying its flag and (b) the effects of\nthat framework cannot extend beyond the boundaries of the fleet flying the flag\nof each Member State.\nRegulation 391/2009 is directly applicable\nin all Member States and therefore fulfils condition (a). However, for the\nreasons described in sections 1.7.1.3 and 1.7.1.4, the framework of cooperation\ncreated by Regulation 391/2009 goes further than the boundaries of the fleet\nflying the flag of each member states and therefore does not comply with condition\n(b) and is therefore in conflict with Points 3.9.3.1 and 3.9.3.2 of Part II of\nthe draft RO Code. \n1.7.2.3.\u00a0 Application of\nclassification rules\nAs the provisions of point 3.9.3.3 of Part\nII of the draft RO Code are identical to those included in section 19, Part 2\nof the draft III Code, the considerations made in subsection 1.7.1.4 are also\napplicable to these provisions.\n1.7.2.4.\u00a0 Authorisation of recognised\norganisations\nAccording to point 8.1.1 of Part II of the\ndraft RO Code, \"[...] a flag State may authorise an RO to act on its\nbehalf in statutory certification and services and determination of tonnages only\nto ships entitled to fly its flag as required by these conventions. Such\nauthorisations shall not require ROs to perform actions that impinge on the\nrights of another flag State.\"\nThis provision should be analysed in\ncorrelation with the definition of the 'statutory certification and services'\nin order to see if the extension of the flag State requirements over class\ncertificates and the minimum list of criteria which have to be met by an\norganisation in order to be recognised at EU level might call into question\npowers of other flag States. In this respect, the considerations made in\nsections 1.7.1.3 and 1.7.1.4 also apply here.\n1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IMO audit\nThe foreseen amendments to the\ninternational conventions discussed are also establishing a mandatory IMO audit\nscheme defined as \"the IMO Member State Audit Scheme established by the\nOrganization and taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization,\nwhich is intended to ensure consistent and effective implementation of\ninstruments of the Organization and to assist States to improve their\ncapabilities and overall performance in this respect.\"\nAccording to the amendments brought, Member\nStates will be subject to these audits at periodic intervals. As defined, the\naudit shall take into account the compliance with the instruments of the IMO\nand shall be based on an overall schedule developed by the Secretary-General of\nthe Organization taking into account the guidelines developed.\nHence, in principle, a mandatory IMO audit\nwill assess also compliance with the international conventions as defined in\nRegulation (EC) No 391/2009 and Directive 2009/15/EC, including the III Code\nand the RO Code.\nIn this respect it is necessary to examine\nif a situation of incompatibility may arise between the international\nobligations of the Member States and those incumbent on them under EU law.\nThe analysis made in sections 1.7.1 and\n1.7.2 shows that there are a number of areas where the draft III and RO Codes\nare in contradiction with the applicable EU law and therefore it is necessary\nto ensure that the obligations incumbent on them under the international\nmaritime safety conventions concerned, and against which they will be audited\nby the IMO, are compatible with their obligations at EU level. \n1.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2008/106/EC\nWithout prejudice to the considerations\nmade in sections 1.6 to 1.8, no areas of conflict have been identified between\nthe draft Codes and Directive 2008/106/EC.\n1.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\nIn view of the above it is only possible\nfor the Member States to give their consent to be bound by the III and RO Codes\nif the necessary safeguards are taken in order to ensure that:\n(a)                   \nThe full effectiveness of Regulation 391/2009\nand Directive 2009/15/EC, as well as the Union's capacity to continue to\ndevelop such acquis; and \n(b)                   \nThe Commission's capacity to grant recognition\nonly to those organisations which fulfil the criteria and obligations laid down\nin Regulation 391/2009, and to withdraw the recognition of those which do not,\nare fully preserved.\nThe Commission considers that, in order to\nprotect the achievement of the objectives of the said Directive and Regulation,\nthe Member States should make an express reservation in relation to their\nobligations under EU law when giving their consent to be bound by the Codes and\nto submit their maritime administrations to a mandatory IMO Member State Audit\nScheme.\nAs regards the issues discussed under\nsection 1.7.1.3 it should suffice for the Member States to make it clear, when\ngiving their consent to be bound by the Codes, that they interpret the\nprovisions concerned in a certain way \u2013 e.g. as providing only a minimum list\nof requirements which does not prevent the flag States from imposing other\nrequirements on recognised organisations.\nFinally, the obligation of the Member\nStates to undergo an IMO audit as provided in Article 7 of Directive 2009/21/EC\nshould be seen also in the light of the obligations incumbent on them at\ninternational and EU level. Therefore, any IMO audit should verify compliance\nonly with those provisions of the international conventions which Member States\nhave accepted. \n2013/0111 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nOn the position to be adopted, on behalf\nof the European Union, at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) with\nregard to the adoption of certain Codes and related amendments to Conventions\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100 (2), in\nconjunction with Article 218 (9) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now approved by the IMO Marine\nEnvironment Protection Committee in its 64th session (MEPC 64,\nOctober 2012) and by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee in its 91st\nsession (MSC 91, November 2012), the 28th IMO Assembly is expected\nto adopt an IMO Instruments Implementation Code (III Code) in December 2013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now approved by the IMO\nMEPC 64 and by the IMO MSC 91, an IMO Code on Recognised Organisations (RO\nCode) is expected to be adopted by these Committees in May and June 2013, in\ntheir 65th and 92nd sessions, respectively. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO MSC 91 approved\namendments to the International Load Lines Convention, 1966 (hereinafter\nreferred to as the \"Load Lines convention\"); to the International\nRegulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972; and to the International\nConvention on Tonnage Measurement, 1969 with a view to rendering the III Code\nmandatory, together with an associated flag State audit scheme, for\nconsideration and adoption by the 28th IMO Assembly.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO MEPC 64 approved\namendments to the protocols of 1978 and 1997 relating to the International\nConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the MARPOL convention\"), with a view to\nrendering the III Code mandatory, together with an associated flag State audit\nscheme. The Committee is expected to adopt these amendments at its 66th\nsession, in 2014.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO MSC 91 approved\namendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the SOLAS convention\") and its 1988\nProtocol, as well as to the protocol of 1988 relating to the International Convention\non Load Lines, 1966, with a view to rendering the III Code mandatory, together\nwith an associated flag State audit scheme. At its 92nd Session, due\nto take place in June 2013, the Committee is expected to approve amendments to\nthe International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping\nfor Seafarers, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as \"the STCW\nConvention\"), with the same purpose. The Committee is expected to adopt\nthe amendments referred to in this paragraph at its 93rd session, in\n2014. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO MEPC 64 approved\namendments to the Protocol of 1978 relating to the MARPOL convention with a\nview to rendering the RO Code mandatory. The Committee is expected to adopt\nthese amendments at its 65th session.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IMO MSC 91 approved\namendments to the SOLAS convention and to the protocol of 1988 relating to the\nLoad Lines convention, with a view to rendering the RO Code mandatory. The\nCommittee is expected to adopt these amendments at its 92nd session.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once adopted, the\namendments to the above mentioned conventions will be submitted by the IMO\nSecretary-General to the respective contracting parties in order for these to\nexpress their consent to be bound by the said amendments either tacitly or\nexpressly, according to the relevant provisions of each convention.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 None of the above\nmentioned conventions contains clauses excluding the formulation of\nreservations as regards amendments.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The draft III Code is meant\nto replace Resolution A.973(24) which contains the existing Code for the\nimplementation of mandatory IMO instruments, which in turn replaced Assembly\nResolution A.847(20), which the\nMember States are obliged to apply by virtue of Article 3 (1) of Directive\n2009/15/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on common rules and\nstandards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant\nactivities of maritime administrations[15].\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matter of the RO Code\nis exhaustively regulated by the above mentioned Directive and by Regulation\n(EC) N\u00b0 391/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council on common rules and\nstandards for ship inspection and survey organisations[16], either directly or by\nreference to a number of IMO resolutions.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, according to the\nfirst subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Directive 2009/15/EC, following the\nadoption of new instruments or protocols to the international conventions\nreferred to in Article 2(d), the Council, acting on a proposal from the\nCommission, shall decide, taking into account the Member States\u2019 parliamentary\nprocedures as well as the relevant procedures within the IMO, on the detailed\narrangements for ratifying those new instruments or protocols, while ensuring\nthat they are applied uniformly and simultaneously in the Member States. The\nterm \"international conventions\" is defined both in Directive\n2009/15/EC and in Regulation (EC) n\u00ba391/2009 to include the SOLAS, MARPOL and\nLoad Lines conventions, together with the protocols and amendments thereto, and\nthe related codes of mandatory application, in their up-to-date version. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligations incumbent\non the flag States under the STCW convention are covered by Directive\n2008/106/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers[17], as amended by Directive\n2012/35/EU[18].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\nthe consistency with Union law of the Member States' obligations arising from\nthe application of the III Code and the RO Code under the conventions referred\nto in the preceding paragraphs and under other conventions which render the\nsaid codes mandatory for the Contracting Parties.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/21/EC on\nflag State requirements[19]\nlays down a number of obligations for the Member States as flag States. These\ninclude in particular an obligation for Member States to take the necessary\nmeasures for an IMO audit of their administration to be carried out at least\nonce every seven years. However, this provision shall expire at the latest on\n17 June 2017 or at an earlier date, as established by the Commission, if a\nmandatory IMO Member State Audit Scheme has entered into force.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the above mentioned\nreasons, the III Code and the RO Code as well as the corresponding amendments\nto the conventions referred to above come under exclusive EU competence which the\nUnion has acquired pursuant to Article 3 (2) TFEU, in so far as the adoption of\nthe international instruments at stake may affect common rules or alter their\nscope. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of provisions in\nthe draft III Code are in conflict with the above mentioned instruments of EU\nlaw especially as regards: a) the extension of the Code to cover the\nadministrative instructions of the flag State as regards classification tasks\nand certificates, which entails a risk that the requirements contained in\nRegulation (EC) 391/2009 concerning those tasks and certificates, or action\ntaken in order to ensure the implementation of those requirements, be unduly\ncontested; b) the limitation of the flag State's capacity to regulate the\nactivity of recognised organisations only to ships flying its flag, in contrast\nwith criteria and obligations laid down in the said Regulation which concern\nall the activities of recognised organisations, regardless of flag; c) the\nprohibition for the flag State to mandate its recognised organisations to apply\nclassification or statutory requirements to ships other than those entitled to\nfly its flag, beyond convention requirements and the mandatory instruments of\nthe IMO, in contrast with the specific criteria and obligations referred to above.\n\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A number of provisions in\nthe draft RO Code are in conflict with the above mentioned instruments of EU\nlaw, especially as regards: a) the definition of \"statutory certification\nand services\" which includes services and certification tasks which in\nRegulation (EC) 391/2009 and in Directive 2009/15/EC are considered part of the\nrecognised organisations' classification activities and hence of a private\nnature; b) the limitation of requirements for cooperation between recognised\norganisations only in the framework established by the flag State, in contrast\nwith the obligations laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 391/2009; c)\nthe application of classification rules, as described above. Moreover, the\nprohibition in the draft RO Code of any requirements on recognised\norganisations which may impinge on the rights of another flag State may, when\nread in conjunction with the Code's definition of statutory certification and\nservices, lead to abusive interpretation of the Code and hence give rise to unjustified\nrestrictions to the implementation of the requirements provided in Regulation (EC)\n391/2009 on the classification activities of recognised organisations.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neither the areas listed in\nthe draft III Code where the Contracting Parties can intervene in the activity\nof recognised organisations nor the requirements placed in the draft RO Code on\nrecognised organisations cover all the minimum criteria and obligations laid\ndown in Regulation 391/2009 or deriving from obligations incumbent on the Member\nStates in accordance with Directive 2009/15/EC; however, these provisions must\nbe understood, save where an explicit prohibition is formulated, as setting\nminimum standards on which the Contracting Parties can elaborate and improve.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in either the draft\nIII Code or the RO Code should place any restrictions on the Union's capacity\nto lay down, in accordance with the Treaties and international law, appropriate\nconditions for the granting of recognition to organisations wishing to be\nauthorised by the Member States to carry out ship survey and certification\nactivities on their behalf, with a view to achieving the Union's objectives and\nin particular to enhance maritime safety and the protection of the environment.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the exception of the\nabove described areas of potential conflict with Union law, the two draft Codes\nmust on the whole be considered a positive development insofar as they will\nestablish high global standards for the activities of flag States and\nrecognised organisations alike; for these reasons, the development of an IMO RO\nCode was explicitly envisaged in recital (4) of the Regulation 391/2009.
