This proposal concerns a number of agricultural and industrial products.\nThe suspension requests were examined in the light of the criteria set out in\nthe Communication from the Commission concerning autonomous tariff suspensions\nand quotas (OJ C 363, 13.12.2011, p. 6). Following this review, the\nCommission considers that the suspension of duties is justified for the\nproducts listed in Annex I of this proposal. Also, Annex I lists i) products\nfor which the wording of their description had to be changed and ii) products\nfor which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary, with their new description\nand/or CN \u2013 TARIC code.\nProducts for which tariff suspension is no\nlonger in the Union's economic interests have to be withdrawn. Acordingly, Annex\nII lists the products removed from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nand products for which the wording of their description had to be changed, or\nproducts for which a new CN or TARIC code became necessary, which are replaced\nby new description and/or codes in Annex I.\nThe proposal is in line\nwith the trade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. Particularly,\nthis proposal is not at the expense of countries enjoying a preferential\ntrading agreement with the EU (e.g. GSP, ACP regime, candidate countries and\npotential candidates).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Economic Tariff Questions Group, in\nwhich the competent authorities of all Member State are represented, was\nconsulted. All listed suspensions correspond to agreements or compromises\nreached in the discussions of the group.\nThere was no mention of potentially serious\nrisks with irreversible consequences.\nThis proposal will follow an inter-service\nconsultation procedure and will be published after its adoption by the Council.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis of this regulation proposal\nis Article 31 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nBy virtue of Article 31 of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas\nare approved by the Council acting by qualified majority on the basis of a\nCommission proposal, therefore a regulation is the appropriate instrument.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. \nThe proposal complies with the principle of\nproportionality as this set of measures is in line with the principles set out\nto simplify the procedures for the operators engaged in foreign trade and in\naccordance with the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff\nsuspensions and quotas (C 363, 13.12.2011 p.6).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nUncollected customs duties of a total\namount of approximately 33,4 Mio \u20ac/year. The effect on the\ntraditional own resources of the budget is -25 Mio \u20ac/year (75% x 33,4 Mio \u20ac/year).\n2013/0125 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nsuspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural,\nfishery and industrial products\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\nthe Union to suspend totally the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on 80 new\nproducts currently not listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011[1]. Those products should therefore be inserted in that Annex.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is no longer in the\ninterest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous Common Customs\nTariff duties for 14 of the products which are currently listed in the Annex to\nRegulation (EU) No 1344/2011 with TARIC codes 2008 60 19 30, 2008 60 39 30,\n2916 19 95 30, 2917 39 95 10, 2934 99 90 12, 3204 11 00 10, 3204 17 00 45, 3204\n17 00 55, 3204 19 00 72, 3911 90 99 75, 8108 20 00 20, 8108 90 50 40, 8108 90\n50 80, 8708 80 99 10 and 9405 40 39 30. Those products should therefore be\ndeleted from that Annex.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to modify\nthe product description of 22 suspensions in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nin order to take account of technical product developments and economic trends\non the market or linguistic adaptations. Moreover, TARIC codes for eight products\nshould be changed. In addition, for three products multiple classification is\nconsidered necessary whereas for 12 products double classification is no longer\nnecessary.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The suspensions for which\ntechnical modifications are necessary should be deleted from the list of\nsuspensions in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011 and\nshould be reinserted in that list with new product descriptions, or new CN or\nTARIC codes. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For three products it is\nconsidered necessary, in the interest of the Union, to amend the date for their\nmandatory review. The reviewed suspensions should therefore be deleted from the\nlist of suspensions in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nand reinserted in that list with new time limits for a mandatory review.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the inerest of clarity,\nthe modified entries should be marked with an asterisk in the lists of inserted\nand deleted suspensions set out in Annex I and Annex II to this Regulation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of their temporary\nnature, the suspensions listed in Annex I should be reviewed systematically, at\nthe latest five years after their application or renewal. Moreover, closure of\ncertain suspensions should be warranted at any time, as a result of a proposal\nof the Commission on the basis of a review carried out on initiative of the Commission\nor on request of one or more Member States if the suspensions are no longer in\nthe Union's interest to be maintained or due to technical product developments,\nto changed circumstances or to economic trends on the market.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n1344/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the suspensions laid\ndown in this Regulation have to take effect on 1 July 2013, this\nRegulation should apply from that date and should enter into enter into force\nimmediately upon its publication in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1344/2011\nis amended as follows:\n(1)              \nThe rows for the products listed in Annex I to\nthis Regulation are inserted.\n(2)              \nThe rows for the products for which the CN and\nTARIC codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation are deleted.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\nthe day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels,

The\nuncollected duties corresponding to these suspensions, calculated on the basis\nof requesting Member State projections for the period 2013 to 2017, amount to 20 Mio\n\u20ac/year.\nOn the basis of the existing statistics for\npreceding years, it would appear, however, necessary to increase this amount by\nan average factor, estimated at 1,8 to take account of imports into other\nMember States using the same suspensions. This means uncollected duties loss of\nrevenue of some 36 Mio \u20ac /year.\nWithdrawal:\n14 products have been withdrawn from this Annex\nreflecting the reintroduction of customs duties. This represents an increase of\n2,6 Mio \u20ac in resources, as estimated on the basis of 2012 statistics.\nEstimated cost of this operation\nOn the basis of the above, the impact on the\nloss of revenue resulting from this Regulation may be estimated at 36 \u2013 2,6 = 33,4 Mio\n\u20ac (gross amount, including collection costs) x 0,75 = 25 Mio\n\u20ac/year for the period 01.07.2013 - 31.12.2017.\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 349, 31.12.2011, p. 1.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding traditional own resources (agricultural\nduties, sugar levies, customs duties) the amounts indicated must be net amounts,\ni.e. gross amounts after deduction of 25 % of collection costs \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
