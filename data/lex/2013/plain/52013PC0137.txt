These fishing opportunities\nare usually amended several times during the period in which they are in\neffect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposed amendments seek to modify the three\nRegulations mentioned above as follows:\n(a) Regulation (EU) No 44/2012\nAt the end of 2012, Lithuania\u00a0 agreed to exchange with another country fishing opportunities in the context of\nthe Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). The Commission accepted\nsuch agreement and notified it to the NAFO Secretariat on 9 January 2013. For\nreasons of transparency and consistency with other exchanges of fishing\nopportunities implemented in 2012, Regulation (EU) No 44/2012 should be amended\naccordingly. This modification does not affect in any way relative stability.\nFuture exchanges of fishing opportunities with third countries will follow the\nnew procedure established by Regulation (EU) No 40/2013.\n(b) Regulation (EU) No 39/2013\nA mistake is corrected regarding the\nprecise coordinates of the area subject to the TAC for herring in the Firth of\nClyde, within ICES subarea VI.\n(c) Regulation (EU) No 40/2013\nIn accordance with the procedure provided\nfor in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, the Union held consultations on fishing rights\nwith those partners during 2012. The consultations with the Faroe Islands and Iceland were not finalised. Consultations with Norway were postponed to January 2013, so\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013 included provisional fishing opportunities for those\nstocks affected by arrangements with Norway, amounting to a proportion of the\n2012 fishing opportunities concerned. The negotiations with Norway were concluded on 18 January 2013. As a consequence, it is necessary to establish\nthe definitive fishing opportunities for the relevant stocks in Annexes IA and\nIB of Regulation (EU) No 40/2013.\nThe 9th Annual Meeting of the Western and\nCentral Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), held in Manila from 2 to 9\nDecember 2012 adopted new conservation and management measures for bigeye tuna,\nyellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna concerning fishing effort limitations, as well\nas measures on the closed area for fishing with fishg aggregating devices\n(FADs). WCPFC also agreed on management measures regarding the overlap area\nbetween WCPFC and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). As a\nresult, EU vessels listed in the registers of both organisations will have to\ncomply with the IATTC conservation and management measures set out in the Union's fishing opportunities regulations when fishing in the overlap area. The WCPFC\nmeasures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\nTwo recommendations from the International\nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) accord the Union a flexibility, up to a 200 tonnes, as regards catches taken in the South and North\nmanagement areas (ICCAT recommendations 2011-02 and 2012-01). Annex ID should\nbe amended in order to enable Member States to apply these ICCAT provisions.\nNew or modified fishing opportunities in\nthe South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) were\nestablished following the outcome of the 1st annual meeting of the\nSPRFMO Commission held on 28 January \u2013 1 February 2013. The provisional quotas\nincluded in Annex IJ of Regulation (EU) No 40/2013 for jack mackerel, the\nreporting associated with them, and other provisions regarding effort\nlimitations must now be implemented accordingly.\n2013/0076 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulations (EU) No 44/2012, (EU)\nNo 39/2013 and (EU) No 40/2013 as regards certain fishing opportunities\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission[1],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Regulations (EU) No\n44/2012[2],\n(EU) No 39/2013[3]\nand (EU) No 40/2013[4]\nthe Council fixed, for 2012 and 2013, fishing opportunities for certain fish\nstocks and groups of fish stocks in EU waters and, for EU vessels, in certain\nnon-EU waters.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\narea within ICES subarea VI in which the herring TAC for the Firth of\nClyde applies was not defined with enough precision in Regulation (EU) No\n39/2013. The relevant coordinates should be amended accordingly.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional fishing\nopportunities for Greenland halibut in NAFO 3LMNO became available for the\nUnion on 31 December 2012 as a result of quota transfers between the Union and\nother Contracting Parties to the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation\n(NAFO). The Union accepted such transfers by means of a notification to NAFO on\n9 January 2013. Consequently, for the year 2012, Annex IC to Regulation (EU) No\n44/2012 should be amended so as to reflect those new fishing opportunities.\nThese modifications concern the year 2012 only and should be without prejudice\nto the principle of relative stability.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fishing opportunities for\nEU and Norwegian vessels, and the conditions of access to each other\u2019s waters\nare established each year following consultations on fishing rights held in\naccordance with the procedure provided for in the\nagreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway[5].\nPending the conclusion of those consultations on the arrangements for 2013,\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013 fixed provisional fishing opportunities for the\nstocks concerned. On 18 January 2013, the consultations with Norway were concluded and the arrangements for the fishing opportunities for 2013\nestablished. Regulation (EU) No 40/2013 should be amended accordingly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 9th Annual Meeting of\nthe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), held in Manila\nfrom 2 to 9 December 2012, adopted new conservation and management measures for\nbigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna concerning fishing effort\nlimitations, as well as measures on the closed area for fishing with fish\naggregating devices (FADs). The WCPFC also agreed on management measures\nregarding the overlap area between WCPFC and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna\nCommission (IATTC). According to those measures, EU vessels listed in the register\nof both organisations must comply only with the IATTC conservation and management\nmeasures set out in Regulation (EU) No 40/2013 when fishing in the overlap\narea. Those WCPFC measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under ICCAT provisions on\nthe conservation of Atlantic swordfish, the Union may count up to 200 tonnes of\nits swordfish catch taken from the North Atlantic management area against its\nuncaught South Atlantic swordfish quota. The Union may also count up to 200\ntonnes of its swordfish catch taken from the South Atlantic management area\nagainst its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish quota. Those provisions should be\nimplemented in the law of the Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At its first annual\nmeeting, held in 2013, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management\nOrganisation (SPRFMO) adopted fishing opportunities consisting of a TAC for\njack mackerel, including a modification of the associated reporting in this\nfishery, and effort limitations for pelagic and bottom fisheries. Those\nprovisions should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No 39/2013\nand (EU) No 40/2013 apply, in general, from 1 January 2013. This Regulation\nshould apply from 1 January 2013 as regards amendments to these regulations. Such\nretroactive application will be without prejudice to the principles of legal\ncertainty and protection of legitimate expectations as the fishing\nopportunities concerned have not yet been exhausted. The amendment concerning\nGreenland halibut in NAFO 3LMNO should apply as of 9 January 2013, the date of\nnotification by the Union of its acceptance to NAFO. Since the modification of\nsome catch limits have an influence on the economic activities and the planning\nof the fishing season of EU vessels, this Regulation should enter into force\nimmediately after its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1 \nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 44/2012\nAnnex IC to Regulation (EU) No 44/2012 is\namended in accordance with the text in Annex I to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 39/2013\nAnnex I to Regulation (EU) No 39/2013 is\namended in accordance with the text in Annex II to this Regulation.\nArticle 3\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 40/2013\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 4, the following point\n(n) is added:\n\"(n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'overlap area between IATTC and\nWCPFC' mean the geographical area defined by the following limits:\n\u2013              \nlongitude 150\u00ba W,\n\u2013              \nlongitude 130\u00ba W,\n\u2013              \nlatitude 4\u00ba S,\n\u2013              \nlatitude 50\u00ba S.\u201d\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 24 is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\"Article 24\nPelagic fisheries - capacity limitation\nMember States having actively exercised\npelagic fisheries activities in the SPRFMO Convention Area in 2007, 2008 or\n2009 shall limit the total level of gross tonnage of vessels flying their flag\nand fishing for pelagic stocks in 2013 to the total Union level of 78 600 gross\ntonnage in that area.\"\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 25 is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\"Article 25\nPelagic fisheries - TACs\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only Member States having actively\nexercised pelagic fisheries activities in the SPRFMO Convention Area in 2007,\n2008 or 2009, as specified in Article 24, may fish for pelagic stocks in that\narea in accordance with the TACs set out in Annex IJ. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fishing opportunities set out in Annex\nIJ may only be fished under the condition that Member States send to the\nCommission, in order to communicate them to the SPRFMO Secretariat, the list of\nvessels actively fishing or engaged in transhipment in the Convention Area,\nrecords from vessel monitoring systems (VMS), monthly catch reports and, where\navailable, port calls at the latest by the fifth day of the following month.\u201d\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 29 is replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\"Article 29\nFishing effort limitations for bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna,\nskipjack tuna \nMember States shall ensure that fishing days\nallocated to purse-seine vessels fishing for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus),\nyellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus\npelamis) in the part of the WCPFC Convention Area in the high seas and\nlocated between 20\u00ba N and 20\u00ba S does not increase.\"\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 30, paragraph 1 is\nreplaced by the following:\n\u201c1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the part of the WCPFC\nConvention Area located between 20\u00ba N and 20\u00ba S, fishing activities of\npurse-seine vessels making use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) shall be\nprohibited between 00:00 hours of 1 July 2013 and 24:00 hours of 31 October\n2013.
