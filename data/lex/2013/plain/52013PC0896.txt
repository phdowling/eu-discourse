According to this Article, the Commission is to submit appropriate proposals on which the European Parliament and the Council shall decide in accordance with Article 336 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. On 31 August 2012, the Commission submitted a Report to the Council on the exception clause (Article 10 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations) (COM (2012) 476) and on 5 December 2012, the Commission submitted to the Council a Commission staff working document on the exception clause (SWD (2012) 428). The Court of Justice stated that when the assessments made by the Commission and the Council result in opposite conclusions, the Commission must submit to the European Parliament and to the Council appropriate proposals on the basis of that Article, in order to involve the European Parliament and to allow the legislators to decide on the appropriate measures to be taken with regard to the existing economic and social situation in the Union (paragraph 76). According to the judgment, the Commission has a margin of appraisal as regards the appropriate character of the proposals, given the economic and social data, as well as, where necessary, other factors to be taken into consideration, such as those that are relevant to human resources management and, in particular, the needs of recruitment (paragraph 74). The Commission reports mentioned above refer systematically to a stagnation and an ongoing crisis as well as a high level of unemployment rate and a high level of public deficit and debt in the European Union, though not concluding that the criteria set in Article 10 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations are met.\u00a0 As the Court judged that the Commission has no margin to decide whether or not to trigger the exception clause with regard to these criteria, the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations constitutes the only means of taking account of an economic crisis in the adjustment of remuneration and therefore of disapplying the criteria laid down in Article 3(2) of that annex. The Commission shall take this economic and social data into account in order to propose appropriate measures to derogate from the strict application of the method. At the same time, since 2011, there have been a number of relevant developments. The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a reform of the Staff Regulations which includes a suspension of adjustments of salaries, allowances and pensions in 2013 and 2014 leading to a freeze for two years and several significant changes to the working conditions of staff of the EU institutions such as measures with regard to weekly working time, career, pensions and leave days which lead to significant savings. Taking into account the result of the normal application of the method in 2012, the social and economic situation, the reform of the Staff Regulations as well as the situation with regard to recruitment and management of human resources observed over the last years, the Commission concludes that the present proposal as well as the proposal for the adjustment of 2011 would be appropriate measures to be taken by the legislator based on Article 10 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations.\u00a0 Under Article 65 of the Staff Regulations the remuneration and pensions shall be updated before the end of each year. In this regard, the urgent implementation of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-63/12, issued on 19 November 2013, constitutes a due reason for adopting this Regulation rapidly. Elements of the new method determining the content of the Proposal The Eurostat report was submitted to the Council on 5 December 2012 (SWD (2012) 427). According to this report, the average change in the purchasing power of national civil servants\u2019 remuneration in the reference period measured by the specific indicator is equal to -1.1%. The change in the cost of living in Brussels in the reference period is equal to 2.8%. The amount of the adjustment is obtained by multiplying together the specific indicator and the Brussels International Index calculated by Eurostat. The proposed adjustment to remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg was therefore 1.7%. The amount of the adjustment must be corrected to take into account the above mentioned elements. The Commission considers therefore as appropriate to reduce the proposed adjustment to remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg to 0.9% instead of 1.7% with regard to the strict application of the method. \n 120 || The economic parities for remuneration establish the purchasing power equivalence of the remuneration paid in Brussels, as the reference city, with that paid in the other places of employment. Eurostat has calculated those parities in agreement with the national statistical bodies. The economic parities for pensions establish the purchasing power equivalence of the pension paid in Belgium, as the reference country, with that paid in the other countries of residence. Eurostat has calculated those parities in agreement with the national statistical bodies. With regard to the parallel proposal for 2011, the same approach would result in an adjustment of 0.9% instead of 1.7%. The new proposals for 2011 and 2012 would therefore in effect reduce the result of the normal application of the method in force in 2011 and 2012 by 47%. \n 130 || Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Article 65, Article 10 of Annex XI and Article 19 of Annex XIII of the modified Staff Regulations. \n Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || Consultation of interested parties \n 211 || Methods of consultation used, main sectors covered and general profile of respondents The elements of the proposal have been discussed with the staff representatives in accordance with the appropriate procedures. \n 212 || Summary of replies received and the way in which they have been taken into account The proposal takes account of the opinions of the parties consulted. \n Budgetary implications \n 401 || The impact of the adjustment to remuneration and pensions on administrative expenditure and on revenue is detailed in the financial statement annexed hereto. \n2013/0439 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nadjusting with the effect from 1 July 2012\r\nthe remuneration and pensions of the officials and other servants of the\r\nEuropean Union and the correction coefficients applied thereto\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Staff Regulations of\r\nOfficials of the European Union and in particular Article 10 of Annex XI thereof\r\nand the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with\r\nthe Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-63/12, when the Council\r\nestablishes that at this stage of the procedure there is a serious and sudden\r\ndeterioration in the economic and social situation within the Union, the\r\nCommission must submit a Proposal under Article 336 in order to involve the\r\nEuropean Parliament in the legislative process. Equally the Council and the\r\nEuropean Parliament shall decide upon the Commission proposal having regard to\r\nthe criteria set in Article 65 of the Staff Regulations respecting the rules\r\nset in Annex XI with the exception of its Article 3(2).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court has confirmed\r\nthat the Commission has a margin of appraisal that should be based on Article\r\n65 of the Staff Regulations, as regards the content of appropriate proposals.\r\nThe review of remuneration may, where appropriate, take into account other\r\nfactors, such as the human resources management and in particular the needs of\r\nrecruitment. Within this margin of appraisal, the Commission may base its\r\ndecision upon economic and social data such as the 2012 stagnation and the\r\nongoing crisis as well as the high level of unemployment rate and the high\r\nlevel of public deficit and debt in the European Union. The Commission has\r\ntaken into account as well developments since 2011 such as the reform of the\r\nStaff Regulations and especially the two years freeze imposed to EU officials\r\nand the increase of weekly working time to 40h.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the data\r\nsupplied by Eurostat in agreement with the national statistical offices of the\r\nMember States, national civil servants lost 1.1% of their purchasing power, the\r\nsame loss in purchasing power should have been applied to the EU officials and\r\nother servants for the period 1 July 2012 \u2013 30 June 2013 if the Commission\r\nwould have followed the normal application of the method. The Commission\r\nconsidered however as appropriate to reduce the proposed adjustment to\r\nremuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg to 0.9% instead of 1.7%\r\nwith regard to the economic crisis and the efforts already consented by EU\r\nofficials.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same approach would\r\nlead in 2011 to an adjustment of 0.9% instead of 1.7%. The total adjustment for\r\nboth years would be therefore 47% lower than under the normal application of\r\nthe method in force in 2011 and 2012.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has\r\nproposed the above measures in order to involve the European Parliament in the\r\nlegislative procedure and to allow the co-legislators to decide on the\r\nappropriate measures in accordance with Article 336 TFEU.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Article 65 of the\r\nStaff Regulations the remuneration and pensions shall be updated before the end\r\nof each year. In this regard, the urgent implementation of the Judgment of the\r\nCourt of Justice in Case C-63/12, issued on 19 November 2013, constitutes a due\r\nreason for adopting this Regulation expediently.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nWith effect from 1 July 2012, the date \u20181\r\nJuly 2011\u2019 in the second paragraph of Article 63 of the Staff Regulations shall\r\nbe replaced by \u20181 July 2012\u2019.\nArticle 2\nWith effect from 1 July 2012, the table of\r\nbasic monthly salaries in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations applicable for\r\nthe purposes of calculating remuneration and pensions shall be replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\nArticle 3\nWith effect from 1 July 2012, the\r\ncorrection coefficients applicable to the remuneration of officials and other\r\nservants under Article 64 of the Staff Regulations shall be as indicated in\r\ncolumn 2 of the following table.\nWith effect from 1 January 2013, the\r\ncorrection coefficients applicable under Article 17(3) of Annex VII to the\r\nStaff Regulations to transfers by officials and other servants shall be as\r\nindicated in column 3 of the following table.\nWith effect from 1 July 2012, the\r\ncorrection coefficients applicable to pensions under Article 20(1) of Annex\r\nXIII to the Staff Regulations shall be as indicated in column 4 of the\r\nfollowing table.\nWith effect from 16 May 2012, the\r\ncorrection coefficients applicable to pensions under Article 20(1) of Annex\r\nXIII to the Staff Regulations shall be as indicated in column 5 of the\r\nfollowing table.
