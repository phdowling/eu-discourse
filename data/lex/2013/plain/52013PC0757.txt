Regulation (EC) No\n1166/2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production\nmethods requires Farm Structure Surveys (FSS) to be carried out in the form of\nan agricultural census in 2010 and as sample surveys in 2013 and 2016. It also\nrequires a survey on agricultural production methods to be carried out in 2010\nor 2011. The Member States and the Commission need considerable funding to\ncarry out these surveys. According to the Regulation, the EU can cover a\nmaximum of 75 % of a Member State\u2019s costs of carrying them out. The maximum\namounts that the reimbursements are capped at are defined per country. Since the\nsurveys are spread out over two multi-annual financial framework periods, it\nwas not possible to fix their entire financing at the same time. Under Article\n14 of Regulation 1166/2008, the budgetary and legislative authority must fix the\nfinancial framework for FSS 2016 on a proposal from the Commission and based on\nthe new financial framework for the period starting in 2014.\nMoreover, the accession of Croatia to the European Union must be taken into account. This means that the Regulation\nneeds to be amended also to include the maximum contribution to Croatia.\nThe European Statistical System (ESS) strategy\nstates that, the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) should have an\nadvisory role and assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers.\nThis means that the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics should be\nreplaced by the ESSC for comitology procedures.\nThis proposal updates Regulation 1166/2008 as\nfollows: (i) establishes the financial framework 2014-18; (ii) sets out the\nEU\u2019s maximum financial contribution to Croatia\u2019s costs of carrying out the FSS;\nand (iii) changes the committee that assists the Commission.\nThe Farm Structure Surveys have been\ncarried out in a harmonised way across the European Union, based on legal acts,\nsince 1966. The present Regulation 1166/2008 is one in a series of legal acts\non the subject, and the proposal to amend this Regulation is therefore fully\nconsistent with European Statistical Programme and Union policies. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe main consultations with different\nstakeholders and other interested parties took place when Regulation 1166/2008\nwas drafted. The present proposal has been assessed by the Commission services\nwith regard to the need for FSS data. \nThe proposal was discussed with the\nStanding Committee for Agricultural Statistics.\nAn ex-ante evaluation of the initiative has\nbeen carried out. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe Regulation amends Regulation 1166/2008\non farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods. It\nestablishes the financial framework for the 2016 Farm Structure Surveys, sets\nout the EU\u2019s maximum financial contribution to Croatia\u2019s survey costs, and\nreplaces the committee that assists the Commission in exercising its\nimplementing powers.\nArticle 338 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union provides the legal basis for the production\nof the European statistics. Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative\nprocedure, the European Parliament and the Council adopt measures for the\nproduction of statistics where necessary for the performance of the activities\nof the Union. It sets out the requirements relating to the production of\nEuropean statistics, stating that they must conform to standards of\nimpartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence,\ncost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\nThe proposal complies with both the\nsubsidiarity and proportionality principles, as it concerns minor amendments to\nRegulation 1166/2008, some already foreseen in the legislative procedures\nleading to the adoption of that Regulation. \nProposed instrument: Regulation. Other\nmeans would not be appropriate as the proposal amends a Council and European\nParliament Regulation in force.\nOn 27 June 2013, the Commission adopted\nproposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council\nadapting to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\na number of legal acts providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with\nscrutiny (2013/0218 (COD). Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 on farm structure\nsurveys and the surveys on agricultural production methods was among the basic\nacts adapted to the delegated acts regime.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe Farm Structure Surveys are costly to\ncarry out so considerable funding is required from the Member States and the Commission to meet the information requirements. According to Regulation\n1166/2008, Member States will be reimbursed up to 75 % of their costs,\ncapped at maximum amounts defined per country. The amounts needed have been\nfixed in the Regulation, except for Croatia, who only joined the European Union\nin 2013. In addition, appropriations necessary for the management, maintenance\nand development of the database systems used within the Commission to process\nthe data supplied by Member States have been included. The overall financial\nframework for the period 2014 to 2018 totals EUR 20 650 000.\nIn order to satisfy the high quality requirements\nfor agricultural statistics and to ensure that the collected information is\nmade available and is used as efficiently as possible, actions are needed to\nimprove the methodology and find ways of lowering the burden on respondents and\nNational Statistical Institutes while at the same time meeting the emerging new\ninformation needs. This has led to proposal for allocation, via internal\nCommission procedure, additional Eurostat appropriations of an administrative\nnature to be used for development of the database and methodological issues.\n.\n2013/0367 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 on\nfarm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, as\nregards the financial framework for the period 2014-2018 \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\n338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1166/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on\nfarm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88[1]\nprovides for Member States to carry out farm structure surveys in 2010, 2013\nand 2016, for which they shall receive a maximum financial contribution of 75 %\nfrom the Union towards the cost of carrying out the surveys, subject to defined\nmaximum amounts. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to carry out the farm\nstructure surveys and to meet the information requirements of the Union,\nconsiderable funding is required from the Member States and from the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1166/2008 provided the financial envelope for the implementation of the\nprogramme of surveys, including management, maintenance and developments of the\ndatabase systems used within the Commission to process the data supplied by the\nMember States, and fixed the amount for the period 2008-2013. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008, the amount for the period 2014-2018 should\nbe fixed by the budgetary and legislative authority on a proposal from the\nCommission on the basis of the new financial framework for the period\ncommencing in 2014.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposed financial\nenvelope should only finance the carrying out of the Farm Structure Survey in\n2016 and related management, maintenance and development of the database\nsystems used within the Commission to process the data supplied by the Member\nStates. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the accession\nof Croatia and the need to conduct surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings\nin this Member State in 2016, a maximum Union contribution per survey should be\nfixed for Croatia; this adaptation is needed by reason of the accession and has\nnot been provided for in the Act of Accession.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Standing Committee for\nAgricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC of 31 July 1972[2] provides advice to and assists\nthe Commission in exercising of its implementing powers under legislative acts\nin agricultural statistics.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the strategy for a\nnew European Statistical System (ESS) structure, aimed at improving\ncoordination and partnership within the ESS, the European Statistical System\nCommittee, established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics[3], should have an advisory role\nand assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers.

This initiative provides a continued financial support to the\nMember States for collection of data on the structure of agricultural holdings\nin order to assure the data series and continued supply of information\nnecessary for monitoring and implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy.\nAll other aspects of the existing legal framework will remain unchanged and no\nnew impact is expected.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nThe proposal\u2019s implementation will be monitored through: (i) working group\nmeetings with Member States; (ii) validating the datasets according to the\nrules specified in the Data Supplier Manual; and (iii) analysis of the National\nMethodological Reports.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nThe farm structure surveys (the 2010 agriculture census and the 2013\nand 2016 sample surveys) are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThere is a need for harmonised data collection to be\nable to draw comparable EU-level conclusions in the context of the Common\nAgricultural Policy. The different climatic situation and environmental regions\nwithin the European Union, with their different farming practices, strengthen\nthe argument for a Union level approach. The action, according to the principle\nof subsidiarity leaves it for the countries to decide the way of collecting the\ndata (personal interviews, postal survey, internet- or telephone-based, use of\nother administrative sources etc.) however within the Regulation a number of\nharmonised information are to be collected, by using common definitions (which\ncould be understood differently between the MS depending on their agricultural\nreality). EU action is therefore necessary in order to obtain comparable\ninformation about the agriculture at EU level.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe FSS survey\u2019s structure is rather complex and requires\nsubstantial work in the Member States, according to what Member State\nrepresentatives implementing the survey in their countries report in the working\ngroups (currently, information on around 200 variables is collected for each\nfarm surveyed). A consultation on the burden for respondents and organisations\nresponsible for collecting the data was carried out in the FSS working group\nmeetings. It showed that collecting the data required puts a significant burden\non Member States (statistical offices and respondents), and that personal interviews\nare often needed to ensure high-quality data. The Member States and the\nCommission need considerable funding to carry out the surveys and collect the\ninformation required \u2014 experience shows that Member States\u2019 costs may\nsignificantly exceed the EU\u2019s contribution (capped at a maximum of 75 % of\nfixed amounts per country). While the financial framework for the 2010 and 2013\nsurveys was fixed in Regulation 1166/2008, the financial framework for the 2016\nFSS must be fixed by the budgetary and legislative authority on a proposal from\nthe Commission and based on the new financial framework for the period starting\nin 2014, as stipulated by Regulation 1166/2008.\nCoherence and possible synergy with other relevant\ninstruments\nThe farm structure surveys have a very long history of\nbeing carried out on an EU basis since 1966/67 and being covered by a legal\nframework. The current legal act in force (Regulation 1166/2008) covers the\nsurveys scheduled for agriculture census 2010 and sample surveys for 2013, as well\nas 2016. A new legislative initiative for continuation of this programme of\nsurveys post-2016 is foreseen, in order to continue serving the purpose of\nsupporting the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the CAP\n2020 and beyond. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\n\u00d7 Proposal/initiative\nof limited duration\n\u2013     \n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal/initiative\nin effect from [01/01/2014] to [31/12/2018]\n\u2013     \n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0 Financial\nimpact from 2014 to 2019\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned\n[8]\nx Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \nx by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nGrant recipients must deliver the data\ncollected and the corresponding methodological report.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified\nPotential data quality and timeliness\nissues.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\nValidation rules applied to datasets to be communicated to the\nMember States in advance; compliance with deadlines will be monitored.

This will ensure, for\nexample, that internal anti-fraud-related monitoring is fully aligned with the\nCAFS and that the fraud management risk approach is geared to identify fraud\nrisk areas and adequate responses. Networking groups and specific IT tools\ndedicated to analysing fraud cases will be set up where necessary.\nEurostat has defined a control strategy 2013-2017 accompanying the\nimplementation of expenditure. The measures and tools in this strategy are\nfully applicable to the proposed regulation. Reducing complexity, applying\ncost-effective monitoring procedures as well as conducting risk based ex-ante\nand ex-post controls will aim to reduce the likelihood and contribute to the\nprevention of fraud. Specific awareness raising measures and relevant training\nwith regard to fraud prevention are part of the control strategy.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\n\u00b7      Existing expenditure budget lines\nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number Description: || Diff./non-diff.
