Further, the moratorium provides significant economic benefits\r\nto the Union companies. \nAs\r\nregards non-violation and situation complaints, the Union is of the opinion\r\nthat they were designed to maintain a balance of negotiated market access and\r\ntariff concessions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (\u201cGATT\u201d)\r\nand, accordingly, it does not appear appropriate to have them apply at this\r\nstage under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property\r\nRights (\u201cTRIPS\u201d).\nThe proposal provides that the Council\r\nauthorises the Commission to take a position on behalf of the European Union\r\nwithin the WTO to join a consensus as regards the said decisions. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL BASIS OF PROPOSAL\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) provides that when a Decision having legal effects\r\nneeds to be taken in a body set up by an international agreement, the Council,\r\non a proposal from the Commission or the High Representative of the Union for\r\nForeign Affairs and Security Policy, shall adopt a Decision establishing the\r\nposition to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf. The\r\nextension of the moratoria falls under this provision as the Decision is taken\r\nin a body set up by an international agreement (the WTO Ministerial Conference)\r\naffecting the rights and obligations of the Union.\nThe envisaged e-commerce moratorium relates\r\nto matters falling within the scope of the common commercial policy (Article\r\n207 TFEU) and in particular, to obligations under the General Agreement on\r\nTrade in Services. Similarly, the envisaged moratorium on non-violation and situation complaints relates to matters\r\nfalling within the scope of the common commercial policy, in particular to\r\nobligations under the TRIPS. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SCOPE OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe Commission will be authorised to take a\r\nposition on behalf of the European Union to support the extension of the\r\ne-commerce and non-violation and situation complaints moratoria by the WTO Ministerial\r\nConference. Should there be an emerging consensus to propose the indefinite\r\nextension of the \"e-commerce moratorium\" and/or the non violation and\r\nsituation complaints moratorium, so that the moratoria in question become\r\npermanent, the European Union should be supportive. \nConsistent with Article 218(10), the\r\nEuropean Parliament will be immediately and fully informed.\n2013/0360 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganisation (WTO) as regards an extension of the moratoria on customs duties\r\non electronic transmissions (\"e-commerce moratorium\") and\r\nnon-violation and situation complaints\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard\r\nto the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A moratorium on customs\r\nduties on electronic transmissions (\"e-commerce moratorium\") stating\r\nthat \u201cmembers will continue their current practice of not imposing customs\r\nduties on electronic transmissions\u201d was adopted in the form of a\r\ndeclaration at the 1998 Ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation\r\n(\u201cWTO\u201d). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currently the moratorium\r\ntakes the form of a WTO Ministerial Conference decision, which has been renewed\r\nevery two years since 1998. The moratorium was last extended at the WTO Ministerial\r\nConference in December 2011 till 2013. It should be further extended by the WTO\r\nMinisterial Conference or made permanent should a consensus to that effect\r\narise in the on-going or future discussions.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No consensus on banning or\r\nallowing non-violation or situation complaints under the TRIPS Agreement has\r\nbeen possible up to now. The Declaration adopted at the WTO Ministerial\r\nConference in Hong Kong in 2005 states: \u201cWe take note of the work done by\r\nthe Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights pursuant\r\nto paragraph 11.1 of the Doha Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and\r\nConcerns and paragraph 1.h of the Decision adopted by the General Council on 1\r\nAugust 2004, and direct it to continue its examination of the scope and\r\nmodalities for complaints of the types provided for under subparagraphs 1(b)\r\nand 1(c) of Article XXIII of GATT 1994 and make recommendations to our next\r\nSession. It is agreed that, in the meantime, Members will not initiate such\r\ncomplaints under the TRIPS Agreement.\u201d\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedure so far for\r\nthe successive extensions of the moratorium on non-violation and situation\r\ncomplaints has been a decision by the WTO Ministerial Conference following a recommendation\r\nfrom the Council for Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.\r\nConsidering that a very limited number of WTO members are insisting that the\r\ndebate surrounding the application of non-violation and situation complaints\r\ncontinues, should those countries change their stance in favour of a permanent\r\nwaiver, the EU should be ready to join the consensus.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is in the interest of\r\nthe European Union to give its support to the extension of the moratoria on\r\ne-commerce and non-violation and situation complaints.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission will report regularly to the Trade Policy Committee on the state of\r\nplay of the discussions on further extensions of the moratoria on e-commerce\r\nand non-violation and situation complaints, in particular should the positions\r\nof other Members in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the adoption of\r\nsucessive decisions by the WTO Ministerial Conference change,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position of the European Union within\r\nthe Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation shall be to support\r\nthe extension of the moratoria on customs duties on\r\nelectronic transmissions (\"e-commerce moratorium\") and non-violation\r\nand situation complaints.\nShould there be an emerging consensus to\r\npropose the indefinite extension of the \"e-commerce moratorium\" and/or\r\nthe non-violation and situation complaints moratorium, the position of the European Union within the Ministerial Conference\r\nof the World Trade Organisation shall be to support the longer period of time\r\nor the turning of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions\r\nand/or the moratorium on non-violation and situations complaints into a\r\npermanent one.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
