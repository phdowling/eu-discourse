This\r\napproach was followed in the submission by the European Union and its Member States on their commitment under a second commitment period in April 2012.[5]\nApart from adopting the Doha Amendment, the\r\nDoha Climate Change Conference also adopted a number of decisions on technical\r\nissues related to the implementation of the substantive mitigation commitments listed\r\nin the Doha Amendment: these include decisions on the accounting and management\r\nof Kyoto units in the transition from the first to the second commitment period\r\nand for the second commitment period (Decisions 1/CMP.8 and 2/CMP.8).[6]. A further set of decisions,\r\ncompleting the implementation package, is in preparation, and the European\r\nUnion is working to help ensure their adoption at the Warsaw Climate Change Conference\r\nin November 2013.\nJoint fulfilment of the commitments of\r\nthe European Union, its Member States and Iceland\nArticle 4 of the Kyoto Protocol allows\r\nParties to fulfil jointly their respective commitments. The European Union and\r\nits Member States used this option when they ratified the Kyoto Protocol in\r\n2002 and implemented its first commitment period[7].\r\nDuring the negotiations on the Doha Amendment, the European Union and its Member States made it clear that they again intended to fulfil their commitments jointly for\r\nthe second commitment period, this time also with Iceland.\nParties that agreed to fulfil their\r\ncommitments jointly are each deemed to have met those commitments if their\r\njoint commitment is achieved (based on their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions\r\nover the duration of the commitment period). In the event of failure to achieve\r\nthe joint commitment, however, each Party is held responsible for its emission\r\nlevel set out in their joint fulfilment agreement. The Kyoto Protocol therefore\r\nrequires the Parties to a joint fulfilment agreement to set out, and notify\r\nwith the deposit of their instruments of acceptance, the respective emission\r\nlevels allocated to each member of the joint fulfilment agreement.\nThe terms of the joint fulfilment of the\r\ncommitment of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland is set out in Annex I of the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of\r\nthe Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder.[8] The terms will also be included\r\nin the bilateral agreement with Iceland, for which the Commission proposed to\r\nthe Council a recommendation for a negotiating mandate in June 2013. Once\r\nagreed, these terms, including the respective emission levels, need to be\r\nnotified to the UNFCCC when the European Union, its Member States and Iceland jointly deposit their instruments of acceptance of the Doha Amendment.\nEmissions accounting after 2012\nThe Kyoto Protocol\u2019s second commitment\r\nperiod will continue and to some extent enhance the existing comprehensive system\r\nof emissions accounting to ensure transparency of the performance of Parties\r\nand compliance with their obligations. At the heart of this system is the\r\nrequirement, for each Party with a commitment, to calculate an assigned amount.\r\nThis assigned amount represents the amount of tonnes each Party is allowed to\r\nemit during the commitment period, in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq).\r\nIt is issued in the form of assigned amount units (AAUs) in each Party\u2019s\r\nnational registry. Under the joint fulfilment agreement set out in Annex II to\r\nthe proposal for a Council Decision this means that the European Union, its\r\nMember States and Iceland are each responsible for issuing to their national\r\nregistries AAUs representing their respective assigned amounts.\nIn addition to AAUs, national registries\r\nwill also hold, and account for, transactions in units resulting from the use\r\nof the Kyoto Protocol's flexible mechanisms. These include not only AAUs, but\r\nalso certified emission reductions (CERs), for clean development mechanism\r\nprojects, emission reduction units (ERUs) for joint implementation projects, as\r\nwell as removal units (RMUs) for removals by sinks. Transactions in these units\r\nwill be subject to international requirements such as the eligibility criteria\r\nfor participation in the flexible mechanisms and those governing the commitment\r\nperiod reserve (CPR). These requirements provide safeguards against a Party\u2019s\r\nover-selling of units where this is not justified by actual emission reductions\r\nby that Party. In addition, the Doha Climate Change Conference agreed rules on\r\nthe transition of the first to the second commitment period, in particular in\r\nrelation to the carry-over (banking) of surplus AAUs from the first commitment\r\nperiod.\nAlthough the newly agreed Kyoto rules do not,\r\nin principle, affect the operation of the EU ETS and the Effort Sharing\r\nDecision, the interaction between the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s accounting system and\r\nthe accounting rules under European Union legislation should be clarified, and\r\nthe implementation of the Kyoto rules must be aligned with those under EU\r\nlegislation. In addition, the implementation of the joint fulfilment agreement\r\nwill require further technical rules to be drawn up.\nLegal basis for technical\r\nimplementation in the European Union\nDuring the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first\r\ncommitment period (2008 to 2012), internationally agreed requirements were\r\nimplemented through the Monitoring Mechanism Decision[9] and the Registry Regulations\r\napplicable for phase two of the EU ETS (2008-2012).[10] These requirements included the\r\naccounting of emissions and units, the EU\u2019s joint fulfilment, the unit\r\nmanagement required with regard to commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and\r\ntheir interaction with unit management processes under the EU ETS. The Registry\r\nRegulations contained accounting and unit management rules for implementation\r\nof the EU ETS and for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first commitment\r\nperiod. The Registry Regulation currently in force[11] only contains provisions for\r\nunit management related to the implementation and operation of phase three of\r\nthe EU ETS and the Effort-Sharing Decision. It does not regulate accounting\r\nrequirements for the technical implementation of the Protocol after 2012.\nThe implementation of the Kyoto Protocol\r\nafter 2012 requires a set of technical implementation rules to be drawn up for\r\nthe European Union, its Member States and Iceland. The recently adopted\r\nMonitoring Mechanism Regulation[12]\r\ndoes not contain the legal basis that would enable the Commission to do so in\r\nrelation to Member States\u2019 national registries. Hence the need for this amendment\r\nto the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation to provide the required legal basis.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 technical implementation\r\nof the Kyoto Protocol after 2012\nTo ensure the technical implementation of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol in the European Union after 2012, enable the effective\r\noperation of the joint fulfilment of the commitments of the European Union, its\r\n Member States and Iceland, and ensure its alignment with the operation of the\r\nEU ETS and the Effort Sharing Decision, technical implementation rules are\r\nrequired in the European Union. These rules should address a number of issues,\r\nincluding:\n\u2013                        \r\nUnit management processes such as transactions\r\nof Kyoto units (issuance, transfer, acquisition, cancellation, retirement,\r\ncarry-over, replacement or expiry date change) in and between the national\r\nregistries of the European Union, Member States and Iceland;\n\u2013                        \r\nAccounting processes related to the transition\r\nfrom the first to the second commitment period, including the carry-over of\r\nsurplus AAUs, CERs and ERUs from the first to the second commitment period;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe establishment and maintenance of a previous period\r\nsurplus reserve (PPSR) and a commitment period reserve (CPR) for each member of\r\nthe joint fulfilment agreement;\n\u2013                        \r\nThe levy or \u2018share of proceeds\u2019 applied to the\r\nissuance of ERUs and the first international transfer of AAUs in the second\r\ncommitment period.\nThis proposal for a Regulation of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council provides the basis for implementing\r\nthese technical issues in the European Union through the adoption of legal\r\nacts.\nUnit management processes\nThe delegated acts envisaged in this\r\nproposal are needed to ensure that all transactions of Kyoto units in the\r\nnational registries of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland are consistent with the joint fulfilment of their commitments. The transactions\r\ninclude issuance, transfer, acquisition, cancellation, carry-over, replacement,\r\nexpiry date change and retirement. It is also necessary to ensure effective implementation\r\nof unit management processes established for the accounting of emissions and\r\nunits under the EU ETS and the Effort Sharing Decision. The joint fulfilment\r\nagreement for the second commitment period will require a further specification\r\nof Kyoto implementation rules in the European Union.\nMoreover, both the EU ETS and the Effort\r\nSharing Decision allow for the limited use of Kyoto units for compliance with\r\nobligations established in EU legislation. It is essential that the technical\r\nimplementation of the Kyoto rules in the European Union provides for the full\r\nflexibility set down in Union legislation, so that these units can be accessed\r\nby operators in line with the provisions of the EU ETS and by Member States in\r\nrelation to their obligations under the Effort Sharing Decision. It is also\r\nessential that the technical implementation maintains robust accounting\r\npractices relevant to the alignment of Kyoto implementation rules with the EU\r\nETS and the Effort Sharing Decision. This includes the need to ensure that a Kyoto unit is issued or retired for each related EU unit being created or used for\r\ncompliance. \nIn addition, the delegated acts envisaged\r\nin this proposal are required to define an effective regulation of the\r\nretirement of units after 2012: the achievement of the joint commitment depends\r\non the retirement of units by the European Union, each Member State and Iceland, according to their respective emission levels. A coherent process of the\r\nretirement of units by the Union, the Member States and Iceland and clear\r\nidentification of the units to be retired by each Party will guarantee that\r\ncompliance under Union legislation will also mean compliance with commitments\r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol and vice versa. Moreover, such a process is needed to\r\nsafeguard the integrity of accounting under the EU ETS. Provided that operators\r\ncovered by the EU ETS comply with obligations therein, it will also guarantee\r\nthat there is no need to acquire further Kyoto units to cover those emissions\r\nfor compliance with Kyoto accounting requirements for the second commitment\r\nperiod. To this end, the delegated acts envisaged in this proposal will ensure\r\nthat emissions covered by the EU ETS between 1 January 2013 and 31 December\r\n2020 correspond to the subsequent retirement of units valid for the second\r\ncommitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. Essentially, they will ensure that\r\none Kyoto unit, valid for the second commitment period, is retired for each\r\nunit surrendered in the EU ETS for emissions from sources listed in Annex A to\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. Similarly, they will also establish that Kyoto units, valid\r\nfor the second commitment period, are retired against emissions and removals of\r\n Member States and Iceland in the non-ETS sectors, to the extent that these\r\ngases, sources and sinks are covered by the Protocol.\nAccounting processes related to the transition\r\nfrom the first to the second commitment period\nDecision 13/CMP.1, which contains the Kyoto\r\nProtocol\u2019s key accounting rules,[13]\r\nsets out the provisions to enable Parties to carry over ERUs, CERs and AAUs to\r\nthe subsequent commitment period after the compliance assessment has been\r\ncompleted for all Parties. Under this Decision, ERUs and CERs may be carried\r\nover up to a limit equivalent to 2.5 % of a Party\u2019s assigned amount. Removal units\r\n(RMUs), temporary CERs (tCERs), long-term CERs (lCERs) and ERUs converted from\r\nRMUs cannot be carried over. Decision 1/CMP.8 confirms the application of these\r\nrules after 2012 and adds the requirement that carried-over AAUs must be\r\ntransferred to that Party's previous period surplus reserve (PPSR).\nThe percentage limit on carry-over of CERs\r\nand ERUs is applied based on assigned amount, and CERs and ERUs valid for the\r\nfirst commitment period used for compliance in phase three of the EU ETS (2013-2020)\r\nare held in the Union Registry. For these reasons, it will be crucial that the\r\nlimit across the European Union and its Member States is applied in a way that\r\nallows such units to be carried over for subsequent retirement. Furthermore,\r\nthe EU ETS requires accounts to be opened and maintained not only by Parties,\r\nbut also by private entities. To the extent that the holdings in these accounts\r\ninclude CERs and ERUs, it will be important to establish consistent rules that\r\nenable an optimal implementation of carry-over rules. AAUs representing\r\nallowances banked between phase two and phase three of the EU ETS are also held\r\nin the Union Registry. The delegated acts will therefore also need to establish\r\nrules for the application of carry-over rules on AAUs to ensure that the\r\nimplementation of the Kyoto accounting system is aligned with that under the EU\r\nETS and the Effort Sharing Decision.\nThe establishment and maintenance of a\r\ncommitment period reserve (CPR) and a previous period surplus reserve (PPSR)\r\nfor each member of the joint fulfilment agreement;\nThe delegated acts envisaged in this\r\nproposal will also need to specify the operation of the commitment period reserve\r\n(CPR) in the national registries of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland. The international requirement to establish and maintain a CPR forms\r\npart of each Party\u2019s responsibility to manage and account for its assigned\r\namount. According to international decisions, the CPR equals the lower of\r\neither 90 % of a Party\u2019s initial assigned amount or 100 % of its most recently\r\nreviewed inventory, multiplied by 8. The CPR applies to each member of the\r\njoint fulfilment agreement individually. As the assigned amount of the Member\r\nStates and Iceland only covers non-ETS sectors and the assigned amount of the Union\r\ncovers the ETS sectors, the delegated acts envisaged in this proposal are\r\nrequired to determine a coherent approach for the accurate calculation, and\r\ntransparent reporting, of the respective commitment period reserves of the\r\nEuropean Union, its Member States and Iceland.\nDecision 1/CMP.8 requires each Party to\r\nestablish a previous period surplus reserve (PPSR) account in its national\r\nregistry and establishes associated rules for the PPSR as follows: units may be\r\ntransferred between PPSR accounts; each Party may retire the units in its own\r\nPPSR up to the level by which emissions during the second commitment period\r\nexceed the assigned amount; and a Party may acquire units up to 2 % of its\r\nassigned amount in the previous commitment period from another Party\u2019s PPSR. The\r\nEuropean Union, its Member States and Iceland are each responsible to establish\r\nand maintain a PPSR in accordance with internationally agreed rules and the\r\nterms of the joint fulfilment. It is necessary to define the scope of each PPSR\r\npursuant to the definition of the emission levels set out in Annex I to the\r\nproposed Council Decision. It is also necessary to establish common rules on\r\nthe opening balance,[14]\r\nand on the use and acquisition of units in the PPSRs of the European Union, its\r\n Member States and Iceland.\nShare of proceeds applied to AAUs and\r\nERUs\nDecision 1/CMP.8 subjects the first\r\ninternational transfer of AAUs and the issuance of ERUs to a 2 % share of\r\nproceeds levy. In so far as this levy applies to the issuance of ERUs, this will\r\nfall under the responsibility of each Member State and Iceland. Nonetheless, to the extent that AAU balances must be maintained to ensure that a\r\nvalid Kyoto unit can be retired for each unit used for compliance with the Effort\r\nSharing Decision, the delegated acts envisaged in this proposal are required to\r\nensure that the accounting for the application of the share of proceeds levy is\r\naligned with the requirements of European Union legislation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal aspects of this proposal\nThis proposal amends the legal basis,\r\ncontained in the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation, which enables the Commission\r\nto adopt non-legislative acts establishing rules on non-essential elements for\r\nthe accounting of Kyoto units after 2012 in EU law. The essential elements as\r\nregards the commitments of the European Union, its Member States and Iceland, their implementation and joint fulfilment are laid down in a number of legal\r\ninstruments, including the separate proposal for a Council Decision. They will\r\nalso be addressed in the bilateral agreement with Iceland and are included in the\r\nDoha Amendment and accompanying decisions of the Conference of the Parties\r\nserving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the\r\nMonitoring Mechanism Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted\r\nthereunder.\nPreviously, under former Registry\r\nRegulations, such rules were adopted under the procedure of a regulatory committee\r\nwith scrutiny. They were based on a legal basis contained in the Monitoring\r\nMechanism Decision. The legal basis which enabled the implementation of\r\ntechnical issues related to the management of units in the first commitment\r\nperiod of the Kyoto Protocol through adoption of the Registry Regulations was\r\ncontained in Articles 3(3) and 6(1), of the Monitoring Mechanism Decision. It\r\nreferred, inter alia, to the need to adopt implementing comitology provisions\r\nas regards reports on the information from the national registry, on the issue,\r\nacquisition, holding, transfer, cancellation, withdrawal and carry-over of assigned\r\namount units, removal units, emission reduction units and certified emission\r\nreductions during the previous year. It also provided for the adoption of\r\ncomitology measures as regards the requirement of the Community and its Member States,\r\nto \u2018establish and maintain registries in order to ensure the accurate\r\naccounting of the issue, holding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation and\r\nwithdrawal of assigned amount units, removal units, emission reduction units\r\nand certified emission reductions and the carryover of assigned amount units,\r\nemission reduction units and certified emission reductions\u2019.\nThe Monitoring Mechanism Decision was\r\nrepealed and replaced by the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation, which entered\r\ninto force on 8 July 2013. The Monitoring Mechanism Regulation refers to the\r\nregistry system which enables the technical implementation of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol with regard to the unit management in national registries in its\r\nArticle 10 (\u2018Establishment and operation of registries\u2019). It contains the essential\r\nelement of the international requirement for the Union and its Member States\r\n\u2018to set up and maintain registries to accurately account for the issue,\r\nholding, transfer, acquisition, cancellation, retirement, carry-over,\r\nreplacement or change of expiry date, as relevant, of AAUs, RMUs, ERUs, CERs,\r\ntCERs and lCERs. Article 10 (4) also contains a legal basis for the adoption of\r\na delegated act which implements the non-essential elements of the technical\r\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol with regard to the unit management in\r\nnational registries, replacing the former Article 6 (1) of the Monitoring\r\nMechanism Decision. However, while Article 6 (1) of the Monitoring Mechanism\r\nDecision applied to all unit management issues in \u2018the registries of the\r\nCommunity and its Member States\u2019, the scope of application of this provision\r\nhas been narrowed in the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation. The legal basis for\r\nthe adoption of delegated acts now only applies to the \u2018set up\u2019 (rather than\r\nthe establishment and maintenance) of the \u2018Union Registry\u2019 (rather than\r\nthe registries of the Union and Member States). \nIn order to\r\nestablish an effective registries system that implements the new requirements\r\nfor unit management in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, it\r\nis therefore necessary to amend Article 10 of the Monitoring Mechanism. Its\r\nscope of application must be widened to include all technical implementation\r\nissues with regard to the unit management in national registries as required by\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, the Doha Amendment and decisions adopted thereunder for the\r\nsecond commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\nBased on the content of the rules that need\r\nto be adopted in the legal acts provided for in this proposal according to the\r\nabove, these legal acts must also be adopted as delegated acts pursuant to\r\nArticle 290 TFEU, in the same way as already provided for in Article 10 (4), of\r\nthe Monitoring Mechanism Regulation.\nA delegated act supplements the essential\r\nrules by specifying its substance and regulating further detail. It is\r\ndifferent from an implementing act pursuant to Article 291 TFEU which provides\r\nfor uniform conditions in the implementation of Union legislation by the Member\r\nStates. As shown above, the accounting requirements to be implemented after 2012\r\ndo not solely stem from EU legislation, but are to a large extent based on\r\ninternationally agreed rules. Also, they are not implemented by the Member\r\nStates alone, but they apply equally to the European Union itself, placing an\r\nobligation on EU institutions. As provided for by Article 290 TFEU, the\r\ndelegated acts envisaged in this proposal would not harmonise the\r\nimplementation of any existing essential rules, but rather set out further\r\nspecific technical details for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol after\r\n2012.\n2013/0377 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 as\r\nregards the technical implementation of the Kyoto Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192 (1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[15],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[16],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council adopted\r\nDecision [\u2026] on the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint\r\nfulfilment of commitments thereunder.[17]\r\nThe Decision concludes the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u2018UNFCCC\u2019), establishing a\r\nsecond commitment period, on behalf of the Union, and sets out the terms of the\r\njoint fulfilment of the commitments of the Union, its Member States and Iceland\r\nin accordance with Article 4 of the Kyoto Protocol.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conclusion of the Doha\r\nAmendment, the implementation of accompanying decisions of the Conference of\r\nthe Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the\r\nterms of the joint fulfilment in the Union, its Member States and Iceland\r\nrequire the establishment of rules to ensure the technical implementation of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol in the Union after 2012, to enable the effective operation\r\nof the joint fulfilment of the commitments of the Union, its Member States and\r\nIceland, and to ensure its alignment with the operation of the Union\u2019s Emissions\r\nTrading System (\u2018EU ETS\u2019) established by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[18]\r\nand Decision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.[19]\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the first\r\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the internationally agreed\r\nrequirements for the accounting and management of emissions and units and the\r\njoint fulfilment by the Union and its Member States were implemented under\r\nDecision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[20] and the so-called Registry\r\nRegulations[21].\r\nThe former Registry Regulations were replaced by Commission Regulation (EU) No\r\n389/2013[22],\r\nwhich now contains provisions for unit management related to the implementation\r\nand operation of the EU ETS and Decision 406/2009/EC.[23] The newly adopted Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council[24] no longer contains the required legal basis for the adoption of\r\ndelegated legislation to implement the rules for the second commitment period.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the second commitment\r\nperiod, the assigned amount of the Union relates to the emissions of greenhouse\r\ngases from sources covered by the EU ETS, to the extent that these are covered\r\nby the Kyoto Protocol, while the respective assigned amounts of Member States\r\nand Iceland relate to all other emissions of greenhouse gases from sources and\r\nremovals from sinks covered by the Kyoto Protocol. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 1/CMP.8[25] amends the rules for the\r\nestablishment of eligibility to participate in the flexible mechanisms under\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. It also defines limits related to units carried-over from\r\nthe first to the second commitment period, including the requirement for each\r\nParty to establish a previous period surplus reserve (PPSR).
