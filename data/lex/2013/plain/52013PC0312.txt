Copernicus or rather its predecessor was established as an EU\nprogramme by the GMES Regulation (EU) No 911/2010. It covers all the activities\nfor ensuring an uninterrupted provision of accurate and reliable data and\ninformation on environmental issues and security matters to users in charge of\npolicy making, implementation and monitoring, in the EU and its Member States.\nCopernicus aims at providing Europe with a continuous, independent and reliable\naccess to observation data and information. The EU investment aims at filling\nthe observation gaps, providing access to existing assets and developing\noperational services.\nCopernicus is structured in six Services:\nMarine, Atmosphere, Land and Climate change monitoring as well as support to\nEmergency and Security. Copernicus uses data from satellites and in-situ\nsensors such as buoys, balloons or air sensors to provide timely and reliable added-value\ninformation and forecasting to support for example, agriculture and fisheries,\nland use and urban planning, the fight against forest fires, disaster response,\nmaritime transport or air pollution monitoring.\nCopernicus also contributes to economic\nstability and growth by boosting commercial applications (the so-called\ndownstream services) in many different sectors through a full and open access\nto Copernicus observation data and information products. It is one of the\nprogrammes to be delivered under the Europe 2020 strategy for smart,\nsustainable and inclusive growth and it was included in the industrial policy\ninitiative of Europe 2020, given its benefits to a wide range of Union\npolicies.\nResponsibility for funding the exploitation\nand the renewal of space infrastructure developed with EU and intergovernmental\nfunds cannot be optimally achieved by individual Member States because of the\ncosts incurred. In the field of space-based observation for operational\nmeteorology, European States have pooled their resources to develop and exploit\nmeteorological satellites in the framework of the European Organisation for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). European States also\ndeveloped demonstrators of environmental satellites either through the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) or through national space agencies. They could not, however,\nfind a way to co-operate with regard to the funding of sustained operational\nprogrammes in the field of environmental monitoring. The need for continuing\nsuch observations is becoming critical, considering the increasing political\npressure on public authorities to take informed decisions in the field of\nenvironment, security and climate change and the need to respect international\nagreements.\nFor the services with a pan-European and a\nglobal coverage, Member States cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of\nthe proposed action, as the inputs from different Member States have to be\naggregated at European level. The provision of other services (e.g. emergency\nmaps or thematic land monitoring maps of a more limited geographical scope) can\nbe better achieved at EU level for two reasons. First, a more coherent and\ncentralised management of input data, from space based or in-situ sensors will\nallow for economies of scale.\nSecondly, a coordinated provision of Earth\nmonitoring services at Member State level helps to avoid duplications and\nenhances the monitoring of the implementation of EU environmental legislation\non the basis of transparent and objective criteria. Only comparable information\nproduced at Member State level will make it possible to ascertain an effective\nimplementation of environmental legislation which in many cases addresses truly\nborderless and therefore international problems.\nMoreover, action at European level will\ncreate economies of scale leading to a better value for public money. Action at\nEU level thus leads to a clear added value.\nSince the beginning the overall funding\nallocated to its development by the EU and ESA has reached over \u20ac3.2 billion. A\nlarge part of the GMES budget was dedicated to the development of observation\nsatellites: the Sentinels. This was done through a contribution from the\nCommission of \u20ac 738 Mio to the ESA\u2019s GMES Space Component programme (GSC).\nUntil the end of 2013, Copernicus is funded\nby the FP7 Space theme and the GMES and its Initial Operations programme. As\nCopernicus will be ready to enter in its operational phase, a new Regulation is\nrequired from 2014 onwards. In line with the objectives of the Communication \u201cA\nSimplification Agenda for the MFF 2014-2020\u201d[1],\nthis new Regulation will better define the governance of the programme, in\nparticular the role of the Commission, the objectives of the programme and indicators\nwhich will allow an effective monitoring of its implementation and ensure a\nsmooth transition from the current activities. The proposed Regulation includes\nas well provisions for the establishment of proportionate financial procedures\nin particular for the large part of the programme to be implemented indirectly.\nIn the context of simplification and \u201csmart regulation\u201d, it should be noted\nthat Copernicus aims at enhancing the quality of legislation by providing\nevidence-based monitoring tools.\nIn its Communication entitled \u201cA Budget for\nEurope 2020\u201d, (COM (2011) 500 final of 29.06.2011) the Commission indicated\nthat given the limits of the EU budget, it was proposed to fund GMES outside\nthe multi-annual financial framework in the period from 2014 to 2020. This\nproposal was rejected by the Parliament in its resolution P7_TA(2012)0062 of 16\nFebruary 2012. The European Council conclusions of 7-8 February 2013 on the\nMulti-annual Financial Framework (MFF) foresee that the programme should be\nfinanced under sub-heading 1a of the financial framework, with a maximum level\nof commitments of EUR 3,786 million (2011 prices) to be laid down in the MFF\nRegulation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nSince the creation of the European\nCommission's GMES Bureau in 2006 a rolling process of stakeholders'\nconsultation has been in place on GMES. This consultation process, launched\nwith the Communication entitled \u201cGMES: from concept to reality\u201d[2], led firstly to the adoption of\nthe 2008 Communication entitled \"GMES: we care for a safer Planet\"[3]. Further consultation was\ncarried out in order to prepare the Commission proposal for a Regulation on the\nEuropean Earth monitoring programme (GMES) and its initial operations\n(2011-2013)[4]\nand the Communication entitled \"Global Monitoring for Environment and\nSecurity (GMES): Challenges and Next Steps for the Space Component\"[5]. \nSince the entry into force of the GMES\nRegulation in 2010, the consultation of Member States and users has continued\nthrough the new governance bodies set up by the Regulation itself: the GMES\nCommittee and the User Forum composed of public user representatives.\nThe consultation has confirmed the interest\nand need for the Copernicus Programme and \u2013 now that it is indeed becoming an\nEU programme \u2013 it now focuses on different design options, in particular for\nthe Copernicus Services. Stakeholders have indicated that the uninterrupted and\nguaranteed availability of the information coming from the Copernicus Services\nis the cornerstone for the success of the programme and for its benefits to\nfully materialise.\nAn impact assessment was made in 2011 and\nthe main conclusions were published in Document SEC (2011) 867 final of\n28.06.2011, which accompanied the Commission's proposal on the Multiannual\nFinancial Framework, COM (2011) 500. The impact assessment has now been adapted\nand the recommendations of the Impact Assessment Board have been taken into\naccount. What has changed since 2011 is the political consideration of the usefulness\nof funding the Copernicus programme in the MFF. The Commission therefore\nconsiders that it is now time to make a formal proposal.\nIt should be noted, however, that this\nproposal had to be readjusted to the amount agreed under the ceiling of\nMultiannual Financial Framework, which cut the initial proposal of the\nCommission by over 2 billion EUR. In order to preserve the service delivery,\nthe Commission had to cut new developments in the space component to renew and\nmodernise the observation capacity. ESA will take over responsibility for the\ndevelopment of the next generation of the Sentinels.\nThe question of ownership of the Copernicus\nspace component assets is important and cannot be considered in isolation from\nthe rights and responsibilities that such ownership confers upon the owner. The\nowner has the fullest possible rights including the right of use, transfer and\ndisposal. \nIn determining whether to accept ownership\nof the space component assets, two phases need to be distinguished: During the\nfirst phase, i.e. the present Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the EU was only\na contributor to an ESA programme at a rate of some 30% and was lacking the\nfunds to assume a leading role in shaping the space component of Copernicus.\nMoreover, the EU funds were largely FP7 appropriations and were not designed to\nfund an operational programme on a permanent basis. The EU was therefore unable\nto assume ownership during this phase. The second phase will begin with the\nnext Multi-Annual Financial Framework. It brings about a fundamental change in\nthat the EU will now be able to fund 100% of most parts of the Copernicus space\ncomponent, including the ground segment and the cost of operations of the\nsatellites. \nIn this new context, as referred to in\nArticle 19, the ownership of the satellites will need to be reviewed. The\nRegulation foresees the option that the EU or a specifically designated body or\nfund could take over the ownership from ESA. In view of an ownership transfer,\noptions will need to be assessed, taking account relevant factors including the\noperation of the satellites; legal ownership of the data; data access\nconditions; and the value of the assets. These options will only be considered\nif disadvantages of EU ownership seem to outweigh its advantages. The transfer\nof ownership from the EU could only be exercised by means of a delegated act. \nThe option of a data purchase scheme could\nalso be considered.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nHaving regard to Article 189 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union, the proposal is for a new Regulation\nof the European Parliament and the Council establishing the Copernicus\nProgramme. It focuses on the following main aspects\n(1)                   \nChange of name into Copernicus;\n(2)                   \nGovernance of GMES in its operational phase, with\na view to allowing the Commission to delegate activities to a number of\noperators;\n(3)                   \nFunding over 2014-2020.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe financial statement accompanying this\nproposal for a Regulation sets out indicative budget appropriations, which are\ncompatible with the multiannual financial framework 2014 \u2013 2020, with a maximum\nlevel of commitments of EUR 3,786 million, in 2011 prices, equivalent to EUR\n4,291 million in current prices.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe Commission may adopt delegated acts in order\nto achieve certain objectives set out in the proposal.\n2013/0164 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing the Copernicus Programme and\nrepealing Regulation (EU) No 911/2010\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 189(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[6],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[7],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Global Monitoring for\nEnvironment and Security (GMES) was an Earth monitoring initiative led by the\nUnion and carried out in partnership with the Member States and the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) The origin of GMES date back to May 1998, when institutions\ninvolved in the development of space activities in Europe made a joint\ndeclaration known as the \"Baveno Manifesto\". The Manifesto called for\na long-term commitment to the development of space-based environmental\nmonitoring services, making use of, and further developing, European skills,\nand technologies. In 2005, the Union made the strategic choice of developing an\nindependent European Earth observation capacity to deliver services in the\nenvironmental and security fields[8],\nwhich resulted ultimately in Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the European Earth\nmonitoring programme (GMES) and its initial operations (2011 to 2013)[9].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copernicus should be\nconsidered as a European contribution to building the Global Earth Observation\nSystem of Systems (GEOSS) developed within the framework of the Group on Earth\nObservations (GEO).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the results of\nthat initiative, Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 established the European Earth monitoring\nprogramme (GMES) and the rules for the implementation of its initial operations.\n\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the programme set up\nunder Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 should continue under the new multiannual\nfinancial framework, the acronym 'GMES' should be changed to 'Copernicus' in\norder to facilitate the communication with the public at large. The Commission\nhas registered the trademark so that it can be used by the Union institutions\nand licensed to other interested users, in particular the providers of core\nservices.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objectives of the\nCopernicus programme are to provide accurate and reliable information in the\nfield of the environment and security, tailored to the needs of users and\nsupporting other Union\u2019s policies, in particular relating to the internal\nmarket, transport, environment, energy, civil protection, cooperation with\nthird countries and humanitarian aid. It builds on capabilities existing in\nEurope, complemented by new assets developed in common.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Copernicus programme\nshould be implemented consistently with other relevant Union instruments and\naction, in particular with environmental and climate change actions, and\ninstruments in the field of security, protection of personal data, competitiveness\nand innovation, cohesion, research, transport, competition and international\ncooperation, with the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\nprogramme. Copernicus data should maintain coherence with Member States\u2019\nspatial reference data and support the development of the infrastructure for\nspatial information in the Union established by Directive 2007/2/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an\nInfrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE)[10]. Copernicus should also complement\nthe Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) and Union activities in the\nfield of emergency response.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copernicus is a programme\nto be delivered under the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and\ninclusive growth. It is to benefit a wide range of Union policies and contribute\nto reaching the objectives of Europe 2020, in particular by developing an\neffective space policy to provide the tools to address some of the key global\nchallenges and meet the targets on climate change and energy sustainability. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Copernicus programme\nstands to benefit from the results provided by Horizon 2020, the Union's\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014\u20112020, in particular\nthrough its activities in research and innovation for future Earth Observation\ntechnologies and applications using remote sensing, airborne and in-situ\ntechnologies and data to respond to the grand societal challenges.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to attain its\nobjectives, the Copernicus programme should rely on an autonomous Union\u2019s capacity\nfor space\u2011borne observations and provide operational services in the\nfield of environment, civil protection and security. It should also make use of\nthe available in\u2011situ data provided, namely, by the Member States. The provision\nof operational services depends on the well\u2011functioning and safety of the\nCopernicus space component. The increasing risk of collision with other\nsatellites and space debris is the most serious threat to the Copernicus space\ncomponent. Therefore, the Copernicus programme should support actions aimed at\nreducing such risks, in particular by contributing to the programme established\nby Decision [XXX] of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a\nSpace Surveillance and Tracking Support Programme[11].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The maximum financial\nenvelope needed for the Copernicus actions (2014-2020) is EUR 3 786 million in\n2011 prices, allotted in a separate budget chapter under Title 2 of Heading 1a of\nthe Union's General Budget. Staff and administrative expenditures incurred by\nthe Commission in the coordination of the Copernicus programme should be funded\nfrom the budget of the Union.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to improving\nthe implementation of Copernicus and its long-term planning, the Commission\nshould adopt the annual work programme in line with the priorities, objectives\nand strategies of a multi-annual plan, \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copernicus should be user\ndriven, thus requiring the continuous, effective involvement of users,\nparticularly regarding the definition and validation of service requirements. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The international dimension\nof Copernicus is of particular relevance in the exchange of data and\ninformation, as well as in access to observation infra-structure. Such an\nexchange system is more cost-efficient than data-buy schemes and strengthens\nthe global dimension of the programme.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EEA Agreement and the\nFramework Agreements with candidate and potential candidate countries provide\nfor participation by those countries in Union programmes. Participation by\nother third countries and international organisations should be made possible\nby the conclusion of international agreements to that effect.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States, third\ncountries and international organisations should be free to contribute to the\nprogrammes on the basis of appropriate agreements.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should have the\noverall responsibility for the Copernicus programme. It should define its\npriorities and objectives and ensure the overall coordination and supervision\nof the programme.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\npartnership dimension of Copernicus and in order to avoid duplication of\ntechnical expertise, the implementation of the programme should be delegated to\nentities with the appropriate technical and professional capacity. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the implementation of\nthe Copernicus programme, the Commission may rely, where appropriate, on\ncompetent Union agencies, such as the European Environment Agency (EEA), the\nEuropean Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External\nBorders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX), the European\nMaritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC) or\nany relevant body potentially eligible for a delegation according to Article 58\nof Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the annual\nbudget of the Union[12].\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 61(2)\nof Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the selection of entities (the\n\u201coperators\u201d) to whom the Commission may entrust implementation tasks, should\nfollow a transparent procedure based on justified on objective grounds and\nshall not give rise to a conflict of interests. Given the particular nature of\nthe tasks involved, an ad-hoc procedure based on a call for expression of interest\nwas chosen to identify the potential operators best suited to be entrusted with\nindirect management of the Copernicus programme.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The operators of the\nCopernicus programme should be subject to supervision by the Commission, whilst\nenjoying the necessary autonomy to implement the tasks they were entrusted\nwith. They should submit an annual work programme to the Commission with an\nannual implementation report.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important that, in\norder to meet its obligations under Article 317 TFEU, the Commission has the\nnecessary means at its disposal to supervise the acts of the entities to which\nit entrusts implementation tasks under the Copernicus programme. This includes\nnot just the powers already conferred to it by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\n966/2012, but also the possibility to give instructions to the operator and\nconduct inspections. In particular, in the case of urgency or of unforeseeable\nevents, and in every situation where the operator is unable to carry out those\ntasks, the Commission should be able to call back the delegation and act in\nlieu of the operator. The exercise of this faculty should be proportional to\nthe goals to be attained and therefore the delegation agreement should be\nsuspended for the time needed to perform the required acts.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve the\nobjective of Copernicus on a sustainable basis, it is necessary to coordinate\nthe activities of the various partners involved in Copernicus, and to develop,\nestablish and operate a service and observation capacity meeting the demands of\nusers. In this context, a committee should assist the Commission in ensuring\nthe coordination of contributions to Copernicus by the Union, the Member States\nand inter-governmental agencies, making the best use of existing capacities and\nidentifying gaps to be addressed at Union level. It should also assist the\nCommission in monitoring the coherent implementation of Copernicus.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The work of the operators\nto whom the Commission has delegated tasks should also be measured against\nperformance indicators. This would provide the European Parliament and the\nCouncil with an indication of the progress of the Copernicus operations and\nprogramme implementation.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The data and information\nproduced in the framework of the Copernicus programme should be made available\nto the users on a full, open and free-of-charge basis, in order to promote\ntheir use and sharing, and to strengthen Earth observation markets in Europe,\nin particular the downstream sector, thereby enabling growth and job creation.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wherever the access or use\nof Copernicus or third party data and information may endanger\nthe security of the Union and its Member States or threaten their external\nrelations, the Commission should restrict their availability or limit the\nlicences awarded.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question of ownership\nof the Copernicus space component assets is important and cannot be considered\nin isolation from the rights and responsibilities that such ownership confers\nupon the owner. In order to have the right of use, transfer and disposal, the\nUnion should become the owner. In the case of the Sentinel satellites,\nownership implies in particular the right to decide upon the data policy and to\nmanage its implementation, to choose the exploitation model and the operator of\nthe Sentinels, and to conclude international agreements with third countries\non, among other, sharing satellite data.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\nthe Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the\nexpenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of\nirregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used\nand, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance\nwith Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to increase the value\nof Copernicus to users, the Commission should be assisted by representatives of\nmid and end-users, experts from Member States including from relevant national\nagencies or by independent experts.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation as regards the adoption of\nthe annual work programme, the multi annual plan for the period 2014-2020 and\nthe measures to promote the convergence of Member States in the use of\nCopernicus data and information and their access to the technology and\ndevelopment in Earth Observation, implementing powers should be conferred on\nthe Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control\nby the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[13].\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as to inform Member\nStates and respect the impartiality in the decision-making, the advisory\nprocedure should be used for the adoption of measures to promote the\nconvergence of Member States in the use of Copernicus data and information and\ntheir access to the technology and development in Earth Observation. The\nexamination procedure should be used for the adoption of the annual work\nprogramme and the multi-annual plan for the period 2014-2020 given that that\nact relates to a programme with substantial implications.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take into\naccount possible security risks as well as bandwidth and other technical\nlimitations, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of the data requirements necessary for the operational services,\nthe conditions and procedures regarding access to, registration and use of\nCopernicus data and information, the conditions and procedures for the\ntransmission and use of satellite data transmitted to receiving stations not\npart of the Copernicus programme and for the archiving of Copernicus data and\ninformation, the specific technical criteria necessary to prevent he disruption\nof the Copernicus data and information system and the criteria for the restriction\nof dissemination of Copernicus data and information due to conflicting rights\nor security interests, as well as the criteria for the performance of the\nsecurity assessment. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry\nout appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert\nlevel.

It aims to create partnerships between research\nand business communities and can set benchmarks for transfer of research and\ndevelopment into business;\n\u2013                        \n\u00ab a high-employment economy \u00bb, Copernicus creates additional potential for new jobs by boosting\nadditional demand for highly-skilled workers;\n\u2013                        \n\u00ab economic, social and territorial\ncohesion \u00bb, i.e. need for new ground\ninfrastructure in particular in the EU-12; creating new business potential for\nSMEs in all EU Member States Copernicus will give an impetus to those countries\nlagging behind in land or emergency services and will therefore contribute to\nthe objective of an increased cohesion among the Member States. Copernicus\nservices are by definition pan-European and respond to European requirements.\n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objectives and\nABM/ABB activities concerned \nThe Copernicus programme comprises the\nfollowing specific objectives: \nSpecific objective No. 1: Copernicus\nServices\nThe Copernicus land monitoring service will\nfocus on a Periodic Land Cover mapping service on the European, regional and\nnational level, and dynamic Land monitoring activities.\nThe Copernicus marine environment monitoring\nservice will provide information on the state of physical oceans and marine\necosystems for the global ocean and the European regional areas. The\napplication areas of the Copernicus marine services include maritime safety,\nthe marine environment and coastal regions, marine resources as well as\nseasonal meteorological forecasting and climate monitoring.\nThe Copernicus atmosphere environmental\nservice will ensure the monitoring of air quality on a European scale and of\nthe chemical composition of the atmosphere on a global scale. It shall in\nparticular provide information for air quality monitoring systems at the local\nto national scales, and should contribute to the monitoring of atmospheric\nchemistry climate variables.\nThe Copernicus climate change monitoring\nservice will allow for the adaptation and mitigation of its effects. It should\nin particular contribute to the provision of ECVs (Essential Climate\nVariables), climate analyses and projections on a scale relevant to adaptation\nand mitigation and relevant service delivery. \nThe Copernicus emergency response service\nwill offer a combination of maps and/or various levels of pre-processed data\nproduced to support emergency response players at international, European,\nnational or regional levels in disasters such as storms, fires floods,\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, deliberate or man-made disasters or other\nhumanitarian disasters. The service can address all the crisis management\ncycle: prevention, preparedness, response or recovery activities.\nThe Copernicus security service will provide\ninformation in support of the challenges which Europe is facing in the security\nfield, notably border control, maritime surveillance and support for EU\nexternal actions.\nThe Copernicus in-situ component will ensure\nobservations through airborne, seaborne and ground-based installations for the\nservice areas. The access to reference data is necessary for operating the\nservices. While this is mainly a responsibility of the Member States, the\nprogramme may contribute to cross border harmonisation of in-situ data within\nthe EU and additional collection of in-situ data outside the EU. Activities\nwill be entrusted to entities responsible for the Services.\nHorizontal activities are included as well,\nsupporting the overall management of the funds allocated under this Regulation,\noverseeing the implementation of all the programme activities, in particular\nwith respect to the cost, schedule and performance, the establishment of\nappropriate instruments and structural measures necessary to identify, control,\nmitigate and monitor the risks associated with the programme; the relationships\nwith third countries and international organisations; reporting activities to\nMember States; the coordination with activities at national, Union and\ninternational levels, notably GEOSS; the coordination of voluntary contributions\nof Member States; ensuring the complementarity and consistency of the programme\nwith other relevant Union policies, instruments and actions; the establishment\nof user needs and the monitoring of their implementation.\nSpecific objective No. 2: Space observation\nThe Copernicus space component will ensure\nsustainable space\u2011borne observations for the Copernicus services.\nIt includes the operations of the dedicated\nspace infrastructure (i.e. the Sentinel satellites); access to third party\nmissions; distribution of data; technical assistance to the Commission for\nfederating service data requirements, identifying observation gaps,\ncontributing to the specification of new space missions.\nDevelopment activities include design and\nprocurement of new elements of the space infrastructure; provision of technical\nsupport to the Commission for the translation of service requirements into\nspecifications of new space missions with the support of space infrastructure\noperators; coordination of the development of space activities, including\ndevelopments aiming at modernising and complementing the Copernicus Space\nComponent.\n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected results and impact\nThe development of services for ensuring\nthe long term sustainability of the system and for covering new users' needs\nnot expressed so far is foreseen. The advantage is that Copernicus remains able\nin a sustainable way to consistently respond to users' needs, thereby\nincreasing users' up-take and downstream market development.\nEconomic impact: the development of new products and new services will stimulate\nproduct and process innovation and hence have a long term impact on the\nEuropean industry. The full continuity of Copernicus services would\nsignificantly improve the boost to the industry's competitiveness and the emergence\nof commercially viable businesses.\nEnvironmental impact: Availability of long term Copernicus Services supports the objective\nfor Europe to be a key player in climate change. It will insure as well a real\npartnership in GEOSS.\nSocial impact: new jobs would be created, not only in the satellite industry and\nin R&D, but also in businesses linked to the development of new techniques\nfor Earth observation and related industries and services. More important, the\nsustainable commitment will facilitate the development of the downstream\nservices where the impact in terms of employment would be significant. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\nimpact \nThe achievement of the objectives will be\nmeasured by the following indicators:\n(a)         \ndata and added-value information made available\nin accordance with the service-level delivery requirements;\n(b)         \nuse of data and information measured by the progression\nin number of users, by the volume of accessed data and added-value information,\nand by the widening of distribution across Member States;\n(c)         \nmarket penetration and competitiveness of the\nEuropean downstream operators.\nSpecific tools will be put in place for\nmeasuring regularly those parameters, in particular by including specific\nrequirements in the delegation agreements and/or contracts to be established\nwith operators. Ad hoc studies will be procured at several milestones of the\nprogramme to measure the degree of satisfaction of the (potential) users, as\nwell market penetration and the effect of Copernicus in the competitiveness of\nthe downstream sector.\nIn addition, it is expected that a large\npart of programme implementation will be delegated to third parties. Delegation\nagreements will include objectives and indicators to allow monitoring the\nperformance of the operators. Those indicators will serve as well for the\noverall monitoring of the programme. They include:\n\u2013                        \nthe establishment at operational level of the 6\nservices, all six services being in place operationally by 2017;\n\u2013                        \nthe delivery within budget and planning of\nservice information as established in the delegation agreements and/or\ncontracts with operators;\n\u2013                        \nthe number of users of services and their degree\nof satisfaction;\n\u2013                        \nthe development of the downstream sector using\nCopernicus data and information.\n\u2013                        \nthe launch and exploitation of the planned\nsatellites or instruments, including the timely delivery of observation data in\nthe adequate format to the identified users, according to the planning to be\nagreed in the Long Term Scenario document for the space component;\n\u2013                        \nthe definition and development within budget and\nplanning of new satellites and respective ground segment, as defined in the\nLong Term Scenario and in the delegation agreement to be established with ESA;\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term \nInsufficiently reliable information on\nthe state of the earth to public users \nIn the last thirty years, substantial\nR&D efforts in the field of Earth observation have been made by the EU, the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) and their respective Member States, with a view to\ndeveloping infrastructure and pre-operational Earth observation services.\nHowever, many of the existing Earth observation services in Europe are\ninsufficient due to infrastructural gaps and lack of guarantees on their\navailability in the long term. Data provided through the currently existing\nservices either do not cover all the parameters needed by policy makers[17] or are not provided on a\ncontinuous and sustainable basis, in particular because the lifetime of the\nservice or the underlying observation infrastructure is limited due to\nbudgetary and/or technical constraints. Failure to address this problem will\nhave major short and long term consequences. For example, in the short term, no\nmaps will be available for civil protection in the event of natural disasters\nand in the longer term, vital climate change data will not be available for\ndecision makers.\nDownstream investments at risk\nThe Copernicus programme based on the\nInitial Operation Regulation finances, during the period 2011 \u2013 2013, a set of\noperational activities. With the existing programme, covering the initial\noperations, a first step has been made towards an Earth observation system.\nHowever, it is still limited in time (i.e. 2011-2013).\nThis risk of disruption represents a major\nconcern for final users like public authorities, but also for downstream\nservice providers, as they are not likely to invest significantly in\nnon-mature, risky markets and will face additional difficulties in raising capital.\n\nInnovation potential at risk\nDisruption would also imply that R&D\ninvestments are not translated into innovation. Therefore the potential to\nunleash the innovation capacity linked to Copernicus, which is mainly a service\nrelated innovation, will not be exploited. This would be regrettable especially\ntaking into account that the EU innovation policy should be more targeted to\nthe services sector, as different studies show[18].\nImpact on employment\nFinally, satellite application systems are\nthe main source of income for the European space industry (3.1 billion euro),\nand are the main domain of exports (with 1.13 billion euro).[19] One of the two most\nsignificant segments in terms of income is Earth observation (e.g. Copernicus\nSentinels). Currently, Earth observation systems account for around 30 % of the\ntotal income for the European space industry. Besides this direct impact on\nindustry sales, Copernicus has a significant impact on the competitiveness and\nthe profitability of the European space manufacturing industry. Export and\ntrade vastly depend on the relative competitive position of the sector. For\nthese reasons, Copernicus impact on employment in the sector would be\nsignificant with an estimated 35,000 jobs over the period 2015-2030. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nThe legal basis for a European Earth\nobservation programme (Copernicus) is Article 189 of the TFEU, which allows the\nEU to develop its own space programme. Article 2 of the Regulation 911/2010 on\nthe European Earth Monitoring programme (GMES) and its initial operations\nalready lists activities included in the programme. Moreover, the delivery of\nCopernicus is a strategic objective of Europe 2020. \nResponsibility for funding the exploitation\nand the renewal of space infrastructure developed with EU and intergovernmental\nfunds cannot be optimally achieved by individual Member States because of the\ncosts incurred. In the field of space-based observation for operational\nmeteorology, European States have pooled their resources to develop and exploit\nmeteorological satellites in the framework of the European Organisation for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). European States also\ndeveloped demonstrators of environmental satellites either through ESA or\nthrough national space agencies. They could, not however, find a way to\nco-operate with regard to the funding of sustained operational programmes in\nthe field of environmental monitoring similar to those in meteorology. The need\nfor continuing such observations is becoming critical, considering the\nincreasing political pressure on public authorities to take informed decisions\nin the field of environment, security and climate change and the need to\nrespect international agreements.\nFor the services with a pan-European or\nglobal coverage, Member States cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of\nthe proposed action, as the inputs from different Member States have to be\naggregated at European level. The provision of other services (e.g. emergency\nmaps or thematic land monitoring maps of a more limited geographical scope) can\nbe better achieved at EU level for two reasons. First, a more coherent and\ncentralised management of input data, from space based or in situ sensors will\nallow for economies of scale. Secondly, an uncoordinated provision of Earth\nobservation services at Member State level would lead to duplications and would\nrender the monitoring of the implementation of EU environmental legislation on\nthe basis of transparent and objective criteria difficult or even impossible.\nIf information produced at Member State level is not comparable, it will not be\npossible for the Commission to ascertain whether environmental legislation has\nbeen implemented correctly in all Member States. Moreover, action at European\nlevel will create economies of scale leading to a better value for public\nmoney. Action at EU level thus leads to a clear added value.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThis proposal builds on the experience\nacquired during development of Copernicus as a research initiative over the\nlast twelve years and the initial operations phase in 2011-2013. This\nexperience proves that, while funding for research is still necessary to\ncontinue the development of Copernicus, it has become necessary to support delivery\nof Earth observation services and operations of satellites in order to reap the\nfull benefits of the investments made so far and to respond to the needs\nidentified above.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coherence and possible\nsynergy with other relevant instruments\nIn the operational phase Copernicus will be\nable to deliver information to policy makers, public authorities, businesses\nand European citizens. This means that Copernicus, as an EU autonomous source\nof information, aims to support all relevant Union policies, instruments and\nactions, where understanding the way our planet changes is paramount.\nExamples of Copernicus' contribution to\nother EU policies are the following:\n\u00b7                        \nInternational cooperation policies: extending\nCopernicus services to Africa represents a concrete contribution to EU\ndevelopment policies. Satellite Earth Observation, for instance, allows the\nmonitoring of crop conditions during the agriculture season and the development\nof a Food Security Early Warning System for at-risk regions worldwide. In addition\nsome applications of Copernicus could provide policy makers with information on\nnatural resources in Africa.\n\u00b7                        \nTransport policy: by optimising ship routing\nCopernicus Marine service can minimise fuel consumption and emissions. \n\u00b7                        \nEnvironmental policies: the Copernicus services\nprovide systematic or periodic information at various scales which are\nnecessary for monitoring on a continuous basis the state of the Marine,\nAtmosphere and Land environment. In this context environmental images collected\nthrough Copernicus could provide the basis to monitor the targets of the new\nEuropean biodiversity strategy, or as a tool to monitor the efficient use of\nresources such a wood, water, minerals, land, air (quality) and many others at\nEuropean and global scale.\n\u00b7                        \nHumanitarian aid: Copernicus services play also\nan important role in emergency response activities inside and outside EU,\nproviding up-to-date information which is crucial for decision makers,\noperation planners and field teams.\n\u00b7                        \nEnergy: Copernicus can provide Europe with a\nreliable source of information on solar energy and can contribute to the\nmonitoring of nuclear proliferation or decommissioning of nuclear sites.\n\u00b7                        \nRegional policy: at Pan-EU level the Copernicus\nLand Service provides harmonised land cover and land cover change products.\nThis information is essential for land use and urban policies purposes.\n\u00b7                        \nClimate change policy: there are several\nCopernicus services that touch upon climate-related issues such as forest\nmonitoring and land carbon information, monitoring sea and ice level, analysis\nof green-house gases and fluxes.\n\u00b7                        \nSecurity: Copernicus can contribute to border\nsurveillance and maritime surveillance. In this framework since 2008, DG ENTR\nand DG HOME have established a close cooperation. \n\u00b7                        \nAgriculture: Copernicus could contribute to the\nimprovement of the timely and accurate monitoring of agricultural land use and\nits changes at European, national and regional levels by providing common\nmethodologies and indicators covering various temporal, spatial and thematic\nscales. The common agriculture policy could use Copernicus in order to monitor\nthe \u2018set-aside\u2019 policy. \n\u00b7                        \nMarine related policies: Copernicus allows\nunderstanding the ocean, its dynamic and its impact on climate change.\nApplications in this domain include: Maritime Security, Oil Spill, Marine\nResources management, Climate Change, Seasonal Forecast, Coastal Activities,\nIce Survey and Water Quality.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 2014 to 2020\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management modes envisaged[20] \n\u00fe Direct management by the Commission \n\u00fe Indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[21]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00fe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International organisations\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments:\nCopernicus builds on capabilities existing\nin Europe, avoiding unnecessary duplication and, to the contrary, looking for\nsynergies among existing national or international capabilities. In addition,\nit is considered that the Commission has neither the internal workforce nor the\nexpertise to manage alone this highly complex operational system of systems.\nThis is why, in line with the objectives of simplification and of improving the\nperformance of EU spending programmes, it is proposed to implement large parts\nof the programme indirectly, in the meaning Article 58 of the Financial\nRegulation, delegating implementing powers to a number of relevant bodies, in\ntheir field of expertise. With delegation agreements, the Commission will\nremain responsible for the programme but will transfer implementation\nresponsibilities to a number of operators. The Commission, supported by the\ncommittee and independent experts, will focus on defining the high level\nprogrammatic decisions and on monitoring their implementation. Operators will\nbe requested to submit annual Work Programmes and Annual Activity Reports\ntogether with audit certificates.\nUntil 2013, the development of the Space\ncomponent was co-funded by the EU and ESA through a contribution of the FP7\nSpace theme and the GMES and its initial operations Regulation to the ESA\u2019s\nGMES Space Component programme. The Commission, on behalf of the EU,\ncontributed by one third to the overall budget of the GSC programme, i.e. circa\n780 million out of \u20ac 2.4 billion, To that aim, a delegation agreement was\nestablished in 2008 between the EU, represented by the Commission, and ESA.\nThis agreement was established under the framework agreement between the EU and\nESA. Recognising that ESA has a unique expertise and is the only agency for\nresearch and development activities of space related programmes at European\nlevel, it is proposed to continue entrusting it the development activities,\ni.e. design, construction and procurement of satellites and related ground\nsegment, of Copernicus. It is considered that ESA can continue co-funding the\ndevelopment activities, and in particular developments of a new generation of\nsatellites, to be opposed to the procurement of recurrent units replicating the\ndesign of the already developed units. \nIt is proposed as well to entrust the\noperations of the developed infrastructure to both ESA and EUMETSAT. ESA will\nbe responsible for the operations of Sentinels 1, 2 and of the processing of\nthe Land part of Sentinel 3. Having design and coordinated the design and\nprocurement of the ground segment, acknowledging its expertise acquired on the\noperations of many scientific missions, ESA is well placed to manage these\ntasks. EUMETSAT will be entrusted with the operations of satellites and\ninstruments particularly relevant for the atmosphere and marine communities,\nwhich are very close, often identical, to its own domain of competences. It\nshould be recalled that Sentinels 4 and 5 are instruments carried on EUMETSAT\nown satellites. In addition, reception, treatment and distribution of data will\nmostly be done using multi-mission capacities of EUMETSAT. Both organisations\nwill be responsible for the access and delivery of observations from\ncontributing missions, in their respective domains of expertise.\nOne of the key products of the Land service\nis a comprehensive and timely assessment of land cover and land cover change. Corine\nLand Cover (CLC) datasets have provided a time series of land cover and land\nuse information over the European continent since 1990. These allow for\nmonitoring changes to the earth\u2019s surface that result from the interaction of\nboth natural processes and human activities. Since 1994, Corine is implemented\nby the European Environment Agency. The EEA is an agency of the European Union\nwhich task is to provide sound, independent information on the environment to those\ninvolved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental\npolicy, and also the general public. EEA is also responsible for coordinating\nthe European environment information and observation network (Eionet) in which\nnational experts contribute to the collection and validation of environmental\ndata. During the GMES initial operations (2011-2013), the coordination of the\npan-European and local components of the Land service were entrusted to the EEA\nand implemented through centralized implementation, with procurement via\nframework and service contracts to service providers; and decentralized\nimplementation, using grant agreements to national agencies that are the EEA\u2019s\ndirect stakeholders. In addition, it should be noted that the Land service\nrelies strongly on in-situ measurements and geographical reference data. EEA is\nwell placed to arrange their furniture by national environmental and/or mapping\nagencies. This is why, acknowledging the obvious synergies possible between\nCopernicus and EEA\u2019s core responsibilities, and the unique position of the EEA,\nas coordinator of the Eionet, vis-\u00e0-vis Copernicus stakeholders that are the\nnational environmental agencies, it is proposed to continue delegating the\nimplementation of these two components of the Land service to the EEA.\nSince 2008, work has been on-going to\nestablish a European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) to reinforce the\ncontrol of the Schengen external border, especially the southern maritime and\neastern land borders. EUROSUR will provide Member States with a common technical\n(infrastructure) and operational framework (workflow) in order to increase the\nsituational awareness at their external borders and improve the reaction\ncapabilities of their national authorities surveying the EU borders. One of the\nobjectives agreed is to set up a common application of surveillance tools\n(satellites, UAVs, aerostats, etc), Frontex acting as a facilitator. Frontex is\nthe European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the\nExternal Borders of the Member States of the European Union. It promotes,\ncoordinates and develops European border management. For the strand on border\ncontrol of the Security service, the active cooperation of Frontex is\ninstrumental. Frontex was involved in all FP7 projects preparing the strand, as\nwell as other related projects of the FP7 Security theme. It can be noted that\nthe need for Frontex to rely on GMES/Copernicus for those activities is\nrecognised in the Commission\u2019 proposal for the EUROSUR Regulation[22]. It is thus proposed to\ndelegate the implementation of this strand to Frontex.\nAs for the Security strand on maritime\nsurveillance, it is proposed to delegate its implementation to EMSA, the\nEuropean Maritime Safety Agency. Indeed, EMSA\u2019s mandate includes some\nresponsibilities in maritime security and an obligation to assist the\nCommission in related activities. EMSA has a widely recognised expertise in the\nimplementation of CLEANSeaNET, a maritime safety operational programme relying\non Earth observations. It is also actively involved in several R&D projects\npreparing for the Copernicus Security service.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules \nA monitoring system will be put in place to\nensure the highest quality outputs and most efficient use of resources.\nMonitoring will run throughout the life of the programme.

Each risk will be allocated a\ndegree of probability and an impact rating. The risk register will also include\na list of measures intended to reduce the probability of a risk materialising.\nThe risks are classified as follows:\n\u00b7                        \nTechnological risks: e.g. satellite uses\nleading-edge technology which has yet to be validated and the specifications of\nwhich are constantly evolving.\n\u00b7                        \nIndustrial risks: establishing the\ninfrastructure involves many industrial players, in a number of countries,\nwhose work has to be coordinated effectively in order to arrive at systems\nwhich are reliable and fully integrated, particularly with regard to security.\n\u00b7                        \nMarket risk: what has to be avoided is a\ntechnical performance that is inferior to that promised having a negative\neffect among users, and the infrastructure not being used as a result.\n\u00b7                        \nTimetable risk: any delay in the implementation\nwould jeopardize the window of opportunity.\n\u00b7                        \nGovernance risk: governance of the programmes\nrequires various bodies to work together, and an appropriate degree of\nstability and organisation has to be guaranteed. Moreover, differences of\nopinion between the various parties involved have to be taken into account on\nseveral major issues. In this context the sharing of some risks, including\nfinancial and security-related risks, among those players who are best placed\nto cope with them, should be considered.\nMoreover, the budget of the Programme will\nbe implemented, for the most part, in indirect management, through delegation\nagreements, and, in a marginal part, in centralised mode, where the Commission\nwill make use of grants and public procurement. The risks are different for\neach of these different types of expenditure. Audits carried out by the\nEuropean Court of Auditors and by the Commission\u2019s own ex-post audits have\nidentified the following main risks which remain potentially valid for this\nProgramme:\nFor delegation agreements: The main risks\nidentified refer to eligibility of the operators (the entity with whom the\nCommission concludes a delegation agreement), contractual compliance\n(transposal of the Commission's requirements into the contractual\ndocumentation), process compliance (non-observance of processes prescribed by\nthe Commission) and performance (non-achievement of pre-defined\ntargets/objectives).\nThese risk types will be addressed taking\naccount of the following factors:\n\u00b7                        \nSignificant aspects of the management and\ncontrol process are carried out by the operators. \n\u00b7                        \nThe Commission has to rely to a significant\nextent on the operators' management control systems.\n\u00b7                        \nIt is important to ensure the appropriate level\nof controls along the implementation chain with clear responsibilities for all\nthe involved partners.\nFor grants: The complex cost eligibility\nrules and the relatively limited financial management expertise of certain\nbeneficiaries could result in a high risk of incorrectly declared costs (e.g.\noverheads and equipment costs). \nThe lack of a complete database with\ninformation about beneficiaries, projects and declared costs could make the\ndetection of risky beneficiaries and of possible duplicate charging of costs or\nother irregularities difficult and thus result in ineffective antifraud\nactivity. \nFor public procurement: Undetected errors\nor uncorrected imprecisions in tenders or tender specifications could lead to\nbad contract execution.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\n\nDifferent control methods are envisaged to\naddress the different risks identified above\n2.2.2.1.\u00a0 Delegation Agreements \nInformation on the internal control\nsystem set-up\nA management and control system based on\nthe following measures should be established:\n\u00b7                        \nex-ante assessment of the operator\n\u00b7                        \nrisk based monitoring, included on the basis of\nstandardised reporting,\n\u00b7                        \npreventive action through the design of\nappropriate eligibility, contractual compliance, process compliance and\nperformance requirements;\n\u00b7                        \ncontractual remedies allowing for corrective\naction in case of implementation error regarding eligibility, contractual\ncompliance, process compliance and performance requirements;\n\u00b7                        \nex-ante controls on payments from the DG to the\ntrust account of the operator;\n\u00b7                        \nalignment of interest measures;\n\u00b7                        \nparticipation in governance\n\u00b7                        \naudit access rights concerning operators,\naffiliated entitites and final beneficiaries;

\n\u00b7                        \nfinancial statements audited by external\nauditors;\n\u00b7                        \nstatements of assurance provided by operators on\nan annual basis.\nThe verification that processes are working\nas designed will be ensured through several information channels:\nmanagement's knowledge about the state of\nthe DG's internal control systems, gathered through the day-to-day work and\nexperiences;\nthe DG\u2019s formal supervision, follow-up and\nmonitoring arrangements;\n\u00b7                        \nthe results from the annual ICS review (\u2018full\ncompliance with baseline requirements\u2019);\n\u00b7                        \nthe results of the Risk Assessment exercise;\n\u00b7                        \nthe ex-ante and ex-post controls, including\nreports of exceptions and/or internal control weaknesses;\n\u00b7                        \nthe results from the DG\u2019s external financial\naudits;\n\u00b7                        \nthe audit and consultancy work performed by the\nDG's Internal Audit Capability;\nevaluations of the Programmes carried out\nby external evaluators.\nAuditing by the IAC, the IAS or the ECA\nwill provide further feedback on the adequacy of the control system.\nEstimation of the costs and benefits of\nthe controls implied by the control system\nControls envisaged have been considered in\na broad sense in line with the COSO model definition of internal control\ndefined as \"a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe achievement of objectives in effectiveness and efficiency of operations,\nreliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations\". The costs of controls are estimated on a comprehensive basis\ncovering any activities which are directly or indirectly related with the\nverification of the rights of operators and the regularity of the expenditure.\nWhere possible they are detailed along the various management stages, and in\nline with the description of the control system envisaged.\nAdjustments to take account of the expected\nchanges of the new proposal include data for the alignment of interest measures\nand further contractual remedies allowing for corrective action in case of\nimplementation error regarding requirements.\nAssessment of the expected level of risk\nof non-compliance with the applicable rules\nUnder the envisaged control system, the\nexpected level of risk of non-compliance (defined as the expected risk of error\nof legality and regularity occurring at the level of transactions) will be kept\nbelow 2% on a multi-annual basis, however with a lower cost due to risk\nfrequency and risk impact mitigation, stemming from the additional measures\nintroduced.\nThe error rate is expected to drop due to\nthe clarification of the applicable rules including SMART requirements, due to\nfurther reinforcement of contractual remedies and due to the increased\nalignment of interest.\nIt is envisaged that a minor part of this\nProgramme's budget might be implemented under centralised direct management\n(see below) through grants and public procurement.\n2.2.2.2.\u00a0 Grants \nInformation on the internal control\nsystem set-up\nThe current internal control framework is\nbuilt on the implementation of the Commission's Internal Control Standards,\nprocedures for selecting the best projects and translating them into legal\ninstruments, project and contract management throughout the project lifecycle,\nex-ante checks on claims, including receipt of audit certificates, ex-ante\ncertification of cost methodologies, ex post audits and corrections, and\nevaluation. \nThe documentation of calls for proposal\ncontains detailed guidance about eligibility rules and notably about the most\nfrequent errors in relation to staff costs. Beneficiaries are invited to\nprovide already when making a proposal sufficient details about the envisaged\ncosts allowing ex-ante verification and detection of possible errors or\nmisunderstandings and where necessary changes of the implementation or\nadaptation of the grant agreement. This will significantly increase the legal\ncertainty of beneficiaries and decrease the risk of error.\nEx-post controls will be carried out in\norder to determine the representative average error rate that will remain\ndespite of training, ex-ante checks and corrections. The\nex-post audit strategy for expenditure under the\nProgramme will be based on the financial audit of\ntransactions defined by Monetary Unit Sampling, complemented by a risk-based\nsample. The ex-post audit strategy regarding legality and regularity will be\ncomplemented by reinforced operational evaluation and the anti-fraud strategy.\nEstimation of the costs and benefits of\nthe controls implied by the control system\nA balance will have to be found between, on\nthe one hand, increasing the attractiveness of the Programme by reducing the\ncontrol burden for the beneficiaries (increased trust and risk taking using\nmore flat rates, lump sums and scales of unit) and, on the other hand, ensuring\nthat the rate of un-corrected errors stays as low as reasonably feasible.\nDG ENTR will establish a cost-effective\ninternal control system that will give reasonable assurance that the risk of\nerror, over the course of the multiannual expenditure period is, on a annual\nbasis,, is within the range of 2-5%; with the ultimate aim to achieve a\nresidual level of error as close as possible to 2% at the closure of the\nmultiannual programmes, once the financial impact of all audits, correction and\nrecovery measures have been taken into account. \nThe audit strategy shall aim at providing a\nfair and reliable representation of the risk of error and at effectively and\nefficiently examining indications of fraud. The ex-ante checks of proposals\nbefore signature of the grant agreement and clarification of eligibility rules should\nnot significantly increase the time to contract. The authorising officers by\ndelegation shall report annually about the costs and benefits of control and\nthe Commission shall report to the legislative authority in the framework of\nthe Mid-Term Review about the level of non compliance that could be achieved.\nAssessment of the expected level of risk\nof non-compliance with the applicable rules\nA. Current sources of error\nBased on results so\nfar, recurring errors have been identified in relation to the following:\n\u00b7                        \npersonnel costs:\ncharging average or budgeted costs (rather than actual costs), failure to keep\nadequate records of time spent on the programme, charging of ineligible items\n(SME owner-manager costs).\n\u00b7                        \nother direct costs: regular errors identified are subcontracting without prior\nauthorization, or without respecting the rules of value for money, etc.\n\u00b7                        \nindirect costs:\nin a number of cases the indirect costs are a flat rate percentage of direct\ncosts, and so the error in indirect costs is proportional to the error in\ndirect costs.\nB. Proposed simplification opportunities\nThe program will benefit from the\nsimplification measures included in the triennial review of the Financial\nRegulation. In this framework the Commission will use the possibility to adopt\nsimplification measures as for example scales of unit cost for SME owner\nmanagers or the use of standard rates for staff costs in line with the\nbeneficiaries usual account principles.\nC. Contribution of control changes to the\nreduction of the expected level of non\u00adcompliance\nThe starting point is the status quo, based\non FP7 grant audits carried out so far. Based on the\nassumptions that:\n\u00b7                        \nthe beneficiaries of grants under the future\nCopernicus programme are similar to those who participated in FP7, and that\n\u00b7                        \none third of the sources of errors are estimated\nto be those listed under point B above,\nthe simplification measures included in the\nFinancial Regulation are expected to lead to a reduction of the error rate.\nAnother reduction of errors is expected from the ex-ante clarification of the\neligibility rules.\nConclusion: taken all measures referred to\nabove together, the ultimate aim is to achieve a residual level of error as\nclose as possible to 2% by the end of the lifecycle.\nThis scenario is based on the assumption\nthat the measures of simplification are not subject to substantial\nmodifications in the decision making process.\n2.2.2.3.\u00a0 Public Procurement\nThe internal control framework built on the\nimplementation of the Commission's Internal Control Standards, public\nprocurement procedures for selecting the best proposals and for contract\nmanagement throughout the project / contract, and ex-ante checks on invoices\nand payments shall avoid residual errors being above 2%.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\nto prevent fraud and irregularities \nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention\nand protection measures.\nIn the framework of the Commission's\nAnti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS)[23] and with the assistance of OLAF through consultation and\nparticipation in the OLAF Fraud Prevention and Detection Network (FPDNet) DG\nENTR has developed its own draft Anti Fraud Strategy (AFS) covering measures\nfor the prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities both internally\nand towards beneficiaries and contractors. The AFS will be updated annually.\nIn particular for grants, the DG ENTR AFS\nAction Plan foresees the creation of a central register of all its\nbeneficiaries (coordinators, partners, subcontractors and other actors) and\nprojects (reports and cost declarations). This database, in combination with the\nplanned acquisition of powerful data analysis tools for the detection of fraud\nindicators or 'red flags' will significantly improve its control functions and\naudit capabilities.\nIn order to increase the knowledge and\ncapacity for performing preventive and effective controls, the DG ENTR AFS\nAction Plan foresees the offer of specific training courses and guidance\nmaterial. Furthermore, a control strategy for the evaluation of the financial\nand technical capacity of beneficiaries will be developed and implemented as\nwell as a risk-categorisation of beneficiaries based on fraud-indicators,\nregistration in IT tools and flagging for ex ante / ex post audits.\nIn addition, audit procedures and guidance\nfor risk-based ex post audits will be developed focussed on possible fraud\ncases and irregularities. This AFS will also be better aligned to the internal\ncontrol standards, in particular with the risk assessment exercise, and to the\nAFS of other DGs and sub-delegated entities.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT\nOF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of
