Under Article 153(2) of the TFEU, the Commission may\npropose directives which lay down minimum requirements for gradual\nimplementation, having regard to the conditions and technical rules obtaining\nin each of the Member States.\nOn the basis of\nthese legal provisions, an appropriate occupational safety and health framework\nhas been adopted with a view to protecting workers\u2019 health and safety from\nrisks due to exposure to chemicals at the workplace. Following the adoption of\nRegulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on\nclassification, labelling and packaging (CLP) of substances and mixtures[1], in order to implement, within\nthe European Union, the United Nations Globally Harmonised System of\nClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (hereinafter GHS)[2], certain aspects of this legal\nframework need to be adapted.\nDirectives 92/58/EEC[3], 92/85/EEC[4], 94/33/EC[5], 98/24/EC[6] and 2004/37/EC[7] contain references to EU\nchemical classification and labelling legislation. If these Directives are to\nremain effective, they need to be aligned to the new legislation in this area.\nThus, the aim of the present Directive is to update references and terminology\nof the five aforesaid Directives to bring them into line with the applicable EU\nchemical classification and labelling legislation. In doing so, no changes to\nthe scope or level of protection provided by these Directives are required.\nGeneral context\nThe GHS is a United Nations system for\nidentifying hazardous chemicals and informing users about the related hazards\nby means of standard symbols and phrases on packaging labels, and safety data\nsheets.\nFollowing successful negotiations on the\nCommission\u2019s proposal, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the CLP\nRegulation on 16 December 2008. This Regulation aligns the existing EU\nlegislation to the GHS and was published in the Official Journal on 31 December\n2008.\nThe CLP Regulation entered into force on 20\nJanuary 2009. The deadlines for classification in accordance with the new rules\nare 1 December 2010 for substances and 1 June 2015 for mixtures. The CLP\nRegulation will ultimately replace the current rules on classification,\nlabelling and packaging of substances (Directive 67/548/EEC) and preparations\n(Directive 1999/45/EC) after the transitional period provided for in its\nArticle 61.\nThe CLP Regulation is expected to\nfacilitate global trade and harmonised communication of information on hazards\nposed by chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It will complement the\n\u2018REACH Regulation\u2019[8].\nImplementation of the GHS in the European\nUnion via the CLP Regulation will require companies to classify, label and\npackage their substances and mixtures appropriately before placing them on the\nmarket after a transitional period during which the two systems, CLP Regulation\nand the combination of the substances and preparations directives, will apply\nside by side. The aim is to protect workers, consumers and the environment by\nmeans of labelling and indicating any potential hazardous effects of chemicals.\nThe safety data sheets provided by\nsuppliers of chemicals are a major source of information for employers and\nworkers. Transitional arrangements will also apply to the legislative\nrequirements governing safety data sheets which are now regulated in Article 31\nof the REACH Regulation.\nThe aforementioned five Directives need to\nbe amended in order to update the references to the EU chemical classification\nand labelling legislation described above, without any changes to the scope or\nlevel of protection provided by these Directives.\nConsistency with other European Union\npolicies and objectives\nThis proposal relates to the key action on\nquality of work and working conditions identified in the Flagship initiative \u2018An\nagenda for new skills and jobs[9]\u2019\nIt is consistent with the objectives of\nother policies of the European Union, in particular those aiming at improvement\nof the regulatory framework in order to develop a clear, understandable,\nup-to-date and user-friendly body of secondary EU legislation, in the interests\nof citizens and economic operators.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested parties and\nimpact assessment\nConsultation of interested parties\n- Consultation of the Advisory Committee on\nSafety and Health at Work (ACSHW), in accordance with the Council Decision of\n22 July 2003 setting up that Committee[10].\nThe Committee adopted its opinion on 1 December 2011.\n- Consultation of the social partners in accordance with Article 154(2) and (3) of\nthe TFEU. The first-stage consultation (Article 154(2)\nof the TFEU) took place between 9 December 2009 and 26 March 2010. The second-stage\nconsultation (Article 154(3) of the TFEU) took place between 17 January and 17\nMarch 2011.\nThe results can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7              \nFive out of six social partners which responded\nagree with the content of the envisaged regulatory initiative.\n\u00b7              \nThe majority of the respondents agree with the\napproach of a single amending Directive. One of the workers\u2019 representatives\nsuggested that the required amendments should be done separately and not by\nmeans of a single amending Directive, as two of the five Directives in question\nare currently under review for other reasons.\n\u00b7              \nAn approach that includes maintaining a formal\nlink to the EU chemical classification system (the CLP Regulation) is commonly\npreferred.\n\u00b7              \nThe social partners are in favour of additional\nnon-binding measures that can help employers and workers to understand\noccupational safety and health issues arising from the new requirements for\nchemical classification, labelling and packaging. Explanatory guidance, in\nparticular for SMEs, would be considered useful. The Commission, in cooperation\nwith the ACSHW, has prepared guidance material which will be published in the\nnear future.\n\u00b7              \nNone of the social partners wished to initiate a\ndialogue on the matter.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposed amendments to the five\naforesaid Directives maintain the current level of worker protection with no\nadditional requirements being introduced. Thus, the proposed changes do not\ncreate any significant impact that would require a formal impact assessment to\nbe carried out.\nA full impact assessment for the primary\npiece of legislation, the European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No\n1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and\nmixtures, was presented during 2007[11].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the proposal\nSummary of the proposed measures\nThe proposal amends the relevant articles\nand annexes of Directives 92/58/EEC, 92/85/EEC, 94/33/EC, 98/24/EC and\n2004/37/EC, in order to achieve the objectives mentioned under point 1 above.\nLegal basis\nArticle 153(2) of the TFEU.\nSubsidiarity\nprinciple\nThe subsidiarity principle applies in so\nfar as the proposal concerns a field \u2013 protection of the health and safety of\nworkers at work \u2013 which does not fall under the exclusive competence of the\nEuropean Union.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nachieved sufficiently by the Member States themselves, as the provisions of\nDirectives cannot be amended or repealed at national level.\nThe objectives of the proposal can be\nachieved only by Union action, entailing amendment of an act of EU law that is\ncurrently in force, which cannot be done by the Member States themselves.\nThe principle of subsidiarity is respected\nin as much as the proposal amends existing Union legislation.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle. The minimum EU action necessary to ensure the\ncontinued effectiveness of existing policy will be taken, without introducing\nany additional requirements.\nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Directive.\nNo other instrument would have been\nsuitable. The aim is to amend five EU Directives and the only way to do this is\nto adopt another Directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary implications\nThe proposal has no implications for the\nUnion budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional information\nSimplification\nThe proposal contributes to the\nsimplification of the legislative framework by introducing appropriate\nproportionality and flexibility.\nRepeal of existing legislation\nNot applicable. This proposal contains only\namendments to existing Directives.\nEuropean\nEconomic Area\nThis draft instrument is concerned with a\nsubject covered by the EEA Agreement and must therefore extend to the European\nEconomic Area.\nDetailed explanation of the proposal by\narticle\nArticles 1 to 5 introduce the required\nchanges to the relevant provisions of Directives 92/58/EEC, 92/85/EEC,\n94/33/EC, 98/24/EC and 2004/37/EC, in order to align them to the references to\nthe European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on\nclassification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures.\nRegarding the non-exhaustive list of agents\nmentioned in the Annex, Part I, Section 3 of Directive 94/33/EC, an exact\ncorrelation between the pre-existing and new chemical classification systems\ncannot be achieved. The proposal therefore presents an alignment that may\nresult in a limited number of additional substances coming within the scope of the\nAnnex. However, the proposed changes are designed to maintain the policy\nobjective of Article 7 of this Directive, which remains unchanged.\nArticles 6 and 7 concern the transposition,\nentry into force and application of the Directive.\nArticle 8 is a standard article reflecting\nthe legal nature of a Directive.\n2013/0062 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Directives 92/58/EEC,\n92/85/EEC, 94/33/EC, 98/24/EC and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council , in order to align them to Regulation (EC) No.\n1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[12],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[13],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 153 of the Treaty, the European Parliament and the Council\nmay adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for encouraging\nimprovements, especially in the working environment, to ensure a better level\nof protection of the health and safety of workers. Such directives must avoid\nimposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would\nhold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 31(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\nprovides that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect\nhis or her health, safety and dignity.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of\nsubstances and mixtures[14] established a new system for the classification\nand labelling of substances and mixtures within the Union, based on the\nGlobally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)\nat international level, within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\nstructure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directives 92/58/EEC of\n24 June 1992 on the minimum requirements for the provision of safety and/or\nhealth signs at work[15], 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage\nimprovements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers\nwho have recently given birth or are breastfeeding [16], 94/33/EC on the protection\nof young people at work[17], and 98/24/EC on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks\nrelated to chemical agents at work[18], and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers\nfrom the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work [19] contain references to the previous classification and labelling system.\nThey should therefore be amended in order to align them to the new system laid\ndown in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those amendments are necessary to ensure the continued effectiveness of\nthe above-mentioned Directives.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\nI point 2 and Section II point 1 of the Annex to Directive 94/33/EC contain references to repealed Directives 90/679/EEC of 26 November 1990\non the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological\nagents at work[20]\nand 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks\nrelated to exposure to carcinogens at work[21]. Those references should therefore be\nreplaced by references to the relevant provisions of Directive 2000/54/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the\nprotection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at\nwork[22]\nand Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\nApril 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to\ncarcinogens or mutagens at work[23].\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article 154 of the Treaty, the Commission consulted\nthe social partners on the possible direction of Union action in this field.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following this consultation, the Commission considered that Union action\nwas desirable and consulted the social partners on the content of the envisaged\nproposal, in accordance with Article 154 of the Treaty.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following this second phase of consultation, the social partners did not\nwish to initiate the process which could lead to the conclusion of an agreement,\nas set out in Article 154 of the Treaty,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1 \nAmendments to Directive 92/58/EEC\nDirective 92/58/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1)                   \nArticle 1(2) is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
