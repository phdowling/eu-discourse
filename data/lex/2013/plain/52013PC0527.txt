When those levies did not allow achieving the objective of\r\nself-financing of the sector each marketing year, the basic regulation provided\r\nfor an additional levy to be charged to producers. Article 15 of the basic\r\nregulation provided for the elements to be taken into consideration for the\r\ncalculation of the levies.\nIn its above mentioned judgements, the\r\nCourt did not put into question the production levy system and the principle by\r\nwhich the sugar producers had to bear the full financial responsibility for the\r\nlosses incurred in each marketing year by disposing of that part of production\r\nunder quota which is surplus to the Union's internal consumption and were accordingly\r\nliable to a levy on their production under quota, to be fixed by the Commission\r\nwith a view to covering the losses incurred during the marketing years from\r\n2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006.\nThe Court has ruled, however, that the Commission\r\nhas repeatedly erred in calculating the annual levies set for the period in\r\nquestion pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Lastly, it found\r\nthat the method used by the Commission in its Regulation (EC) No 1193/2009 to\r\nfix the levies was incorrect because it led to an over-estimation of the costs\r\nto be covered and to consequently over-charging sugar producers.\nAs a result of the invalidity of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1193/2009, the Court held that individuals are entitled to\r\nreimbursement of the excess sums unduly paid in respect of the invalid\r\nproduction levies collected by the Member States over the period in question as\r\nwell as to the payment of interest on such sums. \nThe judgement has left a legal void as to\r\nthe exact amount of the levies for the marketing years 2002/2003, 2003/2004,\r\n2004/2005, 2005/2006. Therefore, to comply with the judgement, the levies set\r\nfor these marketing years should be replaced by new ones, calculated according\r\nto the method validated by the Court, with retroactive effect. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission has presented to the Member\r\nStates various working documents relating to the determination of the corrected\r\nsugar levies and the follow-up to the Court's judgement of 27 September 2012.\r\nThose working documents were presented at the Management Committee for the\r\nCommon Organisation of Agricultural Markets on 6 December 2012, on 20 December\r\n2012, on 24 January 2013 and a consolidated version on 28 February 2013.\nA number of Member States (DE, BE, LV, IT,\r\nFR, NL, UK, CZ) called the Commission to prepare a legal act correcting the\r\nlevies, which should include the reimbursement by the Union budget of interest on\r\nreimbursements made or to be made to the sugar producers who paid excess levies\r\nin the relevant years, by the concerned Member States. Some delegations also\r\nsuggested that interest should be calculated at a uniform rate at the European\r\nlevel.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nPursuant to Article 266 TFEU 'The\r\ninstitution whose act has been declared void \u2026shall be required to take the\r\nnecessary measures to comply with the judgement of the Court of Justice of the\r\nEuropean Union.'. Therefore, following the annulment of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1193/2009, new levies for the period in question are to be fixed.\nSince, with effect from the marketing year\r\n2006/2007, Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 was repealed and replaced by Council\r\nRegulations (EC) No 318/2006, on the common organisation of the markets in the\r\nsugar sector, and further replaced by (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common\r\norganisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain\r\nagricultural products (Single CMO Regulation), Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1260/2001 can no longer serve as the legal basis for correcting the levies. The\r\nCommission is therefore not empowered to adopt the corrective legal act necessary\r\nto implement the judgement. \nPursuant to Article 43(3) TFEU 'The\r\nCouncil, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing \u2026\r\nlevies.'. In view of the nature of the proposed Regulation,\r\nArticle 43(3) appears to be the appropriate legal basis to fix the corrected\r\nsugar levies for the marketing years in questions.\nAlthough the Court did not invalidate\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1837/2002, fixing the production levies for the marketing\r\nyear 2001/2002, taking into consideration that the same method invalidated by\r\nthe Court has been used for setting the levies for the marketing year 2001/2002,\r\nthe levies set for that marketing year are to be considered incorrect as well.\r\nTherefore, new levies for that marketing year should be fixed and included in\r\nthe corrective legislative act.\nIn its above mentioned judgements, the\r\nCourt has clarified all the elements that have to be taken into consideration\r\nfor the calculation of the 'average loss', within the meaning of Article 15 of\r\nthe basic regulation, which has to be used for estimating the 'overall loss' to\r\nbe covered by the production levies. In particular, the 'average loss' is to be\r\ncalculated by dividing the actual total refunds paid (lower than that\r\ncalculated by the Commission in the annulled Regulation (EC) No 1193/2009) by\r\nthe total exported quantities, regardless whether they were exported with or\r\nwithout a refund. The 'exportable surplus' is also calculated by using all\r\nexports, whether a refund has been paid or not. The application of the new\r\nmethod indicated by the Court leads to a substantial decrease of the 'average\r\nloss' and the 'overall loss' to be covered by the levies for the period in\r\nquestion.\nTherefore, the proposed Regulation will\r\nestablish the sugar production levies for the marketing years 2001/2002, 2002/2003,\r\n2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006, re-calculated on the basis of the methodology\r\nclarified by the Court. This will allow Member States to calculate the\r\nreimbursement due to sugar producer in respect of the excess levies that they\r\nhave been charged over the same period.\nMoreover, the revision of the production\r\nlevies for the marketing years 2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006\r\nwill impact on the complement price that the sugar producers had to pay to beet\r\ngrowers in respect of the difference between the maximum amount of the A or B\r\nlevy and the amount of these levies charged for the marketing years 2002/2003,\r\n2003/2004 and 2005/2006.\nIndeed, according to the common\r\norganisation of the markets in the sugar sector in force until 2006, the levies\r\nwere paid by sugar manufacturers but the latter recovered 60% of these costs\r\nfrom beet growers, by paying a lower beet price. When the amounts of the levies\r\nwere set below the maximum level for the A or B levies (i.e. 2% and 37.5% of\r\nthe intervention price for white sugar respectively), Article 18(2) of the\r\nbasic regulation provided that sugar manufacturers have to pay beet sellers 60%\r\nof the difference between the maximum amount of the levy in question and the\r\namount of the base levy or the B levy actually charged. \nTherefore, this corrective legal act establishes\r\nthe revised complement prices that sugar producers should pay back to beet\r\nsellers. Only the difference between the old and the new complement prices\r\nshould be reimbursed to beet sellers.\nThe reimbursement of the sugar levies constitutes\r\na correction of the sugar levies originally paid in the EU own resources.\r\nMember States have to establish the new sugar levies entitlements based on the\r\nnew levies within four months following the entry into force of the current\r\nact.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS \nThe revision of the sugar production levies\r\nfor the marketing years 2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006\r\nwill result in a negative correction of EUR 295 541 212, to be charged to the\r\nown resources of the EU budget. Besides the said amount, Member States could\r\nclaim from the Commission the reimbursement of the interest effectively paid by\r\nthem, in accordance with their national law, in reimbursing the excess levies\r\ncollected for the relevant years. The latter expenditure shall be separately charged\r\nto the EU budget by the concerned Member States upon presentation of the corresponding\r\nproofs of payment.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe Commission will issue a declaration accompanying\r\nthe present proposal for a Council Regulation, in order to clarify certain\r\nelements related to the reimbursement of the principal and interest, the\r\nreimbursement to the beet sellers, the accounting procedure and monitoring of the\r\nreimbursement process.\n2013/0252 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\nfixing the production levies in the sugar\r\nsector for the marketing years 2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005,\r\n2005/2006, the coefficient required for calculating the additional levy for the\r\nmarketing years 2001/2002 and 2004/2005 and the amounts to be paid by sugar\r\nmanufacturers to beet sellers in respect of the difference between the maximum\r\namount of the levies and the amount of these levies to be charged for the\r\nmarketing years 2002/2003, 2003/2004 and 2005/2006\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the\r\nsugar sector[1],\r\nand in particular Article 15(8) first indent, Article 16(5), and Article 18(5)\r\nthereof, empowered the Commission to adopt detailed rules on the amounts of the\r\nlevies to be collected, the coefficient for the additional levy and the\r\nrepayment to beet sellers.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission established\r\nthe production levies for the marketing years 2001/2002[2], 2002/2003[3], 2003/2004[4], 2004/2005[5] and 2005/2006[6]. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 18(2) of Regulation\r\n(EC) No 1260/2001 provided that when basic production levy is lower than the\r\nmaximum amount referred to in Article 15(3) or when the B levy referred to in that\r\nArticle is lower than the maximum amount referred to in Article 14(4) of that\r\nRegulation, adjusted, where necessary, in accordance with paragraph 5 of that\r\nArticle, sugar manufacturers had to pay back beet sellers 60% of the difference\r\nbetween the maximum amount of the levy concerned and the amount of the levy to\r\nbe charged. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n9(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 314/2002 of 20 February 2002 laying down\r\ndetailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector[7], the amounts to be paid by\r\nsugar manufacturers to beet sellers in respect of the difference between the\r\nmaximum amount of the basic levy and the B levy and the amounts of that levies charged,\r\nwere set for the marketing years 2002/2003[8],\r\n2003/2004[9]\r\nand 2005/2006[10].\r\n\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the framework of the\r\nreform of the common market organisation for the sugar sector, Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of\r\nthe markets in the sugar sector[11]\r\nhas repealed and replaced Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as of the marketing year\r\n2006/2007. Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, subsequently repealed and incorporated\r\ninto Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007\r\nestablishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific\r\nprovisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)[12], has replaced the variable\r\nsugar production levy system of self-financing the production quota regime by a\r\nnew production charge aimed at contributing to the financing of the expenditure\r\noccurring in the sugar sector under the common market organisation for sugar.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 8 May 2008 the Court of\r\nJustice declared invalid[13]\r\nCommission Regulations (EC) No 1762/2003 of 7 October 2003\r\nfixing the production levies in the sugar sector for the 2002/2003 marketing\r\nyear[14]\r\nand (EC) No 1775/2004 of 14 October 2004 setting the production\r\nlevies in the sugar sector for the 2003/2004 marketing year[15]. In its judgment, the Court\r\nheld that all the quantities of sugar in exported products, regardless of\r\nwhether or not refunds have actually been paid, are to be taken into account\r\nfor the purpose of calculating the estimated average loss per tonne of product.\r\n\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court also declared\r\ninvalid[16]\r\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1686/2005 of 14 October 2005 setting the\r\nproduction levies and the coefficient for the additional levy in the sugar\r\nsector for the 2004/2005 marketing year[17].\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply with the\r\nCourt\u2019s rulings, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 1193/2009 correcting\r\nRegulations (EC) No 1762/2003, (EC) No 1775/2004, (EC) No 1686/2005, (EC) No\r\n164/2007 and fixing the production levies in the sugar sector for the marketing\r\nyears 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006[18].\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 September 2011 the\r\nGeneral Court delivered its judgment in case T-4/06, in which it stated that\r\nthere was no proper legal basis for a differentiated coefficient for the\r\nadditional levy in the sugar sector and annulled Article 2 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1686/2005 as replaced by Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No\r\n1193/2009. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 27 September 2012 the\r\nCourt declared invalid Regulation (EC) No 1193/2009, stating that\r\nArticle 15(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 was to be\r\ninterpreted as meaning that the total amount of refunds should have included\r\nthe total amounts paid, for the purpose of calculating the estimated average\r\nloss per tonne of product[19].\r\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the levies\r\nshould be fixed at the appropriate level. The 'average loss' within the\r\nmeaning of Article 15(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should be\r\ncalculated by dividing the refunds paid by the exported quantities, whether a\r\nrefund is paid or not, for exports defined in accordance with Article 6(5) of\r\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 314/2002 of 20 February 2002 laying down detailed\r\nrules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector[20]. The 'exportable surplus' within\r\nthe meaning of Article 15(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should\r\nalso be calculated by using all exports, whether a refund has been paid or not.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considering that the same\r\nmethod invalidated by the Court was used to calculate the levies for the\r\nmarketing year 2001/2002, the production levies and the coefficient for the\r\nadditional levy for the marketing year 2001/2002 should also be corrected\r\naccordingly. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the Court's\r\njudgement that the corrected levies should apply from the same dates as the levies\r\nwhich were declared invalid.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence of the\r\nfixing of the sugar levies according to the new method referred to in recital\r\n(11), the amounts payable by sugar manufacturers to beet sellers in respect of\r\nthe difference between the maximum amount of the base levy and the amount of\r\nthe levies chargeable for the marketing years 2002/2003, 2003/2004 and\r\n2005/2006 should also be newly set, with retrospective effect. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2001/2002 marketing\r\nyear, the uncovered overall loss recalculated following the method referred to\r\nin recital (11) amounts to EUR 14.123.937. The coefficient referred to in\r\nArticle 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should be set accordingly and be\r\napplicable for that marketing year. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2002/2003 marketing\r\nyear, the application of the method referred to in recital (11) results in 2%\r\nfor the basic levy and 16,371% for the B levy, which should be applicable for\r\nthat marketing year with retrospective effect. The recalculated overall loss is\r\ncovered in its entirety by the receipts from the basic production levy and the\r\nB levy. Therefore, there is no need to fix the additional coefficient referred\r\nto in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 for that marketing year.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2002/2003 marketing\r\nyear, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1440/2002 of 7 August 2002 revising the\r\nmaximum amount for the B production levy and amending the minimum price for B\r\nbeet in the sugar sector for the 2002/03 marketing year[21] set the maximum amount of the\r\nB levy at 37,5% of the intervention price for white sugar while the B levy\r\nrevised according to the method referred to in recital (11) applicable for that\r\nmarketing year is 16,371 % of the intervention price for white sugar. This\r\ndifference requires that the amount payable by sugar manufacturers to beet\r\nsellers should be fixed per tonne of beet of standard quality for that marketing\r\nyear, in accordance with Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2003/2004 marketing\r\nyear, the application of the new calculation method referred to in recital (11)\r\nresults in 2% for the basic levy and 17,259% for the B levy. The recalculated overall\r\nloss is covered in its entirety by the receipts from the basic production levy\r\nand the B levy. Therefore, there is no need to fix the additional coefficient\r\nreferred to in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, for that\r\nmarketing year.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2003/2004 marketing\r\nyear, Regulation (EC) No 1440/2002 set the maximum amount of the B levy at 37,5%\r\nof the intervention price for white sugar while the B levy revised according to\r\nthe method referred to in recital (11) applicable for that marketing year is\r\n17,259 % of the intervention price for white sugar. This difference requires that\r\nthe amount payable by sugar manufacturers to beet sellers should be fixed per\r\ntonne of beet of standard quality for that marketing year, in accordance with\r\nArticle 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2004/2005 marketing\r\nyear, the application of the method referred to in recital (11) does not change\r\nthe basic levy and the B levy. For that marketing year, the uncovered overall\r\nloss calculated following the new method amounts to EUR 57.648.788. The\r\ncoefficient referred to in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should\r\ntherefore be set. It follows from the Court's judgement referred to in recital (9)\r\nthat the coefficient should be uniform for the Member States of the Union as\r\nconstituted on 30 April 2004 and the Member States of the Union as constituted\r\non 1 May 2004. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2005/2006 marketing\r\nyear, the application of the method referred to in recital (11) results in an\r\namount of 1.2335% for the basic levy without the need for a B levy. The recalculated\r\noverall loss is covered in its entirety by the receipts from the basic\r\nproduction levy and there is no need to fix the additional coefficient referred\r\nto in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, for that marketing year.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the 2005/2006 marketing\r\nyear, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1296/2005 of 5 August 2005 revising the\r\nmaximum amount for the B production levy and amending the minimum price for B\r\nbeet in the sugar sector for the 2005/06 marketing year[22] set the maximum amount of the\r\nB levy at 37,5% of the intervention price for white sugar. While the basic levy,\r\nrevised in accordance with the method referred to in recital (11) applicable\r\nfor that marketing year, is 1,2335 % of the intervention price for white sugar,\r\nthere is no need for any B levy to be fixed. Due to these differences, it is necessary\r\nto fix the amounts per tonne of beet of standard quality payable by sugar\r\nmanufacturers to beet sellers for that marketing year, in accordance with\r\nArticle 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of legal\r\ncertainty and to ensure uniform treatment of the concerned operators in\r\ndifferent Member States, it is necessary to set a common date upon which the levies\r\nfixed by this Regulation should be established within the meaning of the second\r\nsubparagraph of Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000\r\nof 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/ (EC, Euratom) on the system of\r\nthe Communities' own resources[23],\r\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The production levies in\r\nthe sugar sector for the marketing years 2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004,\r\n2004/2005, 2005/2006 are set out in point (1) of the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The coefficients required\r\nfor calculating the additional levy for the marketing years 2001/2002 and\r\n2004/2005 are set out in point (2) of the Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts payable by\r\nsugar manufacturers to beet sellers in respect of the A or B levies for the marketing\r\nyears 2002/2003, 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 are set out in point (3) of the Annex.\nArticle 2\nThe date of establishment, referred to in\r\nthe second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000,\r\nof the levies fixed by this Regulation, shall be the last day of the fourth month\r\nfollowing the day of entry into force of this Regulation, at the latest. \nArticle 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\r\nEuropean Union.\nArticle 1(1) shall apply from:\n\u2013                        \r\n16 October 2002 for the marketing year 2001/2002,\r\n\n\u2013                        \r\n8 October 2003 for the marketing year 2002/2003,\r\n\n\u2013                        \r\n15 October 2003 for the marketing year\r\n2003/2004, \n\u2013                        \r\n18 October 2005 for the marketing year 2004/2005,\r\nand \n\u2013                        \r\n23 February 2007 for the marketing year\r\n2005/2006.\nArticle 1(2) shall apply from:\n\u2013                        \r\n16 October 2002 for the marketing year 2001/2002,\r\nand \n\u2013                        \r\n18 October 2005 for the marketing year\r\n2004/2005.\nArticle 1(3) shall apply from:\n\u2013                        \r\n8 October 2003 for the marketing year 2002/2003,\n\u2013                        \r\n15 October 2003 for the marketing year 2003/2004,\r\nand \n\u2013                        \r\n23 February 2007 for the marketing year\r\n2005/2006. \nThis\r\nRegulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all\r\nMember States.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\nANNEX \n(1) Production levies in the sugar sector referred\r\nto in Article 1(1)\n   || 2001/2002 || 2002/2003 || 2003/2004 || 2004/2005 || 2005/2006 \n (a) EUR per tonne of white sugar as the basic production levy on A sugar and B sugar || 12,638 || 12,638 || 12,638 || 12,638 || 7,794 \n (b) EUR per tonne of white sugar as the B levy on B sugar || 236,963 || 103,447 || 109,061 || 236,963 || -

The Court has ruled that the Commission has repeatedly erred in calculating the annual levies set for the period in question. The Court held that individuals are entitled to reimbursement of the excess sums unduly paid in respect to the invalid production levies collected by the Member States over the period in question and accrued to the Union budget. The corrective legal act retroactively establishes the sugar production levies for the marketing years from 2001/02 to 2005/06 re-calculated on the basis of the methodology clarified by the Court. Following the judgement, the reimbursement to operators has to include interest (based on the national rules and according to the principle of unjust enrichment the EU has to reimburse the Member States on the compensatory interests paid). The total amount to be reimbursed to Member States is the following: Own resources - principal 295,5 Mio \u20ac - 10,0 Mio \u20ac (already reimbursed in 2009) * 75% = 214,1 Mio \u20ac of levies after collection fees. Compensatory interest The compensatory interest claimed is not included in the amounts under own resources. The estimated amount given above is calculated for 100% of the difference between old and new levies. The interest rates will be determined by national law and so the final amount cannot be definitely determined at this point in time. The interest rates used as a basis for estimating the financial impact of 53.4 Mio \u20ac are those published in the following regulations: EU Regulation No 2012/2001; EU Regulation No 1852/2002; EU Regulation No 1842/2003; EU Regulation No 1751/2004; EU Regulation No 956/2005; EU Regulation No 1119/2005; EU Regulation No 1668/2005; EU Regulation No 1489/2006; EU Regulation No 981/2007; EU Regulation No 1190/2007; EU Regulation No 999/2008; EU Regulation No 1012/2009; EU Regulation No 974/2010; EU Regulation No 1036/2011; EU Regulation No 938/2012. The amount will be paid under the budget line 05 07 02. In case the Regulation is not adopted in time so that payments can take place in the 2013 budget year, an amount will have to be included in the amending letter for Budget 2014. \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1. \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 278, 16.10.2002, p. 13.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 254, 8.10.2003, p. 4.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 316, 15.10.2004, p. 64.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 271, 15.10.2005, p. 12.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 51, 20.2.2007, p. 17.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 50, 21.2.2002, p. 40.\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 254, 8.10.2003, p. 5.\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 316, 15.10.2004, p. 65.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 51, 20.2.2007, p. 16.\n[11]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 58, 20.2.2006, p. 1.\n[12]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n[13]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joined cases C-5/06 and C-23/06\r\nto C-36/06, ECR 2008, I-03231.\n[14]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See the reference in footnote 3.\n[15]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See the reference in footnote 4.\n[16]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Orders of 6 October 2008 in\r\njoined cases C-175/07 to C-184/07, ECR 2008, I-00142, as well as in cases C-466/06, ECR 2008,\r\nI-00140, and C-200/06, ECR 2008,\r\nI-00137.\n[17]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See the reference in footnote 5.\n[18]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 321, 8.12.2009, p. 1.\n[19]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joined cases C-113/10, C-147/10\r\nand C-234/10, not yet published.\n[20]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 50, 21.2.2002, p. 40.\n[21]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 212, 8.8.2002, p. 3.\n[22]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 205, 6.8.2005, p. 20.\n[23]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 130, 31.5.2000, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
