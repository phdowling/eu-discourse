It provides a legal framework covering issues\nfrom regular political dialogue to trade relations and regulatory cooperation,\nand development cooperation.\n(4)                   \nThe aim of the Agreement, concluded for 10 years\n(renewable), is to build a solid basis for strengthening ties between Iraq and\nthe EU. In particular, it aims to enhance political dialogue on bilateral,\nregional and global issues, improving the trade arrangements between Iraq and\nthe EU, supporting Iraq\u2019s own vital reform and development efforts and\nfacilitating its integration into the wider international economy. The Agreement\nunderlines the EU\u2019s determination to play a significant role in Iraq\u2019s\ntransition and will be the main vehicle for the EU\u2019s support to Iraq and\nfurther enhancement of EU-Iraq relations.\n(5)                   \nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Council\nDecision of 21 December 2011 on the signing and provisional application of\ncertain provisions of the Agreement, Article 2 (Human Rights clause) and Titles\nII (Trade and Investments), III (Cooperation areas) and V (Institutional,\nGeneral and Final Provisions) are applied on a provisional basis starting from\n1 August 2012, in so far as it concerns matters falling within the EU\u2019s\ncompetence. \n(6)                   \nIn Title V on institutional provisions, a\nCooperation Council is established at ministerial level to supervise the\nimplementation of the Agreement pursuant to Article 111 of the Agreement. The\nCooperation Committee is established by Article 112 (1) of the Agreement. In\naccordance with Article 112 (2), the Cooperation Council shall be assisted in\nthe performance of its duties by the Cooperation Committee and may decide to\nset up any other specialised sub-committee or body that can assist it in\ncarrying out its duties, and shall determine the composition and duties of such\ncommittees or bodies and how they shall function.\n(7)                   \nWith a view to completing the institutional\nframework and allowing for expert level discussions on the key areas falling\nwithin scope of the provisional application of the Agreement, it is suggested\nto establish three subcommittees, designated as follows: (1) Subcommittee on\nHuman Rights and Democracy; (2) Subcommittee on Trade and related issues; (3)\nSubcommittee on Energy and related issues. Additional subcommittees may be\nestablished at a later stage, following agreement of the Parties. \n(8)                   \nThe meetings in the subcommittees will allow the\nEU to reinforce the interaction with the Iraqi administration and provide an\nopportunity to discuss in detail Iraq\u2019s development in the specific areas and\npriorities for EU-Iraq cooperation, as well as for EU assistance to Iraq. Iraq\nhas expressed strong interest in starting the work of the three subcommittees\nas soon as possible.\n(9)                   \nBoth the EU and Iraq have committed to a rapid\nand effective implementation of the Agreement. The aim of this proposal is\ntherefore to ensure that the institutional framework of the Agreement is\nestablished as soon as possible, with the understanding that the first meetings\nof the sub-committees should take place not later than in early 2013, followed\nby those of the Cooperation Committee and the Cooperation Council. In order to\nbe able to proceed in this sequence it is proposed that, by its first act the\nCooperation Council adopts its decisions on (1) the adoption of the rules of\nprocedure for the Cooperation Council and the Cooperation Committee, and (2) the\nestablishment of the specialised subcommittees and the adoption of their terms\nof reference. Furthermore, these decisions should be adopted by written\nprocedure, in accordance with Article 10 of the Cooperation Council\u2019s proposed Rules\nof Procedure.\n2013/0090 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the Union position to be adopted in the\nCooperation Council established by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\nbetween the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the\nRepublic of Iraq, of the other part, in relation to the adoption of the rules\nof procedure of the Cooperation Council and of the Cooperation Committee, and\nthe establishment of specialised subcommittees and the adoption of their terms\nof reference\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nfunctioning of the European Union, and in particular its Article 218 (9),\nHaving regard to Article 3 of the Council\nDecision of 21 December 2011 on the signing and provisional application of\ncertain provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (\u201dthe\nAgreement\u201d) between the European Union and their Member States, of the one\npart, and the Republic of Iraq, of the other part,[2]in particular its Article 111(3)\nand its Article 112(2),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with its\nArticle 117, parts of the Agreement are applied provisionally as of 1 August\n2012.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to contribute to\nthe effective implementation of the Agreement, its institutional framework\nshould be established as soon as possible.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 111 (3) of the\nAgreement provides that the Cooperation Council shall establish its rules of\nprocedure. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 112 of the\nAgreement provides that the Cooperation Council shall be assisted in the\nperformance of its duties by a Cooperation Committee and may decide to set up\nany other specialised sub-committee or body that can assist it in carrying out\nits duties, and shall determine the composition and duties of such committees\nor bodies and how they shall function.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nSole Article\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position to be adopted\nby the Union in the Cooperation Council established by Article 111 of the\nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member\nStates, of the one part, and the Republic of Iraq, of the other part, shall be\nhereby established in relation to:\n\u2013              \nthe adoption of the rules of procedure of the\nCooperation Council and of the Cooperation Committee, and\n\u2013              \nthe establishment of specialised subcommittees\nand the adoption of their terms of reference,\nunder the terms of the draft Cooperation\nCouncil decisions annexed to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minor changes to the draft\ndecisions may be agreed to by the representatives of the Union in the Cooperation\nCouncil without further decision of the Council.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\nANNEX I\nDECISION\nNo 1/2013 OF THE EU-IRAQ COOPERATION COUNCIL\nof\n\u2026 2013\nadopting\nits rules of procedure and those of the Cooperation Committee\nTHE EU-IRAQ COOPERATION COUNCIL, \nHaving regard to the Partnership and\nCooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the\none part, and the Republic of Iraq, of the other part, (hereinafter referred to\nas \u2018the Agreement\u2019) and in particular Article 111 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nIn accordance with its Article 117, parts of the\nAgreement are applied provisionally as of 1 August 2012.\n(2)                   \nIn order to contribute to the effective\nimplementation of the Agreement, its institutional framework should be\nestablished as soon as possible.\n(3)                   \nIt is for the Cooperation Council to adopt the\nnecessary measures to this effect;
