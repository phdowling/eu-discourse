Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Slovenia, Malta, Cyprus and Croatia are also Parties to the Convention\r\nand its Protocols, together with 13 non EU Mediterranean countries.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Eighteenth Ordinary\r\nMeeting of the Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention (MOP) will take\r\nplace 3-6 December 2013 in Istanbul, Turkey.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Meeting of the Parties\r\nwill be asked to decide, i.a. on two acts having legal effects: \n\u2013              \r\nA proposal to adopt a Regional Action Plan on\r\nMarine Litter, under the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea\r\nagainst Pollution for Land Based Sources (\"the LBS Protocol\")\n\u2013              \r\nA proposal to amend the annexes II and III to\r\nthe Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in\r\nthe Mediterranean[2]\r\n(the \"SPA and Biodiversity protocol\")\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\nthe proposal to adopt a Regional Action Plan on Marine\r\nLitter:\n(a)         \r\nThe LBS Protocol provides for the adoption by\r\nthe Convention of regional action plans to eliminate pollution from land-based\r\nsources and activities. Once the plans are adopted, their measures and\r\ntimetables become legally binding, in the framework of the implementation of\r\nArticle 15 of the Land-based Sources Protocol. \n(b)         \r\nA new proposal for a Marine Litter Regional\r\nAction Plan has been formulated by the Secretariat of the Convention and was\r\napproved within MEDPOL, the relevant technical body of the Convention, in June\r\n2013. This proposal is in line with EU legislation on waste and water[3], and the Rio+20 commitment to\r\nsignificantly reduce marine litter[4].\r\nIt should also be enhanced by a few additional technical adaptations at the MOP\r\n18. Enhanced cooperation with third countries for the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment is necessary to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of\r\nthe Marine Strategy Framework Directive 2008/56/EC[5]. \n(c)         \r\nThe Marine Litter Regional Action Plan is, as\r\nstated in its article 5 \"without prejudice to stricter provisions,\r\nrespecting marine litter management measures contained in other existing or\r\nfuture national, regional or international instruments or programmes\". It\r\ninvites Parties to elaborate, as appropriate, relevant measures and programmes\r\nto target marine litter.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the proposal to amend\r\nthe SPA Biodiversity Protocol, in order to upgrade five coral species from Annex III to Annex II and to\r\ninclude six other species directly into annex II to the SPA and Biodiversity Protocol\n(a)         \r\nThe proposal was discussed in the relevant technical body of the Convention: the\r\nfocal points meeting of the SPA Biodiversity Protocol. The General Fisheries\r\nCommission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has taken part in the meeting. In\r\naccordance with Article 17 of the Convention and Article 14(1) of the SPA and\r\nBiodiversity Protocol, an amendment to the annexes to the Protocol will become\r\neffective for all Contracting Parties to the Protocol on the expiry of a period\r\ndetermined by the Contracting Parties concerned when adopting the amendment,\r\nexcept for those Contracting Parties which have opted out by notifying the\r\nDepositary. \n(b)         \r\nThe coral species concerned are included in Annex I to the Habitats Directive[6] as natural habitat types of\r\ncommunity interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas\r\nof conservation[7].\r\nFive of these coral species (Callogorgia verticillata, Cladocora caespitosa,\r\nEllisella paraplexauroides, Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata) are\r\nexplicitly mentioned in the interpretation manual of EU habitats[8] and other species (Antipatella\r\nsubpinnata, Antipathes dichotoma, Antipathes fragilis, Leiopathes\r\nglaberrima, Parantipathes larix, Cladocora debilis) are included as components\r\nof corallogenic reef concretions. \n(c)         \r\nThe support of these proposals by the EU ensures\r\nconsistency between its internal and external action. The EU is committed to\r\ninternational cooperation for the protection of biodiversity in line with\r\nArticle 191 (1) TFEU and in accordance with Article 5 of the UN Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity (CBD), the agreements made during the CBD Conference of the\r\nParties in Nagoya, 2010, the concern expressed at the United Nations Conference\r\non Sustainable Development in 2012 \"on the significant vulnerability of\r\ncoral reefs and mangroves to impacts, including from climate change, ocean\r\nacidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices and pollution\"\r\nthe commitment \u201cto support international cooperation with a view to\r\nconserving coral reef and mangrove ecosystems and realizing their social,\r\neconomic and environmental benefits as well as facilitating technical\r\ncollaboration and voluntary information-sharing\" as well as the Aichi\r\nBiodiversity Target No 10 according to which \"by 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other\r\nvulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are\r\nminimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning\".\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposal for amendment\r\nof the SPA and Biodiversity Protocol and the proposal for a Marine Litter\r\nAction Plan under Article 15 of the LBS Protocol will not require any change to\r\nUnion Law.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nview of the above, the European Union should support the proposal to adopt the\r\nRegional Action Plan on Marine Litter and the proposal\r\nto amend the annexes II and III to the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas\r\nand Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean.\n2013/0357 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non establishing the position to be taken\r\nat the Eighteenth Ordinary Meeting of the Contracting Parties of the Barcelona\r\nConvention for the Protection of the Environment and the Coastal Region of the\r\nMediterranean, with regard to the proposal for amending Annexes II and III to\r\nthe Protocol concerning Special Protected Areas and Biological Biodiversity in\r\nthe Mediterranean and with regard to the proposal for adoption of a Regional\r\nAction Plan on Marine Litter\r\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192 (1), in\r\nconjunction with Article 218 (9), thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission[9],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU is a Contracting\r\nParty to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the\r\nCoastal Region of the Mediterranean[10]\r\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the Barcelona Convention').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU is a Party to the\r\nProtocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution for Land\r\nBased Sources (hereinafter referred to as 'the LBS Protocol') and to the\r\nProtocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean[11] (the 'SPA and Biodiversity Protocol').\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Eighteenth Ordinary Meeting of the Contracting\r\nParties to the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols, which will take place in\r\n Istanbul (Turkey) from 3 to 6 December 2013 will examine the adoption of:\n(a)         \r\nA proposal to adopt a Regional Action Plan on\r\nMarine Litter, under the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea\r\nagainst Pollution for Land Based Sources ('the LBS Protocol').\n(b)         \r\nA proposal to amend the annexes II and III to\r\nthe Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in\r\nthe Mediterranean (the 'SPA and Biodiversity protocol').\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the proposal to\r\namend the annexes II and III to the Protocol concerning Specially Protected\r\nAreas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean:\n(a)         \r\nThe Meeting of\r\nthe Contracting Parties is the decision-making body of the Convention, and the\r\npowers conferred upon it include the capacity to amend as required the annexes\r\nto the Convention and to its protocols. In accordance with Article 17 of the Barcelona\r\nConvention and Article 14(1) of the Protocol, an amendment to the Annexes of\r\nthe Protocol shall become effective for all Contracting Parties to the Protocol\r\non expiry of a period determined by the respective Contracting Parties when\r\nadopting the amendment, except for those that have notified in writing the\r\nDepositary that they are unable to approve the amendment.\n(b)         \r\nAccording to the Memorandum of Understanding\r\nsigned between the Mediterranean Action Plan (UNEP/MAP) and the General\r\nFisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), possible amendments to the\r\nannexes of the Protocol should be consulted between the Parties ensuring timely\r\nand adequate flow of scientific information.\n(c)         \r\nThe EU should support this proposal because it\r\nis scientifically sound, consistent with Union legislation in particular under\r\nthe Habitat Directive and with the Union's commitment to international\r\ncooperation for the protection of biodiversity, and in accordance with\r\nArticle 5 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity[12], the target agreed at the Convention\r\non Biological Diversity in 2010 to significantly reduce the current rate of\r\nbiodiversity loss by 2020 as well as the Aichi Biodiversity Target No 10\r\naccording to which \"by 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral\r\nreefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean\r\nacidification are minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning\".\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the proposal to\r\nadopt a Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter, under the Protocol for the\r\nProtection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution for Land Based Sources\r\n(\"the LBS Protocol\"):\n(a)         \r\nThe LBS Protocol provides for the adoption by\r\nthe Meeting of the Parties of Regional action plans and programmes, including\r\nmeasures and timetables, to eliminate pollution deriving from land-based\r\nsources and activities. By virtue of Article 15 of the Protocol, when plans are\r\nadopted, their measures and timetables will become binding for the Parties on\r\nthe one hundred and eightieth day following the day of notification by the\r\nSecretariat to all the Parties.\n(b)         \r\nRegional Action Plan on Marine Litter has been\r\nformulated by the body designated by the Parties as responsible to prepare the\r\nMeeting of the Parties, and have been approved by the relevant technical body\r\nof the Convention. The Regional Action Plan should in addition be enhanced by a\r\nfew technical modifications, in order to bring it further in line with current\r\npractice in the EU.\n(c)         \r\nThe Regional Action Plan concerns a field\r\ncovered by Union law in particular in the field of waste and water as well as\r\ntransport[13]\r\nand is coherent with the commitment made at Rio+20 to significantly reduce\r\nmarine litter. Enhanced cooperation with third countries for the protection of\r\nthe marine environment is necessary to contribute to the achievement of the\r\nobjectives of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive 2008/56/EC. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two proposals to be\r\nexamined by the Eigtheenth Ordinary Meeting of the Contracting Parties would not\r\nrequire any change in Union
