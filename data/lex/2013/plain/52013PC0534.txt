While their potential damage is very significant, these\r\noffences are not always investigated and prosecuted by the relevant national\r\nauthorities, as law enforcement resources are limited. As a result, national\r\nlaw enforcement efforts remain often fragmented in this area and the\r\ncross-border dimension of these offences usually escapes the attention of the\r\nauthorities.\nWhereas tackling cross-border fraud cases\r\nwould require closely coordinated and effective investigations and prosecutions\r\nat European level, the current levels of information exchange and coordination\r\nare not sufficient to achieve this, despite the intensified efforts of Union\r\nbodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\r\nCoordination, cooperation and information exchange face numerous problems and\r\nlimitations owing to a split of responsibilities between authorities belonging\r\nto diverse territorial and functional jurisdictions. Gaps in the judicial\r\naction to fight fraud occur daily at different levels and between different\r\nauthorities and are a major impediment to the effective investigation and\r\nprosecution of offences affecting the Union\u2019s financial interests. \nEurojust and Europol have a general mandate\r\nto facilitate exchange of information and coordinate national criminal\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions, but lack the power to carry out acts of investigation\r\nor prosecution themselves. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has a mandate\r\nto investigate fraud and illegal activities affecting the EU, but its powers\r\nare limited to administrative investigations. Action by national judicial\r\nauthorities remains often slow, prosecution rates on the average low and\r\nresults obtained in the different Member States over the Union as a whole\r\nunequal. Based on this track record the judicial action undertaken by Member\r\nStates against fraud may currently not be considered as effective, equivalent\r\nand deterrent as required under the Treaty.\nAs Member States' criminal investigation\r\nand prosecution authorities are currently unable to achieve an equivalent level\r\nof protection and enforcement, the Union not only has the competence but also\r\nthe obligation to act. Article 325 of the Treaty so requires from a legal\r\nperspective, but taking into account the specific Union rules which apply in\r\nthis field the Union is also best placed to protect its own financial\r\ninterests, including via the prosecution of offences against these interests.\r\nArticle 86 of the Treaty provides the necessary legal basis for such a new\r\nUnion-level prosecution system, the purpose of which is to correct the\r\ndeficiencies of the current enforcement regime exclusively based on national\r\nefforts and add consistency and coordination to these efforts.\nThe current proposal seeks to set up the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and define its competences and procedures.\r\nIt complements an earlier legislative proposal[1]\r\nwhich defines the criminal offences as well as the applicable sanctions. \nThis proposal is part of a legislative\r\npackage as it will be accompanied by a proposal concerning the reform of\r\nEurojust.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn order to prepare this Regulation, the\r\nCommission has consulted widely with stakeholders, on a number of occasions,\r\nalso building on earlier discussions related to the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office, which have been going on for more than a decade.[2] Preparatory consultations in\r\nview of the present proposal have covered the main issues addressed in this\r\nRegulation, including various options with regard to the institutional, legal,\r\norganisational and operational set-up of a European system for the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of the relevant offences.\nEarly in 2012, two questionnaires were\r\npublished and distributed on-line, one to justice professionals and another to\r\nthe general public, respectively. In general, the replies were positive towards\r\ntaking new actions to strengthen the material and procedural framework to\r\ncounter offences affecting the EU\u2019s financial interests, and most also\r\nexpressed support for the idea to set up a European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\r\nA number of more detailed suggestions, concerns and questions were also voiced,\r\nin particular on the relationship between such the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice and national prosecution authorities, the competence of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office to direct and coordinate investigations at national\r\nlevel, or the possible difficulties with any harmonised European rules of\r\nprocedure in the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office's proceedings. In\r\nparallel, field research has been conducted in a number of Member States, as\r\npart of the external study in support of this report. In addition, throughout\r\n2012 and at the beginning of 2013, a number of discussions or meetings took\r\nplace at European level:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe network of Public Prosecutors or equivalent\r\ninstitutions at the Supreme Judicial Courts of the Member States, Budapest,\r\n25-26 May 2012. \n\u00b7                        \r\nConference: A Blueprint for the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office? Luxembourg, 13-15 June 2012. The conference gathered\r\nexperts and high level representatives from academia, EU institutions and\r\nMember States.\n\u00b7                        \r\nVice-President Reding's consultation meeting\r\nwith Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecution from Member\r\nStates, Brussels, 26 June 2012. The meeting permitted an open discussion on specific\r\nissues regarding the protection of the Union's financial interests. \n\u00b7                        \r\nOn 18 October 2012, the Commission organised a\r\nconsultation meeting on issues relating to a possible reform of Eurojust, in\r\nwhich questions related to the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice were also discussed with representatives of Member States. The meeting\r\ngenerally supported establishing a close link between Eurojust and the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe 10th OLAF Conference of Fraud Prosecutors,\r\nBerlin, 8-9 November 2012, was an opportunity to explore the ways in which\r\nnational prosecutors would interact with the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice, if set up. \n\u00b7                        \r\nThe informal consultation held on 26 November\r\n2012 with defence lawyers (CCBE and ECBA) looked at procedural safeguards for\r\nsuspects and made useful recommendations in that regard. \n\u00b7                        \r\nERA seminar \"Towards the European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office (EPPO)\", 17 and 18 January 2013.\n\u00b7                        \r\nMeeting of the Commission Expert Group on\r\nEuropean Criminal Policy, Brussels, 23 January 2013.\n\u00b7                        \r\nFurther consultation meeting with ECBA and CCBE,\r\nBrussels, 9 April 2013.\nAlso, numerous bilateral consultation\r\nmeetings with Member States\u2019 authorities have taken place over the second half\r\nof 2012 and the beginning of 2013.\nThe Commission conducted an Impact\r\nAssessment of policy alternatives taking account inter alia an external\r\nstudy (Specific contract No. JUST/2011/JPEN/FW/0030.A4) which has considered\r\nvarious options involving the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\r\nAccording to the analysis of the Impact Assessment, setting up the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office as a decentralised integrated office of the Union,\r\nwhich relies on national judicial systems, offers the most benefits and\r\ngenerates the lowest costs.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\r\n86 of the Treaty. According to the first paragraph of that provision, \u201c[i]n\r\norder to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union, the Council,\r\nby means of regulations adopted in accordance with a special legislative\r\nprocedure, may establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust.\r\nThe Council shall act unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European\r\nParliament\u201d. The second paragraph of that provision defines the responsibility\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office as follows: \u201c[t]he European Public\r\nProsecutor's Office shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and\r\nbringing to judgment, where appropriate in liaison with Europol, the\r\nperpetrators of, and accomplices in, offences against the Union's financial\r\ninterests, as determined by the regulation provided for in paragraph 1. It\r\nshall exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member\r\nStates in relation to such offences\u201d. Finally, the third paragraph of Article\r\n86 of the Treaty defines the substantive scope of the regulations to be adopted\r\npursuant to it: \u201c[t]he regulations referred to in paragraph 1 shall determine\r\nthe general rules applicable to the European Public Prosecutor's Office, the\r\nconditions governing the performance of its functions, the rules of procedure\r\napplicable to its activities, as well as those governing the admissibility of\r\nevidence, and the rules applicable to the judicial review of procedural\r\nmeasures taken by it in the performance of its functions\u201d.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThere is a need for the Union to act\r\nbecause the foreseen action has an intrinsic Union dimension. It implies\r\nUnion-level steering and coordination of investigations and prosecutions of\r\ncriminal offences affecting its own financial interests, the protection of\r\nwhich is required both from the Union and the Member States by Articles 310 (6)\r\nand 325 TFEU. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, this objective can\r\nonly be achieved at Union level by reason of its scale and effects. As stated\r\nabove, the present situation, in which the prosecution of offences against the\r\nUnion\u2019s financial interests is exclusively in the hands of the authorities of\r\nthe Member States is not satisfactory and does not sufficiently achieve the\r\nobjective of fighting effectively against offences affecting the Union budget. \nIn accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to\r\nachieve this objective. Throughout the proposed text, the options chosen are\r\nthose that are least intrusive for the legal orders and the institutional\r\nstructures of the Member States. Key features of the proposal, such as the choice\r\nof the law that applies to investigative measures, the figure of Delegated\r\nProsecutors, the decentralised character of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice and the system of judicial review, were designed in order not to go\r\nbeyond what was necessary to achieve the main objectives of the proposal.\nThe Union's competence to counter fraud and\r\nother offences affecting its financial interests is unambiguously stipulated by\r\nArticles 86 and 325 of the Treaty. As this Union competence is not accessory to\r\nthat of Member States and exercising it has become necessary to achieve a more\r\neffective protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests, the proposed package\r\ncomplies with the requirement of subsidiarity.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Explanation of the\r\nproposal by chapters\nThe main objectives of the proposal are:\n\u00b7                        \r\nTo contribute to the strengthening of the\r\nprotection of the Union's financial interests and further development of an\r\narea of justice, and to enhance the trust of EU businesses and citizens in the\r\nUnion\u2019s institutions, while respecting all fundamental rights enshrined in the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n\u00b7                        \r\nTo establish a coherent European system for the investigation\r\nand prosecution of offences affecting the Union\u2019s financial interests.\n\u00b7                        \r\nTo ensure a more efficient and effective\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of offences affecting the EU\u2019s financial\r\ninterests. \n\u00b7                        \r\nTo increase the number of prosecutions, leading\r\nto more convictions and recovery of fraudulently obtained Union funds. \n\u00b7                        \r\nTo ensure close cooperation and effective\r\ninformation exchange between the European and national competent authorities. \n\u00b7                        \r\nTo enhance deterrence of committing offences\r\naffecting the Union\u2019s financial interests.\n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I: Subject matter\r\nand definitions\nThis Chapter sets out the subject matter of\r\nthe Regulation, which is the setting up of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice. In addition, it defines a certain number of terms used in the text,\r\nsuch as the \u201cfinancial interests of the Union\u201d.\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II: General rules \nThis Chapter regulates the fundamental\r\nfeatures of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, its status and structure\r\nas a new Union office with investigation and prosecution functions. In doing\r\nso, it provides specific rules on the appointment and dismissal of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor and his/her delegates. It also sets out the basic principles\r\nof its functioning. \nSection 1 (Status, organisation and\r\nstructure of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office) clarifies how the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office is set up and what functions will be entrusted to\r\nit. The text provides for its establishment as a new Union body with legal\r\npersonality and sets out its relationship with Eurojust. Among the key features\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the text refers to independence and\r\naccountability, which should guarantee that it is able to exercise its\r\nfunctions and use its powers in a way that makes it immune from any improper\r\ninfluence. The main characteristics of the structure of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office are also described in the text.\nSection 2 (Appointment and dismissal of the\r\nmembers of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office) provides the rules\r\napplicable to the appointment and dismissal procedure of the European Public\r\nProsecutor, his/her Deputies and staff. The appointment procedure for the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor is designed in a way that guarantees his\r\nindependence and accountability towards Union institutions, whereas his/her\r\ndismissal procedure rests with the Court of Justice of the European Union. For\r\nthe European Delegated Prosecutors, who will be appointed and dismissed by the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor, the procedure ensures their integration into national\r\nprosecution systems.\nSection 3 (Basic principles) describes the\r\nmain legal principles that will govern the activities of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office, including conformity with the Charter of Fundamental\r\nRights of the European Union, proportionality, national law being applicable to\r\nimplement the Regulation, procedural neutrality, legality and celerity of\r\ninvestigations, Member States\u2019 duty to assist the investigations and\r\nprosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \nSection 4 (Competence of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office) clarifies the criminal offences which fall within\r\nthe material competence of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. These\r\noffences are to be defined by reference to national law implementing Union law\r\n(Directive 2013/xx/EU). The text distinguishes between two categories of offences,\r\nthe first of which falls automatically within the competence of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Article 12) and the second (Article 13) which\r\nrequires to establish its competence where there are certain connecting links\r\nwith offences of the first category. The Section also describes how the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office will exercise its competence over these offences.\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III: Rules of\r\nprocedure on investigations, prosecutions and trial proceedings\nThis Chapter covers the essential features\r\nof the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice, including provisions on how they should be controlled by national courts,\r\nwhat decisions the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office could take once the investigation\r\nis completed, how it would exercise its prosecution functions and how the\r\nevidence collected would be used in trial courts. \nSection 1 (Conduct of the investigation)\r\nprovides the general rules that apply to the investigations of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office, including the sources of information used, how\r\ninvestigations are initiated and conducted and how the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office may obtain further information from databases or data\r\ncollected at its request. \nSection 2 (Processing of information)\r\nexplains the functioning of the Case Management System.\nSection 3 (Investigation measures) sets out\r\nthe types and conditions of the individual investigation measures which the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office will be able to use. The text does not regulate in\r\ndetail each of these measures but requires the application of national law. \nSection 4 (Termination of the investigation\r\nand powers of prosecution) stipulates the different types of decisions which the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office may take at the end of the investigation,\r\nincluding indictments and dismissals.\nSection 5 (Admissibility of evidence)\r\nregulates the admissibility of evidence collected and presented by the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office in trial courts.\nSection 6 (Confiscation) regulates the\r\ndisposition of the assets confiscated by national courts as a result of the\r\nprosecution conducted by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV: Procedural\r\nsafeguards\nThe rules of this Chapter provide safeguards\r\nfor suspects and other persons involved in the proceedings of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which will need to comply with the relevant\r\nstandards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\r\nUnion. The rules refer to Union legislation (Directives on various procedural\r\nrights in criminal proceedings) with regard to certain rights but also define\r\nautonomously other rights which have not yet been regulated in Union\r\nlegislation. As such, these rules provide an additional layer of protection\r\ncompared to national law so that suspects and other persons may benefit\r\ndirectly from a Union-level protection. \n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V: Judicial review\nArticle 86(3) of the Treaty prescribes the\r\nUnion legislator to determine the rules applicable to the judicial review of\r\nprocedural measures taken by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the\r\nperformance of its functions. This possibility reflects the specific nature of the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which is different from that of all other\r\nUnion bodies and agencies and requires special rules regarding judicial review.\nArticle 86(2) of the Treaty requires that\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office exercise its functions of prosecutor in\r\nthe competent courts of the Member States. The acts of investigation of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office are also closely related to an eventual prosecution\r\nand will mainly deploy their effects in the legal orders of the Member States.\r\nIn most cases they will also be carried out by national law enforcement\r\nauthorities acting under the instructions of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice, and sometimes also after having obtained the authorisation of a\r\nnational court. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is therefore a Union\r\nbody whose action will mainly be relevant in the national legal orders. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate to consider the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office as a\r\nnational authority for the purpose of the judicial review of its acts of\r\ninvestigation and prosecution. As a result, national courts should be entrusted\r\nwith the judicial review of all the challengeable acts of investigation and\r\nprosecution of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the Union courts\r\nshould not be directly competent with regard to those acts pursuant to Articles\r\n263, 265 and 268 of the Treaty, since such acts should not be considered as\r\nacts of an office of the Union for the purpose of judicial review.\nIn accordance with Article 267 of the\r\nTreaty, national courts are able or, in certain circumstances, bound to refer\r\nto the Court of Justice questions for preliminary rulings on the interpretation\r\nor the validity of provisions of Union law which are relevant for the judicial\r\nreview of acts of investigation and prosecution of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice. This may include questions on the interpretation of this Regulation. Since\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office will be considered a national authority\r\nfor the purpose of judicial review, national courts will only be able to refer\r\nquestions on interpretation to the Court of Justice regarding its acts. The\r\npreliminary rulings procedure will thus ensure that this Regulation is applied\r\nuniformly throughout the Union, whereas the validity of the acts of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office may be challenged before national courts in\r\naccordance with national law.\n3.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VI: Data protection\nThis Chapter provides for rules governing\r\nthe data protection regime which in the specific context of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office particularise and complement the Union legislation\r\napplicable to processing of personal data by EU bodies (in particular\r\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\r\nDecember 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of\r\npersonal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement\r\nof such data). The supervision of all personal data processing in the context\r\nof the activities of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office has been entrusted\r\nto the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).\n3.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VII: Financial and\r\nstaff provisions\nThe rules of this Chapter regulate how the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office shall handle its budget and staff. They are based on\r\nthe applicable Union legislation, i.e. for budget matters on Regulation (EU,\r\nEuratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\r\nOctober 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the\r\nUnion and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, and for\r\nstaff matters on Regulation 31 (EEC), as amended.\n3.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter VIII: Provisions on\r\nthe relations of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office \nThis Chapter regulates the relationship of\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office with Union institutions or other bodies\r\nas well as actors outside the Union. Special rules apply to the relationship of\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office with Eurojust, given the special links\r\nthat tie them together in the area of operational activities, administration\r\nand management.\n3.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IX: General\r\nprovisions\nThese provisions address institutional\r\nmatters which arise with the setting up of any new Union office or agency. They\r\nare largely inspired by the \u201cCommon Approach on decentralised agencies\u201d but\r\ntake into account the specific (judicial) nature of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office. The provisions covers matters such as legal status and\r\noperating conditions, language arrangements, transparency requirements, rules\r\non the prevention of fraud, handling classified information, administrative\r\nenquiries and liability rules.\n3.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter X: Final provisions\nThese provisions deal with the\r\nimplementation of the Regulation and provide for the adoption of implementing\r\nprovisions, transitional provisions, administrative rules and entry into force.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal seeks to be cost-efficient for\r\nthe EU budget: part of OLAF's current resources will be used for setting up the\r\ncentral headquarters of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which in turn\r\nwill rely on the administrative support of Eurojust. \nLimited additional costs will arise in\r\nrelation to the position of the European Delegated Prosecutors who will be\r\nlocated in the Member States and will be an integral part of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor's Office. Given their dual status as both Union and national\r\nprosecutors, they will receive remuneration from the EU budget and will be\r\ncovered by the Staff Regulations.\nAs the set-up phase of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office will probably take several years, staff members will be gradually\r\ntransferred from OLAF to the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The equivalent\r\nnumber of the staff transferred and the corresponding credits to finance this\r\nstaff will be reduced in the establishment plan and budget of OLAF. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will\r\nreach cruising speed once the full staff levels are achieved. The full staff\r\nlevel will be achieved in 2023 with 235 staff, of which 180 establishment plan\r\nposts and 55 external staff. The estimated cost for 2023 with this staff level\r\nis approximately 35 million EUR.\n2013/0255 (APP)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the establishment of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor's Office\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 86 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\r\nEuropean Parliament,\nAfter consulting the European Data\r\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the Union and the\r\nMember States have an obligation to protect the Union\u2019s financial interests\r\nagainst criminal offences, which generate significant financial damages every\r\nyear. Yet, these offences are currently not sufficiently investigated and\r\nprosecuted by the relevant national authorities. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The setting up of the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is foreseen by the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) in the context of the area of freedom,\r\nsecurity and justice.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty expressly\r\nrequires that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office be established from\r\nEurojust, which implies that this Regulation should establish links between\r\nthem.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty provides that\r\nthe mandate of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is to combat crime\r\naffecting the Union's financial interests.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity, combatting crimes affecting the financial interests\r\nof the Union can be better achieved at Union level by reason of its scale and\r\neffects. The present situation, in which the prosecution of offences against\r\nthe Union\u2019s financial interests is exclusively in the hands of the authorities\r\nof the Member States does not sufficiently achieve that objective. Since the\r\nobjectives of this Regulation, namely the setting up of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office, cannot be achieved by the Member States given the\r\nfragmentation of national prosecutions in the area of offences committed\r\nagainst the Union\u2019s financial interests and can therefore, by reason of the fact\r\nthat the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is to have exclusive competence to\r\nprosecute such offences, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt\r\nmeasures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\r\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve\r\nthese objectives and ensures that its impact on the legal orders and the\r\ninstitutional structures of the Member States is the least intrusive possible.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandate of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be to investigate, prosecute and bring to\r\njudgment the perpetrators of offences against the Union\u2019s financial interests.\r\nThis requires autonomous powers of investigation and prosecution, including the\r\nability to carry out investigations in cross-border or complex cases.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The organisational\r\nstructure of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should also allow quick\r\nand efficient decision-making in the conduct of criminal investigations and\r\nprosecutions, whether they involve one or several Member States.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a rule, the\r\ninvestigations of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be carried out\r\nby European Delegated Prosecutors in the Member States. In cases involving\r\nseveral Member States or cases which are of particular complexity, the\r\nefficient investigation and prosecution may require that the European Public\r\nProsecutor also exercise his powers by instructing national law enforcement\r\nauthorities.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office is to be granted powers of investigation and prosecution,\r\ninstitutional safeguards should be put in place to ensure its independence as\r\nwell as its accountability towards the Union institutions. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strict accountability is a\r\ncomplement to the independence and the powers granted to it under this\r\nRegulation. The European Public Prosecutor is fully accountable for the\r\nperformance of his/her duties as the head of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice and as such he/she carries an overall institutional accountability for its\r\ngeneral activities before the Union institutions. As a result, any of the Union\r\ninstitutions can apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a\r\nview to his/her removal under certain circumstances, including in cases of\r\nserious misconduct. This accountability should be combined with a strict regime\r\nof judicial control whereby the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office can only\r\nuse coercive investigation powers subject to prior judicial authorisation and\r\nthe evidence presented to the trial court should be subject to verification by\r\nthat court as to its compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the\r\nEuropean Union. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure consistency in\r\nits action and thus an equivalent protection of the Union's financial\r\ninterests, the organisational structure of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice should enable central coordination and steering of all investigations\r\nand prosecutions within its competence. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\r\nshould therefore have a central structure where decisions are taken by the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To maximise efficiency and\r\nmimimise costs, the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should respect the\r\nprinciple of decentralisation whereby it should in principle have recourse to\r\nEuropean Delegated Prosecutors located in the Member States to carry out\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should\r\nrely on national authorities, including police authorities, in particular for\r\nthe execution of coercive measures. Under the principle of loyal cooperation,\r\nall national authorities and the relevant Union bodies, including Europol,\r\nEurojust and OLAF, are obliged to actively support the investigations and\r\nprosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office as well as to cooperate\r\nwith it to the fullest extent possible.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The operational activities\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be carried out under the\r\ninstruction and on behalf of the European Public Prosecutor by the designated European\r\nDelegated Prosecutors or their national staff in the Member States. The\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor and the Deputies should have the staff necessary to\r\ncarry out their functions under this Regulation. The European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office should be considered indivisible.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedure for the appointment\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor should ensure his/her independence and his/her\r\nlegitimacy should be drawn from\r\nUnion institutions. The Deputies of the European Public Prosecutor should be\r\nappointed by the same procedure.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedure for the appointment\r\nof the European Delegated Prosecutors should ensure that they are an integral\r\npart of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and that they are integrated\r\nat both an operational and functional level into the national legal systems and\r\nprosecution structures.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Charter of Fundamental\r\nRights of the European Union constitutes the common basis for the protection of\r\nrights of suspected persons in criminal proceedings during the pre-trial and\r\ntrial phase. The activities of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should\r\nin all instances be carried out in full respect of those rights.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigations and\r\nprosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be guided by the\r\nprinciples of proportionality, impartiality and fairness towards the suspect.\r\nThis includes the obligation to seek all types of evidence, inculpatory as well\r\nas exculpatory.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to\r\ndetermine the rules of procedure applicable to the activities of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office. As it would be disproportionate to provide detailed\r\nprovisions on the conduct of its investigations and prosecutions, this\r\nRegulation should only list the measures of investigation that the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office may need to use and leave the other matters, in\r\nparticular rules related to their execution, to national law.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\r\ncertainty and zero tolerance towards offences affecting the Union's financial\r\ninterests, the investigation and prosecution activities of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office should be based on the principle of mandatory prosecution,\r\nwhereby it should initiate investigations and, subject to further conditions,\r\nprosecute every offence within its competence.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The material scope of\r\ncompetence of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be limited to criminal\r\noffences affecting the financial interests of the Union. Any extension of this\r\ncompetence to include serious crimes having a cross-border dimension would require\r\na unanimous decision of the European Council.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Offences against the\r\nUnion's financial interests are often closely connected to other offences. In\r\nthe interest of procedural efficiency and to avoid a possible breach of the\r\nprinciple ne bis in idem, the competence of European Public Prosecutor\u2019s\r\nOffice should also cover offences which are not technically defined under\r\nnational law as offences affecting the Union's financial interests where their\r\nconstituent facts are identical and inextricably linked with those of the\r\noffences affecting the financial interests of the Union. In such mixed cases,\r\nwhere the offence affecting the Union\u2019s financial interests is preponderant,\r\nthe competence of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be exercised\r\nafter consultation with the competent authorities of the Member State\r\nconcerned. Preponderance should be established on the basis of criteria such as\r\nthe offences\u2019 financial impact for the Union, for national budgets, the number\r\nof victims or other circumstances related to the offences\u2019 gravity, or the\r\napplicable penalties. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competence of the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office regarding offences affecting the financial\r\ninterests of the Union should take priority over national claims of\r\njurisdiction so that it can ensure consistency and provide steering of\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions at Union level. With regard to these offences\r\nthe authorities of Member States should only act at the request of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office, unless urgent measures are required.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office should bring prosecutions before national courts, its\r\ncompetence should be defined by reference to the criminal law of the Member\r\nStates, which criminalises acts or omissions affecting the Union's financial\r\ninterests and determines the applicable penalties by implementing the relevant\r\nUnion legislation, in particular [Directive 2013/xx/EU[3]], in national legal systems. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office should exercise its competence as broadly as possible so\r\nthat its investigations and prosecutions may extend to offences committed\r\noutside the territory of the Member States. The exercise of its competence should\r\ntherefore be aligned with the rules pursuant to [Directive 2013/xx/EU].\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office has exclusive competence to deal with offences affecting\r\nthe Union's financial interests, the investigations it conducts on the territory\r\nof Member States should be facilitated by the competent national authorities\r\nand the relevant Union bodies, including Eurojust, Europol and OLAF, from the\r\nmoment a suspected offence is reported to the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\r\nuntil it determines whether to prosecute or otherwise dispose of the case. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to comply fully\r\nwith their obligation to inform the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office where a\r\nsuspicion of an offence within its competence is identified, the national\r\nauthorities of the Member States as well as all institutions, bodies, offices\r\nand agencies of the Union should follow the existing reporting procedures and have\r\nin place efficient mechanisms for a preliminary evaluation of allegations\r\nreported to them. The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union\r\nmay make use of OLAF to that effect.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential for the\r\neffective investigation and prosecution of offences affecting the Union's\r\nfinancial interests that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office can gather\r\nevidence throughout the Union by using a comprehensive set of investigative\r\nmeasures, while bearing in the mind the principle of proportionality and the\r\nneed to obtain judicial authorisation for certain investigative measures. These\r\nmeasures should be available with regard to the offences within the mandate of\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office for the purpose of its investigations\r\nand prosecutions. Once ordered by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office or by\r\nthe competent judicial authority at its request, they should be carried out in\r\naccordance with national law. In addition, the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\r\nshould have access to all relevant data sources, including public and private\r\nregisters.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the\r\ninvestigative measures provided for by this Regulation should comply with the\r\nconditions set out in it, including the need to obtain judicial authorisation\r\nfor certain coercive investigative measures. Other investigative measures may\r\nbe subject to judicial authorisation if this is required by the national law of\r\nthe Member State where the investigation measure is to be carried out. The\r\ngeneral requirements of proportionality and necessity should apply to the\r\nordering of the measures by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and to\r\ntheir authorisation by the competent national judicial authority pursuant to\r\nthis Regulation. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 86 of the Treaty\r\nrequires the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to exercise the functions of\r\nthe prosecutor, which includes taking decisions on a suspect\u2019s indictment and\r\nthe choice of jurisdiction. The decision whether to indict the suspect should be\r\nmade by the European Public Prosecutor so that there is a common prosecution\r\npolicy. The jurisdiction of trial should be chosen by the European Public\r\nProsecutor on the basis of a set of transparent criteria. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\r\nprinciple of mandatory prosecution, the investigations of the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office should normally lead to prosecution in the competent\r\nnational courts in cases where there is solid evidence and no legal ground bars\r\nprosecution. In the absence of such evidence and where there is no high\r\nprospect that the required evidence could be produced in trial the case can be\r\ndismissed. Additionally the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should have the\r\npossibility to dismiss the case where the offence is a minor one. Where the\r\ncase is not dismissed on such grounds but prosecution is not justified either,\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should have the possibility of\r\nproposing a transaction to the suspect, if this would be in the interest of the\r\nproper administration of justice. The rules applicable to transactions, and\r\nthose which apply to the calculation of the fines to be imposed, should be\r\nclarified in the administrative rules of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\r\nThe closure of a case through a transaction in accordance with this Regulation should\r\nnot affect the application of administrative measures by the competent\r\nauthorities, as far as those measures do not refer to penalties that could be\r\nequated to criminal penalties. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence presented by\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the trial court should be recognised\r\nas admissible evidence, and thus presumed to meet any relevant evidentiary\r\nrequirements under the national law of the Member State where the trial court is\r\nlocated, provided that court considers it to respect the fairness of the\r\nprocedure and the suspect\u2019s rights of defence under the Charter of Fundamental Rights\r\nof the European Union. The trial court cannot exclude the evidence presented by\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office as inadmissible on the ground that the conditions\r\nand rules for gathering that type of evidence are different under the national\r\nlaw applicable to it.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union. It requires the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office to respect, in particular, the right to a fair trial, the\r\nrights of the defence and the presumption of innocence, as enshrined in\r\nArticles 47 and 48 of the Charter. Article 50 of the Charter, which protects\r\nthe right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the\r\nsame offence (ne bis in idem), ensures that there will be no double\r\njeopardy as a result of the prosecutions brought by European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office. The activities of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office shall\r\nthus be exercised in full compliance with these rights and the Regulation shall\r\nbe applied and interpreted accordingly.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 82(2) of the Treaty\r\nallows the Union to establish minimum rules on rights of individuals in\r\ncriminal proceedings, in order to ensure that the rights of defence and the\r\nfairness of the proceedings are respected. Although the Union has already\r\nestablished a significant acquis, some of these rights have not yet been\r\nharmonised under Union law. In respect of those rights, this Regulation should lay\r\ndown rules which would apply exclusively for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rights of defence\r\nalready provided for in the relevant Union legislation, such as Directive\r\n2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on\r\nthe right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings[4], Directive 2012/13/EU of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 on the right to\r\ninformation in criminal proceedings[5],\r\nand [Directive 2013/xx/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of\r\nxx xxxx 2013 on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and on\r\nthe right to communicate upon arrest], as implemented by national law,\r\nshould apply to the activities of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Any\r\nsuspected person in respect of whom the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiates\r\nan investigation should benefit from them.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 86(3) of the Treaty\r\nallows the Union legislator to determine the rules applicable to the judicial\r\nreview of procedural measures taken by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\r\nin the performance of its functions. This competence granted to the legislator\r\nreflects the specific nature of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which\r\nis different from that of all other Union bodies and agencies and requires\r\nspecial rules regarding judicial review.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 86(2) of the Treaty\r\nrequires that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office exercise its functions of\r\nprosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States. Acts undertaken by the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the course of its investigations are\r\nclosely related to the prosecution which may result therefrom and have effects\r\nin the legal order of the Member States. In most cases they will be carried out\r\nby national law enforcement authorities acting under the instructions of\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, sometimes after having obtained the\r\nauthorisation of a national court. It is therefore appropriate to consider the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office as a national authority for the purpose of the\r\njudicial review of its acts of investigation and prosecution. As a result,\r\nnational courts should be entrusted with the judicial review of all acts of\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office which\r\nmay be challenged, and the Court of Justice of the European Union should not be\r\ndirectly competent with regard to those acts pursuant to Articles 263, 265 and\r\n268 of the Treaty, since such acts should not be considered as acts of a body\r\nof the Union for the purpose of judicial review.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n267 of the Treaty, national courts are able or, in certain circumstances, bound\r\nto refer to the Court of Justice questions for preliminary rulings on the\r\ninterpretation or the validity of provisions of Union law, including this\r\nRegulation, which are relevant for the judicial review of the acts of\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\r\nNational courts should not be able to refer questions on the validity of the acts\r\nof the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the Court of Justice, since those\r\nacts should not be considered acts of a body of the Union for the purpose of\r\njudicial review.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be clarified\r\nthat issues concerning the interpretation of provisions of national law which\r\nare rendered applicable by this Regulation should be dealt with by national\r\ncourts alone. In consequence, those courts may not refer questions to the Court\r\nof Justice relating to the interpretation of national law to which this Regulation\r\nrefers.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nthe Treaty prescribes that the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office is to be set up from Eurojust, they\r\nshould organically, operationally and administratively co-exist, co-operate and\r\ncomplement each other.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should also work closely with other Union institutions and agencies\r\nin order to facilitate the exercise of its functions under this Regulation and\r\nestablish, where necessary, formal arrangements on detailed rules relating to\r\nexchange of information and cooperation. Cooperation with Europol and OLAF should\r\nbe of particular importance to avoid duplication and enable the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to obtain\r\nthe relevant information at their disposal as well as to draw on their analyis in\r\nspecific investigations. \n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) 45/2001 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the\r\nprotection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the\r\nCommunity institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[6] applies to the processing of\r\npersonal data performed by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. This\r\nconcerns the processing of personal data in the framework of the objectives and\r\ntasks of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, personal data related to\r\nstaff members as well as administrative personal data held by it. The European\r\nData Protection Supervisor should monitor the processing of personal data by\r\nthe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The principles set out in (EC) No Regulation\r\n45/2001 should be particularised and complemented as regards the processing of operational\r\npersonal data by the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office when necessary.

Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nSpecify the effects\r\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nThe establishment of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is\r\nexpected to increase the protection of the Union's financial interests. Its\r\nestablishment is expected to lead to an increase in the number of prosecutions\r\nof the perpetrators of crimes affecting the financial interests, leading to a\r\nhigher number of convictions, a higher level of recovery of illegally obtained\r\nfunds and increased deterrence. In addition, its independence will ensure that\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions of the relevant crimes will be taken forward\r\nwithout direct influence of national authorities.\n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nSpecify the\r\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nIncreased number and percentage of successful criminal\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nWhereas both the Union and the Member States have an obligation to\r\nprotect the Union's budget, in reality the Union has little control over the\r\nexpenditure by Member States and virtually no power to intervene in cases of\r\ncriminal misuse of the EU's funds. The vast majority of the EU budget is\r\nmanaged by national authorities (for example when they award public procurement\r\ngrants financed through the EU budget) and any criminal investigations or\r\nprosecutions concerning offences affecting the Union's budget are within the\r\ncompetence of the Member States. Criminal investigations into fraud and other\r\ncrimes against the EU budget are often hampered by divergent legislation\r\nand uneven enforcement efforts in the Member States. National law\r\nenforcement authorities, prosecutors and judges in the Member States decide in\r\naccordance with priorities set by national criminal policy and on the\r\nbasis of national criminal law competences and procedural rules whether and, if\r\nso, how they intervene to protect the Union's budget. Consequently, the level\r\nof protection of the Union's financial interests differs significantly\r\nfrom one Member State to another. The fact that the rate of successful\r\nprosecutions concerning offences against the EU budget varies considerably\r\nacross the EU from one Member State to another (from 19% to 91%[15]) shows a gap in the\r\nexisting protection mechanisms and calls for corrective measures. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nThe added value of establishing a European Public Prosecutor's\r\nOffice is mainly to be found in the increased number of prosecutions of\r\ncrimes affecting the Union's financial interests. \nThe creation of a European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office would improve\r\nthe use of resources and information exchange necessary to be able to\r\nconduct successful investigations and prosecutions of the relevant offences.\r\nThis, in turn, would strengthen the law enforcement response to these offences\r\nin general, and increase the preventive effect (deterrence) for\r\npotential criminals. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office would be able to\r\npool investigative and prosecutorial resources for the needs in a given\r\nsituation, thereby making law enforcement at European and national level more\r\nefficient.\nThe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office will direct investigations\r\nand prosecutions in the Member States, ensure effective coordination of\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions, and solve problems related to different\r\napplicable legal systems. The current system, where the Member States are\r\nsolely responsible for such investigations and prosecutions, supported by\r\nEurojust and Europol, is not efficient enough to deal with the high levels of\r\nrelevant crime and associated damages. \nEnsuring that the limited financial resources of the Union are used\r\nin the best interests of EU citizens and are better protected against fraud is\r\nindispensable also for the legitimacy of expenditure and for ensuring public\r\ntrust in the Union. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nAt national level, there is often insufficient information\r\nexchange on suspected offences involving EU funds between the authorities\r\nresponsible for monitoring and control, those dealing with administrative\r\ninvestigations and law enforcement bodies. This partly arises as a result of\r\nloopholes in the procedural framework referred to above hampering efficient\r\nmultidisciplinary investigations involving judicial as well as administrative,\r\ncustoms and tax authorities in the Member States. Agencies managing and\r\ncontrolling the disbursement of EU funds sometimes focus solely on getting\r\ntheir money back through administrative and civil law procedures even if there\r\nare strong suspicions that a criminal act has occurred. This may lead to\r\nneglecting criminal prosecutions, and with that deterrence and general\r\nprevention.\nThe effective investigation and prosecution of offences against the\r\nEU\u2019s financial interests is, furthermore, hampered by the fact that law\r\nenforcement authorities and prosecutors do not always transmit information\r\nabout criminal offences to their colleagues in other Member States, or to\r\nEurojust or Europol.\nIn addition, the classical ways of international cooperation via\r\nmutual legal assistance (MLA) requests or via joint investigation teams (JITs)\r\nare often not functioning well enough to allow for the effective investigation\r\nand prosecution of these offences despite the efforts of European bodies such\r\nas Eurojust and Europol. Responses to MLA requests are often very slow and\r\npolice and judicial authorities experience practical difficulties in contacting\r\nand cooperating with colleagues abroad due to language problems and differences\r\nin legal systems. In some States, slow and ineffective international\r\ncooperation has frequently resulted in the impossibility to pursue the case due\r\nto the fact that the prescription period had expired. In addition, cases\r\naffecting the EU\u2019s financial interests are particularly complex.\nAs regards cooperation at Union level, mixed\r\nexperiences have been reported regarding the cooperation with Eurojust and\r\nEuropol, and between the Member States and OLAF. Eurojust and Europol do not\r\nalways receive the information they need to be able to support the Member\r\nStates. OLAF provides support to Member States through its ability to grant\r\nspecialised technical and operational assistance as required by Article 7 of\r\nsecond Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the European\r\nCommunities\u2019 Financial Interests. At the same time, OLAF's investigations are\r\nconducted subject to specific conditions, in particular when it comes to\r\ntransmitting information to the national judiciary, including applicable data\r\nprotection rules. For this reason, the cooperation with OLAF has also been\r\ncriticised on occasion, in particular with respect to the long time it\r\nsometimes takes for OLAF to share information with national prosecutors. Some\r\nMember States also restrict the cooperation with non-judicial bodies like OLAF\r\nbased on rules of judicial secrecy.\nOLAF's annual statistics demonstrate that the cases which are\r\ntransferred to national investigation and judicial authorities are not equally\r\neffectively and efficiently prosecuted across the EU. In its eleventh\r\noperational report, OLAF analysed the judicial follow-up given by Member States\r\nto its cases over 12 years and found \"very substantial differences between\r\ncountries with respect to their capacity to bring EU-budget related judicial\r\ninvestigations and prosecutions to a conviction within a reasonable time\".\r\nThe fact that the average prosecution rate lies under 50% shows that there are\r\nserious difficulties in achieving overall effectiveness of investigation and\r\nprosecution in the Member States. \n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nAnti-fraud Directive proposal\nThe Union's current actions to protect its financial interests\r\ninclude administrative investigations, controls and audits, as well as\r\nlegislative action, including the Commission's proposal for a Directive on the\r\nfight against fraud to the Union's financial interest by means of criminal law,\r\nbut do not address the deficiencies identified with respect to the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of criminal offences related to the protection of\r\nthe EU's financial interests.\nEurojust\nEurojust can only coordinate and encourage investigations and prosecutions,\r\nand assist with information exchange. If a Member State refuses to investigate\r\nor prosecute a case, Eurojust cannot compel it to do so. The National Members\r\nof Eurojust often lack the powers to ensure effective follow-up in the Member\r\nStates, or if they do, they usually refrain from using the powers which they\r\nderive from national laws \u2013 most decisions on these sort of issues are arrived\r\nat through consensus. \nThe proposal on the establishment of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office is accompanied by a proposal on the reform of\r\nEurojust which will align it with the common approach on European agencies\r\nagreed by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, and will\r\nestablish a link between Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\r\nThis reform might lead to more efficient information exchange and better\r\ncooperation between the national authorities. \nThere are, and will always be, cases where both the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and Eurojust need to be\r\ninvolved, in particular cases where the suspects are involved in both crimes\r\naffecting the Union\u2019s financial interests and other forms of crime. This\r\nimplies that there will be a need for continuous close cooperation. To ensure\r\nthat this takes place, provisions have been included in both Regulations to set\r\nout that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office may request that Eurojust, or\r\nits national members, intervene, coordinate, or otherwise use their powers in a\r\ngiven case.\nIn addition it is envisaged that Eurojust will provide practical\r\nsupport services, on a zero cost basis, to the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office in administrative issues, such as personnel, finance\r\nand IT. This approach delivers considerable synergies. One example of such\r\nsynergy is that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office will be able to use the\r\nIT infrastructure of Eurojust, including using its Case Management System,\r\ntemporary work files and index for its own cases. The details of this\r\narrangement will be laid down in an agreement between the European Public\r\nProsecutor\u2019s Office and Eurojust. \nOLAF\nCurrently OLAF conducts administrative investigations for the\r\nprotection of EU's financial interests. OLAF has specialised staff with\r\nsignificant experience in cooperating with national criminal authorities. Many\r\nmembers of OLAF staff have a relevant background in their national enforcement\r\nand judicial administrations (police, customs, and prosecutorial functions).\nA part of OLAF's resources would thus be used in order to set up the\r\nEuropean Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, taking into account their experience in\r\nthe conduct of administrative investigations and the objective of avoiding\r\nduplication of administrative and criminal investigations. Another important\r\naspect is that of using the current networks which OLAF has developed over the\r\nyears in the area of anti-fraud investigations.\nFinally, OLAF would contribute to the setting up of the European\r\nPublic Prosecutor\u2019s Office with specialised support to facilitate forensic\r\nanalysis and technical and operational support to investigations and for the\r\nestablishment of evidence in criminal cases affecting the Union's financial\r\ninterests. \nA proposal to amend Regulation 1073/1999 concerning investigations\r\nconducted by OLAF (OLAF reform) is under inter-institutional\r\nnegotiation. While this proposal improves the information exchange between OLAF\r\nand EU institutions bodies, agencies and offices (IBOA), as well as with the\r\nMember States and it provides better governance for OLAF and a set of\r\nprocedural guarantees for the persons concerned by investigations, it does not\r\nprovide OLAF with any additional means of action, in particular criminal\r\ninvestigation powers. \nEuropol\nThe role of Europol is limited to providing intelligence and support\r\nto national law enforcement activities. It cannot ensure follow-up to its\r\nanalyses in the Member States, nor direct national investigations. The powers\r\nof Europol are also limited by the TFEU. Under Article 88 TFEU Europol cannot\r\nindependently investigate crime, and any operational action must be carried out\r\nby Europol in liaison and with the agreement of the national law enforcement\r\nauthorities. Whilst the support functions of Europol are certainly important,\r\nthese cannot substitute for the powers to independently investigate criminal\r\nbehaviour. \nA proposal for a Regulation on Europol was adopted by the\r\nCommission in March 2013, focusing on aligning Europol\u2019s competences with the\r\nTFEU and to make it a hub for information exchange, while granting new\r\nresponsibilities regarding training. It does not comprise police investigation\r\nand law-enforcement powers in the area of the protection of EU\u2019s financial\r\ninterests.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\nX Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from 2017\r\nto 2023,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged \nDirect management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\nby its departments, including by its staff in\r\nthe Union delegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \nX Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\nX bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of\r\nthe Financial Regulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nSpecify frequency\r\nand conditions.\nThe European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office shall issue an annual report\r\non its activities.
