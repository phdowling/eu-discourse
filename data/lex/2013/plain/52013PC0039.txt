The\npatterns of use appear to follow those associated with amphetamine. \n(3)              \nBetween 2010 and 2012, 21 fatalities in four\nMember States have been reported where 4-methylamphetamine alone or in combination\nwith other substances has been detected in post-mortem samples. In some cases 4-methylamphetamine\nwas the predominant drug detected.\n(4)              \n4-methylamphetamine has no known, established or\nacknowledged medical value or use. However, it is used as an analytical\nreference standard and in scientific research.\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of the Council\nDecision, within six weeks from the date on which it receives the Risk\nAssessment Report, the Commission shall either present to the Council an\ninitiative to have the new psychoactive substance subjected to control\nmeasures, or shall present a report justifying why it deems it not necessary to\npresent such an initiative. \nAlthough the scientific evidence concerning\nthe overall risks and patterns of use of 4-methylamphetamine is still limited\nat this stage, there are grounds for subjecting the substance to control across\nthe Union. The main reason is that, according to the available information from\nthe Risk Assessment Report, the substance poses risks to health, as highlighted\nabove. These risks are heightened by the fact that 4-methylamphetamine is often\nsold as amphetamine or in combination with amphetamine or other substances, and\nthat most users are unaware that they are consuming this specific substance. \nFurthermore, taking into account that organised\ncrime appears to be involved in the manufacture, trafficking and supply of\n4-methylamphetamine and given the similarity of this substance with amphetamine,\nthe possibility that 4-methylamphetamine develops as an alternative to amphetamine\nfurther justifies subjecting the substance to control measures. \nThe objective of this proposal for a\nCouncil Decision is to call upon Member States to submit 4-methylamphetamine to\ncontrol measures and criminal penalties as provided under their legislation by\nvirtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on\nPsychotropic Substances. \n2013/0021 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non submitting 4-methylamphetamine to\ncontrol measures\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to the Council Decision\n2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and\ncontrol of new psychoactive substances[2],\nand in particular Article 8 (3) thereof, \nHaving regard to the initiative of the\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nA Risk Assessment Report on 4-methylamphetamine was\ndrawn up on the basis of Article 6 of Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special\nsession of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre\nfor Drugs and Drug Addiction, and was subsequently received by the Commission\non 29 November 2012. \n(2)                   \n4-methylamphetamine is a synthetic ring-methylated\nderivative of amphetamine which has predominantly been seized in powder and\npaste form in samples containing amphetamine and caffeine, but which has also\nappeared in tablet and liquid form. It has emerged on the illicit amphetamine\nmarket where it is sold and used as amphetamine. There has been one report of\nthe substance being detected in a commercial product sold on the internet. The\nmain chemical precursor for the synthesis of 4-methylamphetamine is\n4-methylbenzyl methyl ketone (4-methyl-BMK), which appears to be commercially\navailable on the internet and is not controlled under the 1988 United Nations\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances.\n(3)                   \n4-methylamphetamine's specific physical effects have\nbeen rarely reported by users as they are typically unaware that they have\ntaken the substance. However, the few reports that are available suggest that\nit has stimulant-type effects. Limited available data related to humans suggest\nthat the adverse effects of 4-methylamphetamine include hyperthermia,\nhypertension, anorexia, nausea, perspiration, gastric distress, coughing,\nvomiting, headache, palpitations, insomnia, paranoia, anxiety and depression. Current\ndata is not sufficient to determine the relative dependence-producing potential\nof this substance.\n(4)                   \nThe acute toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine is\nsimilar to that of other stimulants, according to the limited data sources\navailable. Certain evidence suggests that in combination with other substances,\nincluding amphetamine and caffeine, there may be a higher risk of overall\nenhanced toxicity. \n(5)                   \nThere have been a total of 21 fatalities\nregistered in four Member States where 4-methylamphetamine alone or in\ncombination with one or more substances, especially amphetamine, has been\ndetected in post-mortem samples. While it is not possible to determine with\ncertainty the role of 4-methylamphetamine in these fatalities from the\navailable information, in some cases the substance was the predominant drug\ndetected, with levels comparable to those found in certain cases of death\ncaused by the consumption of amphetamine. \n(6)                   \n4-methylamphetamine has been detected in 15\nMember States, while one Member State has reported the manufacture of the\nsubstance on its territory. Prevalence specific to 4-methylamphetamine is\ndifficult to estimate. There is no information on specific demand for the\nsubstance from user groups. It is not commercially marketed through internet\nshops.\n(7)                   \nThe available information suggests that it is\nproduced and distributed by the same organised crime groups that are involved in\nthe manufacture and trafficking of the controlled drug amphetamine. \n(8)                   \n4-methylamphetamine has no known, established or\nacknowledged medical value or use in the Union and there is no marketing\nauthorisation for the substance in the Union. Apart from its use as an\nanalytical reference standard and in scientific research, there are no\nindications that it may be used for any other legitimate purpose.\n(9)                   \n4-methylamphetamine is currently not under\nassessment and has not been under assessment by the United Nations system. Eight\nMember States control the substance under drug control legislation by virtue of\ntheir obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic\nSubstances. Two other Member States apply the generic definition in their\nnational legislation to the product while one Member State controls it under\nits medicines legislation. \n(10)               \nAlthough the Risk Assessment Report reveals that\nlimited scientific evidence is available on the characteristics and risks of\n4-methylamphetamine and points out that further studies are required on the\noverall health and social risks associated with the substance, the available\nevidence provides sufficient grounds for subjecting the substance to control\nmeasures across the Union. This is because of the health risks that the\nsubstance poses, as documented in its detection in several cases of fatalities,\nespecially when used in combination with other substances, because of its strong\nresemblance in terms of appearance and effects with amphetamine and the fact\nthat users may unknowingly consume this substance. These risks as well as the\nlimited medical value or use of 4-methylamphetamine, justify a decision to subject\nit to control measures across the Union. \n(11)               \nSince ten Member States already control 4-methylamphetamine,\nplacing it under control across the Union may help avoid problems in\ncross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation. \n(12)               \nUnion-wide control measures may help prevent\n4-methylamphetamine developing as an alternative to amphetamine in the illicit\ndrug markets, \nHAS\nADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nThe new psychoactive substance\n4-methylamphetamine is hereby submitted to control measures.\nArticle 2\nMember States shall take the necessary\nmeasures, in accordance with their national law, and not later than one year\nfrom the date this decision is published, to submit 4-methylamphetamine to\ncontrol measures and criminal penalties as provided for under their legislation\nby virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on\nPsychotropic Substances.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\nday following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Union.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\nL 127, 20.5.2005, p. 32.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
