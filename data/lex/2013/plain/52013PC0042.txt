It is of fundamental\nimportance to ensure trust and confidence in the authenticity of notes and\ncoins for citizens, companies and financial institutions. Counterfeits harm citizens\nand businesses that are not reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in\ngood faith. It also decreases the acceptability of notes and coins. \nCounterfeiting of the euro is of special\nconcern due to the importance of the euro. The euro is the single currency\nshared by the 17 Member States of the euro area and in use for the 330 million people living in this area. It is also used at a large scale\nin international trading transactions and serves as important reserve currency\nfor third countries. The value of euro notes circulating worldwide, that is to\nsay almost 913 billion euro in January 2013, is roughly the same as that of US\ndollar bills. Around one quarter of that value circulates outside the euro\narea, notably in neighboring regions[1].\nToday the euro is the second most important international currency world-wide. \nThe euro continues to be a target of\norganised crime groups active in the forgery of money. Counterfeiting of the\neuro has led to a financial damage of at least EUR 500 million since the\nintroduction of the euro in 2002. Data from the European Central Bank (ECB)\nshow peaks in the number of counterfeit notes during the period 2009 \u2013 2010 and\ntwo other peaks in the second half of 2011[2]\nand of 2012[3].\nThe ECB notes an increase of 11.6% as regards the quantity recovered in the\nsecond half of 2012 compared with the previous months. The Annual Report 2011[4] of the European Technical and\nScientific Centre (ETSC) points to a continuous discovery of new types of\ncounterfeit euro coins and a sharp increase in the number of sophisticated\ncounterfeit coins. Europol considers that there is a long-term trend towards an\nincrease in the crime level and notes that the criminal threat remains serious[5]. Europol's assessment is\nconfirmed by recent large-scale seizures of counterfeit euro notes and coins\nand the continuous dismantling of illegal print shops and mints each year[6]. \nThese developments show that the existing\nmeasures against counterfeiting have not reached the necessary level of dissuasion\nand therefore require improving the protection against counterfeiting. In\nparticular, considerable differences exist with respect to the levels of\nsanctions which are applicable in the Member States to the main forms of\ncounterfeiting, i.e. the production and distribution of counterfeit currency.[7] Whereas the minimum level of\nmaximum penalty for producing counterfeits was harmonised in the year 2000 at a\nlevel of eight years imprisonment, the situation concerning the minimum level\nof sanctions for currency counterfeiting is different. There are no minimum\nsanctions in place in some of the Member States or legal provisions only\nprovide for fines, whereas the minimum sanction in others is as high as ten\nyears imprisonment. These differences impair cross-border law enforcement and\njudicial cooperation[8].\nFurthermore, data collected in the framework of a study of the European\nCounterfeiting Experts Group[9]\nindicate that a high number of illegal print shops were discovered in the last\nnine years in those Member States which have no minimum sanctions in place or\nonly have fines for currency counterfeiting as their minimum sanctions which\nsuggests that counterfeiters make use of forum shopping. Finally, the current\nlack of a minimum and maximum level of sanctions for distribution offences constitutes\na dangerous threat with respect to the distribution within the European Union\nof counterfeit notes produced in third countries, as illustrated by the\nconsiderable number of print shops dismantled in third countries (e.g. Colombia\nand Peru) and the related seizure of large amounts of counterfeit euros and\nother currencies ready to be exported to or distributed in the European Union.\nIt can therefore be concluded that the current size of differences in the\nsanction systems of the Member States have a negative impact on the protection\nof the euro and other currencies against counterfeiting by criminal law\nmeasures. \nThe current level of sanctions is one of\nthe reasons for insufficient deterrence and uneven protection across the\nEuropean Union of its currency. The maximum level for criminal sanctions\nconstitutes one tool for the prosecutors and judges to determine the sanction\nto be imposed on the criminal, but it remains incomplete without a set minimum\nlevel. Since in practice the minimum standard for the maximum penalty is rarely\nimposed, a minimum penalty can be considered as more dissuasive and of great practical\nvalue for the protection of the euro. For those who are tempted to counterfeit\nthe euro, it will be the knowledge of the possible sanctions which will\ndeter them; the difference of being sentenced to imprisonment for a certain\nminimum duration instead of a fine, for example, is obvious. Thus, the minimum\nsanctions contribute to a consistent EU wide system for the protection of the\neuro. \nThe euro is the single currency of the\neconomic and monetary union established by the European Union. It is thus a\ntruly European common \"good\" that should be protected in a consistent\nmanner across the European Union, in particular by setting a minimum level of\npenalties for serious cases of production and distribution offences.\nThe European Union and the Member States\nshould provide for comprehensive protection of the euro and combat offences\nagainst the euro on a common basis. Following the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency ('Geneva Convention')[10] and its principle of\nnon-discrimination of other currencies foreseen in Article 5, all currencies\nwill profit from this increased protection of the euro. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal context\n1.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criminal law\nThe Geneva Convention lays down rules to\nensure that severe criminal penalties and other sanctions can be imposed for\ncounterfeiting offences. It also contains rules on jurisdiction and\ncooperation. Following the ratification of the Geneva Convention agreed on 20\nApril 1929, a certain degree of approximation of national legislation against\ncounterfeiting of currency has since taken place. \nCouncil Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA on\nincreasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against\ncounterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro[11] aims at supplementing, on the\nterritory of European Union, the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1929.\nIt identifies practices which are to be regarded as punishable in addition to\nthe actual act of counterfeiting, such as distribution. For these offences, the\nFramework Decision requires effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.\nIn addition, it contains provisions on jurisdiction and on the liability of\nlegal persons. The Framework Decision was amended by Council Framework Decision\n2001/888/JHA of 6 December 2001[12],\nwhich introduced a provision on mutual recognition of convictions for the\npurpose of recognizing \"repeat offences\".\nMember States were obliged to transpose Council\nFramework Decision 2000/383/JHA by 29 May 2001 and Council Framework Decision\n2001/888/JHA by 31 December 2002. The Commission has assessed their implementation\nin three reports[13].\nDespite the development of an EU acquis in this area, certain shortcomings have\nbecome visible. Although all Member States have, with minor exceptions,\nformally implemented the Framework Decision correctly, Member States have\nadopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection\nand practices within their national legal systems.\n1.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further Union provisions in\nthis area\nThe Framework\nDecision is part of a comprehensive legal framework consisting also of\nadministrative and training measures:\n\u00b7              \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998\non the introduction of the euro[14].\nIt obliges the Member States of the euro area to ensure adequate sanctions\nagainst counterfeiting and falsification of euro notes and coins;\n\u00b7              \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 of 28 June\n2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against\ncounterfeiting[15],\nupdated through Council Regulation 44/2009 of 18 December 2008[16]. It regulates how euro notes\nand coins can be uttered in such a manner as to protect them against\ncounterfeiting. Furthermore, issues such as gathering and accessing technical\nand statistical data relating to the counterfeit notes and coins, the\nexamination of counterfeit notes and coins by the National Analysis Centres and\nobligations of credit institutions and centralisation of information at\nnational level are addressed. Council Regulation (EC) No 1339/2001 of 28 June\n2011[17]\nextended the effects of Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 to those Member States\nwhich have not adopted the euro as their single currency;\n\u00b7              \nDecision of the European Central Bank of 16\nSeptember 2010 on the authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of\neuro notes (ECB/2010/14)[18];\n\u00b7              \nRegulation (EU) No 1210/2010 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of \n15 December 2010 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro\ncoins unfit for circulation[19];\n\u00b7              \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 of 6\nDecember 2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins[20], amended by Council regulation\n(EC) No 46/2009 of 18 December 2008[21];\n\u00b7              \nCouncil Decision 2005/511/JHA of 12 July 2005 on protecting the euro against counterfeiting, by designating\nEuropol as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting[22];\n\u00b7              \nCouncil Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February\n2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious\ncrime[23]\nby stimulating and improving coordination and cooperation between competent\njudicial authorities of the Member States also in the field of counterfeiting\nof the euro;\n\u00b7              \nTargeted actions for\nexchange, assistance and training of law enforcement agents to establish closer\nprofessional ties for a more efficient fight against euro counterfeiting are\nfinanced by the Union through the Pericles programme, which was established by\nCouncil Decision 2001/923/EC of 17 December 2001[24].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\ninterested parties\nThe Commission has consulted\nspecialist stakeholders on a number of occasions.\nThe consultation of the stakeholders started at the 58th Euro Counterfeiting\nExpert Group[25]\n(ECEG) meeting on 10 November 2011 and continued during subsequent ECEG\nmeetings. Experts and specialists[26]\nwere further consulted at The Hague Conference which took place from 23 to 25\nNovember 2011. A questionnaire on the implementation of the Framework Decision\nwas sent to Member States on 20 December 2011. The results of the questionnaire\nand a possible way forward were discussed at the 59th ECEG meeting on 14 March\nand the 60th meeting on 13 June 2012. The ECB as well as Europol participated\nin this process and provided their input, also through direct contributions to\nthe Commission.\nFrom the consultation it can be concluded that\nstakeholders consider it necessary to provide added value to the practitioners\nfor the protection of the euro and other currencies by criminal law measures. Two concrete proposals were received in relation to the improvement of\nprocedural criminal law: a proposal to align the investigative techniques such\nas controlled delivery, under-cover agents; and a proposal to introduce\nprovisions obliging judicial authorities to transmit samples of seized\ncounterfeit currency for technical analysis for the\npurpose of detecting further counterfeits in circulation.\nThe ECB expressed strong support for\nreinforcing the criminal law framework, in particular by strengthening and\nharmonising the penalties, including by setting standards for minimum penalties.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nThe Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives,\ntaking into account the consultations of the interested parties. After\nconsidering the possible options, the impact assessment concludes that the\nfollowing solution would be preferred: \n\u2013                        \nmaintenance of most of the provisions from Council\nFramework Decision 2000/383/JHA in a new proposal, with minor modifications,\ntaking into account the Treaty of Lisbon; \n\u2013                        \nmodification of the provisions on penalties by\nintroducing a minimum penalty of six months for production and distribution of\ncounterfeit currency and by introducing a maximum penalty of at least eight\nyears for distribution; \n\u2013                        \nintroduction of a new provision obliging Member\nStates to provide for the possibility to use certain investigative tools; \n\u2013                        \nintroduction of a new provision obliging Member\nStates to ensure that the\nNational Analysis Centres and the National Coin Analysis Centres can analyse euro counterfeits also during on-going judicial\nproceedings for the purpose of detecting further counterfeits.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis\nThe EU's competence to establish \"minimum\nrules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the areas\nof particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension resulting from the\nnature or impact of such offences or from a special need to combat them on a\ncommon basis\" is set out in Article 83 (1) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU). \nCounterfeiting of means of payment is\nexplicitly mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 83 TFEU as such an area of\nparticularly serious crime. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity,\nproportionality and the respect for fundamental rights\nIt is considered that there is a need for\nEU action based on the following factors:\nCounterfeiting of the euro poses a genuine\nproblem for the Union and for its citizens, businesses and financial\ninstitutions. The fact that the euro is the single currency of the euro area\nimplies that the offence of euro counterfeiting must necessarily be considered\nto cause the same harm everywhere in the euro area irrespective of where it is committed.\nThis pan-European dimension requires that counterfeiting is fought in a similar\nmanner and that criminals encounter equivalent penalties, wherever in the\nEuropean Union the crime is committed.\nThis particular position of the euro, which\nis the single currency of the economic and monetary union established by the European\nUnion and therefore a truly European \"good\", requires that its\nprotection must be ensured at EU level. As such, it is even more\n\"EU-centred\" than a field subject to harmonisation of rules in the\nMember States. \nOnly the EU is in a position to develop\nbinding legislation with effect throughout the Member States, and thus to\ncreate a legal framework which would contribute to overcoming the weaknesses of\nthe current situation.\nAccording to Article 5 of the Geneva\nConvention, no distinction shall be made in the scale of punishment between\nacts relating to domestic currency on the one hand and to foreign currency on\nthe other. Therefore, the increased protection of the euro should be extended\nto all currencies. \nThe proposed penalties are proportionate to\nthe seriousness of the offences and the considerable impact of counterfeiting\nof the euro and other currencies on citizens and businesses. They are in line\nwith the penalties currently provided for in the law of a majority of Member\nStates. Since many Member States already provide for the concept of minimum\npenalties, it is appropriate and consistent that the concept of minimum\npenalties be used at Union level. In order to guarantee that the severity of\npenalties is not disproportionate to the criminal offence, a specific safeguard\nfor cases of lower amounts of counterfeits is being proposed, i.e. one\nthreshold below which a lower penalty of imprisonment can be imposed and\nanother one below which also a fine can be imposed, unless the case features\nparticularly serious circumstances. This could for instance be the case where\nthe counterfeit money is discovered in circumstances that clearly suggest that\nhigher amounts have been or were to be produced. The chosen thresholds need to\nbe high enough to take account of minor cases, but at the same time low enough\nto guarantee a deterrent effect of the sanction and to take account of the\nimportance of genuineness of banknotes and coins and the trust citizens have in\nthem. \nThis Directive requires Member States to\nprovide for, in their national law, the scale of penalties foreseen in Article\n5, not going below the requested minimum levels. However, the general rules and\nprinciples of national criminal law on the application and execution of\nsentences in accordance with the concrete circumstances remain applicable. This\nincludes general rules on the application of sentences to juveniles, in cases\nof attempt, of only supporting participation or where the perpetrator\ncontributes to the discovery or to the prevention of serious offences.\nConcerning the execution of sentences, general principles as e.g. on suspended\nimprisonment, on alternatives to imprisonment (electronic surveillance) or on\nearly release would continue to apply. In the individual cases, the courts will\nexercise their discretion taking into account all aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances within the applicable legal framework.\nAny of the proposed criminal law measure\nwas carefully assessed and designed in view of its possible effects on the\nprotection of fundamental rights.\nThe proposal is relevant to the following\nrights and principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (hereafter the\nCharter): the rights to liberty and family life (by possible imprisonment of\nconvicted perpetrators), the freedom to choose an occupation and to conduct a\nbusiness (by possible disqualifications of convicted perpetrators), the right\nto property (by possible shutting down of businesses having committed offences),\nthe principle of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and\npenalties (because definitions for offences and the scale of penalties are set\nout), the right not to be tried twice (because of the possible interplay with\nadministrative punitive sanctions). These interferences are justified because\nthey serve to meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union (see paragraph\n1 of Article 52 of the Charter), and in particular to provide effective and\ndeterring measures for the protection of the euro and other currencies. It has\nbeen carefully insured that the measures do not go beyond what is necessary to\nachieve this objective and are thus proportionate. In particular explicit\nsafeguards in the instrument itself have been laid down, specifying the right\nto an effective remedy and to a fair trial, including the rights of the\ndefence, ensuring an equivalent level of effective judicial protection by\nnational courts. The requested penalties are proportionate in relation to the\noffences committed.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nIn order to set out criminal law provisions\non the basis of paragraph 1 of Article 83 TFEU, a directive is the correct\ninstrument.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific provisions\nArticle 1: Subject matter \u2013 this provision gives a description of the scope and purpose of\nthe proposal. \nArticle 2: Definitions \u2013 this provision sets out definitions which apply throughout the\ninstrument.\nArticle 3: Offences \u2013 this provision defines the main offences to be criminalised by\nMember States and clarifies that certain circumstances of the perpetration of\nthe offence fall under the scope. \nArticle 4: Incitement, Aiding and\nAbetting, Attempt \u2013 this provision is applicable to\nall offences mentioned above and requires Member States to criminalise all forms\nof preparation and participation. Criminal responsibility for attempt is\nincluded for the majority of offences.\nArticle 5: Penalties \u2013 this provision is applicable to all offences mentioned above in\nArticle 3 and 4. It requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate\nand dissuasive penalties in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. For\nmore serious cases of the offences of production and distribution of\ncounterfeit currency, it sets out a sanction of imprisonment within a range of\nat least six months and eight years for natural persons. The upper minimum\nceiling of eight years is already provided for in the Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA\nfor the offence of production. \nArticles 6 and 7: Liability of and\nsanction types for legal persons \u2013 these provisions\nare applicable to all offences mentioned in Article 3 and 4. They require Member\nStates to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such\nliability is alternative to that of natural persons, and to apply effective,\nproportionate and dissuasive sanctions on legal persons, and they outline the\npossible sanctions.\nArticle 8: Jurisdiction \u2013 this provision is based on the principles of territoriality and\npersonality. It is applicable to all offences mentioned in Articles 3 and 4. It\nrequires jurisdiction of the judicial authorities which allow them to initiate\ninvestigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to currency\ncounterfeiting. It obliges Member States whose currency is the euro to exercise\nuniversal jurisdiction on euro counterfeiting offences under certain conditions.\nIn case of parallel proceedings, Council Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA[27] of 30 November 2009 on\nprevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal\nproceedings promotes closer cooperation between the competent authorities.\nFollowing Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002, the national\nmember of Eurojust has to be informed of any case where conflicts of\njurisdiction have arisen or are likely to arise. In addition, Article 8 of this\nDirective requests that Member States concentrate criminal proceedings in one\nMember State unless not appropriate.\nArticle 9: Investigative tools \u2013 the provision aims at ensuring that investigative tools which are\nprovided for in national law for organised crime or other serious crime cases\ncan also be used in cases of counterfeiting of currency. \nArticle 10: Obligation to transmit\ncounterfeit euro notes and coins for analysis and detection of counterfeits \u2013 the provision requires from Member States to ensure that the National Analysis Centres and the National Coin Analysis Centres can analyse euro counterfeits also during on-going judicial proceedings\nfor the purpose of detecting further counterfeits.\nArticle 11: Relation to the Geneva\nConvention \u2013 the provision requests that Member\nStates are contracting parties of the International Geneva Convention of 20\nApril 1929.\nArticle 12: Replacement of Council Framework\nDecision 2000/383/JHA \u2013 this provision replaces the\ncurrent provisions in the area of counterfeiting of currency in relation to\nMember States participating in this Directive.\nArticle 13: Transposition \u2013 the provision requires that the Member States transpose the\nDirective within 18 months after its entry into force. Member States have to communicate\nto the Commission the text of these provisions as well as future provisions in\nthe field covered by this Directive. Member States are not required to transmit\nexplanatory documents, because the Directive contains a limited number of legal\nobligations and concerns a delimited domain at national level.\nArticles 14, 15 and 16 \u2013 contain further provisions on reporting by the Commission and\nreview; entry into force and addressees. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThis proposal has no budgetary implications\nfor the budget of the European Union.\n2013/0023 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the protection of the euro and other\ncurrencies against counterfeiting by criminal law, and replacing Council\nFramework Decision 2000/383/JHA \n\u00a0\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 83(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter having consulted the European Central\nBank,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[28],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the single currency\nshared by the Member States of the euro area, the euro has become an important\nfactor in the Union's economy and the every-day-life of its citizens. It is in\nthe interest of the Union as a whole to oppose and pursue any activity that is\nlikely to jeopardise the authenticity of the euro by counterfeiting.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counterfeit money has a\nconsiderable ill-effect on society. It harms citizens and businesses that are\nnot reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in good faith. It is of\nfundamental importance to ensure trust and confidence in the authenticity of notes\nand coins for citizens, companies and financial institutions. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential to ensure\nthat effective and efficient criminal law measures protect the euro and any\nother currency whose circulation is legally authorised in an appropriate way in\nall Member States. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\n974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro[29] obliges the Member States\nwhose currency is the euro to ensure adequate sanctions against counterfeiting\nand falsification of euro notes and coins. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulations (EC)\nNo 1338/2001[30]\nand No 1339/2001[31]\nof 28 June 2001 lay down measures necessary for the protection of the euro\nagainst counterfeiting, in particular measures to withdraw counterfeit euros from\ncirculation. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The International\nConvention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency signed at Geneva on\n20 April 1929 and its Protocol ('Geneva Convention')[32] lays down rules to effectively\nprevent, prosecute and punish the offence of counterfeiting currency. In\nparticular, it aims at ensuring that severe criminal penalties and other\nsanctions can be imposed for offences of counterfeiting currency. All\ncontracting parties of the Geneva Convention have to apply the principle of\nnon-discrimination to currencies other than their domestic currency.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this Directive\nis to supplement the provisions and to facilitate the application of the Geneva\nConvention by the Member States. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive builds on\nand updates Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA on\nincreasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against\ncounterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro[33]. This Directive complements the Framework Decision with further\nprovisions on the level of penalties, on investigative tools and on the\nanalysis, identification and detection of counterfeits during judicial proceedings.\nThe Framework Decision should be replaced by this Directive in relation to\nthose Member States participating in the adoption of this Directive.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive should\nprotect any banknote and coin whose circulation is legally authorised, irrespective\nof whether it is made of paper, metal or any other material. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The protection of the euro\nand other currencies calls for a common definition of the offences related to\nthe currency counterfeiting as well as for common sanction types both for natural\nand legal persons. In order to ensure coherence with the Geneva Convention, this\nDirective should provide for the same offences to be punishable as in the\nConvention. Therefore, the production of counterfeit notes and coins and their\ndistribution should be a criminal offence. Important preparatory work to those\noffences, for example the production of counterfeiting instruments and\ncomponents, should be punished independently. The common aim of those definitions\nof offences should be to act as a deterrent from any handling with counterfeit notes\nand coins, instruments and tools for counterfeiting. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The misuse of legal facilities\nor material of authorised printers or mints for the production of unauthorised notes\nand coins for fraudulent use should also be regarded as counterfeiting. This\ncovers situations where a national central bank or mint or other authorised\nindustry produces notes or coins exceeding the quota authorised by the European\nCentral Bank. It also covers situations where an employee of a legal printer or\nmint abuses the facilities for his or her own purposes. That conduct should be punishable\nas a counterfeiting offence even if the authorised quantities have not been\nexceeded, because the produced counterfeits would, once circulated, not be\ndistinguishable from authorised notes and coins.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notes and coins which the\nEuropean Central Bank or the national central banks and mints have not yet\nformally issued should also fall under the protection of this Directive. Thus,\nfor instance, euro coins with new national sides or new series of euro notes should\nbe protected before they have officially been put into circulation.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Incitement, aiding and\nabetting and attempt to commit the main counterfeiting offences, including\nmisuse of legal facilities or material and including counterfeiting of notes\nand coins not yet issued but designated for circulation, should also be\npenalised where appropriate. This Directive does not require Member States to\nrender attempt to commit an offence related to an instrument or component for\ncounterfeiting punishable.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sanctions for counterfeiting\noffences should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive throughout the\nUnion. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currency counterfeiting is\ntraditionally a crime subject to a high level of sanctions in the Member\nStates. This is due to the serious nature and the impact of the crime on\ncitizens and businesses and due to the need to ensure the trust of Union\ncitizens in the genuine character of the euro and other currencies. This holds particularly\ntrue for the euro, which is the single currency of 330 million people in the\neuro area and which is the second most important international currency. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, Member States\nshould provide for certain minimum types and levels of sanctions. The concept\nof minimum penalties is currently provided for in a majority of Member States.\nIt is consistent and appropriate to adopt this approach at Union level.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The levels of the sanctions\nshould be effective and dissuasive but should not go beyond what is\nproportionate to the offences. The penalty for natural persons in serious\ncases, that is to say, for the main offences of production and distribution of\ncounterfeit currency involving a large amount of counterfeit notes and coins or\ninvolving particularly serious circumstances, should therefore be a minimum\npenalty of at least six months and a maximum penalty of at least eight years of\nimprisonment. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The minimum penalty of six\nmonths helps to ensure that equal priority is given by law-enforcement and\njudicial authorities to the offences of counterfeiting of the euro and other\ncurrencies and, in turn, facilitates cross-border cooperation. It contributes\nto mitigating the risk of forum-shopping. Moreover, it allows that sentenced\nperpetrators can be surrendered with the help of a European Arrest Warrant so\nthat the custodial sentence or detention order can be executed. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should have\nthe possibility to impose a short term of imprisonment or to refrain from\nimprisonment in cases where the total nominal value of the counterfeited notes\nand coins is not significant or does not involve particularly serious\ncircumstances. That value should be below EUR 5 000, that is to say ten times\nthe highest denomination of the euro, for cases calling for a penalty other than\nimprisonment, and below EUR 10 000 for cases calling for imprisonment for a shorter\nterm than six months. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive is without\nprejudice to the general rules and principles of national criminal law on the\napplication and execution of sentences in accordance with the concrete\ncircumstances in each individual case.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since confidence in the\ngenuine character of notes and coins can also be harmed or threatened by the\nconduct of legal persons, legal persons should be liable for the criminal\noffences committed on their behalf.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the success of\ninvestigations and prosecution of currency counterfeiting offences, those\nresponsible for investigating and prosecuting such offences should have access\nto the investigative tools used in combating organised crime or other serious\ncrime. Such tools include, for example, the interception of communications,\ncovert surveillance including electronic surveillance, the monitoring of bank\naccounts and other financial investigations, taking into account, inter alia,\nthe principle of proportionality and the nature and seriousness of the offences\nunder investigation. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\nestablish their jurisdiction in coherence with the Geneva Convention and the\nprovisions on jurisdiction in other Union criminal law legislation, that is to\nsay, for offences committed on their territory and for offences committed by\ntheir nationals. The pre-eminent role of the euro for the economy and society\nof the European Union as well as the specific threat to the euro as a currency\nof world-wide importance calls for an additional measure to protect it.\nTherefore, each Member State whose currency is the euro should exercise\nuniversal jurisdiction, for offences related to the euro committed outside the European\nUnion, if either the offender is in its territory or counterfeit euros related\nto the offence are detected in that Member State. When exercising universal\njurisdiction, Member States should respect the principle of proportionality, in\nparticular with regard to convictions by a third country for the same conduct. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counterfeiting often\nconcerns several Member States in parallel, with for instance production taking\npart in one Member State and distribution in one or more others. In line with\nthe mechanisms set up in Council Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA of 30 November\n2009 on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in\ncriminal proceedings[34],\nMember States should concentrate the criminal proceedings including the\nprosecution in one Member State in such cross-border cases unless not\nappropriate. This is in particular the situation where this concentration can\nstreamline the investigation such as the seizure of evidence or where it allows\nthe court to take into account the whole scale of the offence in one\nconviction. Following Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting\nup Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime[35], the national member of Eurojust\nhas to be informed of any case where conflicts of jurisdiction have arisen or\nare likely to arise.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the euro, the identification\nof counterfeit notes and coins is centralised at the National Analysis Centres\nand, respectively, the Coin National Analysis Centres which are designated or\nestablished in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001. The analysis, identification\nand detection of counterfeit euro notes and coins should also be possible\nduring on-going judicial proceedings in order to avoid and stop such types of counterfeits\nfrom further circulating, with due respect for the principle of a fair and\neffective trial. In general, the judicial authorities should authorise the\nphysical transmission of the counterfeits to the National Analysis Centres and Coin\nNational Analysis Centres. In certain circumstances, for example where only a few\ncounterfeit notes or coins constitute the evidence for the criminal proceedings\nor where physical transmission would result in the risk of destruction of\nevidence such as fingerprints, the judicial authorities should instead be able\nto decide to give access to the notes and coins.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably the right to\nliberty and security, the respect for private and family life, the freedom to\nchoose an occupation and right to engage in work, the freedom to conduct a\nbusiness, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair\ntrial, the presumption of innocence and the right to defence, the principles of\nthe legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, as well as\nthe prohibition of being tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for\nthe same criminal offence. This Directive seeks to ensure full respect for\nthose rights and principles and must be implemented accordingly.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can\ntherefore, by reasons of the scale and effects, better achieved at Union level,\nthe Union may adopt the measures laid down in this Directive, in accordance\nwith the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve\nthe objective.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [In accordance with Article\n3 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in\nrespect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on\nthe European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nthe United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to take part in the\nadoption and application of this Directive.\nAND/OR\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and\nIreland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the\nTreaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United\nKingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption and application of this\nDirective and are not bound by it or subject to its application.]\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark annexed to the\nTreaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive\nand is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive establishes minimum rules\nconcerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of counterfeiting\nof the euro and other currencies.
