It\r\nis based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of\r\nstrengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable\r\ngrowth underpinned by financial stability, thereby supporting the achievement\r\nof the Union's objectives for sustainable growth and jobs. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on common\r\nprovisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the\r\ncorrection of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area sets out\r\nprovisions for enhanced monitoring of budgetary policies in the euro area and\r\nfor ensuring that national budgets are consistent with the economic policy\r\nguidance issued in the context of the SGP and the European Semester. Since\r\npurely budgetary measures might be insufficient to ensure a lasting correction\r\nof the excessive deficit, additional policy measures and structural reforms may\r\nbe required.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 9 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 sets out the modalities for economic partnership programmes,\r\nto be submitted by euro area Member States under an Excessive Deficit\r\nProcedure. Setting out a roadmap of measures to contribute to an effective and\r\ndurable correction of the excessive deficit, the economic partnership programme\r\nshould detail in particular the main fiscal-structural reforms, notably those\r\nreferring to taxation, pension and health systems and budgetary frameworks,\r\nwhich will be instrumental to correct the excessive deficit in a lasting\r\nmanner. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 27 April 2009, the\r\nCouncil adopted a decision according to Article 104(6) of the Treaty\r\nestablishing the European Community (TEC), whereby France is placed in an Excessive\r\nDeficit Procedure. On 21 June 2013, the Council adopted a revised\r\nrecommendation under Article 126(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union (TFEU) in the context of an excessive deficit which was opened\r\nbefore the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 473/2013. In this context, France was requested to present an economic partnership programme by 1 October 2013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 October 2013, and\r\nthereby within the time frame established by Article 9(3) and 17(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013, France presented to the Commission and to the\r\nCouncil an Economic Partnership Programme, setting out in particular fiscal-structural\r\nreforms that aim at ensuring an effective and lasting correction of the\r\nexcessive deficit. The Economic Partnership Programme includes measures aimed\r\nat implementing the country-specific recommendations (CSR) addressed to France\r\nby the Council on 9 July 2013: (i) ensuring the long-term sustainability of\r\npublic finances (CSR 1) while simplifying the tax system (CSR 5), (ii)\r\nrestoring competitiveness through measures to reduce production costs\r\n(CSR 2), improving the business environment (CSR 3) and increasing\r\ncompetition (CSR 4) as well as (iii) combating unemployment and inequality\r\non the labour market (CSR 6). \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme focuses on measures which, with very few exceptions, either have\r\nalready been implemented or are in the process of adoption. It provides limited\r\ninformation on the policy strategy of the government for the period up to 2015,\r\nwhich is the deadline for correcting the excessive deficit. The fiscal-structural\r\nreforms taken or planned by France are the following: (i) measures to reduce\r\nthe general government deficit, notably through efforts to contain expenditure\r\ngrowth, (ii) creation of an independent fiscal council, (iii) reform of the\r\npension system, (iv) simplification of the tax system (v) reduction in the cost\r\nof labour. Additional structural reforms with a bearing on growth and\r\ncompetitiveness, and hence an indirect impact on the deficit reduction include:\r\n(i) support to innovation and export capacity of firms, (ii) measures to enhance\r\ncompetition and efficiency in network industries and in some regulated sectors,\r\n(iii) reform of the labour market, and (iv) support to youth employment. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding public finances,\r\nthe measures taken seek to comply with the headline deficit targets set forth\r\nin the Council recommendation of 21 June 2013, making specific efforts to\r\ncontain expenditure growth, including on healthcare. To that avail, a number of\r\npublic policy assessments have been carried out as part of the on-going\r\nspending review and have translated into specific proposals but the expected\r\nsavings have not been systematically quantified. In addition, part of the\r\nmeasures announced so far consist in limiting and/or abolishing tax and social\r\nsecurity exemptions, which will actually raise the tax burden rather than lower\r\nexpenditure. More generally, it remains to be seen to what extent the spending\r\nreview will indeed result in major reforms of government policies, coverage of\r\nactivities by the public sector and delivery modes of public services. The\r\ngovernment has also initiated a decentralisation reform aimed at clarifying the\r\nresponsibilities of local authorities and central government in order to\r\nincrease the efficiency of local government expenditure. However, it is unclear\r\nat this stage whether this process will indeed contribute to rationalising\r\nlocal spending and the expected savings have not been quantified. Beyond the\r\nsignificant amount of savings targeted for 2014, the Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme provides little information on measures to improve the\r\ncost-effectiveness of healthcare spending in the medium to long run, including\r\nin the area of pharmaceuticals, in view of the projected increase in this\r\nspending.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governance of public\r\nfinances has been strengthened in particular through the creation of a High\r\nCouncil for Public Finances. An independent authority by law, the High Council provides\r\nan opinion on the macroeconomic scenario underpinning draft budgets and\r\nstability programmes and on the consistency of annual fiscal targets with the\r\nmulti-annual budgetary strategy. Accordingly, it provided an opinion on the\r\nStability Programme submitted by France on 30 April 2013 as well as on the\r\nDraft Budgetary Plan.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The planned pension reform\r\ncan be expected to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the pension\r\nsystem. Measures taken up to 2020 mainly focus on the revenue side, in\r\nparticular with an increase in social contributions for both employees and\r\nemployers, a measure that the Council had warned against. The government has\r\ncommitted itself to offsetting the impact of the planned pension reform on the\r\ncost of labour in 2014 through a reduction in family contributions. From 2020,\r\nthe contribution period for a full pension will gradually increase to 43 years\r\nin 2035. The planned reform falls short of fully addressing the Council\r\nrecommendation as the measures considered are expected to only halve the\r\nfinancing gap of the pension system by 2020. In this respect, the scope and\r\nspecific rules of public sector worker schemes have not been reviewed.\r\nMoreover, the financial gap of the pension system by 2020 could be even higher\r\nthan expected if the macroeconomic scenario underpinning the reform proves overly\r\noptimistic, which cannot be fully ruled out based on current economic\r\ndevelopments. The budgetary cost of planned measures to better take strenuous\r\nactivities into account is subject to significant uncertainty and is yet\r\nanother risk to the financial outlook of the pension system.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further efforts have been\r\nmade to simplify the tax system and increase its efficiency through a further\r\ncut in tax expenditures and proposals to increase environmental taxation. On the\r\nother hand, beside the measure already adopted in 2013 and whose impact will\r\nincrease in 2014, no measures are considered in the Draft Budgetary Plan to further\r\nreduce the debt bias in corporate taxation. Amendments\r\nto the Draft Budgetary Plan after the latter was submitted to the Commission\r\nand the Council will result in a de facto higher corporate income tax statutory\r\nrate for large companies, contrary to the Council recommendation to reduce\r\nstatutory rates while broadening the tax base. Furthermore, while value-added\r\ntax rates will change from January 2014, as decided in December 2012, the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme does not include information on measures to further bring\r\nreduced rates closer to the standard rate as recommended by the Council. The\r\nsuspension of a green tax on heavy goods vehicles announced by the government\r\non 29 October appears at odds with the efforts presented in the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme to increase environmental taxation.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures taken by the\r\ngovernment to support cost-competitiveness can be expected to mitigate the\r\nincrease in the cost of labour linked to the fiscal consolidation measures\r\nadopted since 2010. In particular, the tax rebate for competitiveness and\r\nemployment adopted in December 2012 reduces significantly the cost of labour\r\nfor wages below 2.5 times the minimum wage. Beside the commitment to offset the\r\nimpact of the planned pension reform in 2014 the government has announced an\r\nupcoming reform of the social security financing in order to diversify receipts\r\nand reduce its impact on the labour cost. However, little information is\r\navailable at this stage on the specifics of this reform.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme puts forward a number of structural reforms taken to increase growth\r\nand competitiveness and to fight unemployment. To support competitiveness, the\r\ngovernment has taken measures to ease access to finance for innovative projects\r\nand support exporting firms. Initiatives to simplify the interactions between\r\ncompanies and the administration have been launched. In addition, the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme mentions targeted measures to increase competition in\r\nsome regulated sectors (e.g. notaries, accountants) but these measures fall\r\nshort of fully addressing the country-specific recommendations which called for\r\nan ambitious reform in the services sector. A reform of the railway system is also\r\npresented in the Economic Partnership Programme. While this reform seeks to\r\nimprove the efficiency of the system, it does not provide for the opening of\r\ndomestic passenger transportation to competition, as called for in the\r\ncountry-specific recommendations. The Economic Partnership Programme also\r\npresents significant measures adopted to fight unemployment although most of\r\nthem were known at the time of the Council recommendation. The law of 14 June\r\n2013 on securing jobs, the specific measures to support the employment of young\r\npeople and of older workers, as well as the forthcoming reform of vocational\r\ntraining and apprenticeship are positive steps to improve the functioning of\r\nthe labour market and hence increase France's growth potential. By contrast, the\r\nnegotiation on the unemployment benefit system has been postponed to 2014,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION: \nThe Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme of France presented to the Commission and to the Council on 1 October\r\n2013 includes a set of fiscal-structural reforms that is partly adequate to\r\nsupport an effective and lasting correction of the excessive deficit. The Economic\r\nPartnership Programme provides a comprehensive overview of the measures adopted\r\nprior to the Council recommendation of 9 July. It also includes information on\r\nthe additional reforms launched by the time the Economic Partnership Programme\r\nwas submitted. However, these will be insufficient to address fiscal and\r\nstructural imbalances and little detail on planned reforms to further respond\r\nto the recommendation has been provided. The government proposal\r\nfor a pension reform will reduce the deficit of the pension system but will not\r\nsuffice to eliminate it by 2020, with notably schemes for state government\r\nofficials and employees working in a number of state-controlled companies still\r\nexpected to run significant deficits by that horizon and the underlying\r\nmacroeconomic scenario appearing too optimistic. The on-going spending\r\nreview has delivered only limited outcomes so far and it remains to be seen to\r\nwhat extent it will translate into sizeable savings. Whether the planned\r\ndecentralisation reform will improve coordination between local, regional and\r\nnational levels and bring significant savings for the general government as a\r\nwhole is also unclear. The Economic Partnership Programme provides\r\nlittle information on measures to tackle the projected medium- to long-term\r\nincrease in public expenditure on healthcare. Moreover, recent\r\ndecisions taken by the government in the area of taxation seem to go against the\r\nCouncil recommendation and create uncertainty about the government's strategy. Finally, the\r\nmeasures underpinning the government's commitment to reduce the cost of labour\r\nneed to be further specified. Overall, while the already legislated reforms are\r\nwelcome steps, further efforts to address fiscal and structural imbalances are\r\nrequired to effectively support a durable correction of the excessive deficit\r\nand the long-term sustainability of public finances. Therefore, France is\r\ninvited to submit additional information in the upcoming National Reform\r\nProgramme and Stability Programme on the reform efforts to increase the\r\nefficiency of public spending across all sub-sectors of general government and\r\nin particular to achieve better coordination and additional savings between\r\ncentral and local government levels. Measures to increase the\r\ncost-effectiveness of healthcare expenditure and to avoid that the projected\r\ndeficits of public sector worker pension schemes will weigh on the general\r\ngovernment deficit necessitate further explanation. More information is also\r\nneeded on the actions planned to further reduce the labour cost and more\r\ngenerally on the further structural reforms envisaged to increase the\r\nadjustment capacity of the economy and to boost potential growth. The\r\nCommission and the Council will monitor the implementation of the reforms in\r\nthe context of the European Semester. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 140, 27.5.2013 p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
