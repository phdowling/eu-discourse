The\nobjective was to achieve a legally binding Treaty making the legal trade in\nconventional arms more responsible, by setting high common international\nstandards on imports, exports and transfers.\nIntensive preparatory\nwork was carried out during 2007 and 2009, followed by a First United Nations\nConference on the ATT held in New York from 2 to 27 July 2012. Although the\nConference failed to reach a consensus, it delivered a first draft text. \nAt the last UN Conference, held in March\n2013, this draft Treaty was revised, but still no consensus could be reached\nwith three States rejecting the Chairs' proposal. The Treaty was finally adopted\nby qualified majority on 2 April 2013. The majority of UN Members agreed on 3\nJune 2013 as a designated date for opening the signature of the Treaty. \n1.2 EU\nCompetence\nIn accordance with the rules on external\ncompetence as laid down in Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU), the ATT concerns matters that fall under Union exclusive\ncompetence. \nThe ATT provides, inter alia, for\nmeasures (such as import and export controls), which fall within the scope of\nthe Union's Common Commercial Policy.\nIn this domain, ATT addresses areas of Union law where the degree of regulation\nhas already reached an advanced stage. Moreover, the following\nEU-secondary legislation related to the internal market is also of relevance:\na) Council Directive 2009/43/EC of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions\nof transfers of defence-related products within the Community, b) Council\nDirective 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and\npossession of weapons, c) Regulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 implementing Article 10 of the\nUnited Nations\u2019 Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking\nin firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms\nProtocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit\nmeasures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition.\nAs the ATT concerns matters of exclusive EU\ncompetence, Member States are not in a position to decide autonomously on the\nsignature of the Treaty. They can only do it, in the interest of the Union, after authorisation by the Council upon a proposal by the Commission.\n1.3 Details and\nScope of the ATT\nThe purpose of the ATT is to contribute to\ninternational and regional peace, security and stability by regulating the international\ntrade in conventional arms and eradicating the illicit arms trade. The ATT\ncreates standards for transfers of conventional weapons and requires State\nParties to review all arms exports to ensure conventional arms and munitions\nwill not be used inter alia in Human Rights abuses, terrorism and violations of\nHumanitarian law. \nThe ATT provides for the assessment of arms\ntransfers and measures to prevent the diversion of conventional arms from the\nimporting and exporting States. In addition, it enhances transparency in arms\ntrading by encouraging record keeping and reporting to the Secretariat and\nother State Parties. The provisions of the ATT cover conventional arms of the\nfollowing categories: battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery\nsystems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles and missile\nlaunchers and small arms and light weapons. The Treaty also covers the related ammunition/\nmunitions and parts and components. \n1.4\nImplications for the acquis communautaire \nThe ATT may affect or alter the scope of common rules adopted by the\nEuropean Union. As a result, the\nCouncil has established, in the Annex to its Decision \u2026/2013 authorising the\nCommission to negotiate the ATT on those matters falling under the competence\nof the Union, the following negotiating directives: \n(1)                   \nThe Arms Trade Treaty shall not contain any\nprovision preventing Member States to apply:\n(a)         \nCouncil Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on\ncontrol of the acquisition and possession of weapons, as amended;\n(b)         \nCouncil Directive 93/15/EEC of 5 April 1993 on\nthe harmonization of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and\nsupervision of explosives for civil uses, as amended;\n(c)         \nDirective 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers\nof defence-related products within the Community, as amended.\n(2)                   \nThe Arms Trade Treaty shall contain no provision\nrestricting the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within\nthe Union's internal market, unless the restriction is specifically justified\nby Articles 36, 45(3), 52(1), 65, or 346 TFEU.\n(3)                   \nAny measures provided in the Treaty which\nrestrict exports or imports from/into the Union, or transit through the\nterritory of the Union shall be compatible with any applicable provisions of\nUnion law, including in particular:\n(a)         \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 of 26\nFebruary 2009, on the common rules for imports; \n(b)         \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009, of 19\nOctober 2009, establishing common rules for exports;\n(c)         \nRegulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 implementing Article 10 of the\nUnited Nations\u2019 Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking\nin firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms\nProtocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit\nmeasures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition and\n(d)         \nDirective 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers\nof defence-related products within the Community, as amended.\nThese various European Union legal acts are\npart of the acquis and it is therefore essential that they are not put\nin question by the adoption of the ATT. In the absence of a RIO clause in the\nTreaty, it is particularly important to ensure that the internal market\nlegislation has been safeguarded. \nAccordingly, a detailed analysis was made,\nin line with the Council negotiating directives on these questions, and concluded\nthat the provisions of the ATT (Articles 6, 7, 9, 26) ensure that the ATT is\ncompatible with the acquis. In any case, any potential problem of\ncompatibility could be addressed through article 26 (1). This article foresees\nthat the implementation of the Treaty shall not prejudice obligations\nundertaken by States Parties with regard to existing or future international\nagreements, to which they are parties, where those obligations are consistent\nwith this Treaty. \nThe European Union cannot become a party to\nthe ATT, as the current text includes only State Parties. However, the ATT\nallows for amendments at a later stage and the European Union may become an ATT\nparty subject to a three quarters majority vote of the State Parties. \n1.5 Signing the\nTreaty\nThe European Union as such cannot sign the\nATT. However, as the ATT falls partly within the competence of the Union and partly within that of the Member States, it is necessary that the Union\ninstitutions and the Member States take all the measures to cooperate in\nsigning the ATT and to ensure the implementation of the commitments resulting\nfrom that Treaty.\nIn view of the intention of the Member\nStates to sign the ATT on June 3, 2013, it is necessary to give priority to the\npreparation and adoption of a Council Decision authorising Member States to\nsign the ATT. Once it is adopted, the Commission will propose a second Council\nDecision, on which the European Parliament has to give its consent, authorising\nMember States to ratify the Treaty.\n1.6 Conclusion\nIt is vital to\nfill the gap of the unregulated trade of conventional arms at an international\nlevel and to assist the development of peace-building and humanitarian efforts.\nThe ATT, by establishing common legally binding standards for the import,\nexport and transfer of conventional arms, makes the arms trade more responsible and transparent, an\nobjective shared by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\nIt has the potential to reinforce international peace\nand security at global level. The illegal, or poorly regulated, trade in\nconventional arms costs lives \u2013 more than 740,000 men, women and children die\neach year as a result of armed violence. The swift entry into force of the ATT\nis thus of utmost importance and it is therefore essential for Member States to\nsign the Treaty on June 3 2013, at the Solemn Ceremony. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 1\nDue to the impossibility of the EU to\nbecome party to the Treaty, the Article authorises Member States to sign the\ncurrent Treaty on a subject that concerns matters of exclusive competence of\nthe Union. \nArticle 2\nThe Article encourages EU Member States to\nsign the Treaty, if possible, on the specified date. As advocated by many\nMember States, signing on the said date is an important signal to underline the\ncommitment of the EU and its Member States to implement the ATT as soon as\npossible. Article 20 of the Arms Trade Treaty requires fifty States to ratify\nthe Treaty in order for it to be entered into force. The signing of the Treaty\nby all Member States would therefore constitute an important step towards this\naim.\nArticle 3\nThe purpose of the decision is to authorise\nthe Member States to be bound by the Treaty and so the decision is addressed to\nthem.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nNone\n2013/0146 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Member States to sign, in the\ninterests of the European Union, the Arms Trade Treaty\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and 207(3) in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n11 March 2013 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate the Arms Trade\nTreaty in the framework of the United Nations on those matters coming under the\nexclusive competence of the Union. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\n2 April 2013 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the text of the\nArms Trade Treaty[1].\nThe General Assembly also invited State Parties to open the signing of the\nTreaty with a Solemn Ceremony on 3 June 2013.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nobject of this Treaty is to provide the highest possible common international\nstandards for regulating the international trade in conventional arms and to\nprevent and eradicate illicit trafficking in conventional arms.
