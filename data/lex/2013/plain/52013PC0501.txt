Micro- and\nnanoelectronics, and smart embedded components and systems are priority fields\nidentified within the ICT theme in Horizon 2020.\nIn order to better align EU support for research\nand innovation with industrial goals and attract higher industrial investments\nin Europe, Horizon 2020 provides for the setting-up of public-private\npartnerships in key areas where research and innovation could contribute to Europe\u2019s wider competitiveness goals and help tackle societal challenges.\nThis new proposal for\na public-private partnership (PPP) relates to a Joint\nUndertaking (JU) in the field of electronic components and systems. The ECSEL (\u2018Electronic\nComponents and Systems for European Leadership\u2019) JU replaces the previous ENIAC[2] and ARTEMIS[3] JUs respectively in the fields\nof nanoelectronics and embedded systems launched under the Seventh Framework Programme[4]. It is put forward in the context of the Multiannual\nFinancial Framework[5],\nthe Commission\u2019s proposal for Horizon 2020, the Commission Communication \u2018Partnering\nin Research and Innovation\u2019[6],\nthe Innovation Union Flagship Initiative[7],\nthe Commission Communication on Key Enabling Technologies[8] \u2018A European strategy for Key\nEnabling Technologies \u2014 A bridge to growth and jobs\u2019, and the Commission Communication \u2018A European\nstrategy for micro- and nanoelectronics components and systems\u2019[9]. The\nproposal is also in line with the Commission Communication \u2018Public-private partnerships, in Horizon\n2020: a powerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe\u2019[10].\n\u00b7                        \nRationale and objectives of a Joint\nUndertaking in the area of electronic components and systems\nApart from being a significant industry\nwith more than EUR 1000 billion of turn over world-wide, electronic components\nand embedded systems are at the origin of most productivity improvements across\nthe whole of the economy and have a key role in addressing societal challenges.\nDespite strong presence in important vertical markets (automotive, energy,\npayment systems, etc.), the electronic components and systems industry in Europe is facing major challenges that will impact the whole economy. \nMore specifically, Europe is facing two\nmain challenges in electronic components and systems. One is to be in control\nof the key elements of the value chain, (i.e. design, manufacturing and integration\nin final products), that are essential to ensure the sustainability of value\ncreation from electronics in Europe including the competitiveness of many other\nEuropean industrial sectors (automotive, energy, health, web industry, etc.).\nThe other is to bridge important gaps in the innovation chains in order to\nbetter transform research excellence into commercial successes. \nIn addressing the above challenges Europe must cope with fierce global competition, declining market shares of its industry,\nhigh costs of research and innovation and fast-paced technology development.\nIn that context, a Joint Undertaking in the\narea of electronic components and systems will aim at:\n\u00b7              \nensuring the security of supply of key\ntechnologies underpinning innovation in all major sectors of the economy, and ensuring\nthat Europe can make the best use of these technologies to spur economic growth\ngenerally;\n\u00b7              \nsupporting EU policies, the environment and\nindustrial competitiveness as embodied in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart,\nsustainable and inclusive growth;\n\u00b7              \novercoming obstacles to effective research and\ninnovation in this area, including high risks, high cost of R&D and market\nfailures. Public support is needed to leverage private investments;\n\u00b7              \naligning strategies with Member States to attract\nprivate investment and to contribute to sound public finances by avoiding\nunnecessary duplication of efforts and fragmentation, and easing participation\nfor actors involved in research and innovation;\n\u00b7              \npushing industry to set a long-term strategic research\nand innovation agenda, create the necessary critical mass, leverage private\ninvestment, facilitate knowledge sharing, reduce risks, lower costs and reduce\ntime to market.\nIn particular, the specific objectives of\nthis new Joint Undertaking are:\n\u00b7              \nto maintain and grow semiconductor and smart\nsystems manufacturing capability in Europe including leadership in\nmanufacturing equipment and materials processing;\n\u00b7              \nto secure a leading position in design and\nsystems engineering including embedded technologies;\n\u00b7              \nto provide access for all stakeholders to a\nworld-class infrastructure for the design and manufacture of electronic\ncomponents and embedded and smart systems; \n\u00b7              \nto foster the development of ecosystems\ninvolving innovative SMEs, strengthening existing clusters and nurturing the\ncreation of new clusters in promising new areas.\n\u00b7                        \nBuilding on past experience\nThe proposed Joint\nUndertaking builds upon the achievements of previous JUs\n(ENIAC and ARTEMIS) under the Seventh Framework Programme. Both JUs aimed at creating\na Europe-wide research and development programme in the fields of\nnanoelectronics and embedded systems with an incentive for industry, Member States and the European Union to align strategies and increase investments. They\nprovided a major opportunity to cooperate across Europe, create critical mass\nand leverage investments. The JUs demonstrated that they can successfully play\nthe role of an honest broker, and be a catalyst for ambitious projects\nincreasing the engagement of the private sector champions in a framework in\nwhich national and European public authorities can support topics of high\nstrategic value. This capability has been convincingly demonstrated by the\nENIAC JU\u2019s success in jump-starting the implementation of the KET\nrecommendations in nanoelectronics and by the ARTEMIS JU\u2019s first launch of\nlarge-scale innovation Pilot Projects. In the period 2008-2012 a total\nresearch, development and innovation investment of EUR 2.8 billion was realised\nby some 2000 participants of which over 500 are SMEs. \nThese JUs involve the private sector,\nnational authorities and European authorities. One important challenge of this\ntri-partite construction consisted in aligning procedures and content with the\nexpectations and processes of the participating Member States.\nThe first and second interim evaluations of\nthe ARTEMIS and ENIAC JUs strongly recommended continuing a similar initiative\nunder Horizon 2020, considering that no single organisation or Member State could possibly address all the challenges of this sector. Therefore, a\ncoordinated action at European level is deemed the most appropriate way forward.\nThe experience with the current model shows\nthat it has been able to meet the objectives, albeit with a steeper learning\ncurve than anticipated, during which confidence and a practical modus operandi\nhad to be built up.\nBesides the successes mentioned above, there\nare some observations to be made on the present set-up:\n\u00b7              \nThere is a lack of synchronisation between the\nvarious national procedures (for both contracting and payments), creating\ndelays in the implementation of projects.\n\u00b7              \nThe obligation for the participants to conclude\ntwo grant agreements based on different rules (JU and national) constitutes an\nadministrative burden.\n\u00b7              \nThe differing national rules have an impact on the\nway consortia are built.\n\u00b7              \nThe rigid dependency between EU and national\ncommitments (ratio contributions as imposed by the Council Regulation MS/EU\n1.8) has hampered budget execution.\n\u00b7              \nThe requirements of the Framework Financial Regulation\nfor decentralised agencies put significant constraints on the limited resources\nof the JU.\nThose difficulties did not hold things up\nbut required continuous efforts by all parties to make the system work. The future\ninitiative will greatly benefit from a simplified operating model in line with\nthe overall goal of simplification under Horizon 2020. The\nproposal for the new Joint Undertaking includes provisions aiming at\nsimplification and flexibility of operations.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7                        \nResults of consultation\nStakeholders consider the two existing Joint\nUndertakings in ICT as being of high value. The public consultation showed that\nthe JUs helped addressing key bottlenecks in their respective domains and\ncontributed to an increase of European competitiveness.\nThe current ENIAC and ARTEMIS JUs involve\nindustrial stakeholders (both large companies and SMEs) and the research\ncommunity (research and knowledge-dissemination organisations) from across Europe. Member States are directly involved in the governance structures and contribute\nfinancially. The industrial and research communities are represented through\nthe industrial associations AENEAS and ARTEMIS-IA.\nThe consultations show that all actors are\nmotivated and committed to the JTIs. According to industry, the JTIs have helped\nin bringing together relevant stakeholders and facilitated cooperation in the\nimplementation of strategic research agendas. The JTIs pool private resources\nand public funds from Member States and the European Union.\nFor the new JTI, all stakeholders strongly\nsupport the following two main objectives:\n\u00b7              \nAchieve critical mass by pooling public and\nprivate resources; and\n\u00b7              \nProvide public support for large-scale\ndemonstrators and pilots.\nCooperation on innovation across value\nchains throughout Europe and closer to the market should be supported. The\ndesign of complex electronic components and systems should be covered as well\nas manufacturing and technology development.\nMember States insist on the most effective\nspending of public money in the interests of their national industry and\nresearch community. All participating Member States acknowledge the importance\nof a strong industry in electronic components and systems for their national\neconomy. Member States are willing to consider participation in a tripartite\nmodel, when the level of funding requires pooling of resources and stronger\nalignment of strategies at regional, national and EU levels.\nSome Member States recognise the\ndifficulties currently faced by participants, notably through the application\nof national eligibility criteria and the lack of synchronisation and alignment\nof national contracting and funding terms. Differences in national agreements\ncreate different conditions of participation and lead to some inefficiencies.\nThese difficulties were reported by stakeholders in connection with the\ntripartite model for the JTI.\nFor SMEs ease of participation is of\nparamount importance. They strongly favour more targeted support, an opinion\nthat is shared by the participating Member States.\nThe need for multi-annual financial perspectives\nfrom the Member States for the operations of the JU is equally highlighted by\nmany stakeholders.\nThe various opinions were taken into\naccount when designing the new JTI in electronic components and systems\nalthough the modus operandi of the JU as a one-stop shop was not equally supported\nby all Member States.\n\u00b7                        \nImpact assessment\nThe\nproposed Regulation has been subject to a Commission impact assessment which is\nattached to the proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7                        \nSummary of the proposed action\nThe proposal consists of a Council\nRegulation setting up the ECSEL Joint Undertaking and defining its objectives,\nlegal status, operational rules and statutes for the period 2014-2024 (up to\n2020 for financial programming). The ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings were\nestablished respectively in the fields of nanoelectronics and embedded computing\nsystems by Council Regulations (EC) No 72/2008 and No 74/2008 of 20 December\n2007. These are to be repealed with effect from the entry into force of the new\nJU.\n\u00b7                        \nLegal basis\nThe legal basis of the proposal is Article\n187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nThe Rules for Participation and\nDissemination of Horizon 2020 will apply. However, given a specific operational\nneed of this initiative, a derogation from these Rules is necessary.\nNevertheless, this specific derogation is not included in the present proposal\nat this stage, in order not to prejudice the inter-institutional discussions\nconcerning the appropriate legal basis/procedural modalities for their\nadoption, which are still pending in the context of the legislative works\nconcerning the Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament\nand of the Council laying down the Rules for Participation and dissemination in\nHorizon 2020 (COM(2011) 0810 - 2011/0399 (COD). The specific derogation will be\nintroduced at a later stage in view of the outcome of the abovementioned\ndiscussions.\nThe applicability of State aid rules\nrequires derogating from Regulation (EU) No \u2026 [Rules for the participation and\ndissemination in Horizon 2020] with regard to the single funding rate per\naction. Due to the co-funding by Member States, the State aid rules with their\nspecific provisions on aid intensities depending on the type of participants\nand the type of activities apply to the public aid granted by the Joint\nUndertaking. \n\u00b7                        \nSubsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies insofar\nas the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Union.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States individually for the following\nreasons.\n\u00b7              \nThe sizeable challenges facing Europe\u2019s industry\nand economy require a substantial investment that represents a major effort for\nany one Member State to take on by its own. As a result, individual Member\nStates, whatever the size of their economy, hesitate to engage in research and\ninnovation, or delay investments that are essential for attracting further private\ninvestment and building Europe\u2019s capacity to innovate and compete. By combining\nresources from regional, national and EU levels, Europe can quickly react to,\nand anticipate the demand for, high investments as evidenced by the 2012 calls for\nproposals in respect of the ENIAC JTI. This call supported a set of\nmanufacturing pilot lines in key domains for Europe\u2019s industries.\n\u00b7              \nEurope has high-quality\nspecialised technology and industrial clusters in micro and nanoelectronics\ncomponents and smart and embedded systems. Innovation and competitive products\nand services are increasingly stemming from multi-disciplinary research and\ninnovation activities and from alliances and partnerships along the value chain\nfrom semiconductor development up to embedded software and networked\napplications. If no new initiative is launched at EU level fragmentation of the\nresearch and innovation landscape will increase in Europe. Without a focused\nand coherent programme Europe\u2019s contribution to electronic components and\nsystems would consist of a set of scattered and unstructured local efforts.\nProgress will be held back by lack of coordination of industrial R&D\nobjectives, duplication of effort, unnecessary bureaucracy, and suboptimal use\nof limited research funding. Therefore, action by individual Member States is\nnot sufficient to meet the challenges faced by the electronic components and\nsystems industry. No single national mechanism will be able to gather all the\nnecessary expertise and financial means to take a strong position in the\nworldwide competitive market.\nEU-level action will better achieve the desired\nobjectives for several reasons. A European public-private partnership will\nleverage the financial and technical means that are essential to master the\ncomplexity of the ever escalating pace of innovation in this area. It will have\na focusing effect on the European, national and industrial priorities. It will\ncombine the strengths of transnational and European programmes. The adoption of\na simplified modus operandi should allow for a shorter time-to-grant and avoid\nadditional red tape for participants.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle.\n\u00b7                        \nProportionality principle\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the provisions of this Regulation do not go beyond what is\nnecessary to achieve its objectives.\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons. The proposed Joint\nUndertaking is the only simple option that overcomes the constraints and satisfies\nthe requirements for achieving the objectives of the action. It is a structure\nthat is durable over time, has legal personality and provides a clear legal\nframework for the collaboration and participation of actors involved in\nresearch and innovation, national authorities and the EU in a public-private\npartnership. The participation of all stakeholders is of paramount importance.\nAs the initiative focuses on industrial objectives of great significance for\neconomic competitiveness, industrial participation is essential to help shape\nthe research priorities and innovation policies. The involvement of Member\nStates is needed to mobilise national funding that constitutes the bulk of the\npublic research and innovation spending in the area. Finally, the EU has a key\nrole to play in driving the integration process, balancing the different interests\nof the partners, and adequately monitoring the use of its financial\ncontribution.\nThe proposed action will achieve the\nnecessary integration at EU level while providing flexibility for participation\nby individual Member States. Decision-making power on the use of national financial\ncontributions is kept at the national level. The Joint Undertaking will\nestablish a lean structure for decision-making and financial and administrative\noperations. It will be particularly cost-effective as its administrative costs\nare expected to be around 3% of the overall EU contribution to the research and\ninnovation activities to be launched by the Joint Undertaking.\n\u00b7                        \nChoice of instrument\nProposed instrument: Regulation\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason: the creation of a Joint Undertaking in which the European Union\nparticipates requires a Council Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION\nThe budgetary assessment to be contributed\nby DG CONNECT from its budget for Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies\nindicates maximum EU expenditure of EUR 1 215 255 000[11] [12] (EFTA included) over the total\nlifetime of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking (up to 2024), which would need to be committed\nbefore 31 December 2020, when the budget for Horizon 2020 comes to an end, and\npaid by 31 December 2024.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL\nELEMENTS\n\u00b7                        \nSimplification\nA simplified operating model is proposed to\naddress the practical difficulties experienced by participants with the current\nJUs such as the variety of national rules and practices leading to significant\ndifferences in treating individual participants. It is proposed that the new JU\nmay act for the Member States in making grant agreements/payments instead of\nnational administrations just like it does for the EU contribution. This will allow\nthe JU to act as a one-stop shop and ensure synchronisation of funding to all\nparticipants. It is also proposed to harmonise the public funding rates (from\nEU and national sources) for all participants.\n\u00b7                        \nEuropean interest\nHaving a leading-edge electronics\ncomponents and systems industry in Europe is of strong European interest as it\nwill supply the enabling electronics technologies that foster innovation in a very\nwide range of businesses across the economy from automotive and aerospace to\nenergy, health equipment, home appliances and all types of industrial\nmanufacturing processes. In this respect, the objectives and scope of the ECSEL\nJoint Undertaking will be precise on the technology tracks to follow and\neconomic goals to reach, the open and fair selection criteria for participants,\nthe industry engagement in investments and creating jobs and the relevant\ngovernance and implementation modalities. The public aids provided to the\nactivities of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking will improve the European Union\u2019s\nsituation regarding research and innovation in the international context. They\nwill benefit the full value chain of the electronics components and systems\nindustry in Europe including many SMEs, but also the wider economic actors\nthrough the spill-overs generated. The Commission might consider, upon\nnotification of the Member State or group of Member States concerned, that the\nECSEL Joint Undertaking's initiatives qualify as important projects of common\nEuropean interest, provided all relevant conditions are met.\n2013/0234 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non the ECSEL Joint Undertaking \n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 187 and the first\nparagraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[13],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[14],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public-private\npartnerships in the form of Joint Technology Initiatives were initially provided\nfor in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European\nCommunity for research, technological development and demonstration activities\n(2007-2013)[15].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2006/971/EC\nof 19 December 2006 concerning the Specific Programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019\nimplementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[16] identified specific\npublic-private partnerships to be supported, including public-private\npartnerships in the specific areas of the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Technology\nInitiatives.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe 2020 Strategy[17] underscores the need to\ndevelop favourable conditions for investment in knowledge and innovation so as\nto achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Union. Both European\nParliament and Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 establishing Horizon\n2020 \u2014 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[18] aims to achieve a greater\nimpact on research and innovation by combining Horizon 2020 Framework Programme\nand private-sector funds in public-private partnerships in key areas where research\nand innovation can contribute to the Union\u2019s wider competitiveness goals and\nhelp tackle societal challenges. Union involvement in those partnerships may\ntake the form of financial contributions to joint undertakings established on\nthe basis of Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\nunder Decision No 1982/2006/EC.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nDecision (EU) No [\u2026]/2013 of the Council of [\u2026] 2013 establishing the Specific\nProgramme implementing Horizon 2020 (2014-2020)[19] further support should be\nprovided to Joint Undertakings established under Decision No 1982/2006/EC under\nthe conditions specified in Decision (EU) No [\u2026]/2013. The Industrial\nLeadership priority targets two specific activity lines under Information and\nCommunication Technologies: \"micro- and nanoelectronics\", and \"a\nnew generation of components and systems, engineering of advanced and smart\nembedded components and systems\". Embedded computing systems (ARTEMIS) and\nnanoelectronics (ENIAC) should be combined into a single initiative.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\nCommunication \u2018A European strategy for Key Enabling Technologies \u2014 A bridge to\ngrowth and jobs\"[20]\nidentifies key enabling technologies (hereinafter \u2018KET\u2019), which include micro-\nand nanoelectronics, as indispensable sources of innovation. There is currently\na gap between basic knowledge generation and its subsequent commercialisation\ninto goods and services. This needs to be tackled inter alia through a focused\neffort on pilot manufacturing lines and innovation pilot projects, including\nthose of larger scale, for achieving technology and product validation under\nindustrial conditions, and more integration and cross-fertilisation between the\nvarious KETs.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the\nCommission Communication \u2018A European strategy for micro- and nanoelectronics\ncomponents and systems\u2019[21],\nmicro- and nanoelectronics components and systems underpin innovation and\ncompetitiveness of all major economic sectors. The importance of the area and\nthe challenges faced by the stakeholders in the Union require urgent action in\norder to leave no weak link in Europe\u2019s innovation and value chains. It is thus\nproposed to set up a mechanism at Union level to combine and focus support to research\nand innovation in electronic components and systems by Member States, the Union and the private sector.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of regaining a\nleading position in the nanoelectronics eco-system for Europe, the industrial\nand research stakeholders have proposed a strategic research and innovation\nprogramme with a total investment of EUR 100 billion up to the year 2020,\naiming at increasing Europe\u2019s nanoelectronics-based worldwide revenues by over\nEUR 200 billion per year and creating an additional 250 000 direct and\ninduced jobs in Europe.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u2018Electronic\nComponents and Systems\u2019 encompasses the areas of micro- and nanoelectronics,\nembedded/cyber-physical and smart integrated systems and applications.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ENIAC Joint Undertaking\nset up by Council Regulation (EC) No 72/2008 of 20 December 2007[22] successfully implemented a research\nagenda strengthening the relevant areas in nanoelectronics in which Europe improved its competitiveness by leveraging investments in priority subjects and by\nengaging the whole ecosystem.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ARTEMIS Joint Undertaking\nset up by Council Regulation (EC) No 74/2008 of 20 December 2007 on the\nestablishment of the \u2018ARTEMIS Joint Undertaking\u2019 to implement a Joint\nTechnology Initiative in Embedded Computing Systems[23] has successfully demonstrated its\nstrategic positioning which combines top-down guidance with bottom-up\ndefinition of the technical issues to be addressed, attracting projects with\noutcomes directly relevant for industry.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interim evaluations of\nthe ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings have shown that they are useful and\nadapted tools to combine forces and have significant impact in their respective\ndomains. The research areas covered by the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings\nshould therefore continue to be supported in order to further improve the\ncompetitiveness of the electronic components and systems industry in Europe and focus the efforts on a set of strategic activities commonly agreed among the\nprivate and public stakeholders engaged in the initiatives.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continued support for the\nnanoelectronics and embedded computing systems research programmes should build\non the experience acquired from the operations of the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint\nUndertakings including the results of their interim evaluations, the\nstakeholders\u2019 recommendations and the need to achieve effective coordination\nand synergy of resources.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is increased\ninteraction between the stakeholders of the European Technology Platforms ARTEMIS,\nENIAC and EPoSS (the European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration)\nas detailed in the High Level Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the\nICT Components and Systems Industries which they released in 2012. In order to\nbest capture and build on the synergies stemming from these interactions, it is\nnecessary to set up a single Joint Undertaking (hereinafter the \u2018ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking\u2019) covering electronic components and systems including the previous\nactivities of the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings and using a more fit-for-purpose\nstructure and rules in order to enhance efficiency and to ensure simplification.\nTo this effect, the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should adopt financial rules\nspecific to its needs in accordance with Article 209 of Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\nOctober 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union[24].\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of the high\nlevel strategic research and innovation agenda put forward by the industrial\nstakeholders relies on several sources of support: national, regional and\nintergovernmental programmes, Union Framework Programme and a Joint Technology\nInitiative in the form of a public-private partnership.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The public-private\npartnership on electronic components and systems should combine the financial\nand technical means that are essential to master the complexity of the ever\nescalating pace of innovation in this area. Therefore, the members of the ECSEL\nJoint Undertaking should be the Union, Member States and Associated Countries\nto the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (hereinafter \u2018Associated Countries\u2019) on\na voluntary basis, and associations as private members representing their\nconstituent companies and other organisations active in the field of electronic\ncomponents and systems in Europe. The ECSEL Joint Undertaking should be open to\nnew members.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECSEL Joint Undertaking\nshould address clearly defined topics that would enable the European industries\nat large to design, manufacture and use the most innovative technologies in\nelectronic components and systems. A structured and coordinated financial\nsupport at European level is necessary to help maintain research teams and\nEuropean industries at the leading edge in a highly competitive international\ncontext, ensure the fast and broad industrial exploitation of technology\nleadership across Europe generating important spill-overs for society, share\nrisk-taking and join forces by aligning strategies and investments towards a\ncommon European interest. The Commission might consider, upon notification of\nthe Member State or group of Member States concerned, that the ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking's initiatives qualify as important projects of common European\ninterest, provided all relevant conditions are met.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The private associations AENEAS,\nARTEMISIA and EPoSS have expressed in writing their agreement for the research\nand innovation activities in the area of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking to be\npursued within a structure well adapted to the nature of a public-private\npartnership. It is appropriate that the private associations accept the\nStatutes set out in the Annex to this Regulation by means of a letter of\nendorsement.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve its\nobjectives, the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should provide financial support mainly\nin the form of grants to participants following open and competitive calls for proposals.\nSuch financial support must be targeted at proven market failures that prevent\nthe development of the programme concerned and must have an incentive effect in\nthat it changes the behaviour of the recipient.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to maintain a\nlevel playing field for all undertakings active in the internal market, funding\nprovided by the Union Framework Programme should be designed in accordance with\nState aid rules so as to ensure the effectiveness of public spending and\nprevent market distortions such as crowding-out of private funding, creating\nineffective market structures or preserving inefficient firms.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participation in indirect\nactions funded by the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should comply with Regulation\n(EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 laying\ndown the rules for the participation and dissemination in \"Horizon 2020 \u2013\nthe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)\"[25]. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union\u2019s financial\ncontribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound\nfinancial management and with the relevant rules on indirect management set out\nin Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Commission Delegated Regulation\n(EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation\n(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[26].\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audits of recipients of Union\nfunds under this Regulation should be carried out in such a manner that\nadministrative burden is reduced, in compliance with Regulation (EU) No\n[\u2026]/2013 [the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme].\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial interests of\nthe Union and of the other members of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should be\nprotected by proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including\nthe prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of\nfunds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate,\nadministrative and financial penalties in accordance with Regulation (EU,\nEuratom) No 966/2012.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission's internal\nauditor should exercise the same powers over the ECSEL Joint Undertaking as\nthose exercised in respect of the Commission.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n287(1) of the Treaty, the constituent instrument of bodies, offices or agencies\nset up by the Union may preclude the examination of the accounts of all revenue\nand expenditure of those bodies, offices or agencies by the Court of Auditors. In\naccordance with Article 60(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the\naccounts of the bodies under Article 209 of that Regulation are to be examined\nby an independent audit body which is to give an opinion inter alia on the\nreliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying\ntransactions. Avoidance of duplication of the examination of the accounts\njustifies that the accounts of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking should not be\nsubject to examination by the Court of Auditors.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the principles\nof subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union, the objectives of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking in strengthening\nindustrial research and innovation across the Union cannot be sufficiently\nachieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of avoiding\nduplication, retaining critical mass and ensuring that public financing is used\nin an optimal way, be better achieved by the Union. This Regulation confines\nitself to the minimum required in order to achieve those objectives and does\nnot go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint\nUndertakings were set up for a period up to 31 December 2017. The transition\nfrom the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings to the ECSEL Joint Undertaking\nshould be aligned and synchronized with the transition from the Seventh\nFramework Programme to the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme to ensure optimal\nuse of the funding available for research. In the interest of legal certainty\nand clarity, Council Regulations (EC) No 72/2008 and No 74/2008 should\ntherefore be repealed and transitional provisions should be set out.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To implement the Joint\nTechnology Initiative on \u2018Electronic Components and Systems for European\nLeadership\u2019, a Joint Undertaking within the meaning of Article 187 of the\nTreaty on the functioning of the European Union (hereinafter \u2018ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking\u2019) is hereby established for a period up to 31 December 2024.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking shall replace and succeed the ENIAC and ARTEMIS Joint Undertakings as\noriginally established by Regulations (EC) Nos 72/2008 and 74/2008.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking shall constitute a body entrusted with the implementation of a public-private\npartnership referred to in Article 209 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECSEL Joint\nUndertaking shall have legal personality.

for the\nproposal/initiative\n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\nthe short or long term\nEurope is facing two main challenges in the field\nof electronic components and systems:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need to be in control of the key elements of the value\nchain, i.e. \u2018components and systems design\u2019, \u2018components manufacturing\u2019, and \u2018integration\nof electronic components into final products\u2019. The electronics value chain does\nnot stop at the electronics production level but extends to the whole user\nindustry from automotive to aerospace up to web-based services. Each of its\nelements is essential to ensure sustainability of value creation from\nelectronics in Europe. In particular, if Europe loses its electronics\nmanufacturing capacity, not only the relevant supply chain and design activity may\nshift outside Europe but the competitiveness of the whole economic fabric that depends\non electronics will be seriously undermined.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other is related to improving the efficiency of Europe\u2019s innovation chain as highlighted by the KET report which identified a \u2018Valley of\ndeath\u2019 between basic knowledge generation and the subsequent commercialisation\nof this knowledge in marketable products. Therefore, the steps to innovation\nand industrial production need to be strengthened in order for businesses and\ncitizens to benefit from leading-edge technologies.\nTo ensure control of the value chain and improve its innovation\nsystem, Europe needs to overcome the following difficulties:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fierce global competition and changing business models;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 declining market shares;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 high costs of research and innovation and fragmented\nEuropean landscape; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fast-paced innovation.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nFinancial support to collaborative research and innovation involving\nindustry and academia across Europe is needed in order to:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keep European public research teams at the forefront of\nelectronics and ensure fast and wide industrial exploitation of technology\nleadership across Europe.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Share the costs of risk-taking with the electronic\ncomponents and systems industry in progressing the technology and its widespread\nuse given the huge spill-over effect on growth and jobs across the economy and\nthe impact on addressing the societal challenges ahead.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Join forces. Member States have their own priorities in promoting\ntheir industry but the level of support needed for this industry is beyond\ntheir individual resources. Fragmentation tends to lead to duplication in research and innovation efforts.\nFurthermore only a few world-leading clusters with significant industrial\nactivity in electronic components and embedded systems exist in Europe. Hence EU players need to join forces. Better cooperation based on collaborative user\ncompanies and technology providers accelerate the product innovation on both\nsides by coordinating business focus, while research projects clusters provide\na regional support network for SMEs through cooperation between academia and\nlarge OEMs industry.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reinforce the existing European clusters in electronic\ncomponents and actively supporting the creation of new clusters so as to place Europe on a comparable footing with other players worldwide. There is a need for action at\nthe European level in order to pool resources and bring actors together, to\nprovide the right level of scope and means to strengthen the industry. This\nsupport needs to provide a sustainable and adequate solution for Europe to face up to international competition. This action will help in sharing existing\nand future platforms geared towards a better environment for industrial actors,\nincluding SMEs and end-users, to reinforce their international competitiveness.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structure and coordinate research and innovation in Europe,\nto ensure that in the future there will be a manufacturing base in Europe and that European actors, including users, have access to the latest technology\ndevelopments and infrastructures. To reach this goal, it is critical to\neffectively leverage public funding at European and national levels.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe current ENIAC and ARTEMIS JUs provided a major opportunity to\ncooperate across Europe, create critical mass and leverage investments. Their\nfirst interim evaluation strongly recommended continuing a similar initiative\nunder Horizon 2020, considering that no single organisation or Member State could possibly address all the challenges of this sector. Therefore, a\ncoordinated action at European level is deemed the most appropriate approach.\nThe JUs have demonstrated that they can successfully play the role\nof an honest broker, of a catalyst stimulating ambitious projects and\nincreasing the engagement of the private sector champions, while providing a\nframework in which the national and European public authorities can provide\nsupport for the strategically relevant topics. This capability has been\nconvincingly demonstrated by the ENIAC JU\u2019s success in jump-starting the\nimplementation of the KET recommendations in nanoelectronics and by the ARTEMIS\nJU\u2019s first trial of large Innovation Pilot Projects within their call for\nproposals in 2012.\nRegarding the tripartite construction of both JUs, one important\nchallenge consists in aligning content and procedure with the expectations and\nprocesses of the participating Member States. They enable the calls for\nproposals by pre-committing their financial contributions and determining\nnational eligibility conditions and funding rates.\nThe experience with the current model shows that it has been able to\nmeet the objectives, albeit with a steeper learning curve than expected, due to\nthe lengthy phase in which confidence and practical modus operandi had to be\nbuilt up.\nBesides the successes mentioned above, there are some observations\nto be made about the present set-up:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a lack of synchronisation between the variety of national\nprocedures (for both contracting and payments), creating delays in the\nimplementation of projects.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligation for the participants to conclude two grant\nagreements (JU + national) constitutes an administrative burden.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The variety of national rules affect the way consortia are\nbuilt.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National commitments are often adjusted after knowing the\nresults of the calls for proposals, and this is happening in both up and down\ndirections.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rigid dependency between EU and national commitments (ratio\nMS/EU 1.8) hampered budget execution when national involvement was low or when\nthe national funding rates were deviating from the anticipated\n1/3(JU)-2/3(national) ratio, as happened for the pilot lines.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements of the Framework Financial Regulation\napplicable to decentralised agencies are putting significant constraints on the\nlimited resources of the JU.\nThose difficulties did not hold things up but required continuous\nefforts by all parties to make the system work. Any future similar initiative\nwould greatly benefit from addressing them through a simplified operating\nmodel, which would also be in line with the overall goal of Horizon 2020.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe initiative is intended to develop synergies with complementary\nfunding mechanisms, including the European Commission\u2019s smart specialisation\npolicy aimed at fostering and supporting existing and new science and\ntechnology clusters in regions of the European Union.\nThe scope of the initiative is also complementing the activities envisaged\nunder Industrial Leadership within Horizon 2020 where more advanced, longer-term\nresearch will be supported.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [01/01]2014 to 31/12/2024\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020 for commitment appropriations\nand 2014 to 2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged\nFrom 2014 budget\n\u00a8 Direct management by the Commission through:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u00a8 Shared management with Member States:\n\u00fe Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 international organisations and their agencies (please specify);\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 the European Investment Bank;\n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 bodies referred to in Article 209 FR;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to\nthe extent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and identified in the relevant basic\nact.\nComments\nMember\nStates are co-funding indirect actions.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\nrules\nBy 31 December 2017, the Commission will conduct an interim\nevaluation of the Joint Undertaking and will communicate the conclusions\nthereof, accompanied by its observations, to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil by 30 June 2018.\nWithin six months of the winding up of the Joint Undertaking, but no\nlater than two years after the decision to wind it up, the Commission will\nconduct a final evaluation of the Joint Undertaking. The results of the final\nevaluation will be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council.\nBy 15 February of each year, the Executive Director will present to\nthe Governing Board for approval a draft annual activity report on the progress\nmade by the Joint Undertaking in the previous calendar year, in particular in\nrelation to the work plan for that year. The report will include information on\nthe research performed, innovation and other actions and the corresponding\nexpenditure; the proposals submitted, with a breakdown by participant type,\nincluding SMEs, and by country; the indirect actions selected for funding, with\na breakdown by participant type, including SMEs, and by country, and indicating\nthe contribution of the Joint Undertaking to the individual participants and\nactions.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\nsystem\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified\nThe main risk identified is incorrect payment of expenditure to participants.\nConsidering the size of the Joint Undertaking, a 1% error rate is a realistic\ntarget.\nThe specific risk of conflicts of interest inherent to a\nPublic-Private Partnership is addressed by a clear separation of decision\npowers between the Governing Board - setting the strategy and the work plans\n(involving industry) - and the Public Authorities Board - determining the\nconditions for the calls for proposals and deciding on the allocation of public\nfunding (without industrial involvement).\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\nThe Commission's internal auditor shall exercise the same powers\nover the Joint Undertaking as those exercised in respect of the Commission.\nMoreover, the Governing Board may arrange, as appropriate, for the\nestablishment of an internal audit capability of the Joint Undertaking. The cost\nof an internal audit function (expected to be less than half a million euros for\nthe Joint Undertaking over its lifetime) will be beneficial in proportion to\nthe total payments handled by the Joint Undertaking (an error rate of 1% on EUR\n1.2 billion represents EUR 12 million).\nIn compliance with Article 60 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No\n966/2012, the Joint Undertaking will respect the principles of sound financial\nmanagement, transparency and non-discrimination and will guarantee a level of\nprotection of the financial interests of its members equivalent to that\nrequired under that Regulation.\nEx-post audits of expenditure on indirect actions will be carried\nout in compliance with the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme as part of the\nHorizon 2020 Framework Programme indirect actions.\nIn order to protect the financial interests of the Union, the\nCommission will in compliance with the Financial Regulation supervise the\nactivities of the Joint Undertaking, in particular by carrying out audits and\nevaluations on the programme implementation, apply procedures for the\nexamination and acceptance of the accounts and exclude from Union financing expenditure\ndisbursements which have been made in breach of the applicable rules. It may\nalso suspend and interrupt payments.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\nand irregularities\nThe Commission or its representatives and the Court of Auditors have\nthe power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot, over all grant\nbeneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who receive EU funds.\nThe European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot\nchecks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly\nby such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation\n(Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 with a view to establishing whether there has been\nfraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial\ninterests of the European Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant\ndecision or a contract concerning EU funding.\nWithout prejudice to the above, grant agreements and grant decisions\nand contracts resulting from the implementation of this Regulation shall\nexpressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct\nsuch audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\n\u00b7      New budget lines requested\nIn order of multiannual financial framework\nheadings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number 09 04 02 01 \u2013 mother line || Diff./non-diff. || from EFTA countries || from candidate countries || from third countries || within the meaning of Article 18(1)(a) of the Financial Regulation \n 1a Competitiveness for growth and jobs || 09 04 07 21 Industrial leadership -
