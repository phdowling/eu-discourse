The objectives of such agreements are to give all\nEuropean Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the\nEuropean Union and third countries, and to bring bilateral air service\nagreements between Member States and third countries in line with the law of\nthe Union.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nInternational aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services\nagreements between Member States and third countries, the Annexes to such\nagreements and other related bilateral or multilateral arrangements.\nTraditional designation clauses in Member\nStates\u2019 bilateral air services agreements infringe the law of the Union. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or\nauthorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but\nthat is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State\nor its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against European\nUnion carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and\ncontrolled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 49\nof the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which guarantees\nnationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment\nthe same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of\nthat Member State.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing provisions in the\narea of the proposal\nThe provisions of the Agreement supersede\nor complement the existing provisions in the 12 bilateral air services\nagreements between Member States and the Republic of Peru.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with the other\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThe Agreement will serve a fundamental\nobjective of the external aviation policy of the Union by bringing existing\nbilateral air services agreements in line with the law of the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\nparties\nConsultation methods, main sectors\ntargeted and general profile of respondents\nMember States as well as the industry were consulted throughout the negotiations.\nSummary of responses and how they\nhave been taken into account\nComments made by Member States and the\nindustry have been taken into account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed\naction\nIn accordance with the mechanisms and directives\nin the Annex to the \u201dhorizontal mandate\u201d, the Commission has negotiated an\nagreement with the Republic of Peru that replaces certain provisions in the\nexisting bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the\nRepublic of Peru.
