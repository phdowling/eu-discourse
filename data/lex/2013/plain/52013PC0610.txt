In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 10\r\nJune 2013 of the request made by the Italian Republic. By letter dated 14 June\r\n2013, the Commission notified the Italian Republic that it had all the\r\ninformation necessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nArticle 168 and 168a of the VAT Directive\r\nprovides that a taxable person is entitled to deduct the VAT charged on\r\npurchases made for the purposes of his taxed transactions. At the same time,\r\nArticle 26(1)(a) of the VAT Directive stipulates that the use of goods, forming\r\npart of the assets of a business, for private purposes is to be considered as a\r\nsupply of services for consideration if the VAT on these goods was wholly or\r\npartly deductible. As a result, the system ensures that final consumption is\r\ntaxed when the corresponding input VAT was initially deducted.\nIn relation to motor vehicles, it is\r\nsometimes difficult and burdensome for the taxable persons to identify and\r\nregister the split between business and private use and for the tax\r\nadministration to verify the effective division of use. This would be the case even if Italy would make use of the option\r\nprovided for in Article 168a(2) of the VAT Directive to limit the deduction on\r\nexpenditure related to company cars to the proportion of the taxable person's\r\neffective business use. In addition, because of the\r\nnumber of mixed use vehicles, tax evasion could become considerable.\nIn order to simplify VAT collection and to\r\ncombat tax evasion, in 2007 the Italian Republic requested and obtained from\r\nthe Council an individual derogation allowing it to restrict, until 31 December\r\n2010, the right of deduction to 40% in relation to motorised road vehicles\r\n(other than agricultural or forestry tractors, normally used for carrying\r\npersons or goods by road with a maximum authorised mass not exceeding 3 500\r\nkilograms and having not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's\r\nseat)[1].\r\nHowever, it should be pointed out that certain categories of vehicles were specifically\r\nexcluded from this restriction, such as vehicles forming part of\r\nstock-in-trade, for instruction by driving schools, used for hire or leasing,\r\nused by sales representatives and taxis. At the same time, businesses would be\r\nrelieved from accounting from tax on the private use. This decision was\r\nextended by Council Decision 2010/748/EU[2]\r\nof 29 November 2010 up to 31 December 2013.\nIn accordance with Article 6 of the\r\nabove-mentioned Decision, the Italian Republic have presented a report covering\r\nthe application of the Decision which includes a review of the percentage\r\nrestriction. \nIt appears from information provided by the\r\nItalian Republic in that report that, in particular given the very high number\r\nof small enterprises in the Italian Republic, the limitation to 40% would still\r\ncorrespond to the actual circumstances and therefore be appropriate.\nHowever, any extension should be limited in\r\ntime in order to assess whether the conditions on which the derogation is based\r\nwould still be valid. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the derogation until\r\nthe end of 2016 and to request the Italian Republic to present a new report if\r\na new extension request would be envisaged beyond that end date. The Decision\r\nwould in any case expire if EU rules governing restrictions on the right of\r\ndeduction in this area come into force before that end date.\nExisting provisions in the area of the\r\nproposal\nArticle 176 of the VAT Directive stipulates\r\nthat the Council shall determine the expenditure of which the VAT is not\r\ndeductible. Until such time, Member States are authorised to maintain\r\nexclusions which were in place on 1 January 1979. Therefore, there are a number\r\nof \"standstill\" provisions restricting the right of deduction in\r\nrelation to motor vehicles. Furthermore, similar deduction restrictions have\r\nalso been granted to other Member States on the basis of Article 395 of the VAT\r\nDirective.\nIn 2004, the Commission made a proposal[3] which contains rules on which\r\nforms of expenditure may be subject to a restriction on the right to deduct but\r\nthe Council has not been able yet to reach an agreement on that proposal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nNot relevant\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise\nImpact assessment\nThe proposal is designed to counter VAT evasion\r\nand to simplify the procedure for charging tax and has, therefore, a positive\r\nimpact.\nBecause of the narrow scope of the derogation\r\nand its limited application in time, the impact will in any case be limited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for the Italian Republic to\r\ncontinue to apply a derogating measure from the VAT Directive as to restrict to\r\n40% the right of a taxable person to deduct VAT on expenditure related to\r\nmotorised road vehicles when the vehicle is not used exclusively for business\r\npurposes. When the right of deduction has been limited, the taxable person is\r\nrelieved from the obligation to account for VAT on the private use. Any\r\npossible request for extending the measure should be accompanied by the\r\nsubmission of a report on the application of the derogation.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal has no impact for the Union\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nReview/revision/sunset clause\nThe\r\nproposal includes a review clause and a sunset clause.\n2013/0298 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\namending Decision 2007/441/EU authorising\r\nthe Italian Republic to apply measures derogating from Articles 26(1)(a) and\r\n168 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax[4], and in particular Article\r\n395(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a letter registered by\r\nthe Commission on 2 April 2013 Italy requested authorisation to extend a\r\nmeasure derogating from Articles 26(1)(a) and 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC in\r\norder to continue to restrict the right of deduction in relation to expenditure\r\non certain motorised road vehicles not wholly used for business purposes.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe other Member States of the request made by Italy by letter dated 10 June\r\n2013. By letter dated 14 June 2013 the Commission notified Italy that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2007/441/EC of 18 June 2007[5]\r\nauthorising the Italian Republic to apply measures derogating from Articles\r\n26(1)(a) and 168 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value\r\nadded tax authorises Italy to limit the right of deduction of value added tax\r\n(VAT) charged on expenditure on motorised road vehicles not wholly used for\r\nbusiness purposes to 40%. Decision 2007/441/EC also provides that the use for\r\nprivate purposes of those vehicles which had been subject to a right of\r\ndeduction restriction under that Decision was not to be considered as a supply\r\nfor a consideration. In addition, Decision 2007/441/EC contains definitions of\r\nthe vehicles and expenditure included in the scope of the decision, and a list\r\nof vehicles which are explicitly excluded from the scope of that Decision. Decision\r\n2007/441/EC was amended by Council Decision 2010/748/EC of 29 November 2010[6], setting the expiry date to 31\r\nDecember 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\r\n6 of Council Decision 2007/441/EC, as amended by Council Decision 2010/748/EC, Italy submitted a report to the Commission covering the application of the Decision which\r\nincluded a review of the percentage restriction. The information provided by Italy still shows that a restriction of the right of deduction to 40% corresponds to the\r\nactual circumstances as regards the ratio of business to non-business use of\r\nthe vehicles concerned. Italy should therefore be authorised to apply the\r\nmeasure for a further limited period, until 31 December 2016.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event Italy were to request a further extension beyond 2016, a new report should be submitted to\r\nthe Commission together with the extension request by 1 April 2016.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2004 the\r\nCommission adopted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC\r\nwith a view to simplifying the value added tax obligations[7]. The derogating measures\r\nprovided for in this Decision should expire on the entry into force of such an\r\namending Directive, if that date is earlier than the date of expiry provided\r\nfor in this Decision.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nimpact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2007/441/EC should\r\ntherefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nDecision 2007/441/EC is amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\"Article 6\nAny request for the extension of the\r\nmeasures provided for in this Decision shall be submitted to the Commission by\r\n1 April 2016.\nAny request for extension of those measures\r\nshall be accompanied by a report which includes a review of the percentage\r\nrestriction applied on the right to deduct VAT charged on expenditure on\r\nmotorised road vehicles not wholly used for business purposes.\"\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 7 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\"Article 7\nThis Decision shall expire on the date of\r\nentry into force of Union rules determining the expenditure relating to\r\nmotorised road vehicles which is not eligible for a full deduction of value\r\nadded tax, and on 31 December 2016 at the latest.\"\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day\r\nof its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\r\n2014.\nArticle 3\nThis\r\nDecision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 2007/441/EC of 18 June 2007\r\nauthorising the Italian Republic to apply measures derogating from Articles\r\n26(1) and 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\r\n(OJ L 165, 27.6.2007, p. 33).\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 318, 04.12.2010, p. 45-46.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM(2004) 728final (OJ C 24, 29.1.2005, p. 10).\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p.1\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 165, 27.6.2007, p. 33 \n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 318, 4.12.2010, p. 45-46\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM (2004) 728 final (OJ C 24, 29.1.2005, p.10)\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
