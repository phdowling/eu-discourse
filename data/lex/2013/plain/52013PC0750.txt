Negotiations\r\nare underway on a set of deliverables that could be agreed at the Ministerial\r\nConference. Some of these form part of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) and if\r\nagreed, would constitute a first step toward the conclusion of the entire Doha\r\nround of negotiations. A separate set of non-DDA issues might also be agreed at\r\nMC9 but is the subject of a separate proposal for a Council Decision.\nWith regard to the DDA issues, negotiations\r\nare taking place in 3 pillars: trade facilitation, agriculture and development.\r\nThe EU attaches paramount importance to reaching agreement on trade\r\nfacilitation, which would provide great economic benefits to all WTO Members. If\r\nnegotiations on Trade Facilitation move forward as planned in the run-up to MC9,\r\nWTO members should be in a position to have a political understanding on the\r\nbasic text of the agreement. Nevertheless, the finalisation of the agreement text\r\nwill only occur in 2014 once the schedules of implementation will be ready (regarding\r\nthose provisions that are planned to be implemented at the moment of entry into\r\nforce of the agreement) as these will form an integral part of the agreement.\r\nShould negotiations advance satisfactorily in this direction and MC9 will be in\r\na position to reach such a political understanding on the Trade Facilitation Agreement,\r\nthen part of the MC9 deal will also be to deliver on certain development and\r\nagriculture issues. Some of these development and agriculture issues are likely\r\nto necessitate a Council Decision already for MC9 and are, therefore, the\r\nsubject of the current proposal. A separate Council Decision regarding the EU\r\nposition on the Trade Facilitation Agreement would likely be needed in 2014\r\nonce the Trade Facilitation text is fully ready and requires a position by the\r\nEU in the WTO. \nHence, this proposal for a Council Decision\r\nis limited to the development and agriculture deliverables that may be agreed\r\nin MC9, namely:\n\u00b7       \r\nA Monitoring Mechanism concerning special and differential\r\ntreatment provisions for developing countries: in accordance with the\r\norientations approved by the General Council of the WTO on 31 July 2002, the\r\nSpecial Session of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development is finalising\r\nnegotiations on the functions, structure and terms of reference of a Monitoring\r\nMechanism, that aims to contribute to facilitating the integration of\r\ndeveloping and least-developed members into the multilateral trading system.\n\u00b7       \r\nTariff Rate Quota (TRQ) administration: the text\r\nto be agreed in MC9 should include transparency provisions and an underfill\r\nmechanism. On transparency, TRQ administration is assimilated to import\r\nlicensing measures and thus made subject to the WTO Agreement on Import\r\nLicensing, meaning that some procedural/transparency obligations would apply\r\n(e.g. mandatory publication, timelines for processing an application and\r\nnotification). In addition, a necessity test should be applied which provides\r\nthat administrative procedures should not be more burdensome than absolutely\r\nnecessary to administer the measure. Regarding the underfill mechanism, when\r\nthe fill rate of a TRQ is below 65% for a certain period (or in case of absence\r\nof notification), the importing WTO member may be requested to change the quota\r\nmanagement to a first-come, first-served method (FCFS) or to a system of\r\nautomatic, unconditional licences.\n\u00b7       \r\nFood Security: agreement in MC9 is sought for a\r\n\u2018due restraint\u2019 clause that would protect some developing country Members\u2019 food\r\nsecurity programmes from challenges in the WTO during a specific period of time\r\nand under specific conditions. This could take the form of a Ministerial\r\nDecision.\nThe objective of the present proposal is to\r\nallow the European Union to join a consensus on the above mentioned issues at the\r\n9th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC9). The proposal therefore provides\r\nthat the Council authorises the Commission to take a position on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union within the WTO to join the consensus with a view to supporting\r\nthe adoption of the said decisions. \nGiven the fact that the Ministerial\r\nConference will take place on 3-6 December and that negotiations are ongoing on\r\nall elements of the possible Bali package, the Commission would expect that the\r\nCouncil would take its decision once the situation regarding the relevant texts\r\nwould be sufficiently clear, possibly during the Ministerial Conference itself.\r\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL BASIS OF PROPOSAL\nArticle 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning\r\nof the European Union (TFEU) provides that the Council, on a proposal from the\r\nCommission or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and\r\nSecurity Policy, shall adopt a decision establishing the position to be adopted\r\non the Union\u2019s behalf when a body set up by an international agreement is\r\ncalled upon to take a decision having legal effects.\r\nThe decisions by the Ministerial Conference regarding TRQ administration,\r\nfood security and the Monitoring Mechanism would fall under this provision.\nAll of the envisaged measures fall within\r\nthe scope of the common commercial policy (Article 207 TFEU) and are directly\r\nassociated with the functioning of the WTO and the multilateral trading system.\r\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SCOPE OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe Commission shall be authorised to take\r\na position on behalf of the European Union to join the consensus with a view to\r\nsupport the adoption of the decisions taken by the Ministerial Conference\r\nregarding food security, TRQ administration and the Monitoring Mechanism.\nConsistent with Article 218(10), the\r\nEuropean Parliament will be immediately and fully informed.\n2013/0364 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nestablishing the position to be taken by\r\nthe European Union within the 9th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard\r\nto the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof, \nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\r\nattaches paramount importance to the functioning and progressive strengthening\r\nof the multilateral trading system, and recognises the need to advance the Doha\r\nRound of multilateral trade negotiations. A successful outcome of the 9th\r\nWTO Ministerial Conference would be a necessary step toward this objective, and\r\nwould see an understanding regarding a WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement,\r\naccompanied by limited outcomes on agriculture and development issues, particularly\r\nthose of concern to the Least Developed Countries.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development is at the\r\nheart of the Doha Round of trade negotiations. At its meeting of 31 July 2002,\r\nthe General Council of the WTO approved the recommendation of the Special\r\nSession of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) to establish a\r\nMonitoring Mechanism for special and differential treatment. This Monitoring Mechanism\r\nshould aim to contribute to facilitating the integration of developing and\r\nleast-developed members into the multilateral trading system. The Special\r\nSession of the CTD is finalising its negotiations regarding the functions,\r\nstructure and terms of reference of such a Mechanism. The ensuing decision by\r\nthe Ministerial Conference should be supported by the European Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Agriculture is a key\r\nelement of the Doha Development Agenda and can only be fully resolved within a final\r\noutcome encompassing several other areas of the DDA mandate. Nevertheless, the\r\nEuropean Union recognises the interest of some WTO Members in addressing\r\nspecific agriculture concerns already during the 9th WTO Ministerial\r\nConference, which would go hand in hand with a political understanding on an\r\nambitious Trade Facilitation Agreement.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The efficient management\r\nof Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQ) and transparency regarding their use is essential\r\nfor making sure that previous commitments taken during the Uruguay Round\r\nregarding market access for agriculture products are properly implemented.\r\nNegotiations conducted in the WTO throughout 2013 have allowed Members to reach\r\nagreement regarding the implementation of a TRQ Administration mechanism, which\r\nencompasses transparency provisions and an underfill mechanism. On\r\ntransparency, TRQ administration should be assimilated to import licensing\r\nmeasures and thus made subject to the WTO Agreement on Import Licensing,\r\nmeaning that certain procedural and transparency obligations should apply. In\r\naddition, a necessity test should be applied which provides that administrative\r\nprocedures should not be more burdensome than absolutely necessary to\r\nadminister the relevant measure. Regarding the underfill mechanism, when the\r\nfill rate of a TRQ is below a defined level for a certain period (or in case of\r\nabsence of notification), the importing WTO member may be requested to change\r\nthe quota management to a first-come, first-served method or to a system of\r\nautomatic, unconditional licences. A decision by the Ministerial Conference on TRQ\r\nadministration is now envisaged which should be supported by the European\r\nUnion.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Members should have\r\nthe ability to implement the necessary programmes including public stockholding\r\nfor food security purposes in line with WTO rules. Public stockholding\r\nprogrammes for food security purposes need to meet specific conditions agreed\r\namong WTO Members so as not to distort international trade. Negotiations\r\nconducted in the WTO throughout 2013 have allowed Members to find an\r\nappropriate solution regarding such programmes deployed by developing countries\r\nin the form of an understanding among Members (\u2018due restraint\u2019 clause) not to\r\nchallenge such programmes during a specific period of time provided that they\r\nmeet a certain set of conditions. A decision by the Ministerial Conference\r\nconfirming this understanding is now envisaged which should be supported by the\r\nEuropean Union. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\u2019s\r\ndecision to join a consensus at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference\r\nregarding the Monitoring Mechanism, TRQ administration and food security is\r\ndependent on the progress achieved regarding the Trade Facilitation Agreement\r\nand specifically on whether the Ministerial Conference reaches a political\r\nunderstanding on the text of this agreement,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe position of the European Union\r\nregarding food security, Tariff Rate Quota administration and the Monitoring\r\nMechanism shall be to join the consensus reached among WTO Members with a view\r\nto adopting the decisions by the 9th Ministerial Conference.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
