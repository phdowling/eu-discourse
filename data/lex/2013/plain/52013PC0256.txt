The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty at the level of 63,5%. Individual anti-dumping duty rates were granted to three Chinese exporters (rates from 17,0% to 41,0%). \n   || Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment \n   || Consultation of interested parties \n   || Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n   || Collection and use of expertise \n   || There was no need for external expertise. \n   || Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n Legal elements of the proposal \n   || Summary of the proposed action On 9 March 2012, the Commission announced by a notice, published in the Official Journal of the European Union[2], the initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of tungsten electrodes originating in the PRC. The review was initiated following a substantiated request lodged by European Association of Metals (EUROMETAUX) on behalf of Union producers representing more than 25% of the Union production of certain tungsten electrodes. The review investigation found continuation of dumping and injury should anti-dumping measures be lifted. It was further established that the maintenance of measures was not against the interest of the Union. Therefore, it is suggested that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation, which should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 4 June 2013 at the latest, in order to prolong the existing measures. \n   || Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. \n   || Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n   || Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n   || The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n   || Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n   || Choice of instruments \n   || Proposed instruments: regulation. \n   || Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n Budgetary implication \n   || The proposal has no implication for the Union budget. \n2013/0134 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of certain tungsten electrodes originating in the People's Republic of China following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community [3]\n('the basic Regulation'), and in particular Article 9(4) and 11(2), (5) and (6)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission ('Commission') after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.

The examination of the\ntrends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2008 to the end of the\nRIP (\u2018the period considered\u2019).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\ninvestigation\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the applicant, the other known Union producer, exporting producers in\nthe PRC, unrelated importers and users known to be concerned, producers in the potential\nanalogue countries and the representatives of the PRC of the initiation of the\nexpiry review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out\nin the Notice of initiation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties,\nwho so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should\nbe heard, were granted a hearing.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparently\nlarge number of exporting producers in the PRC and unrelated importers in the Union involved in the investigation, sampling was envisaged in the Notice of initiation, in\naccordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. In order to enable the\nCommission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select\na sample, the above parties were requested, pursuant to Article 17 of the basic\nRegulation, to make themselves known within 15 days of the publication of the\nnotice of initiation and to provide the Commission with the information\nrequested in the Notice of initiation.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three importers made\nthemselves known. None of them, however, imported certain tungsten electrodes\noriginating in the PRC during the RIP. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As only two exporting\nproducers from the PRC came forward with the requested information it was not\nnecessary to select a sample of exporting producers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\nquestionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to those who made\nthemselves known within the deadlines set in the Notice of initiation. Replies\nwere received from two Union producers, two exporting producers in the PRC and\none producer in the USA. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sought and\nverified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping and resulting injury and of\nthe Union interest. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the\nfollowing companies: \n(a)         \nUnion producers \n\u2013              \nPlansee SE, Austria\n\u2013              \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Wolfram Industrie mbH, Germany\n(b)         \nExporting producers in the PRC\n\u2013              \nShandong Weldstone Tungsten Industry Co., Ltd., Zibo, \n\u2013              \nShaanxi Yuheng Tungsten & Molybdenum\nIndustrial Co., Ltd Baoji \n(c)         \nRelated company to one cooperating\nexporting producer in the PRC \n\u2013              \nShanghai Weldstone Asia Co., Ltd., Shanghai\n(d)         \nRelated companies to one cooperating\nexporting producer in the European Union \n\u2013              \nWeldstone GmbH, Wilnsdorf, Germany\n\u2013              \nBinzel Benelux bvba, Eke \u2013 Nazareth, Belgium\n(e)         \nAnalogue Country\n\u2013              \nGlobal Tungsten & Powders Corp, Towanda, USA \nB. PRODUCT UNDER REVIEW AND LIKE\nPRODUCT\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nproduct concerned is the same as that covered by Council Regulation (EC) No\n260/2007, namely tungsten welding electrodes, including tungsten bars and rods\nfor welding electrodes, containing 94% or more by weight of tungsten, other\nthan those obtained simply by sintering, whether or not cut to length,\noriginating in the PRC (\u2018TE\u2019 or \u2018the product under review\u2019), currently falling\nwithin CN codes ex 8101 99 10 and ex 8515 90 00.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under review is\nused in welding and similar processes. TE are used in a wide variety of\nindustrial sectors such as construction, shipbuilding, automobile\nmanufacturing, marine, chemical and nuclear engineering, aerospace as well as\noil and gas pipelines. Based on the physical and chemical characteristics and\nthe substitutability of the different types of the product from the perspective\nof the user, all TE are considered to constitute a single product for the\npurpose of this proceeding.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed\nthat, as in the original investigation, the product under review and that\nmanufactured and sold on the domestic market of the PRC, as well as that produced\nand sold by the Union industry on the Union market and that produced and sold\non the analogue country market have the same basic physical and technical\ncharacteristics and the same basic uses and are therefore considered to be\nalike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\nC. LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OR\nA RECURRENCE OF DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether dumping was currently\ntaking place and whether the expiry of the existing measures would be likely to\nlead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above, it was\nnot necessary to select a sample of exporting producers in the PRC. The two\ncooperating companies covered the imports of product concerned from the PRC to\nthe Union in a range of 80% to 85% during the RIP. On this basis, it was\nconcluded that cooperation was high.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the cooperating\nexporting producers benefited from market economy treatment (\u2018MET\u2019) in\naccordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, while the second\nbenefited from individual treatment (\u2018IT\u2019) in accordance with Article 9(5) of\nthe basic Regulation, granted to them during the original investigation. It is\nrecalled that in the context of investigations in accordance with Article 11(2)\nof the basic Regulation, MET and IT are not reconsidered. A third company, who\ndid not cooperate in the current expiry review, was granted IT in the original\ninvestigation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping of imports during\nthe RIP \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue country \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the PRC is an economy\nin transition and in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(a) of the\nbasic Regulation, normal value for exporting producers not granted market\neconomy treatment has to be determined on the basis of the price or constructed\nvalue in an appropriate market economy third country (\u2018analogue country\u2019).\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As in the original\ninvestigation, the United States of America (\u2018the USA\u2019) was proposed as\nanalogue country in the Notice of initiation for the purpose of establishing\nnormal value. Interested parties were given the opportunity to comment on the\nappropriateness of this choice. No comments were received in this regard. \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also examined\nwhether other countries could be a reasonable choice of an analogue country and\nidentified other third countries from\nwhich imports of tungsten electrodes were recorded in Eurostat. Potential known\nproducers in these countries were contacted and invited to cooperate in the\ninvestigation. However, no cooperation was obtained. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was considered that the USA was representative as a reference market, especially in view of the openness and\ncompetitiveness of their domestic market. The USA was used also as an analogue\ncountry in the original investigation. No new or changed circumstances which\nwould justify a change appeared to exist nor were any such circumstances communicated\nto the Commission. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the USA has been used as an analogue market economy country for the purpose of this review. The\nonly known USA producer was contacted and agreed to cooperate, to reply to the\nquestionnaire and to accept a verification visit. The verified sales and\nproduction figures of this company have been used for the determination of the\nnormal value for companies not granted MET during the original investigation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal value \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the company granted MET\nin the original investigation, normal value has been established based on its\ndata. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined\nwhether the domestic sales of TE to independent customers were representative\nduring the RIP, i.e. if the sales volume of the product intended for domestic\nconsumption represented 5 % or more of their exports of the product under\nreview to the Union. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was subsequently\nexamined whether the domestic sales of the like product could be regarded as\nbeing made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the\nbasic Regulation, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to\nindependent customers on the domestic market.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the types of the\nproduct concerned where the domestic sales were representative and made in the\nordinary course of trade, normal value was established on the prices paid by\nindependent customers in the exporting country. For the remaining types of the\nproduct under review the normal value had to be constructed in accordance with\nArticle 2(3) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, the established normal value\nwas calculated using the company\u2019s cost of manufacturing and adding selling,\ngeneral and administrative costs (SG&A) and profit achieved on the domestic\nsale made in the ordinary course of trade in accordance with Article 2(6) of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure one\nparty argued that the methodology used to determine SG&A expenses was\ndifferent from the one used in the original investigation which may have had an\nimpact on the determination of the profit margin used to calculate the\nconstructed normal value in accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic\nRegulation. Further to the information already previously submitted in the\ninvestigation the party did not substantiate its claim by any evidence. It is\nnoted that in accordance with Article 2(5) of the basic Regulation SG&A\nexpenses were allocated on turnover basis and that this methodology was also\nused in the original investigation.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Profit used in the initial\ninvestigation was not from the OCOT test (ordinary course of trade) as none of\nthe exported types of the product concerned were sold on the domestic market in\nthe ordinary course of trade. The current expiry review showed that some types\nof the product concerned were profitable and therefore, in compliance with\nArticle 2(3) and (6) of the basic Regulation, profit of these profitable\ntransactions was used for constructing the normal value.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the company not\ngranted MET in the original investigation is concerned, pursuant to Article\n2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, normal value was established on the basis of\ninformation collected from the cooperating producer in the analogue country. Domestic\nsales of the producer in the analogue country were found to be made in\nsufficient quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and could thus be\nused as a basis to determine normal value for the company not granted MET.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding\nthe company granted MET, all export sales to the Union were made via related\nimporters and subsequently resold to related and unrelated companies in the Union. The export price was therefore constructed, pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic\nRegulation, on the basis of the price at which the imported products were first\nresold to an independent buyer, duly adjusted for all costs incurred between\nimportation and resale, as well as a reasonable margin for SG&A and\nprofits. In this regard, the related companies\u2019 own SG&A costs were used. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\ndisclosure one party argued that when determining SG&A of the related\nimporters, certain expenses were taken into consideration that were related to the\nsales of other products than the product concerned and that these expenses should\ntherefore be excluded. It is noted that the verified SG&A expenses as\nprovided by the companies concerned were taken into consideration when\nconstructing the export price in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic\nRegulation. The claim that the SG&A expenses reported included SG&A\nexpenses from sales of other products was not supported by any evidence and had\ntherefore to be rejected. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, the comments submitted by on interested party on export prices were\nbased on an erroneous quotation of the relevant currency. Therefore this claim\nwas rejected.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far\nas the profit margin is concerned, none of the unrelated importers in the Union cooperated. In the original investigation, the profit margin of the related importers\nwas used, based on the fact that the activities of the unrelated importers were\nnot sufficiently comparable to that of the related importer concerned. The investigation\nshowed that the activities of the related importer were the same during the RIP\nas during the investigation period of the original investigation, i.e. the\nmajority of the TE imported was further integrated into the main product\nproduced by the group, the welding torch. It should also be noted that the TE\nare of minor value compared to the end-product. On this basis and as in the\noriginal investigation it was concluded that the related importer\u2019s own profit\nmargin would constitute an accurate basis for a profit margin to construct the\nexport price.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding\nthe company granted IT in the original investigation, all export sales to the\nUnion were made directly to independent customers established in the Union. In accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, the export price was therefore\nestablished on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndetermination of the export price of all other producers established in the PRC\nwas based on imports statistics available in the Article 14(6) database.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naccordance to Article 11(10) of the basic Regulation, export prices were\nestablished by deducting the anti-dumping duties paid, as none of the parties\nsubmitted anyevidence that the duty was duly reflected in resale prices and\nsubsequent selling prices in the Union market.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison between\nnormal value and export price was made on an ex-works basis.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of ensuring\na fair comparison between the normal value and the export price of the both cooperating\nexporting producers, and in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic\nRegulation, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made with regard to\ndifferences in transport, insurance and credit costs which affected prices and\nprice comparability. \n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping margin\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As provided for under\nArticle 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on\nthe basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the\nweighted average export price.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the cooperating\nexporting producer granted MET in the original investigation this comparison\nshowed that this company continued dumping at significant levels. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the cooperating\nexporting producer granted IT in the original investigation as well as country-wide\ndumping margin applicable to all other non-cooperating exporting producers in the\nPRC showed a significant level of dumping even higher than in the original\ninvestigation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of imports\nshould measures be repealed \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remark\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the finding of\nthe existence of dumping during the RIP, the likelihood of continuation of\ndumping should measures be repealed was investigated. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it should\nbe noted that the cooperating exporting producers represented only around 10%\nof the total production capacity in The PRC. Therefore, findings had to be largely\nbased on information submitted in the review request as well as publicly available\ninformation. The export price behaviour of Chinese producers to other third\ncountry markets, the Chinese production capacity as well as available spare\ncapacities and the attractiveness of the Union market for Chinese exporters were\nconsidered in particular. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export price behaviour of\nChinese producers to other third country markets \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as exports to other\nthird country markets are concerned, it should be noted that the statistical\ninformation available from Chinese public databases covers a broader product\nscope than the product under review and therefore no meaningful analysis of\nquantities exported to other markets or prices on these markets could be made. The\ntwo cooperating producers from the PRC did not export to unrelated customers in\nother third markets. On this basis, the export prices to other third country\nmarkets during the RIP could not be reliably established and no firm\nconclusions could be drawn on the basis of the information available. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spare capacity of the\nChinese producers\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndata on the basis of which the analysis below is made were provided by the\napplicant in the review request and was cross-checked with publicly available\ninformation.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis, capacities of producers in the PRC were estimated at 1 600 000 kg.\nThe applicant\u2019s estimation of the capacity utilisation of Chinese producers is\naround 63% resulting in an unused capacity of about 600 000 kg, exceeding\nnearly five times the total Union consumption during the RIP. Thus, there are\nlarge quantities available for export from the PRC, in particular, because\nthere are no indications that third country markets or the domestic market\ncould absorb this significant spare capacity.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and prices of dumped\nimports from the PRC\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the PRC into\nthe Union increased by 9% over the period considered and reached the level of well\nabove 50 000 kilograms during the RIP representing approximately half of the total\nEU consumption during the RIP. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period\nconsidered, import prices were fluctuating and followed the same trends as the\nsales prices of the Union industry on the Union market. Overall, import prices\nincreased from 2008 to the RIP by 42% and were still at dumped levels. The price\ngrowth is mainly explained by the higher cost of the main raw material\n(tungsten powder) during the RIP. \n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the Union\nmarket \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union market is among\nthe largest in the world reaching around 20 % of the world consumption of TE. Chinese\ncompanies have shown a serious interest in developing their presence on the\nUnion market which is supported by the fact that they maintained and even increased\ntheir significant market share of 45 % during the RIP. \n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion of the likelihood\nof continuation of dumping\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The foregoing analysis\ndemonstrates that Chinese imports continued to enter the Union market at dumped\nprices with significant dumping margins. Given most notably the analysis of\nprice levels on the Union market, and the interest Chinese exporters have shown\nin the Union market, as well as the significant spare capacities available in the\nPRC, going far beyond the total Union consumption, it can be concluded there is\na strong likelihood of continuation of dumping should measures be removed.\nD.

An undercutting margin of\n37% was established during the RIP, and when including the anti-dumping duty in\nthe calculation, the undercutting margin was still\nsignificant at a level of 24%. The calculation was based on a comparison of the\nCIF export prices of the cooperating exporting producers with the average Union\nindustry prices at ex-work level.

Indeed, the increase\nof the sales prices of the Union industry between 2010 and the RIP is linked to\nthe increase of raw material prices and did not cover the total cost of the\nUnion industry.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In conclusion, the\ndifficulties of the Union industry can be clearly linked to the massive\npresence of Chinese low-priced imports of the product under review on the Union\nmarket, which are sold at significantly dumped prices, despite the measures in\nforce. This factor was enough to determine a situation where the Union industry\nsuffer losses in an attempt to keep a reasonable market share. In addition,\nthese difficulties have been further deepened throughout almost the entire\nperiod considered by two factors: the downturn of the market during the\neconomic crisis of 2008-09 and, even if to a minor extent, the sudden increase\nof raw material costs during the RIP. This led to a scenario where losses have\nreached significant levels. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the negative\ndevelopment of the indicators pertaining to the Union industry, it is\nconsidered that the Union industry continued to suffer material injury within\nthe meaning of the Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation during the period\nconsidered.\nE. LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUATION OF\nINJURY\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe period considered, the Union industry appeared in a vulnerable situation,\nstill exposed to the injurious effect of the dumped imports from the PRC. \n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n11(2) of the basic Regulation, imports from the country concerned were assessed\nin order to establish if there was a likelihood of continuation of injury,\nshould measures be allowed to lapse.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese import volumes \n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that\nconsumption on the Union market decreased significantly since the original\ninvestigation mainly due to the economic downturn. In these circumstances, the\nChinese import volumes increased to a level well above 50 000 kg during the RIP.\nAs to the import volumes, this has increased by 9% while the market share of\nthe Union industry decreased. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 spare capacity in the PRC \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As described in recital (41),\nbased on the information available there is significant spare capacity\navailable in the PRC. It can be expected that a large part of this spare\ncapacity could be used to increase imports in the Union market in the absence\nof anti-dumping measures. This is because there are no indications that third country\nmarkets or the Chinese domestic markets could absorb the significant Chinese spare\ncapacity. Therefore, the capacity to significantly increase imports to the Union exists. The estimation of the unused capacity would exceed nearly five times the\nUnion consumption during the RIP.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, information\nsubmitted during the investigation indicated important distortions in the raw\nmaterial (ammonium\nparatungstate \u2013 'APT') market used to manufacture the\nproduct under review. This raw material is subject to export quotas imposed by\nthe Chinese authorities as well as export taxes. This limits the exports of APT\nand artificially increases its world price. These distortions are likely to\nconfer further incentives to the Chinese industry to produce and export at low\nprices, while the Union industry has to produce the like product on the basis\nof artificially high raw material prices. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractiveness of the\nUnion market \n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was demonstrated that\nthe Chinese exporting producers showed a continuous interest in the Union\nmarket and were able to increase import volumes at the expense of the sales of the\nUnion industry. They even increased their already significant market share\nduring the RIP.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion \n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion industry had been suffering from the effects of the Chinese dumped\nimports for several years and is currently still in a fragile economic\nsituation. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If measures were allowed to\nlapse there is a strong likelihood of increased dumped imports which could\nseriously threaten the existence of the Union industry. Indeed, in the PRC\nthere is a significant spare capacity which is likely to be largely directed to\nthe Union market, at dumped prices undercutting the Union industry sales prices\nin the Union market, should measures be allowed to lapse.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the findings of\nthe investigation, namely the continuation of dumping, the spare capacity in the\nPRC, the distortion found in the market for raw materials, the potential of the\nexporting producers in the PRC to redirect their export volumes to the Union\nmarket, the price behaviour of the Chinese exporters clearly undercutting the\nprices of the Union industry and the attractiveness of the Union market, any\nrepeal of the measures would point to a likelihood of continuation of injury.\nF. UNION INTEREST\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n21 of the basic Regulation, it has been examined whether the maintenance of the\nexisting measures would be against the Union interest as a whole. The\ndetermination of the Union interest was based on an appreciation of the various\ninterests involved, i.e. those of the Union industry, of importers and of\nusers. All interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views\nknown pursuant to Article 21(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be recalled that\nin the original investigation the imposition of measures was considered not to be\nagainst the interest of the Union. Furthermore, the fact that the present\ninvestigation is a review, thus analysing a situation in which anti-dumping\nmeasures have already been in place, allows the assessment of any undue\nnegative impact on the parties concerned by the current anti-dumping measures.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis it was\nexamined whether, despite the conclusion on the likelihood of a continuation of\ninjurious dumping, compelling reasons existed which would lead to the\nconclusion that it is not in the Union interest to maintain measures in this\nparticular case.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the situation of the Union industry and the analysis on the likelihood\nof recurrence of injury, it is clear that the Union industry would be likely to\nexperience a serious deterioration of its financial situation in case the\nanti-dumping measures were allowed to lapse. Throughout the period considered\nthe Union industry lost production and sales volume while imports from the\ncountry concerned increased despite the measures in force. During the same\nperiod the financial situation of the Union industry deteriorated as it\nexperiences heavy losses. Therefore, effective competitive conditions need to\nbe enforced on the Union market.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis considered that the continuation of measures would benefit the Union\nindustry, which should then be able to increase sales volumes and improve its\nfinancial situation. By contrast, the discontinuation of the measures would seriously\nthreaten the viability of the Union industry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the 15 contacted\nusers came forward to cooperate. As in the original investigation no\nquestionnaire replies were received from interested users. In the original\ninvestigation the non-cooperation was explained by the low impact of TE on their\nproduction costs as it appears that quality and reliability are primary\ncriteria for customers. Given the apparent marginal impact of the product under\nreview on the costs of downstream products, it was concluded that measures\nwould not adversely impact the user industry.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of importers\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 Three importers contacted\nthe Commission at the beginning of the investigation, but they were not\nconsidered as being interested parties since they had not imported the product\nconcerned from the PRC during the RIP. Given that importers of TE did not show\nany interest during the investigation, it was concluded that it would not be\nclearly against EU interest to maintain measures.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the above, it is\nconcluded that there are no compelling reasons against the maintenance of the\ncurrent anti-dumping measures.\nG. ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\nrecommend that the existing measures be maintained. They were also granted a\nperiod to submit comments subsequent to that disclosure. The submissions and\ncomments were duly taken into consideration where warranted. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the above\nthat, as provided for by Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the\nanti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain tungsten electrodes\noriginating in the PRC, imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2007 should\nbe maintained.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to minimise the\nrisk of circumvention due to the high difference in the duty rates, it is\nconsidered that special measures are needed in this case to ensure the proper\napplication of the anti-dumping duties. These special measures, which only\napply to companies for which an individual duty rate is introduced, include the\nfollowing: the presentation to the customs authorities of the Member States of\na valid commercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in\nthe Annex to this Regulation. Imports not accompanied by such an invoice shall\nbe made subject to the residual anti-dumping duty applicable to all other\nproducers.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive anti-dumping\nduty is hereby imposed on imports of tungsten welding electrodes, including\ntungsten bars and rods for welding electrodes, containing 94% or more by weight\nof tungsten, other than those obtained simply by sintering, whether or not cut\nto length, currently falling within CN codes ex 8101 99 10 and ex 8515 90 00\n(TARIC codes 8101 99 10 10 and 8515 90 00 10) and originating in the People's\nRepublic of the China. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of duty\napplicable to the, net free-at-Union-frontier price, before duty, of the\nproducts described in paragraph 1, and manufactured by the companies listed\nbelow shall be as follows:\n Company || Anti-Dumping Duty || TARIC Additional Code \n Shandong Weldstone Tungsten Industry Co., Ltd || 17,0 % || A754 \n Shaanxi Yuheng Tungsten & Molybdenum Industrial Co., Ltd || 41,0 % || A755 \n Beijing Advanced Metal Materials Co., Ltd || 38,8 % || A756 \n All other companies || 63,5 % || A999 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of the\nindividual duty rates specified for the companies mentioned in paragraph 2\nshall be conditional upon presentation to the customs authorities of the Member\nStates of a valid commercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements\nset out in the Annex.
