Consequently, customs\r\nlegislation enforcement follows 28 different sets of legal rules and different\r\nadministrative or legal traditions. This means that Member States can impose\r\nsanctions that seem appropriate to them as penalties for infringements of\r\ncertain obligations stemming from the harmonised Union customs legislation. \nSuch sanctions differ in\r\nnature and severity according to the Member State that is competent for it.\r\nNamely, they are of different types (e.g. fines, imprisonment, confiscation of\r\ngoods, temporal or permanent disqualification from the practice of industrial\r\nor commercial activities), irrespective their nature, and even when assuming\r\nthe same type and nature, like for instance a fine, have different\r\nlevels/ranges from Member State to Member State.\nAn overview of the situation\r\nregarding Member States' customs infringements and sanctions systems took place\r\nthrough a Project Group established, on a voluntary basis, by the Commission\r\nwith 24 Member States[1],\r\nunder the Customs 2013 Program. This Project Group analysed the 24 national\r\nregimes for customs infringements and related sanctions and reported back to\r\nthe Commission. Several substantial differences were noted:\nTable 1 \u2013 Differences in Member States'\r\ncustoms sanctioning systems\n The nature of national sanctions for customs infringements || 16 out of 24 Member States provide for both criminal and non-criminal sanctions. 8 out of 24 Member States only have criminal sanctions. \n Financial thresholds to distinguish between criminal and non-criminal infringements and sanctions || Member States whose systems foresee both criminal and non-criminal infringements and sanctions have different financial thresholds to decide on the nature of the customs infringement \u2013 whether criminal or non-criminal- and therefore the nature of the customs sanction. Thus the financial thresholds vary between 266 EUR and 50 000 EUR. \n Member States' requirements to establish the economic operator's liability for the customs infringement || 11 out of 24 Member States consider that an economic operator is liable for certain customs infringements whenever there is a customs law breach, irrespective of the presence of intent, negligence or elements of careless or reckless behaviour (strict liability infringements). 13 out of 24 Member States cannot sanction an economic operator for a customs infringement without the presence of intent, negligence or elements of careless or reckless behaviour. \n Time limits: -to initiate a customs sanction procedure -to impose a customs sanction -to execute the customs sanction || The large majority of Member States have time limits to initiate a sanction procedure, to impose a customs sanction and to execute it. These time limits vary from 1 to 30 years. 1 out of 24 Member States does not employ any time limit at all \u2013 it can initiate the sanction procedure or impose a sanction at any time. \n Legal Persons' liability || An economic operator who is a legal person can be held liable for a customs infringement in 15 out of 24 Member States. In 9 out of 24 Member States legal persons cannot be held liable for infringements. \n Settlement || Settlement refers to any procedure within the legal or administrative system of a Member State that allows the authorities to agree with an offender to settle the matter of a customs infringement as an alternative to initiating or completing customs sanction procedures. 15 out of 24 Member States have this procedure for customs infringements. \n(Source: Report from\r\nthe Project Group on Customs Penalties \u2013 Annex 1B of Impact Assessment for a\r\nlegislative act laying down a Union legal framework on customs infringements\r\nand sanctions)\nThese differences in\r\ninfringements to the customs legislation and sanctions have implications at\r\nseveral levels:\n- from an international\r\npoint of view, the different sanctioning systems existing in the Member States\r\nraise some concerns in certain WTO Member States regarding the compliance of\r\nthe European Union with its international obligations in this field;\n- within the European Union,\r\nthe different enforcement of customs legislation makes the effective management\r\nof the customs union harder, as the same non-compliant behaviour may be treated\r\nin very different ways in each Member State as the previous table shows;\n- for the economic\r\noperators, the differences in the treatment of infringements of Union customs\r\nlegislation have an impact on the level playing field which should be inherent\r\nto the Internal Market, thus providing an advantage for those who breach the\r\nlaw in a Member State with lenient legislation for customs sanctions. This\r\nsituation also has an impact on the access to customs simplifications and\r\nfacilitations or to the process of being granted the AEO status as the\r\ncriterion referring to compliance with customs legislation and the absence of\r\nserious infringements as a condition for obtaining the AEO status, is\r\ninterpreted in a different way by national legislations.\nIn order to tackle those\r\nproblems, the proposal sets a common legal framework for the treatment of\r\ncustoms infringements and sanctions, bridging the gap between different legal\r\nregimes through a common platform of rules and thus contributing to an equal\r\ntreatment between economic operators in the EU, as well as the effective\r\nprotection of the Union's financial interests and law enforcement in the field\r\nof customs.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal context\nCustoms legislation\r\nreferring to the trade in goods between the customs territory of the Union and third countries is completely harmonised and has been assembled in a Community\r\nCustoms Code (CCC)[2] since 1992. A major overhaul of this Code\r\nwas carried out in Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and\r\nof the Council of April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised\r\nCustoms Code or MCC)[3], now recast and repealed by Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union\r\nCustoms Code (UCC)[4], aiming at the adaptation of customs legislation to the electronic\r\nenvironment of customs and trade, to promote further the harmonisation and\r\nuniform application of customs legislation, and to provide Union economic\r\noperators with the appropriate tools for developing their activities in a\r\nglobal business environment.\nThis harmonised customs\r\nlegislation needs to be strengthened with common rules regarding its\r\nenforcement. The need to take some steps in this direction has already been\r\npointed out by the European Parliament in two reports[5], one\r\nfrom 2008 and another from 2011, calling for harmonisation in this field.\nAll this efforts are\r\nsupported on the general obligation foreseen by the Treaty[6] for Member States to \"take any appropriate measure, general\r\nor particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the\r\nTreaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union\". This obligation includes sanctions, without differentiating between those\r\nof a criminal and non- criminal nature.\nMore specifically the\r\nModernised Customs Code and the Union Customs Code include for the first time a\r\nprovision[7] concerning administrative customs penalties. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation with\r\ninterested parties\nFour consultation tools were\r\nused, none of them being public consultations (given\r\nthe specific and technical nature of customs infringements and sanctions), and,\r\nfollowing the request of the stakeholders, with a confidential treatment of the\r\nresponses.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A questionnaire\r\nwas addressed to the customs administrations of Member States concerning their\r\nnational customs infringements and penalties systems and answers from 24 Member\r\nStates were collected as has been previously stated in this memorandum. The\r\ncomparison of the data gathered showed the relevant differences among the\r\ncustoms sanctioning systems of the Member States.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A High Level\r\nSeminar on Compliance and Compliance Risk Management with the participation of\r\ncustoms administrations from all Member States and Candidate Countries and\r\nrepresentatives of economic operators was held in Copenhagen on 20-21 March\r\n2012, where the issue of customs offences and penalties was acknowledged as an\r\nelement of a \"compliance\" scheme, and an issue to be further\r\nexplored.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A first\r\nstakeholder consultation with DG TAXUD's consultative body on customs issues\r\n(the Trade Contact Group (TCG)) was carried out. The TCG includes Union-level\r\nrepresentatives of 45 European trade associations, including SMEs, involved in\r\ncustoms related activities. As a response to this consultation, the majority of\r\nthe associations present at the meeting expressed their overall agreement on\r\nthe relevance of DG TAXUD's initiative for their business activities.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A second\r\nstakeholder consultation was carried out through another questionnaire, and was\r\nsent to SMEs through the Enterprise Europe Network, concerning the effects that\r\nthe different infringements and sanctions systems in force in different Member\r\nStates in the area of customs legislation have on the commercial activity of\r\ncompanies dealing with import/export activities.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nThe Commission conducted an\r\nimpact assessment of policy alternatives (available at:\u2026). Four policy options\r\nwere analysed: A \u2013 baseline scenario; B \u2013 a modification of the legislation\r\nwithin the Union legal framework in force; C \u2013 a legislative measure on the\r\napproximation of the types of customs infringements and non-criminal sanctions\r\nand D \u2013 two separate legislative measures aiming at approximation of customs\r\ninfringements and non-criminal sanctions on the one hand and criminal customs\r\ninfringements and sanctions on the other hand.\nAfter considering the\r\npossible options, the impact assessment concludes that a legislative measure\r\nthat would identify customs obligations to which special protection should be\r\ngiven through the establishment of non-criminal sanctions for any breaches of\r\nthem (option C), is to be preferred. \nThe resubmission of the\r\nimpact assessment received a positive opinion of the Impact Assessment Board on\r\n14 June 2013.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis\nThe proposal is based on\r\nArticle 33 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nArticle 33 TFEU states that\r\ncustoms cooperation between Member States and between the latter and the\r\nCommission should be strengthened within the scope of the application of the\r\nTreaties.\nAccording to the Code, a\r\ndecision taken by a Member State is applied in all other Member States and\r\ntherefore requires consultation between the authorities to enhance its uniform\r\napplication.\nLikewise the introduction of\r\ncertain facilitations and simplifications in the Union customs legislation and\r\nthe AEOs access to them, is a strong reason to further strengthen the\r\ncooperation between Member States. In particular the assessment of the criteria\r\nrequired to be granted the AEO status and in particular the criterion related\r\nto the absence of any serious infringement or repeated infringement by the AEO\r\nrequires comparable sanctioning systems throughout the EU in order to ensure a\r\nlevel playing field between economic operators.\nTherefore the approximation\r\nof customs infringements and sanctions shall not only require customs\r\ncooperation between Member States but also shall contribute to the correct and\r\nuniform application and enforcement of the Union customs legislation.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity,\r\nproportionality and the respect for fundamental rights\nThe approximation of customs\r\ninfringements and non-criminal sanctions shall be seen as integral part of\r\nsecondary law that the Union may adopt with a view to strengthening the\r\ncooperation between the customs authorities of the Member States and between\r\nthe Member States and the Commission in its role of implementing the\r\nlegislation of the customs union, being an area of Union exclusive competence.\r\nUnion action in that area does not therefore deserve being assessed with regard\r\nto the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union. \nHowever, even if\r\nsubsidiarity would have to be considered, although in the specific case we are\r\nin a fully harmonised policy area (customs union) with fully harmonised rules,\r\nwhose effective implementation determines the very existence of the customs\r\nunion, only the Union is in a position to meet the\r\nobjectives of this directive also because of the fact of the important\r\ndisparity in national legislations. \nIn accordance with the\r\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in Article 5(4) of the Treaty on\r\nEuropean Union, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve\r\nthat objective. The content of this proposal is in line with the requirements\r\nenshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Particularly, certain\r\nprovisions under the chapter of procedural rules have been inserted in line\r\nwith the principle of the right to good administration and fair trial, but also\r\nin the light of the principle ne bis in idem.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nThis proposal for an approximation of national laws in the area of\r\ncustoms cooperation in the Union, will take the form of a Directive which\r\nMember States will have to transpose in their national legislation.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific provisions\nThe proposal addresses\r\ninfringements linked to the obligations stemming from the Union Customs Code.\r\nTo do so, it includes a common list of different infringements (strict\r\nliability, committed with negligence and committed with intent) breaching the\r\nrules of the Union Customs Code and as such encompasses all possible situations\r\nthat persons may face in that respect when dealing with customs authorities.\r\nThe proposal considers as infringement not only the complete performance of the\r\nbehaviours listed in the proposal but also its intentional attempt.\nIn parallel to those\r\nconducts, this proposal also establishes a common scale of effective\r\nproportionate and dissuasive sanctions linked to the infringements and relevant\r\ncircumstances that should be taken into account by the competent authorities\r\nfrom Member States when determining the type and level of sanctions for customs\r\ninfringements which contribute to the adaptation of the sanction to the\r\nspecific situation. The combination of the scale of the sanctions along with\r\nthe relevant circumstances permits to establish several levels of severity in\r\norder to respect the principle of proportionality of the sanctions. Moreover,\r\nthe proposal defines certain cases where a behaviour falling in the categories\r\ndefined as strict liability infringements by this proposal shall not be\r\nconsidered as such when they are due to an error on the part of the competent\r\ncustoms authorities.\nThe proposal refers to the\r\nliability of persons playing a relevant role in the commission of customs infringements\r\nwith intent, stating an\r\nequivalent treatment to that of the persons committing the infringement to those inciting, aiding or abetting these\r\ninfringements. It refers, as well, to the liability of legal persons, as customs\r\ninfringements can also result from conducts attributable to legal persons.\nFinally the proposal\r\nincludes some necessary procedural provisions in order to avoid overlap of\r\nsanctions for the same facts and persons. In particular it concerns the time\r\nlimit within the competent authorities must initiate the procedure against the\r\nperson responsible of the infringement, the possibility of suspending the\r\nsanctioning proceeding in those cases where criminal proceedings are being carried\r\nout with regard to the same facts and the territorial competence by defining\r\nwhich Member State is considered competent to deal with the case when the\r\ninfringement involves more than one Member State.\nThe implementation of those\r\narticles in the national legislation of Member States will ensure a homogeneous\r\ntreatment of economic operators regardless the Member State where they fulfil\r\ntheir customs formalities and commercial operations. It will also ensure the\r\ncompliance with the international obligations stemming from the Kyoto\r\nConvention. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal will not have\r\nan impact on human resources and on the European Union budget and is therefore\r\nnot accompanied by the financial statement foreseen under Article 31 of the\r\nFinancial Regulation (Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules\r\napplicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation\r\n(EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002).\nThis proposal has no\r\nbudgetary implications for the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXPLANATORY DOCUMENTS\nIt is important for the\r\nCommission to ensure the correct transposition of the Directive to national\r\nlegislation. In order to achieve this and given the different structure of the national\r\nlegal orders, Member States should communicate the exact reference to the\r\nnational provisions and how it transposes each specific provision of the\r\nDirective. This does not go beyond what is necessary for the Commission to\r\nensure that the Directive's main aim, an effective implementation and enforcement\r\nof Union customs legislation in the customs union, is achieved.\n2013/0432 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the Union legal framework for customs\r\ninfringements and sanctions \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 33 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions in the field of\r\nthe customs union are harmonised by Union law. However, their enforcement lies within\r\nthe scope of Member States' national law.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, customs\r\ninfringements and sanctions follow 28 different sets of legal rules. As a\r\nresult of that, a breach of Union customs legislation is not treated the same way\r\nthroughout the Union and the sanctions that may be imposed in each case differ\r\nin nature and severity depending on the Member State that is imposing the\r\nsanction.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That disparity of Member\r\nStates' legal systems affects not only the optimal management of the customs\r\nunion, but also prevents that a level playing field is achieved for economic\r\noperators in the customs union because it has an impact on their access to\r\ncustoms simplifications and facilitations.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation\r\n(EC) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Code\u201d) has been conceived for a\r\nmultinational electronic environment where there is real time communication\r\nbetween customs authorities and where a decision taken by a Member State is applied in all the other Member States. That legal framework therefore requires\r\na harmonised enforcement. The Code also includes a provision requiring Member\r\nStates to provide for effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nlegal framework for the enforcement of Union customs legislation provided for\r\nin this Directive is consistent with the legislation in force regarding the\r\nsafeguarding of the financial interests of the Union[9].\r\nThe customs infringements covered by the framework established by this\r\nDirective include customs infringements that have an impact on those financial\r\ninterests while not falling under the scope of the legislation safeguarding them\r\nby means of criminal law and customs infringements that do not have an impact\r\non the financial interests of the Union at all. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A list\r\nof behaviour which should be considered as infringing Union customs legislation\r\nand give rise to sanctions should be established. Those customs infringements should\r\nbe fully based on the obligations stemming from the customs legislation with\r\ndirect references to the Code. This Directive does not\r\ndetermine whether Member States should apply administrative or criminal law\r\nsanctions in respect of those customs infringements.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfirst category of behaviour should include customs infringements based on\r\nstrict liability, which does not require any element of fault, considering the\r\nobjective nature of the obligations involved and the fact that the persons\r\nresponsible to fulfil them cannot ignore their existence and binding character.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nsecond and third category of behaviour should include customs infringements\r\ncommitted by negligence or intentionally, respectively, where that subjective\r\nelement has to be established for liability to arise.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inciting\r\nor aiding and abetting a behaviour being a customs infringement committed\r\nintentionally and attempt to commit certain customs infringements intentionally\r\nshould be considered customs infringements.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order\r\nto ensure legal certainty, it should be provided that any act or omission\r\nresulting from an error on the part of the customs authorities should not be\r\nconsidered a customs infringement.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member\r\nStates should ensure that liability can arise for legal persons as well as\r\nnatural persons for the same customs infringement where the customs\r\ninfringement has been committed for the benefit of a legal person.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to approximate the\r\nnational sanctioning systems of the Member States, scales of sanctions should\r\nbe established reflecting the different categories of the customs infringements\r\nand their seriousness. For the purpose of imposing effective, proportionate and\r\ndissuasive sanctions, Member States should also ensure that their competent\r\nauthorities take into account specific aggravating or mitigating circumstances when\r\ndetermining the type and level of sanctions to be applied.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The limitation period for\r\nproceedings concerning a customs infringement should be fixed at four years\r\nfrom the day on which the customs infringement was committed or, in case of\r\ncontinuous or repeated infringements, where the behaviour constituting that\r\ninfringement ceases. Member States should ensure that the limitation period is\r\ninterrupted by an act relating to investigations or legal proceedings\r\nconcerning the customs infringement. Member States may lay down cases where\r\nthat period is suspended. The initiation or continuation of these proceedings\r\nshould be precluded after an expiry period of eight years, while the limitation\r\nperiod for the enforcement of a sanction should be of three years.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A suspension of administrative\r\nproceedings concerning customs infringements should be provided for where\r\ncriminal proceedings have been initiated against the same person in connection\r\nwith the same facts. The continuation of the administrative proceedings after\r\nthe completion of the criminal proceedings should be possible only in strict\r\nconformity with the ne bis in idem principle.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid positive\r\nconflicts of jurisdiction, rules should be laid down to determine which of the\r\nMember States with jurisdiction should examine the case.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should\r\nprovide for the cooperation between Member States and the Commission to ensure\r\neffective action against customs infringements.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\r\ninvestigation of customs infringements, the competent authorities should be\r\nallowed to temporarily seize any goods, means of transport or any other\r\ninstrument used in committing the infringement.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nJoint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September\r\n2011 on explanatory documents[10],\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this\r\nDirective, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be\r\njustified.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since this Directive aims\r\nto provide for a list of customs infringements common to all Member States and for\r\nthe basis for effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions to be imposed\r\nby Member States in the area of the customs union, which is fully harmonised,\r\nthose objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States based on\r\ntheir different legal traditions, but can rather, by reason of the scale and\r\neffect, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in\r\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the\r\nTreaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of\r\nproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond\r\nwhat is necessary to achieve those objectives.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nDirective establishes a framework concerning the infringements of Union customs\r\nlegislation and provides for sanctions for those infringements.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive applies to\r\nthe violation of the obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013, laying down the\r\nUnion Customs Code (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Code\u2019) and of identical\r\nobligations laid down in other parts of the Union customs legislation as\r\ndefined in Article 5(2) of the Code.\nArticle 2\nCustoms infringements and sanctions\nMember States shall lay down\r\nrules on sanctions in respect of the customs infringements set out in Articles 3\r\nto 6.\nArticle 3\nStrict liability customs infringements\nMember States shall ensure\r\nthat the following acts or omissions constitute customs infringements\r\nirrespective of any element of fault:\n(a)         \r\nfailure of the person lodging a customs\r\ndeclaration, temporary storage declaration, entry summary declaration, exit\r\nsummary declaration, re-export declaration or re-export notification to ensure\r\nthe accuracy and completeness of the information given in the declaration,\r\nnotification or application in accordance with Article 15(2)(a) of the Code;\n(b)         \r\nfailure of the person lodging a customs\r\ndeclaration, temporary storage declaration,
