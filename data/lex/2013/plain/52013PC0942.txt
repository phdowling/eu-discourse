The proposal consists in simplifying the list of public entities\nlisted under each Ministry under Appendix 1 A by replacing it with a catch-all\nclause which ensures that all entities subordinated to the listed Ministries\nare covered. In addition, the Chilean authorities propose a catch-all clause\nfor all entities at sub-central level (municipalities) under Appendix 2 A. \nThe suggested amendment eliminates the need\nfor future changes to the Annex should entities change (i.e. in the event that\nadditional dependent services, regions, provinces or communes are created, merged\nor suppressed). Moreover, since Chile's coverage under Title IV of Part IV on Government\nProcurement remains unchanged, the European Commission considers this change is\nof a purely formal nature and no compensatory adjustments are warranted\npursuant to Article 159(2) of the Association Agreement. On the contrary, it\nintroduces a sensible improvement to the structure of the Agreement\nAppendix 1 B and Appendix 2 B of Annex XII,\nwhich refer to the coverage of all other central and sub-central public entities\nthat do not have an industrial or commercial character, remain unchanged.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot relevant since this proposal, which\nformally amends Annex XII, does not introduce a change in the scope. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe Council is asked to adopt a European\nUnion position on a draft Decision of the European Union \u2013 Chile Association\nCommittee amending the list of Chilean entities which procure in accordance\nwith the provisions set out in the Title on government procurement of the\nAssociation Agreement. \nArticle 159 of the Association Agreement foresees\nthe possibility to rectify the coverage of the Title on government procurement and\nthe Association Committee is empowered to take this decision to modify Annex\nXII pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article.\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no financial implications\nfor the European Union budget.\n2013/0450 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non a position to be taken by the European\nUnion within the EU-Chile Association Committee regarding the amendment of\nAnnex XII to the Agreement establishing an association between the European\nCommunity and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of\nthe other part, setting out the list of Chilean entities which procure in\naccordance with the provisions of Title IV of Part IV (Government Procurement)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article\n207(4) in conjunction with Article 218(9), thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Association Agreement\nbetween the European Community and its Members States, of the one part, and the\n  Republic of Chile, of the other part[1]\n(\u2018Association Agreement\u2019), was signed on 18 November 2002.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex XII to the\nAssociation Agreement provides a list of entities in the Republic of Chile which procure in accordance with the provisions on government procurement of Title IV of\nPart IV of the Association Agreement.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Republic of Chile notified the European Union of its intention to modify the Annex XII on 10 February 2012\n(with additional information notified on 18 October 2012).
