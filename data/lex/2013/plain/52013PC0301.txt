In this context, ensuring a smooth\nimplementation of cohesion policy programmes is of particular importance for investment\nin growth and jobs. \nProgramme implementation is often challenging,\nnot least as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from fiscal consolidation.\nThis is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most\naffected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under an\nadjustment programme. To date, seven countries have received financial\nassistance and have agreed a macro-economic adjustment programme with the\nCommission. These countries are Cyprus, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, hereafter called \"programme countries\". Hungary, Romania and   Latvia are no longer under an adjustment programme.\nTo ensure that these Member States (and any\nother Member State which may benefit from such assistance programmes in the\nfuture) continue to implement cohesion policy programmes on the ground and\ncontinue to disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains\nprovisions that would allow the Commission to make increased payments to these\ncountries for the period they are under the support mechanisms, without\nmodifying their overall allocation under cohesion policy for the period\n2007-2013. This will provide additional financial resources to the Member\nStates at a critical juncture and will facilitate the continued implementation\nof programmes on the ground.\nb) Follow-up of European Council conclusions\nof 8 February 2013, paragraph 87\nThe European Council has invited the Commission\nto explore practical solutions to reduce the risk of automatic decommitment of\nfunds from the 2007-2013 envelopes for Romania and Slovakia, including through\nan amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006[1]\n(hereinafter the 'General Regulation') (conclusions of 8 February 2013,\nparagraph 87). The provisions of the European Council agreement of 8 February\non the capping of 2014-2020 allocation at 110% of the 2007-2013 allocation in\nreal terms will affect both Slovakia and Romania (paragraph 46 of the\nconclusions). This will be reflected in paragraph [13 of annex III bis of the\nCommon Provisions Regulation (CPR) concerning the financial framework]. \nThe above elements are dependent on the\non-going negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the European\nCommission and the legislative process and approval of the Multi-annual\nFinancial Framework (MFF) and the CPR regulations.\nHaving explored practical solutions to reduce\nthe risk of automatic decommitment for Romania and Slovakia, it is clear that\nthe risk cannot be substantially reduced without an amendment of the General\nRegulation. In order, therefore, to implement the agreement reflected in the\nEuropean Council Conclusions, and to facilitate the absorption of the 2007-2013\nfunds for Romania and Slovakia, it is necessary to extend the decommitment\ndeadline for these two Member States. Taking into account paragraph 8 of the\nEuropean Council Conclusions \u2013 which retains as an integral part of the MFF\nagreement a strict application of decommitment rules in all headings, in particular\nthe rules for automatic decommitments - the extension proposed covers the 2011\nand 2012 commitments. In this case, the automatic decommitment of the 2011\ncommitment will not be at the end of 2013 but at the end of 2014 and the\nautomatic decommitment of 2012 will not be at the end of 2014 but at the end of\n2015. \nThe end date for eligibility of expenditure for\nthe programming period remains unchanged as 31 December 2015. These extended\ndeadlines should help Romania and Slovakia to overcome any difficulties in\nimplementation and reduce the risk of decommitment in 2013 and 2014, while\nmaintainng the necessary discipline and incentive to complete the 2007-2013\nprogramming period in timely manner. This will allow to concentrate on the\nimplementation of the 2014-2020 programmes without delay.\n\u00b7     \nGeneral context and provisions in force in\nthe policy sphere of the proposal\nArticle 77 of the General Regulation provides\nthat the interim payments and the final balance shall be calculated by applying\nthe co-financing rate for each priority axis laid down by the Commission\ndecision adopting the operational programme concerned. It also provides for the\napplication of an increased co-financing rate for programme countries. This\nprovision currently applies until 31 December 2013.\nArticle 93 of the General Regulation provides\nthat the Commission shall automatically decommit amounts for which an\napplication for payment has not been submitted before the end of the second\nyear (third year for countries whose GDP from 2001 to 2003 was below 85% of the\nEU average for commitments made into the programmes between 2008 and 2010) with\na special treatment of the 2007 commitment.\n\u00b7     \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nThe proposal is consistent with other proposals\nand initiatives adopted by the Commission as a response to the financial\ncrisis.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF INTEREST\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\u00b7     \nConsultation of interested parties\nThere was no consultation of external\nstakeholders\n\u00b7     \nProcurement and use of expertise\nUse of external expertise has not been\nnecessary.\n\u00b7     \nImpact analysis\nThe proposal would allow the Commission to top\nup payments to programme countries until the end of the 2007-2013 period. The\nincrease will be an amount calculated by applying ten percentage points top-up\nto the co-financing rates applicable to the priority axes of the programmes to\nthe newly certified expenditure submitted during the period in question until\nthe ceiling for payments is reached. \nAt the same time, it will allow Romania and\nSlovakia to submit expenditure claims up to the end of 2014, rather that up to\nthe end of 2013, for the 2011 commitment and up to closure, rather than up to\nthe end of 2014, for the 2012 commitment. This will reduce the risk of\nautomatic decommitment of the 2011 and 2012 commitments.\nThe total financial allocation for the period\nfrom the Funds to the countries and the programmes in question will not change.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the\nproposal\n\u00b7     \nSummary of the proposed measures\nIt is proposed to modify article 77 of the\nGeneral Regulation to allow the Commission to continue, until the end of the\n2007-2013 period, to reimburse the newly declared expenditure by an increased\namount calculated by applying a 10 percentage points top-up of the applicable\nco-financing rates for the priority axis.\nIn applying the top-up, the co-financing rate\nof the programme cannot exceed by more than 10 percentage points the maximum\nceilings of Annex III of the General Regulation. In addition, contribution from\nthe funds to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned\nin the Commission decision approving the operational programme.\nIt is also proposed to modify Article 93 of the\nGeneral Regulation to allow a one-year extension of the automatic decommitment\nperiod of the 2011 and 2012 commitments for Romania and Slovakia. \n\u00b7     \nLegal basis\nThe General Regulation defines the common rules\napplicable to the three Funds. Based on the principle of shared management\nbetween the Commission and the Member States, this Regulation includes\nprovisions for the programming process as well as arrangements for programme\n(including financial) management, monitoring, financial control and evaluation\nof projects.\n\u00b7     \nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal complies within the subsidiarity\nprinciple to the extent that it seeks to provide increased support through\nStructural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for certain Member States which are\nexperiencing serious difficulties, notably with respect to economic growth and\nfinancial stability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt\nposition, also as a result of the international economic and financial\nenvironment. In this context, it is necessary to establish at the Union level a\ntemporary mechanism which allows the Commission to increase the reimbursement\non the basis of the certified expenditure under Structural Funds and the\nCohesion Fund. \nThe proposal also complies with the\nsubsidiarity principle to the extent that it allows more time for certain\nMember States to spend their 2011 and 2012 commitments. This rule has already\nbeen set at Union level. \n\u00b7     \nProportionality principle\nThe proposal conforms to the proportionality\nprinciple:\nThe extension of the application of the\nincreased co-financing rates is proportional in relation to the sustained\neconomic crisis and to the other efforts undertaken to help these Member\nStates.\nThe extension of the deadline for automatic\ndecommitment is also proportional in that it is focused on those Member States\nwhich would see their financial allocations under the 2014-2020 period capped\nby the European Council agreement, to limit the risk of losing further\nallocations from the 2007-2013 period due to automatic decommitments.\n\u00b7     \nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: amendment of the current\nregulation.\nThe Commission has explored the scope for\nmanoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary, in the\nlight of experience up to now, to propose modifications to the General\nRegulation. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Budgetary impact\nThere is no impact on commitment appropriations\nsince no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds\nand Cohesion Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the\n2007-2013 programming period.\nFor payment appropriations, the proposal\nrelating to the top-up is budget neutral. However, it can result in a higher reimbursement\nto the Member States concerned in 2014, but will be balanced out at closure in\n2017. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal will imply an\nincrease of payment appropriations (for 2014 of approximately EUR 484 million)\nwhich will be compensated by the end of the programming period. Therefore, the\ntotal payment appropriations for the whole programming period remain unchanged.\nThe budgetary impact of the proposal to extend\nthe automatic de-commitment by one year for Romania and Slovakia does not change the total amount of commitment appropriations. However, it could have a net\npositive impact on total payment appropriations in future years linked to the\nreduced decommitment risk.\n2013/0156 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\n1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management for\ncertain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with\nrespect to their financial stability and to the decommitment rules for certain\nMember States\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[2],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[3],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The unprecedented global\nfinancial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth\nand financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial and\neconomic conditions in several Member States. In particular, certain Member\nStates are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such\ndifficulties, notably with problems in their economic growth and financial\nstability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt position, also as\na result of the international economic and financial environment.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst important actions\nto counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken,\nincluding amendments of the legislative framework, the impact of the financial\ncrisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens is being widely\nfelt. Pressure on national financial resources is increasing and further steps\nshould be taken to alleviate that pressure through the maximum and optimal use\nof the funding from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. In view of the\npersisting financial difficulties, it is necessary to extend the application of\nthe measures adopted by amending Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European\nParliament and of the Council[4].\nThese measures were adopted pursuant to to Articles 122(2), 136 and 143 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nmanagement of Union funding, to help accelerate investments in Member States\nand regions and to improve the availability of funding to the economy, Council\nRegulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on\nthe European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion\nFund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999[5]\nwas amended by Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council to allow the increase of interim payments from the Structural Funds\nas well as from the Cohesion Fund by an amount corresponding to ten percentage\npoints above the actual co-financing rate for each priority axis for Member\nStates which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial\nstability and have requested to benefit from this measure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 77(6) of\nRegulation (EC) No 1083/2006 allows for the application of an increased\nco-financing rate up to 31 December 2013. However, since Member States still\nface serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability the\nduration of the application of an increased co-financing rate should not be\nlimited until the end of 31 December 2013. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Regulation (EU) No \u2026\n(CPR) of the Council and the European Parliament] [The future Common\nProvisions Regulation] aims to contribute to achieving adequate\nconcentration of cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member\nStates. In order to contribute to the reduction of disparities in average per\ncapita aid intensities, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds\nto each individual Member State pursuant to future Regulations is foreseen to\nbe fixed at 2.35% of the GDP of the Member State. The capping will be applied\non an annual basis, and will - if applicable - proportionally reduce all\ntransfers (except for the more developed regions and \"European territorial\ncooperation\") to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum\nlevel of transfer. For Member States which acceded to the Union before 2013 and\nwhose average real GDP growth 2008-2010 was lower than -1%, the maximum level\nof transfer will be 2.59 %.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\n\u2026/\u2026[Common Provisions Regulation] caps the allocations per Member State at 110% of their level in real terms for the 2007-2013 period. Member States\naffected by this capping need to be further protected from the risk of\nautomatic decommitment of allocations in the 2007-2013 period.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its conclusions of 8\nFebruary 2013, the European Council invited the Commission to explore practical\nsolutions to reduce the risk of automatic de-commitment of the Funds from the\n2007-2013 national envelope for Romania and Slovakia, including the amendment\nof Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Council also highlighted\nthe need to ensure a manageable level and profile for the payments in all\nheadings in order to limit the outstanding budgetary commitments notably by\napplying rules for automatic decommitments in all headings. Hence, provisions\nreleasing the decommitment rules for Member States affected by the capping set\nout in Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 [Common Provisions Regulation] should be\nbalanced in view of its effects on the outstanding budgetary commitments.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The deadline for the\ncalculation of the automatic decommitment of the annual budget commitments for years\n2011 and 2012 should be extended by one year, but the 2012 budget commitment,\nwhich will still be open on 31 December 2015 is to be justifed by 31 December\n2015. This should help to improve the absorption of funding committed for\noperational programmes in Member States that are affected by the capping of\ntheir future cohesion policy allocations at 110% of their level in real terms\nfor the 2007-2013 period. Such flexibility is necessary in order to address a\nslower than expected implementation of programmes affecting in particular those\nMember States. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the unprecedented\ncrisis, swift adoption of support measures are needed and therefore it is\nappropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1083/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1083/2006 is amended as\nfollows:\n(1) In Article 77, paragraph 6 is deleted.\n(2) Article 93 is amended as follows:\n(a) The following paragraph 2b is inserted:\n\"2b.

However, it could have a net positive impact on\ntotal payment appropriations in future years linked to the reduced decommitment\nrisk.\nThe Commission has reviewed the need for\nadditional payment credits and thus proposes hereby the necessary actions to\nthe Budgetary Authority.\nEUR million (to 3 decimal places)\n   Expenditure type || Section no. ||   ||   Year n ||   n + 1 ||   n + 2 ||   n + 3 ||   n + 4 || n + 5 and later ||   Total \n Operational expenditure[6] ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Commitment Appropriations (CA) || 8.1 || a || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n Payment Appropriations (PA) ||   || b || n.a || +0.484 || n.a || \u00a0n.a. || -0.484 || n.a; || 0. \n Administrative expenditure within reference amount[7] ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Technical & administrative assistance (NDA) || 8.2.4 || c || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n TOTAL REFERENCE AMOUNT ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n Commitment Appropriations ||   || a+c || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n Payment Appropriations ||   || b+c || n.a. || +0.484 || n.a || n.a. || -0.484 || n.a. || 0,000   \n Administrative expenditure not included in reference amount[8] ||   ||   \n Human resources and associated expenditure (NDA) || 8.2.5 || d || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n Administrative costs, other than human resources and associated costs, not included in reference amount (NDA) || 8.2.6 || e || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \nTotal indicative financial cost of\nintervention \n TOTAL CA including cost of Human Resources ||   || a+c+d+e || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n TOTAL PA including cost of Human Resources ||   || b+c+d+e || n.a || n.a. || n.a || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a \nCo-financing details\nEUR million (to 3 decimal places)\n Co-financing body ||   ||   Year n ||   n + 1 ||   n + 2 ||   n + 3 ||   n + 4 || n + 5 and later ||   Total \n \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 || f || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n TOTAL CA including co-financing || a+c+d+e+f || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n4.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility\nwith Financial Programming\nx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal is compatible with existing financial programming.\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal will entail reprogramming of the relevant heading in\nthe financial perspective.\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal may require application of\nthe provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement[9] (i.e. flexibility instrument or\nrevision of the financial perspective).\n4.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial impact on Revenue\nx\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has no financial implications on revenue\n\u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal has financial impact \u2013 the effect on revenue is as\nfollows:\nEUR million\n(to one decimal place)\n   ||   || Prior to action [Year n-1] ||   || Situation following action \n Budget line || Revenue ||   || [Year n] || [n+1] || [n+2] || [n+3] || [n+4] || [n+5][10] \n   || a) Revenue in absolute terms ||   ||   || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n b) Change in revenue || \u00a0D ||   || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n(Please specify each revenue budget line\ninvolved, adding the appropriate number of rows to the table if there is an\neffect on more than one budget line.)\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Human\nResources FTE (including officials, temporary and external staff) \u2013 see detail\nunder point 8.2.1.\n   Annual requirements ||   Year n ||   n + 1 ||   n + 2 ||   n + 3 ||   n + 4 ||   n + 5 and later \n Total number of human resources || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. || n.a. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARACTERISTICS AND\nOBJECTIVES\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Need to be met in the\nshort or long term\nThe sustained financial\nand economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources,\nas Member States are reducing their budgets.
