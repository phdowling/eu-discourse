The European Council conclusions of January\n2012 highlighted the importance of unleashing the growth potential of a fully\nintegrated Single Market, including measures with regard to network industries.\nThe Commission Communication on Action for Stability, Growth and Jobs adopted\non 30 May 2012 stressed the importance of further reducing the regulatory\nburden and barriers to entry in the rail sector. Likewise, the Commission\nCommunication on strengthening the governance of the single market, adopted on\n8 June 2012[2]\nalso stressed the importance of the transport sector.\nAt the same time, the Commission has\nproposed for the next 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework to create the \u2018Connecting\nEurope Facility\u2019 (CEF) and allocate \u20ac 31.7 billion to transport\ninfrastructure out of the total \u20ac 50 billion envelope.\nIn the last decade, three legislative\n\"railway packages\" have progressively opened up national markets and\nmaking railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level. However,\ndespite the considerable development of the \u2018EU acquis\u2019, the modal share\nof rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This proposal targets the remaining\nobstacles that limit the effectiveness of railway markets.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Problems to be addressed\nRemaining obstacles relate first of all to\nthe access to the market for domestic passenger services. In many Member States\nthese markets are closed to competition, which does not only limit their development,\nbut also creates disparities between those Member States that have opened their\nmarkets, and those that have not. \nThe majority of domestic passenger services\ncannot be provided on a commercial basis alone and require support from the\nState. They are performed under public service contracts. Therefore this\nlegislative package also addresses the issue of competition for public service\ncontracts, and additional points such as the availability of rolling stock for\npotential bidders for such contracts, and integrated timetabling and ticketing\nsystems where they benefit the passenger.\nA second set of problems which prevent the\nrail market from developing its full potential are issues relating to the\ngovernance of infrastructure managers. Since infrastructure managers are\nnatural monopolies, they do not always react to the needs of the market and its\nusers, thus hindering the performance of the sector as a whole. In a number of\nMember States infrastructure managers are unable to fulfil their tasks, since\ntheir functions are separated between different bodies. Moreover, the current\nlegal framework has not led to improved cross-border cooperation among infrastructure\nmanagers.\nIn addition, a number of market entry\nbarriers result from situations where infrastructure management and transport\noperations are part of the same integrated structure. In such a case,\ninfrastructure managers face a conflict of interests as they have to take\naccount of the business interests of the integrated structure and its transport\nsubsidiaries and have an incentive to discriminate in the provision of access\nto the infrastructure.\nFinally, integrated structures make it much\nmore difficult to enforce the separation of accounts between infrastructure\nmanagement and transport operations. Regulators find it difficult to trace\nfinancial flows between the different subsidiaries and the holding company in\nan integrated structure. Accountancy tools allow for the artificial increase or\ndecrease of the results of the respective subsidiaries. Cross-subsidising\npractices and transfers of infrastructure funds to competitive activities are a\nserious market entry barrier for new operators that do not have the possibility\nto rely on such funds. Cross-subsidising practises may also imply State aid\ngranted to competitive activities.\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Objectives\nThe main objective of the European Union\u2019s\ntransport policy is to establish an internal market through a high degree of\ncompetitiveness and the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of\neconomic activities. The 2011 Transport White Paper stated that rail should\naccount for the majority of medium-distance passenger transport by 2050. This\nmodal shift would contribute to the 20 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\nforeseen in the Europe 2020 Agenda for smart, sustainable and innovative growth[3]. The White Paper concluded that\nno major change in transport would be possible without the support of adequate\ninfrastructure and a smarter approach to using it.\nThe overall objective of the Fourth Railway\nPackage is to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing any\nremaining legal, institutional and technical obstacles, and fostering the\nperformance of the railway sector and its competitiveness, in order to further\ndevelop the Single European Railway Area.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific Objectives\nThis proposal encompasses provisions with\nthe following aims: \na) The opening of the market for domestic\npassenger transport services by rail with\nthe objective of intensifying competitive pressure on domestic rail markets, in\norder to increase the quantity and improve the quality of passenger services.\nThese proposals have to be seen alongside the proposed amendments to Regulation\n1370/2007/EC (Public Service Obligations) and in this context aim to increase\nthe efficiency of the public financing of passenger services.\nb) Enhancing governance of the infrastructure\nmanager with the objective of ensuring equal access to the infrastructure. This\nshould be achieved through the removal of conflicts of interest affecting decisions\nof the infrastructure manager on market access and the elimination of the\npotential for cross-subsidisation, which exists in integrated structures. The\nproposal also aims to ensure that all of the infrastructure manager\u2019s functions\nwill be managed in a consistent manner. Finally, the proposal aims at\nstrengthening coordination between infrastructure managers and rail operators\nto better address market needs and at enhancing cross-border cooperation\nbetween infrastructure managers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn order to support the Commission in the\nimpact assessment process, an external consultant was asked to prepare a\nsupport study and to undertake a targeted consultation. The study was started\nin December 2011 and the final report was delivered in December 2012.\nTo gather the views of the stakeholders, a variety\nof targeted consultation methods was preferred to an open consultation. Between\n1 March and 16 April 2012, tailored questionnaires were sent to 427\nrail-related stakeholders (railway undertakings, infrastructure managers, public\ntransport ministries, safety authorities, ministries, representative bodies, workers\u2019\norganisations etc.). The response rate was 40 %. The views of passengers\nwere collected through a Eurobarometer survey that reached 25 000 members of\nthe public evenly spread over the 25 Member States with railways. The network\nof the Committee of the Regions was used to reach local and regional\nauthorities and the Sectoral Dialogue Committee on railways has also been\nconsulted.\nThese consultations were complemented with a\nstakeholder hearing held on 29 May 2012 (with some 85 participants), a\nconference with some 420 participants on 24 September 2012 and with interviews\nwith specific stakeholders throughout 2012. Commission staff met with\nrepresentatives from the Community of European, the European Passenger Transport\nOperators, the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, the European Passengers\u2019\nFederation, the European Rail Infrastructure Managers and UITP \u2013 the\nInternational Association of Public Transport. Visits and face-to-face\ninterviews with stakeholders were also organised in Italy, France, Germany, the\nNetherlands, Poland, Hungary, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nThe majority of stakeholders agreed during\nthe targeted consultation that the quality of rail services and the\ncompetitiveness of the sector in the EU were being affected by different access\nbarriers for railway undertakings. 69 % found different interpretation of\nlegislation to be an issue. Infrastructure capacity constraints were considered\nto be the main access barrier for railway undertakings (quoted by 83 %).\nThe result of the consultation showed that\nviews are highly polarised regarding the appropriateness of solutions that\nshould ensure the independent and efficient governance of railway infrastructure.\nA large majority of transport ministries, competition authorities, regulatory\nbodies, independent infrastructure managers and railway undertakings,\npassengers and freight forwarders\u2019 associations advocated a complete separation\nwhich would ensure full transparency and a level playing field for all\noperators. In contrast, holding companies, infrastructure managers depending on\nsuch holdings and workers\u2019 representatives referred to scientific literature that\nhighlights the disadvantages of separation, such as higher transaction costs\nand the risk of disconnection inefficiencies. These stakeholders thought that a\nstronger role of regulatory oversight could be sufficient to solve the issues.\n64 % of respondents supported the idea of creating a specific body of\nrepresentatives from all infrastructure users to ensure interests are taken\ninto account in a non-discriminatory way.\nThroughout the consultation process the\nCommission took a proactive approach to prompting stakeholders to participate.\nGiven that all relevant parties were given the opportunity to express their\nopinions, the Commission\u2019s minimum consultation standards were met.\nBased on the external study mentioned above\nand the conclusions of the stakeholder consultation process, the Commission\nmade a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of the proposed\nmeasures. This evaluation examined alternative options for new measures aiming to\nmodernise the existing regulatory framework.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n3.1. Definition of the infrastructure\nmanager (Article 3(2))\nThe clarification sets out all the relevant\nfunctions of infrastructure management that are to be performed by the\ninfrastructure manager, in order to ensure that all these functions are\nfulfilled in a consistent manner. It abolishes the option set out in the\nexisting text for functions of the infrastructure manager on a network or part\nof a network to be allocated to different bodies or firms. It also clarifies\nthe meaning of the different functions of infrastructure management.\n3.2. Definition of international passenger\nservices (Article 3, point 5)\nThe fifth Point of the existing Article 3\ndefines international passenger services. With the opening of the market for\ndomestic passenger transport services by rail, the distinction between\ninternational and domestic passenger services becomes irrelevant for the\npurpose of this Directive. This definition is therefore deleted.\n3.3. Separation of accounts within an\nintegrated group (Article 6(2))\nThe existing Article 6(2) allows for the\npossibility of organising infrastructure and transport services within a single\nundertaking while fulfilling the requirements of a separation of accounts.\nSince the proposal contains specific rules on the separation of the two activities,\nthis provision has to be deleted.\n3.4. Institutional separation of the infrastructure\nmanager (Article 7)\nThis provision establishes that\ninfrastructure managers should be able to fulfil all the necessary functions\nfor the sustainable development of the infrastructure. It also introduces the institutional\nseparation of the infrastructure manager from transport operations, by prohibiting\nthe same legal or natural person from having the right to control or exercise\ninfluence over an infrastructure manager and a railway undertaking at the same\ntime. It allows for the possibility of a Member State to be owner of both legal\nentities, in which control should be exercised by public authorities that are\nseparate and legally distinct from each other.\n3.5. Independence of infrastructure\nmanagers within vertically integrated undertakings (Articles 7a and 7b)\nThe proposal allows vertically integrated\nundertakings, including those with a holding structure, to maintain ownership\nof the infrastructure manager. However, it clarifies that this is only permissible\nif conditions are fulfilled which ensure that the infrastructure manager has\neffective decision-making rights for all its functions. It further sets out\nthat this must be guaranteed by strong and efficient safeguards protecting the\ninfrastructure manager\u2019s independence. It specifies that these safeguards should\nbe in place with regard to the structure of the undertaking, including the\nseparation of financial circuits between the infrastructure manager and other\ncompanies of the integrated group. It also sets out rules on the management\nstructure of the infrastructure manager.\n3.6. Verification of compliance (Article\n7c)\nThis provision establishes a possibility\nfor Member States to limit access rights of railway operators which are part of\nvertically integrated undertakings, in case the Commission is not a position to\nconfirm that safeguards to protect the independence of the infrastructure\nmanager have been effectively implemented. \n3.7. Coordination committee (Article 7d)\nThis provision seeks to ensure good\ncoordination between the infrastructure manager and the users of the network\nwhich are affected by his decisions, including applicants, representatives of\npassengers and users of freight services, and regional and local authorities. It\nlists the issues on which the infrastructure manager should take advice from\nthe users which include their needs on the development of the infrastructure,\nperformance targets, allocation and charging.\n3.8. European Network of Infrastructure\nManagers (Article 7e)\nThe proposal creates a forum for the\ncooperation of infrastructure managers across borders, with a view to developing\nthe European rail network. This includes cooperation on the establishment of\nthe core network corridors, the rail freight corridors and the implementation\nof the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) deployment plan. The\nproposal also covers the role to be played by this Network in monitoring the performance\nof infrastructure managers with the aim of improving the quality of services\noffered by infrastructure managers.\n3.9. Conditions of access to railway\ninfrastructure (Article 10)\nArticle 10(2) is amended to grant to\nEuropean railway undertakings access rights for the purpose of operating\ndomestic passenger services. Since the distinction made in the existing\nlegislation between international and domestic services is removed, Article\n10(3) and 10(4), whose purpose had been to determine the international or\ndomestic nature of a service, have to be deleted.\n3.10. Limitation of the right of access\n(Article 11)\nThis provision gives Member States the\npossibility to limit access rights for the purpose of operating domestic or\ninternational services if the exercise of this right would compromise the\neconomic equilibrium of a public service contract. As is currently the case for\ninternational services, the provision stipulates that regulatory bodies have the\nresponsibility to determine whether the economic equilibrium of a public\nservice contract is being compromised by a domestic service according to common\nprocedures and criteria.\n3.11. Common information and integrated\nticketing schemes (Article 13a)\nIn order to ensure that passengers continue\nto benefit from network effects, this provision gives Member States the possibility\nto establish information and integrated ticketing schemes common to all railway\nundertakings operating domestic passenger services in a way that does not\ndistort competition. In addition, it provides for the adoption of coordinated\ncontingency plans by railway undertakings to provide assistance to passengers if\nthere is a major disruption of traffic.\n3.12 Capacity rights (Article 38(4))\nWith a view to giving all market players\nsufficient legal certainty to develop their activities, this provision is amended.\nIt defines the time frame within which regulatory bodies should assess whether\nthe economic equilibrium of a public service contract would be compromised.\nThis is consistent with the process for the allocation of infrastructure\ncapacity.\n2013/0029 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\n\namending Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area, as regards the\nopening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and the\ngovernance of the railway infrastructure\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the past decade, the\ngrowth of passenger traffic by rail has been insufficient to increase its modal\nshare in comparison to cars and aviation. The 6 % modal share of passenger\ntransport for rail in the European Union has remained fairly stable. Rail\npassenger services have not kept pace with evolving needs in terms of offer or quality.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union markets for\nfreight and for international passenger trains have been opened to competition since\n2007 and 2010 respectively through Directives 2004/51/EC[6] and 2007/58//EC[7]. In addition, some Member\nStates have opened their domestic passenger services to competition, either by\nintroducing open access rights or competitive tendering for public service\ncontracts or both.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2012/34/EU of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a\nsingle European railway area[8]\nestablishes a single European railway area with common rules on the governance\nof railway undertakings and infrastructure managers, on infrastructure\nfinancing and charging, on conditions of access to railway infrastructure and\nservices and on regulatory oversight of the rail market. With all these\nelements in place, it is now possible to complete the opening of the Union railway\nmarket and reform the governance of infrastructure managers with the objective\nof ensuring equal access to the infrastructure.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2012/34/EU requires\nthe Commission to propose, if appropriate, legislative measures in relation of\nthe opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and\nto develop appropriate conditions to ensure non-discriminatory access to\ninfrastructure, building on the existing separation requirements between\ninfrastructure management and transport operations.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Better coordination\nbetween infrastructure managers and railway undertakings should be ensured\nthrough the establishment of a coordination committee, in order to achieve\nefficient management and use of the infrastructure.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should also\nensure that all functions necessary to the sustainable operations, maintenance,\nand development of the rail infrastructure will be managed in a consistent\nmanner by the infrastructure manager itself.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cross-border issues should\nbe addressed efficiently between infrastructure managers of the different\nMember States through the establishment of a European network of infrastructure\nmanagers.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure equal\naccess to the infrastructure, any conflicts of interest resulting from\nintegrated structures encompassing infrastructure management and transport\nactivities should be removed. Removing incentives to\ndiscriminate against competitors is the only way to guarantee equal access to the railway infrastructure. It is a requirement\nfor the successful opening of the market for domestic\npassenger transport services by rail. This should also remove the potential for\ncross-subsidisation, which exists in such integrated structures, and which also\nleads to market distortions.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing requirements\nfor the independence of infrastructure managers from railway transport\nundertakings, as laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU, only cover the essential functions\nof the infrastructure manager, which are the decision-making on train path\nallocation, and the decision-making on infrastructure charging. It is however\nnecessary that all the functions are exercised in an independent way, since\nother functions may equally be used to discriminate against competitors. This\nis in particular true for decisions on investments or on maintenance which may\nbe made to favour the parts of the network which are mainly used by the\ntransport operators of the integrated undertaking. Decisions on the planning of\nmaintenance works may influence the availability of train paths for the\ncompetitors. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing requirements\nof Directive 2012/34/EU only include legal, organisational and decision-making\nindependence. This does not entirely exclude the possibility of maintaining an\nintegrated undertaking, as long as these three categories of independence are\nensured. Concerning the decision-making independence it must be ensured that\nthe appropriate safeguards exclude control of an integrated undertaking over\nthe decision-making of an infrastructure manager. However, even the full\napplication of such safeguards does not completely remove all the possibilities\nfor discriminatory behaviour towards competitors which exist in the presence of\na vertically integrated undertaking. In particular, the potential for\ncross-subsidisation still exists in integrated structures, or at least it is\nvery difficult for regulatory bodies to control and enforce safeguards which\nare established to prevent such cross-subsidisation. An institutional\nseparation of infrastructure management and transport operation is the most\neffective measure to solve these problems. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\ntherefore be required to ensure that the same legal or natural person or\npersons are not entitled to exercise control over an infrastructure manager\nand, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a railway\nundertaking. Conversely, control over a railway undertaking should preclude the\npossibility of exercising control or any right over an infrastructure manager.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Member States still\nmaintain an infrastructure manager which is part of a vertically integrated\nundertaking, they should at least introduce strict safeguards to guarantee\neffective independence of the entire infrastructure manager in relation to the\nintegrated undertaking. These safeguards should not only concern the corporate\norganisation of the infrastructure manager in relation to the integrated\nundertaking, but also the management structure of the infrastructure manager,\nand, as far as possible within an integrated structure, prevent financial\ntransfers between the infrastructure manager and the other legal entities of\nthe integrated undertaking. These safeguards do not only correspond to what is\nnecessary to fulfil the existing requirements of decision-making independence\nof the essential functions under Directive 2012/34/EU, in terms of management\nindependence of the infrastructure manager, but go beyond those requirements by\nadding clauses to exclude that incomes of the infrastructure manager may be\nused to fund the other entities within the vertically integrated undertaking.\nThis should apply independently of the application of fiscal legislation of\nMember States and without prejudice to EU state aid rules.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the implementation\nof the safeguards guaranteeing independence vertically integrated undertakings could\nabuse of their structure to provide undue competitive advantages for railway\noperators belonging to such undertakings, For this reason, without prejudice to\nArt 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission\nshould verify, upon request of a Member State or on its own initiative, that these\nsafeguards are effectively implemented and that any remaining distortions of\ncompetition are removed. In case the Commission is not in a position to confirm\nthat this has been achieved, all Member States should have the possibility to limit\nor revoke access rights of the integrated operators concerned. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granting\nUnion railway undertakings the right of access to railway infrastructure in all\nMember States for the purpose of operating domestic passenger services may have\nimplications for the organisation\nand financing of rail passenger services provided under a public service\ncontract. Member States should have the option of limiting such right of access\nwhere it would compromise the economic equilibrium of those public service\ncontracts and where approval has been given by the\nrelevant regulatory body. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulatory\nbodies should assess the potential economic impact of domestic passenger\nservices provided under open\naccess conditions on existing public service contracts following\na request made by interested parties and on the basis of an objective economic\nanalysis.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The process\nof the\nassessment should take into account the need to provide all market players with sufficient legal\ncertainty to develop their activities. The procedure should be as simple,\nefficient and transparent as possible and coherent with the process for the allocation of infrastructure capacity.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nassessment of whether the economic equilibrium of the public service contract would\nbe compromised should take into account predetermined criteria. Such criteria\nand the details of procedure to be followed may evolve over time, in particular\nin the light of the experience of regulatory bodies, competent authorities and\nrailway undertakings and may take\ninto account the specific characteristics of domestic passenger services. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\nassessing whether the economic equilibrium of the public service contract would\nbe compromised, regulatory bodies should consider the economic impact of the intended\nservice on existing public service contracts taking into account its impact on the profitability of any services included in such\npublic service contracts and the consequences for the net cost to the competent public authority that awarded the\ncontracts.
