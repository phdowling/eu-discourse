Although\nsome of the imbalances have emerged as a result of negative spill-overs from\nthe euro-area crisis and developments in Greece, others have been domestic and longer-lasting.\nAmidst consecutive downgradings by credit rating agencies of Cypriot sovereign bonds,\nthe country became unable to refinance itself at rates compatible with\nlong-term fiscal sustainability. In parallel, the banking sector was\nincreasingly cut off from international market funding and\nmajor financial institutions recorded substantial capital shortfalls. The\nsituation in the banking sector worsened dramatically in early-2013, due to a\ndrop in confidence leading to continuous and substantial deposit outflows. In\nMarch 2013, the Eurogroup reached a political agreement on the key elements of\na macroeconomic adjustment programme for Cyprus with a financial envelope of up\nto EUR 10 billion. Following financial turmoil, a bank holiday of 10 days was\nimposed, during which the sector was downsized substantially through resolution\nand restructuring of banks and separation of the Greek operations of Cypriot\nbanks. \nAgainst the\nbackground of these severe economic and financial disturbances, the Cypriot\nauthorities officially requested financial assistance in the form of a loan from\nEuropean Financial Stability Facility / European Stability Mechanism on 25 June\n2012, as well as from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with a view to\nsupporting the return of the economy to sustainable growth, ensuring a\nproperly-functioning banking system, and safeguarding financial stability in\nthe European Union and in the euro area. On 27 June\n2012, the Eurogroup invited the Commission, in liaison\nwith the European Central Bank (ECB), the Cypriot authorities and the IMF, to\nagree on a macroeconomic adjustment programme, including the financing needs,\nand to take appropriate action to safeguard financial stability. On 16 March and 25 March 2013, the Eurogroup reached a political\nagreement with the Cypriot authorities on the key elements of a programme, which\nincluded the restructuring and substantial downsizing of the banking sector and\nthe reinforcement of efforts on fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and privatisation.\nAn important part of the agreement was that the recapitalisation of banks would\nbe almost exclusively generated from within the banks (i.e. from shareholders\nand creditors). Deposits up to EUR 100,000 were to remain unaffected. Creditors\nwere not to suffer losses superior to the losses they would have incurred, had\nthe banks been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. On 2 April 2013,\nan agreement at technical level was reached in respect of a comprehensive\npolicy package to be implemented in a 3-year macroeconomic adjustment\nprogramme; the key objectives, measures and outcomes were laid down in a draft\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Commission and the Republic of\nCyprus.\nThe macroeconomic\nadjustment programme shall aim at restoring financial market confidence, re-establishing\nsound macroeconomic balances and enabling the economy to return to sustainable\ngrowth. To achieve these goals, the programme builds on three pillars. The first\npillar is a financial sector strategy based on\nrestructuring and downsizing of its financial institutions and strengthening its\nsupervision, with efforts to address capital and liquidity shortfalls. The second pillar is an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy,\nbuilding on the consolidation efforts intiated in 2012, in particular through\nmeasures to reduce current primary expenditure, enhance government revenues,\nimprove the functioning of the public sector and maintain fiscal consolidation\nin the medium-term. The aim is to correct the excessive general government\ndeficit and put the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path in\nthe medium term. The authorities are committed to\nreducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP as soon as possible. The good\nimplementation of Structural and other EU Funds, as well as EU policy\ninitiatives aimed at enhancing jobs and growth, should be preserved. This will\ncontribute to the long-term growth path for Cyprus. The\nthird pillar consists of an ambitious structural reform agenda, with a view to\nsupporting competitiveness and sustainable and balanced growth, in line with\ncountry-specific recommendations addressed to Cyprus in 2012, and allowing for\nthe unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances. Recalling\nthe political agreement of 28 February 2013 on a Council Recommendation on\nEstablishing a Youth Guarantee, opportunities for young people and their\nemployability prospects should be maintained.\nThe programme\ncovers the period 2013-2016. \n2013/0121 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\naddressed to the Republic of Cyprus on\nspecific measures to restore financial stability and sustainable growth\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 136(1), in\nconjunction with Article 126(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 136(1) of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) foresees the possibility\nof adopting measures specific to Member States whose currency is the euro in\norder to ensure the proper functioning of economic and monetary union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 13 July 2010, the\nCouncil adopted a Decision under Article 126(6) of the TFEU stating that an\nexcessive deficit existed in Cyprus[1]\nand issued a Recommendation to Cyprus under Article 126(7) of the TFEU with a\nview to bringing an end to the situation of an excessive government deficit\nstating that 'Cyprus's authorities should put an end to the present excessive\ndeficit situation as rapidly as possible and at the latest by 2012'.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Recommendation on\nthe National Reform Programme 2012 of Cyprus and delivering an opinion on the\nStability Programme for Cyprus, 2012-2015[2],\nthe Council recommended, inter alia, that Cyprus take action to achieve a\ndurable correction of the excessive deficit in 2012, ensure sufficient progress\nwith the debt reduction benchmark, strengthen regulatory provisions for the\nefficient recapitalisation of the financial institutions and improve\ncompetitiveness.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus has been under\nincreasing pressure in financial markets, against the background of rising\nconcerns about the sustainability of its public finances, including the\nrequired public support measures to the weakened financial sector. Although\nsome of the imbalances have emerged as a result of negative spill-overs from\nthe euro-area crisis, others have been domestic and longer-lasting.[3] Amidst consecutive downgrades\nby credit rating agencies of Cypriot sovereign bonds, the country became unable\nto refinance itself at rates compatible with long-term fiscal sustainability.\nIn parallel, the banking sector was increasingly cut off from international\nmarket funding and major institutions recorded substantial capital shortfalls.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of these severe\neconomic and financial conditions, the Cypriot authorities officially requested\nfinancial assistance under the terms of a loan by the European Financial\nStability Facility / European Stability Mechanism on 25 June 2012, as well as\nfrom the IMF, with a view to supporting the return of the economy to\nsustainable growth, ensuring a properly-functioning banking system and\nsafeguarding financial stability in the European Union and in the euro area. On\n27 June 2012, the Eurogroup invited the Commission, in\nliaison with the ECB, the Cypriot authorities, and the IMF to agree on a macroeconomic\nadjustment programme, including the financing needs, and to take appropriate\naction to safeguard financial stability in the current very challenging\nenvironment with a risk of spill-over effects from sovereign market turbulence. On 16 March and 25 March 2013, the Eurogroup reached a political\nagreement with the Cypriot authorities on the cornerstones of a programme. The\nbanking sector were to be restructured and downsized and efforts were to be\nstepped-up on fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and privatisation.\nRecapitalisation of banks were to be almost exclusively generated from within\nthe banks (i.e. from shareholders and creditors). \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the current\ncircumstances Cyprus should adopt a comprehensive policy package to be\nimplemented in a 3-year macroeconomic adjustment programme over a period from 2013-Q2\nto 2016-Q1.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The policy package should aim\nat restoring financial market confidence, re-establishing sound macroeconomic\nbalances and enabling the economy to return to sustainable growth. It should be\nstructured on three pillars. The first pillar should be a financial sector\nstrategy based on restructuring and downsizing financial institutions and\nstrengthening supervision of the sector, with efforts to address capital and\nliquidity shortfalls. The second pillar should be an\nambitious front-loaded fiscal consolidation strategy in particular through\nmeasures to reduce current primary expenditure, enhance government revenues,\nimprove the functioning of the public sector and maintain fiscal consolidation\nin the medium-term, while minimising the impact on disadvantaged people and\npreserving the good implementation of Structural and other EU Funds. The third pillar should consist of an ambitious structural reform\nagenda, with a view to supporting competitiveness and sustainable and balanced\ngrowth, allowing for the unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances, in particular\nby reforming the wage indexation system, in consultation with social partners,\nand removing obstacles to the smooth functioning of markets. Recalling the\npolitical agreement of 28 February 2013 on a Council Recommendation on\nEstablishing a Youth Guarantee, opportunities for young people and their\nemployability prospects should be maintained.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Commission\u2019s updated\nforecast for nominal GDP growth (-0.5% in 2012, -8.2% in 2013, -2.9% in 2014, 2.6%\nin 2015 and 3.7% in 2016), the debt-to-GDP ratio would amount to 87% in 2012, 109%\nin 2013, 123% in 2014, 126% in 2015 and 122% in 2016. The debt-to-GDP ratio\nwould therefore increase rapidly until 2015 and move to a declining path\nthereafter, reaching an estimated 105% in 2020. Debt dynamics are affected by\nseveral below-the-line operations. Under the Commission\u2019s updated forecast for\nnominal GDP growth, the primary general government balance is projected to\nattain a deficit of EUR 395 million (2.4% of GDP) in 2013, a deficit of EUR 678\nmillion (4.3% of GDP) in 2014, a deficit of EUR 344 million (2.1% of GDP) in\n2015 and a surplus of EUR 204 million (1.2% of GDP) in 2016.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the long-term\nresilience of the Cypriot banking sector is critical to restoring financial\nstability in Cyprus and - given the strong interlinkages \u2013 preserving financial\nstability in the euro area as a whole. Substantial downsizing and restructuring\nof the Cypriot banking sector is under way. The House of Representatives adopted\nlegislation establishing a comprehensive framework for the recovery and resolution\nof credit institutions. Using this new framework, the Cypriot banking sector\nhas been downsized immediately and significantly. To preserve the liquidity of\nthe Cypriot banking sector, temporary administrative measures have been\nimposed.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of comprehensive\nand ambitious reforms in financial, fiscal and structural areas should\nsafeguard the medium-term sustainability of the Cypriot public debt.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison with\nthe ECB, and if relevant the IMF, should verify at regular intervals the rigorous\nimplementation of the macroeconomic adjustment programme through missions and\nregular reporting by the Cypriot authorities, on a quarterly basis. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the\nimplementation of the policy package, the Commission should provide additional\npolicy advice and technical assistance in specific areas.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Cypriot authorities\nshould involve, in accordance with current national rules and practices, the\nsocial partners and civil society organisations in the preparation,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation of the financial assistance programme.\n\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any form of financial\nassistance received to help implementing the policies under the macroeconomic\nadjustment programme must be in line with European Union legal requirements and\npolicies, in particular with the Union economic governance framework. Any intervention\nin support of financial institutions must be carried out in accordance with the\nEuropean Union\u2019s rules on competition. The Commission will ensure that any\nmeasures laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding in the context of requested\nESM financial assistance is fully consistent with the present decision. \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to facilitate the\nreturn of the Cypriot economy to a path of sustainable growth and to fiscal and\nfinancial stability, Cyprus shall rigorously implement a macroeconomic\nadjustment programme, the main elements of which are laid down in Article 2 of\nthis decision. The macroeconomic adjustment programme (hereafter the \"programme\")\nshall address the specific risks emanating from Cypus for the financial\nstability of the euro area and shall aim at rapidly re-establishing a sound and\nsustainable economic and financial situation in Cyprus and restore its capacity\nto finance itself fully on the financial markets. The programme shall take due\naccount of the recommendations addressed to Cyprus under Articles 121, 126, 136\nand 148 TFEU as well as its actions to comply with them, while aiming at\nbroadening, strengthening and deepening the required policy measures.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\nwith the ECB, and if relevant the IMF, shall monitor the progress made in the\nimplementation of the programme. Cyprus shall give the Commission and the ECB\nits full cooperation. It shall in particular provide to the Commission and the\nECB all the information that they deem necessary for the monitoring of the programme.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission, in liaison\nwith the ECB and, where appropriate, with the IMF, shall examine with the Cypriot\nauthorities any changes and updates to the programme that may be needed in\norder to take proper account of, inter alia, any significant gap between\nmacroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and realised figures (including employment),\nnegative spill-over effects, as well as macroeconomic and financial shocks. In\norder to ensure the smooth implementation of the programme and to help the\ncorrection of imbalances in a sustainable way, the Commission shall provide\ncontinued advice and guidance on fiscal, financial market and structural\nreforms. The Commission shall periodically assess the economic impact of the programme\nand shall recommend necessary corrections with a view to enhancing growth and\njob creation, securing the necessary fiscal consolidation, and minimising\nharmful social impacts.\nArticle 2 \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The key objectives of the Cypriot\nprogramme are: the restoration of the soundness of the Cypriot banking sector; the\ncontinuation of the on-going process of fiscal consolidation; and the implemention\nof structural reforms to support competitiveness and sustainable and balanced\ngrowth.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus shall pursue fiscal\nconsolidation consistent with its obligations under the excessive deficit\nprocedure by means of high-quality permanent measures while minimising the\nimpact on disadvantaged people.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus shall adopt the measures\nspecified in paragraphs 4 to 15. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to reduce the\ndeficit to below 3% of GDP as soon as possible, Cyprus shall stand ready to\ntake additional consolidation measures. Specifically, in the event of\nunderperformance of revenues or higher social spending needs due to adverse\nmacroeconomic effects, the government shall stand ready to take additional measures\nto preserve the programme's objectives, including by reducing discretionary\nspending, while minimising the impact on disadvantaged people. Over the programme period, cash revenues above the programme\nprojections, including any windfall gains, shall be saved or used to reduce\ndebt. If instead over-performance materialises, to the extent that it is deemed\npermanent, this can reduce the need for additional measures in the outer years.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyprus shall preserve the\ngood implementation of Structural and other EU Funds.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to restoring\nthe soundness of the financial sector, Cyprus shall continue to thoroughly\nreform and restructure the banking sector and reinforce viable banks by\nrestoring their capital, addressing their liquidity situation and strengthening\ntheir supervision.

The recently-imposed temporary restrictions on the free movement of\ncapital (inter alia, limits on cash withdrawals,\nelectronic payments and transfers abroad) will be\nclosely monitored. The goal is that controls will remain in place no longer than strictly necessary to prevent\nserious and immediate risks for financial stability. The\nmedium-term funding and capital plans of domestic banks\nrelying on central bank funding\nor receiving state aid should realistically reflect the\nanticipated deleveraging in the banking sector, and reduce dependency on\nborrowing from the central banks, while avoiding asset fire sales and a credit\ncrunch. The regulations on the minimun liquidity\nrequirements will be updated to prevent concentration in euro-denominated\nassets in the future;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 establishing an independent valuation\nof the assets of Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank and quickly\nintergrating the operations of Cyprus Popular Bank into Bank of Cyprus.

Any restructuring or\nresolution plans shall be formally approved under state-aid rules, before such state\naid is provided;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring that a credit register is\ncreated, that the current regulatory framework on loan processes is reviewed\nand amended, if necessay, and that legislation strengthening the governance of\ncommercial banks is adopted;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strengthening banks' governance,\nincluding by prohibiting lending to independent board members or their\nconnected parties;\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 maximising recovery for non-performing\nloans, while minimising incentives for strategic default by borrowers. This\nwill include easing constraints on the seizure of collateral and proper\nmonitoring and managing of non-perfroming loans. The Central Bank of Cyprus\nwill issue guidance to classify as non-performing all loans past due by more\nthan 90 days;\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 aligning the regulation and\nsupervision of cooperative credit institutions to those of commercial banks;\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ascertaining the viability of\ncooperative credit institutions and developing, in consultation with the Commission\nand informing the ECB and the IMF, a strategy for the future structure,\nfunctioning and viability of the cooperative credit institution sector.
