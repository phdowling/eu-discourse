The investigation also found that it was not against the\nUnion interest to impose anti-subsidy measures.\nTherefore, it\nis proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation in\norder to impose definitive anti-subsidy measures on imports of crystalline\nsilicon photovoltaic modules and key components (i.e. cells) originating in the\nPeople's Republic of China.\nThe product scope subject to measures does\nnot include wafers which were initially part of the investigation. This is\nbecause wafers have specific characteristics different from the product\nconcerned.\nLegal basis\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11\nJune 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members\nof the European Community (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019).\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\nproportionality principle for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and\nadministrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional\nand local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and\nproportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instrument: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate because\nthe basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the EU\nbudget.\n2013/0370 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive countervailing duty\non imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components (i.e.\ncells) originating in or consigned from the People's Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of\nthe European Community[1],\nand in particular Article 17 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by the\nEuropean Commission, after consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 8 November 2012, the\nEuropean Commission (the \u2018Commission\u2019) announced by a notice published in the Official\nJournal of the European Union[2]\n('Notice of Initiation'), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with\nregard to imports into the Union of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules\nand key components (i.e. cells and wafers) originating in the People's Republic\nof China ('PRC' or the 'country concerned').\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The anti-subsidy\nproceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 26 September\n2012 by EU ProSun ('the complainant') on behalf of producers representing in this case more than 25 % of the total Union production of crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic modules and key components. The complaint contained prima facie\nevidence of subsidisation of the said product and of material injury resulting\ntherefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a\nproceeding. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior\nto the initiation of the proceeding and in accordance with Article 10(7) of Council\nRegulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised\nimports from countries not members of the European Community (\u2018the basic\nRegulation\u2019)[3], the Commission notified the Government of the PRC ('the GOC') that\nit had received a properly documented complaint alleging that subsidised\nimports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components\noriginating in the PRC were causing material injury to the Union industry. The\nGOC was invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as\nregards the contents of the complaint and arriving at a mutually agreed\nsolution. The GOC accepted the offer of consultations which were subsequently\nheld. During the consultations, no mutually agreed solution could be arrived\nat. However, due note was taken of comments made by the GOC regarding the non-countervailability\nof the schemes listed in the complaint. Following the consultations,\nsubmissions were received from the GOC. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel\nanti-dumping proceeding\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 6 September 2012, the\nCommission had announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union[4], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports\ninto the Union of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components\n(i.e. cells and wafers) originating in the PRC. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 6 June 2013, the\nCommission, by Regulation (EU) No 513/2013[5],\nimposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic modules and key components (i.e. cells and wafers) originating in or\nconsigned from the PRC (\u201cProvisional anti-dumping Regulation\u201d).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninjury analyses performed in the present anti-subsidy and the parallel\nanti-dumping investigation are based on the same definition of the Union\nindustry, the representative Union producers and the investigation period and\nled to identical conclusions unless otherwise specified. This was considered\nappropriate in order to streamline the injury analysis and to reach consistent\nfindings in both proceedings. For this reason, comments on injury aspects put\nforward in any of these proceedings were taken into account in both\nproceedings.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Registration\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\na request by the complainant supported by the required evidence the Commission\nadopted on 1 March 2013 Regulation No 182/2013 making imports of crystalline\nsilicon PV modules and key components (i.e. cells and wafers) originating in or\nconsigned from the PRC subject to registration as of 6 March 2013. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the decision for registration of imports was unfounded, as the\nconditions were not met pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.\nHowever, these claims were not substantiated or based on factual evidence. At the time the decision was taken to register imports the\nCommission had sufficient prima facie evidence justifying the need to\nregister imports, in particular a sharp increase both in terms of absolute\nimports and in terms of market share. The claims in this regard had therefore\nto be rejected.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\nproceeding\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the complainants, other known Union producers, the known exporting\nproducers in the PRC, the PRC authorities and known importers of the initiation\nof the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their\nviews known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in\nthe Notice of Initiation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the apparent\nhigh number of exporting producers, Union producers and unrelated importers,\nall known exporting producers and unrelated importers were asked to make\nthemselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the Notice\nof Initiation, basic information on their activities related to the product\nconcerned during the investigation period as defined in recital (38) below.\nThis information was requested under Article 27 of the basic Regulation in\norder to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary\nand if so, to select samples. The authorities of the PRC were also consulted. \n(a)         \nSampling of exporting producers\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initially 121 Chinese\nexporting producers/groups of producers provided the requested information and\nagreed to be included in a sample. The cooperating companies represent more\nthan 80 % of the total Chinese export volume. On the basis of the information\nreceived from the exporting producers and in accordance with Article 27 of the\nbasic Regulation the Commission initially proposed a sample of seven exporting\nproducers/groups of exporting producers. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The selected sample of\nseven groups of companies consists of the three cooperating exporters with the\nlargest volume of exports of modules, the two cooperating exporters with the\nlargest volume of exports of cells and the two cooperating exporters with the\nlargest volume of exports of wafers. The sample of these seven groups of\nexporting producers served as the basis to determine the level of subsidisation\nfor those groups as well as the level of subsidisation for all cooperating\nexporting producers not included in the sample, as required by Articles 15(2)\nand 15(3) of the basic Regulation. As explained in recital (46) below, the\nCommission excluded wafers from the product scope in the definitive stage of\nthe investigation. Certain companies were selected into the sample on the basis\nof their largest volumes of exports of wafers. However, taking into account the\nfact that the Commission had already investigated these companies, verified the\ndata submitted by them and also the fact that all of these companies had\nsignificant exports of modules and/or cells it was not deemed necessary to\namend the sample\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The number of sampled\nexporting producers was eventually deemed to be eight companies/groups. This is\nbecause, although it was initially reported that the Jinko Solar Co. Ltd and Renesola\nJiangsu Ltd were related, it was subsequently established that they were not. \n(b)         \nSampling of Union producers \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission announced in the Notice of Initiation that it had provisionally\nselected a sample of Union producers. All known Union producers and known\nproducers' association were informed about the selection of the provisional\nsample of Union producers. This provisional sample consisted of nine Union\nproducers out of the around 215 Union producers that were known prior to the\ninitiation of the investigation to produce the like product, selected on the\nbasis of the largest representative volume of production, taking into account\nthe sales volume and the geographical location that could reasonably be\ninvestigated within the time available. It was ensured that the sample covers\nboth vertically integrated and non-integrated Union producers. Interested\nparties were also invited to make their views known on the provisional sample. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several\ninterested parties raised the following objections concerning the provisional\nsample of Union producers:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties submitted that the\nlimited information provided with regard to the provisionally selected sample\nwas insufficient and prevented them from making any meaningful comments on the\nproposed sample. In particular, they criticised that the identity of the Union\nproducers was kept confidential and requested that the Member States where the\nsampled Union producers were located should be disclosed, as well as the\nselected Union producers\u2019 share of production in the total production volume of\nPV modules and cells and the percentage of production and sales represented by\nthe sampled companies individually and by the sample as a whole. \n(ii) The method used for the selection of the\nsample was contested on the grounds that it \u2018confuses three different steps\u2019,\nnamely the support for the initiation of the investigation, definition of the\nUnion industry and sampling. Therefore, it was claimed that it was unclear\nwhether the Union industry was already defined at the time of the selection of\nthe sample, and therefore whether the sample could be considered as\nrepresentative. Without defining the Union industry at sampling stage, interested\nparties were prevented from verifying whether the provisional sample was\nrepresentative, and thus whether on the basis of the sample, the situation of\nthe Union industry during the investigation period as defined in recital (38)\nbelow could be correctly assessed. Furthermore, it was claimed that it was\ninappropriate to select the provisional sample on the basis of the replies of\nthe Union producers to the examination of the support for the initiation of the\ninvestigation.\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was also claimed that the\nprovisional sample was selected merely on the basis of companies which have\nexpressed their support to the present investigation.\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that, since\nvertically integrated companies are included in the provisional sample, the\nproduction volume of cells may be double or triple counted which casts doubts\non the overall representativity of the sample. It was requested that for\nvertically integrated producers only the production volume of modules should be\ncounted, but not the volume of cells.\n(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party alleged that the data\non which the selection of the sample was based were at least partly unreliable\nwhich could have an impact on the representativity of the provisional sample as\na whole.\n(vi) One party provided a list containing\nallegedly around 150 additional Union producers of the like product, claiming\nthat they should have been taken into consideration for the purposes of\nselecting a sample of Union producers.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arguments raised by the\nparties were addressed as follows: The Union producers requested that their\nnames be kept confidential due to the risk of retaliation. There were indeed\nreal threats against Union producers to harm their business both in the Union and outside. The Commission considered that these requests were sufficiently\nsubstantiated to be granted. The disclosure of the location or share in\nproduction and sales of individual Union producers selected in the sample could\neasily reveal the identity of the producer concerned and the requests in this\nregard had to be rejected.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission did not\n\u2018confuse\u2019 the determination of the support for the initiation of the\ninvestigation, the determination of the Union industry and the selection of\nprovisional sample as these steps remained independent from each other and were\ndecided upon separately. It was not demonstrated to what extent the use of\nproduction and sales data provided by the Union producers in the context of the\nexamination of the support for the initiation of the investigation had affected\nthe representativity of the sample. At initiation the Union industry had indeed\nbeen provisionally defined. All available information concerning the Union\nproducers, including information provided in the complaint and data collected\nfrom Union producers and other parties before the initiation of the\ninvestigation, was used in order to provisionally establish the total Union\nproduction for the investigation period, as defined in recital (38) below.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Union producers that\nreplied to questions related to the support for the initiation of the\ninvestigation were considered for the sample, regardless of whether they\nsupported, opposed or expressed no opinion on the investigation. This claim was\ntherefore rejected.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question of\ndouble/triple counting has been considered when the provisional sample was\nselected. It appeared that excluding production and sales of cells of the\nvertically integrated Union producers would not take into consideration the\npart of the production of cells sold on the free market. It was therefore\nconsidered that excluding sales of cells from the total production volume would\nnot necessarily lead to a more representative sample. Furthermore, the\nrepresentativity of the sample was established not only on the basis of the\nproduction volume but also on the basis of the geographical spread and a\nbalanced representation of vertically integrated and non-integrated producers.\nThe relative representativeness of the production volume was calculated at the\nlevel of each type of the like product. On this basis, it was considered that\nthe methodology to select the provisional sample was reasonable and the sample\nis therefore considered representative for the Union industry of the product\nunder investigation as a whole. Therefore, this claim was rejected. As far as\nthe reliability of data is concerned, the sample was selected on the basis of\nthe information available at the time of the selection of the sample as\nprovided for in Article 27 of the basic Regulation. Concerning the reliability\nof data used in the support of the initiation of the investigation, the\ninvestigation found no evidence that the data collected prior to the initiation\nwas significantly deficient. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that the\nbasis on which the provisional sample was selected was sufficiently reliable.\nTherefore, this claim was rejected.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the list of\naround 150 additional Union producers, it should be noted that this information\nwas submitted far outside the deadline set for interested parties to comment on\nthe selection of the provisional sample and for Union producers to come forward\nand to request to be selected in the sample. Moreover, about 30 of the Union\nproducers contained in this list were in fact known to the Commission at the\ntime of the selection of the sample. Furthermore, all Union producers that made\nthemselves known after the publication of the Notice of Initiation were\nconsidered when selecting the sample. On this basis, the representativity of\nthe sample has not been affected. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nreceipt of comments, the composition of the sample was revised on the ground\nthat there were indications that one of the selected companies would not have\nbeen in the position to fully cooperate. In order to maintain the level of\nrepresentativity of the sample an additional Union producer was selected. This\nrevised sample consisted thus of ten companies, selected on the basis of the\nlargest representative volume for each level of production, taking into account\nsales volume on the Union market and geographical location that could\nreasonably be investigated within the time available. Further to the exclusion\nof wafers from the definition of the product concerned, and thus from the scope\nof this investigation (see recitals (42) - (46) - and (349) below), the sample\nconsisted of eight companies. As a result, the revised sample of Union\nproducers accounted, expressed as a percentage of out of the total Union\nproduction, between 18% and 21 % for modules and between 17% and 24 % for cells\nand covered vertically integrated and non-integrated producers. Given that a\nprecise percentage would allow calculating the production volume of the above\nmentioned additional Union producer and thus its identity could be determined,\nno such precise percentages could be disclosed. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion producers who supplied the Commission with information required for the\nselection of a sample in the present anti-subsidy proceeding coincide with the\nUnion producers who supplied the relevant information in the parallel on-going\nanti-dumping investigation. Furthermore, all Union producers selected in the\nfinal sample in the anti-dumping investigation have supplied the relevant\ninformation in the present anti-subsidy investigation which allowed the Commission\nto select a sample. Therefore, it was considered appropriate that the final\nsamples of Union producers in both proceedings were identical.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC reiterated its\nclaim that the use of confidentiality of the names of the Complainants and\nsampled Union producers is not warranted. As already stated in recital (9) to\nthe provisional Regulation, the Union producers requested that their names be\nkept confidential due to the risk of retaliation. The Commission considered\nthat these requests were sufficiently substantiated to be granted. The\ninformation that has been provided to the Commission in order to substantiate\nthe risk of retaliation cannot be disclosed to third parties, as such\ndisclosure would defeat the purpose of the request for confidentiality.\nMoreover, in a case, where, as reported by the GOC, a Union producer\nre-evaluated its position and revealed its identity by filing an application\nfor a Court case against the provisional regulation, there is no longer ground\nto disclose information on the basis of which anonymity was granted, as the\nidentity has been revealed. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final disclosure,\nthe China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic\nProducts (hereinafter CCCME) reiterated the arguments about the method used for\nthe selection of the provisional sample of the Union producers. It claims in\nparticular that the Institutions have not taken into account 120 producers. The\nCommission already addressed this issue in recital (9) to the provisional Regulation.\nMoreover, the Institutions have verified the activities of the companies\nprovided on that list. It turned out that that list mostly includes installers,\ndistributors, related importers and exporting producer in China, Taiwan, and India. It therefore was not apt to demonstrate that the Institutions had\noverlooked a significant number of Union producers. Moreover, the CCCME has not\ncontested the total Union production by providing alternative figures, nor has\nit put forward any evidence that the representativity of the sample could have\nbeen affected, as none of the alleged additional Union producers would have\nbeen selected into the sample, had it been known to the Commission.\n(c)         \nSampling of unrelated importers\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of the around 250 unrelated\nimporters put forward by the complainant, that the Commission contacted, twenty\nparties replied to the sampling form attached to the Notice of Initiation,\ntwelve for modules, one for cells. In addition, seven other parties made\nthemselves known but reported no imports or resales of the product concerned.\nThe sample was selected in accordance with Article 27 of the basic Regulation\nto cover the largest representative volume of imports which could reasonably be\ninvestigated within the time available. On this basis a sample of unrelated\nimporters was selected consisting of two importers for modules and one importer\nfor cells, representing around 2 % - 5 % of the total imports from the country\nconcerned. After the receipt of the questionnaire reply, it became however apparent\nthat the core activity of one of the three importers was in fact solar\ninstallations and not trading of the product concerned. As to the activity of a\nsecond importer, this was that of an importer of modules and not of an importer\nof cells. Nevertheless, the quality of the information provided in its reply to\nthe questionnaire was not sufficient to include it in the analysis of unrelated\nimporters. In addition, the investigation revealed\nthat a majority of imports of the product concerned entered the Union market\nthrough companies related to the exporting producers in the PRC or through\ninstallers or project developers.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures in the parallel\nanti-dumping investigation, the Commission contacted additional importers that\nhad already cooperated in the investigation at the initiation stage by\nproviding basic information on their activities related to the product under\ninvestigation during the investigation period, as specified in the Notice of Initiation.\nThe purpose was to determine whether the size of the sample of unrelated\nimporters could be increased. Six companies qualified as unrelated importers trading\nthe product concerned (i.e. purchasing and reselling it) came forward and were\nwilling to cooperate further in the investigation. Out of these six, five\nreplied within the deadline. Out of the five replies received, only three were\nsufficiently complete and allowed for a meaningful assessment. On this basis,\nthe sample of the unrelated importers was enlarged and consisted of four\nimporters for modules, representing around 2 % - 5 % of the total imports from\nthe country concerned. Given the structure of the\nunrelated importers, which were mostly small and medium-sized companies, it was\nnot possible to have a sample representing a larger share, given the limited\nresources at the disposal of the Institutions.\n(d)         \nQuestionnaire replies and verifications\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission sent\nquestionnaires to the representatives of the PRC (including specific questionnaires\nfor the China Development Bank, Export Import Bank of China, Bank of China,\nBank of Shanghai, Sinosure, other relevant financial institutions and\nstate-owned producers of polysilicon, glass and aluminium which supplied these\nraw materials to the industry concerned during the investigation period), the eight\nsampled exporting producers in the PRC, other exporting producers in the PRC\nthat requested so, as well as to the sampled Union producers, the sampled\nunrelated importers and upstream and downstream operators and their\nassociations that made themselves known within the time limits set out in the\nNotice of Initiation. The Commission also contacted a representative consumer\nassociation.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replies\nwere received from the GOC, all the sampled exporting producers and their related\ncompanies in the PRC, five exporting producers which requested individual\nexamination, from all the sampled Union producers, all the sampled unrelated\nUnion importers and 21 upstream and downstream operators and three of their\nassociations.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission sought and verified all information deemed necessary for the\ndetermination of subsidisation, resulting injury and Union interest.\nVerification visits were carried out at the premises of the following State\nauthorities and financial institutions, the sampled companies, one unrelated\nimporter, two upstream and four downstream operators, associations and\nindependent consultant: \n(a)         \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\u2013              \nChinese Ministry of Commerce, Beijing, China\n\u2013              \nHuaxia Bank, Beijing, China\n\u2013              \nChina Development Bank, Beijing, China\n\u2013              \nExport Import Bank of China, Beijing, China\n\u2013              \nChina Export & Credit Insurance Corporation\n(SINOSURE), Beijing, China\n(b)         \nUnion producers\n\u2013              \neight sampled Union producers\n(c)         \nGroups of Exporting producers (and related\ncompanies) in the PRC\n\u2013              \nChangzhou Trina Solar\nEnergy Co.

However, findings should be based on reliable and verifiable data\nwherever possible. Europressedienst has provided information on macroeconomic\nindicators on the basis of a contract. The Commission carried out an\non-the-spot verification at its premises for the\nsake of the principle of good administration to verify the reliability and\ncorrectness of data on which the Commission has based its findings.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that its\nrights of defence in relation to access to the files open for inspection by\ninterested parties were violated because (i) information was missing from the\nnon-confidential files without \u201cgood cause\u201d being shown or providing\nsufficiently detailed summaries, or exceptionally, the reasons for the failure\nto provide the non-confidential summary, (ii) the non-confidential version of\nan entire questionnaire response of a Union producer was missing and (iii) the\ndelays to make non-confidential versions of the Union producers\u2019 questionnaire\nresponses available for interested parties were excessive.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i) Regarding the claim\nthat information was missing from the open file, the interested party did not\nspecify to which information it was referring to. (ii) Its claim that the\nnon-confidential version of an entire questionnaire response has not been made\navailable was incorrect. (iii) As to the delays in making available the\nnon-confidential replies of the questionnaires of the sampled Union producers,\nit had been explained to the party concerned that the questionnaires were only\nadded to the non-confidential file after having been checked as to their\ncompleteness and reasonableness of the summaries. In order to ensure the Union\nproducers\u2019 right to anonymity, it was also ascertained that the\nnon-confidential versions of the questionnaires did indeed not reveal the\nidentity of the Union producer concerned. In some cases, the non-confidential\nversions needed therefore to be corrected accordingly by the party submitting\nit before they could be made available for other interested parties. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, it is\nconsidered that this did in no way affect the interested parties\u2019 rights of\ndefence. The Commission has given all the interested parties the opportunity to\nrespond to the information included in the file open for inspection in time so\nthat their comments could be taken into consideration, when substantiated and\nwarranted before any conclusions were made in the investigation. The interested\nparty had every opportunity to comment on the questionnaires from sampled Union\nproducers also following the provisional and the final disclosure. Therefore,\neven if the disclosures and the access to the file open for inspection by\ninterested parties are based on different legal provisions, it should be noted\nthat there were ample opportunities for the interested parties to comment on\nall information made available by any party to the investigation. Therefore,\nthis claim had to be rejected. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\nintended to recommend the imposition of countervailing duties on imports of\ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components (i.e. cells)\noriginating in or consigned from the People's Republic of China (\u2018the final\ndisclosure\u2019). All parties were granted a period within which they could make\ncomments on the final disclosure. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments submitted by\nthe interested parties were considered and taken into account where\nappropriate. \n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance of an\nundertaking in view of definitive duties\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\nthe Commission received an amended offer for an undertaking by exporting\nproducers together with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of\nMachinery and Electronic Products, which covers also the parallel anti-dumping\ninvestigation. By Commission Decision 2013/XXX/EU of XX November 2013, the\nCommission has confirmed the acceptance of that undertaking. \n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period and\nperiod considered\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation of subsidisation and injury covered the period from 1 July 2011\nto 30 June 2012 (the \u2018investigation period\u2019 or \u2018IP\u2019). The examination of\ntrends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January\n2009 to the end of the IP (\u2018the period considered\u2019). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE\nPRODUCT \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned was\ndefined at initiation stage as crystalline silicon PV modules or panels and\ncells and wafers of the type used in crystalline silicon PV modules or panels,\noriginating in or consigned from the PRC. The cells and wafers have a thickness\nnot exceeding 400 micrometres. This product is currently falling within CN\ncodes ex 3818 00 10, ex 8501 31 00, ex 8501 32 00, ex 8501 33 00, ex 8501 34\n00, ex 8501 61 20, ex 8501 61 80, ex 8501 62 00, ex 8501 63 00, ex 8501 64 00\nand ex 8541 40 90.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following product types are excluded from the definition of the\nproduct concerned:\n\u2013              \nsolar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells, are portable and supply electricity to devices or charge batteries,\n\u2013              \nthin film photovoltaic products,\n\u2013              \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic products that\nare permanently integrated into electrical goods, where the function of the\nelectrical goods is other than power generation, and where these electrical\ngoods consume the electricity generated by the integrated crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic cell(s).\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like product \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown\nthat the product concerned as well as the product produced and sold in the Union by the Union industry have the same basic physical, chemical and technical\ncharacteristics as well as the same basic end uses. They are therefore\nconsidered as alike within the meaning of Article 2(c) of the basic Regulation.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims regarding product\nscope\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exclusion of wafers\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties claimed that wafers should be removed from the product scope since\nwafers do not share the same basic physical, chemical and technical\ncharacteristics as cells and modules. In addition to the arguments brought\nforward before the publication of the Provisional anti-dumping Regulation, two\nadditional arguments were brought forward in this respect thereafter.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, interested parties\nclaimed that wafers can be used for other purposes than for the production of\ncells, notably the production of integrated circuits and other micro devices.\nIn this respect, it is noted that not all wafers are included in the product\nscope of this investigation, which is limited to \"wafers of the type\nused in crystalline silicon PV modules or panels\", and that those\nwafers have \"a thickness not exceeding 400 micrometres\". While\nwafers certainly do exist in other applications, the investigation never\ncovered wafers which are used in the production of other products such as\nintegrated circuits. In addition, no producers, importers or users involved in\nthe market for these different types of wafers came forwards alleging that\ntheir wafers would be subject to registration or provisional anti-dumping\nduties. It is therefore concluded that these other types of wafers are not\nsubject to the product scope of this investigation. At the same time, this\nshows that wafers do not necessarily have the same end use as cells and\nmodules.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, it is claimed\nthat an unprocessed wafer possesses none of the essential electric properties\nwhich distinguish solar cells and modules from other products. In particular,\nwafers lack the ability to generate electricity from sunlight, which is the key\nfunction of crystalline photovoltaic cells and modules.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the investigation\nshowed that only once the wafer is transformed into a cell, the functionality\nto generate electricity from sunlight arises. The conversion is operated by\ncells which absorb light and convert it into electricity through crystalline\nsilicon. Cells have a positive-negative junction to collect and forward the\nelectricity that is generated by the cell. To assemble the modules, cells are\nsoldered together with flat wires or metal ribbons to produce a string of\ncells. Those are laminated between sheets. Mostly glass is used on top and a\npolymeric backing sheet to the bottom. Frames are usually created to allow the\nmounting in the field (e.g. on rooftops). The module may or may not have an\ninverter.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due\nto the different basic physical and technical characteristics, defined during\nthe investigation inter alia as the functionality to generate\nelectricity from sunlight, it was concluded on balance that wafers should be\nexcluded from the definition of the product concerned, and thus from the scope\nof this investigation.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Physical, chemical and technical characteristics and end uses\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several\ninterested parties claimed that the investigation cannot cover two products\nwith different physical, chemical and technical characteristics, and therefore\nmodules and cells should be subject to two separate investigations. Moreover,\nthey claimed that it is unclear whether the investigation covers one single\nproduct or two separate products and therefore they have no full opportunity to\ndefend their interests. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cell-module production\nis one single production process with different production steps. Cells\ndetermine the characteristics of the finished product (i.e. modules). The\ninvestigation showed that the cells production is directly and exclusively\ndedicated to produce modules; modules and cells share the same physical,\nchemical and technical characteristics (determined by the raw material used)\nand have the same basic end uses, i.e. are sold for integration into PV solar\nsystems. The modules performance is directly linked to the performance of the\ncells.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nNotice of Initiation clearly expressed that modules and cells constitute the\nproduct under investigation. Interested parties had therefore full opportunity\nto defend their interests on the basis of the product concerned as defined. On\nthese grounds, the arguments were rejected.\n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Different nomenclature\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was further claimed that\nmodules and cells could not be considered as a single product as they have\nseveral different eight-digit CN codes, six-digit subheading and four-digit HS\nheading. In this respect it is noted that both cells and modules can be\ndeclared under customs heading 8541 40 90, while the customs headings under\nheading 8501 are for electric generators in general and not in particular for\nsolar products. On these grounds, the argument was rejected. \n2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Value added of cells\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed\nthat the value added in the cell conversion process accounts for the largest\npart of the value of a module and therefore cells must be considered as a\nseparate product.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation revealed\nthat the cells production is the most technologically sophisticated part in the\nproduction process. However, it also showed that the two processing steps are\nlinked to each other and the value added is not concentrated in a particular\nstage of the production process but is spread over the whole production\nprocess. On these grounds, the claim was rejected.\n2.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Separate merchant markets\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that modules and cells have separate merchant markets and therefore\nthey should be treated as different products which would also be demonstrated\nby the fact that a large number of producers are not vertically integrated.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modules and cells cannot be\nconsidered as separate products whose prices fluctuate only depending on market\nfactors. As a matter of fact their prices are strictly interconnected and\naffected by the polysilicon price. Likewise, as it has been explained above in\nrecitals (49) above, the product concerned is produced in one single production\nprocess with different steps. The fact that some producers are not vertically\nintegrated is due only to business decision and economies of scale and does not\nreverse this conclusion. On these grounds, this argument had to be rejected.\n2.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 End use and\ninterchangeability\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nclaimed that modules and cells must be treated as different products given that\nthey have different end uses and they were not interchangeable.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above the\ninvestigation showed that the cell-module production process is one single\nproduction process and therefore the question of interchangeability between\ndifferent steps of a single production process is not applicable. Moreover,\nmodules and cells have the same end use, converting sunlight into electricity\nand therefore cannot be used in other applications.\n2.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distribution channels\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that modules and cells do not share the same distribution channels and\nshould therefore not be considered as one single product. The investigation\nshowed that modules and cells can be distributed within different or similar\ndistribution channels. However, the main criteria to define a single product\nare the same physical, chemical and technical characteristics and end uses.\nConsidering recitals (47) to (49) above, it is concluded that therefore\ndifferent distribution channels are not considered as a determining element.\nThe argument should therefore be rejected.\n2.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumer perception\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that modules\nand cells differ substantially in terms of consumer perception and therefore\nthey should not be considered as one single product.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise as above the main\ncriteria to define a single product are the same physical, chemical and\ntechnical characteristics and end uses. Considering recitals (47) to (49) above\nit is concluded that therefore different consumer perception is not considered\nas a determining element. The argument should therefore be rejected.\n2.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Separate\ninvestigations for cells and modules\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties reiterated that cells and modules are not a single product, and should\ntherefore be assessed separately. Unlike wafers, however, cells and modules do\nshare the same basic property, i.e. the ability to generate electricity from\nsunlight. These arguments were therefore rejected.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none exporter argued that cells by themselves cannot produce electricity.\nAllegedly, they need to be integrated into modules to do so. However, each cell\nby itself has a capacity to generate electricity from sunlight of typically\naround 4W. While this power may be insufficient for most applications which\nrequire an assembly of multiple cells into modules, this does not mean that a\ncell by itself does not already have the capacity to generate electricity.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none exporter further argued that cells are not just another type of module, but\nan entirely different product. In effect, a cell is the key component of a module.\nAs a key component, a cell is clearly not \"an entirely different\nproduct\", as modules and cells share the same basic characteristics of\ngenerating electricity from sunlight, as indicated in recital (60) above.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party argued in\naddition that when the samples for Union producers and Chinese exporters were\nselected, the difference between cells and modules was taken into account.\nTherefore, different duty rates for modules and cells should have been\nestablished. In this respect, it is confirmed that the difference between\nmodules and cells was indeed taken into account when sampling Union producers\nand Chinese exporters, as indicated in recitals (10) and (14) to the\nprovisional anti-dumping Regulation. This, however, was only done to ensure that\nthe sample is representative and does as such not mean that cells and modules\nshould not be considered a single product concerned, or that separate duty\nrates should be established for cells and modules. Indeed, in order to ensure\nthat the sample was representative for all product types, it was important to\ndistinguish between cells and modules when selecting the sample. Furthermore,\nas there was a certain degree of uncertainty with regards to the question as to\nwhether cells and modules were to be regarded as one product or as two separate\nproducts, it was necessary to ensure representativity for both possible\noutcomes. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exporting producers claimed\nthat the fact that the undertaking imposes different minimum import prices and\nvolumes for cells and modules allegedly confirms that modules and cells are\ndistinct products requiring two distinct investigations. The different minimum\nimport prices, however, are merely an indication that cells and modules are\ndifferent groups of product types which are sold at different prices.\nTherefore, it is necessary to define different prices to make the minimum import\nprices meaningful.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the fact that cells\nand modules are distinct groups of product types is not as such relevant for\nthe definition of the product concerned. For the definition of the product\nconcerned, it is sufficient that the products share the same basic\ncharacteristics and end uses, which is the case for modules and cells as\ndescribed in recitals (46) and (71) respectively.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that the\nassessment whether cells and modules are a single product concerned does not\naddress a number of criteria defined by the Appellate Body in EC \u2013 Asbestos[6]. These criteria are used for\nthe definition of the \"like product\", not the product concerned. In\nother words, these criteria have to be used to define the like product, for\nexample the like product produced by Union Industry, which is then compared\nwith the product concerned exported by the Chinese exporting producers. These\ncriteria are therefore not pertinent when defining the product concerned. In\nany event, the Institutions observe that the application of the criteria used\nin EC \u2013 Asbestos to the definition of the product concerned in the\npresent case would not lead to a different outcome. The first and the second\ncriteria (properties, nature and quality respectively end-uses) are identical\nto the criteria physical, chemical and technical properties and end-uses used\nin the preceding recitals. The third criterion (consumers taste and habits) is\nnot really useful for the present case, as cells are the key component of\nmodules; as regards the fourth criterion, tariff classification, it is noted\nthat both cells and modules can be declared under customs heading 8541 40 90,\nwhile the customs headings under heading 8501 are for electric generators in\ngeneral and not in particular for solar products.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other interested parties\nargued that an objective application of the criteria developed by the Court of\nJustice in previous cases[7]\nallegedly leads to the conclusion that modules and cells are different\nproducts. In this respect, it is noted that the court only indicated a number\nof criteria which may be taken into account \u2011 there is no obligation to use all\ncriteria in all cases, since not all of them may be relevant. These criteria\nwere assessed in recitals (27) to (39) to the provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation, where it was found that a number of criteria are not relevant in\nthe present case. In the Brosmann case the assessment whether different\ntypes of shoes belong to the \"product concerned\" was also made on the\nbasis of only three criteria which were found to be relevant. As the interested\nparties did not provide any reasoning why an objective application of the\ncriteria leads one to conclude that modules and cells are distinct products,\nthe argument cannot be accepted.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it is recalled\nthat cells and modules have the same basic end uses, i.e. they are sold for\nintegration into PV solar systems. The modules performance is directly linked\nto the performance of the cells, as indicated in recital (28) to the\nprovisional anti-dumping Regulation.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat with the exclusion of wafers from the product scope, and due to the\nsignificant processing involved to make modules from cells, the argument that\ncells and modules have the same end uses also stands refuted. It is also argued\nthat the assessment that modules and cells have the same end uses is based on\nthe assumption that wafers, modules and cells have the same production process.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, the conclusion\nthat the assessment that modules and cells have the same end uses is based on\nthe production process is wrong. While both statements are indeed in the same\nrecital (36) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation, this does not mean\nthat one conclusion is based on the other assumption. The word\n\"moreover\" separating the two statements makes it clear that the\nsecond statement is not based on the first. In addition, the two statements are\nmade to address separate issues under the heading \"End use and\ninterchangeability\". The first statement concerning the production process\naddresses interchangeability, while the second statement addresses end use. The\nunderlying assumption that the assessment that modules and cells have the same\nend uses is based on the assumption that wafers, modules and cells have the\nsame production process is therefore incorrect.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nto the actual end use of cells and modules, it is not disputed by interested\nparties that modules and cells are sold for integration into PV solar systems.\nThe conclusion that modules and cells have the same end use is therefore\nconfirmed.\n2.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0 Thin film products\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that thin film PV products should be included in the definition of\nproduct concerned, arguing that they share the same basic physical, chemical\nand technical characteristics and the same basic end uses.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thin film PV products are\nclearly excluded from the product definition (see recital (40) above). Indeed, thin\nfilm PV products have different physical, chemical and technical\ncharacteristics compared to the product concerned. They are produced via a\ndifferent production process and not from crystalline silicon which is the main\nraw material to produce modules and cells. They have lower conversion\nefficiency and a lower wattage output and therefore they are not suitable for\nthe same types of applications than those of the product concerned. On these\ngrounds, the arguments had to be rejected.\n2.3.11.\u00a0\u00a0 Semi-finished products\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore it was claimed\nthat cells should be considered as semi-finished feeder products while modules\nare end products, therefore they should not be considered as one single\nproduct.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above, the\nmain criteria to define a single product are the same physical, chemical and\ntechnical characteristics and end uses. Considering recitals (47) to (49) above\nit is concluded that therefore the difference between semi-finished or finished\nproducts is not considered as a determining element. The argument should\ntherefore be rejected.\n2.3.12.\u00a0\u00a0 Solar chargers\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nrequested the exclusion of solar panels dedicated solely to 12V battery\ncharging on the basis that they have a different end use than the modules for\ngrid connection due to the fact that they generate much lower voltage and\ntherefore are not suitable for grid connection.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Notice of\nInitiation solar chargers that consist of less than six cells, are portable and\nsupply electricity to devices or charge batteries are excluded from the product\nunder investigation. Modules of more than six cells dedicated only to battery\ncharging have the same basic characteristics and performance as the modules for\ngrid connection. They use an open voltage circuit which has a lower voltage\nthan the circuit used in modules for grid connection. Despite this difference\nthe investigation has revealed that this type of modules can be connected to\nthe grid. The lower voltage can be easily compensated by an increase in\ndimension and/or number of cells. Therefore modules dedicated to battery\ncharging, and consisting of more than six cells, fall within the definition of\nthe product concerned.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties also claimed\nthat the definition of \"solar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells\" is too narrow, and should be extended to products with a similar\nfunction which are not covered by this definition such as products with a\nsimilar size using a larger number of smaller cells.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, interested\nparties claimed that the definition of \"silicon PV products that are\npermanently integrated into electrical goods\" is too narrow, as only the\ncomplete electrical good is excluded, while solar components for integration\ninto the electrical goods are not necessarily excluded.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, an analysis of the\narguments brought forward by the various interested parties showed that it is\nmore appropriate to define the exclusion of such products on the basis of\ntechnical standards rather than the number of cells. In particular, it was\nestablished that the definitions of standard \"IEC 61730-1 Application\nClass C\" more appropriately define the products which should be excluded\nfrom the scope of the measures.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following definitive\ndisclosure, comments were received concerning the exclusion based on the\ninternational standard mentioned above. It was argued that rather than\nreferring to the standard, it would be more appropriate to define the exclusion\non the basis of the output voltage and the power output as \"modules or\npanels with a output voltage not exceeding 50 V DC and a power output not\nexceeding 50 W solely for direct use as battery chargers in systems with the\nsame voltage and power characteristics\". This claim could be accepted, and\nthe exclusion is finally determined according to this definition.\n2.3.13.\u00a0\u00a0 Roof-integrated solar modules\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party claimed\nthat roof-integrated solar modules should be excluded from the product scope of\nthe investigation, since they combine the functionality of a solar module with\nthat of a roof tile or slate. As such, they are not directly interchangeable\nwith a standard solar module.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has, however, shown that both standard modules and the\nroof-integrated solar module have to comply with the same electrical standards.\nAnd while the roof-integrated solar module cannot be simply replaced with a\nstandard module, it can be replaced by a standard module plus roof tiles or\nslate. These products therefore have the same basic technical property of\ngenerating electricity from sunlight. The added functionality (which is\notherwise provided by roofing material) is not considered substantial and does\nnot warrant an exclusion of roof-integrated solar modules from the product\nscope.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following definitive\ndisclosure, the same interested party argued that the absence of\ndual-interchangeability between roof-integrated solar modules and standard\nsolar modules is an indication that roof-integrated solar modules should be\nexcluded from the scope of the measures, referring to the footware[8] case in\ngeneral and special technology athletics footwear 'STAF' in particular.\nHowever, the reasons for the exclusion of STAF were numerous, and the absence\nof dual interchangeability by itself was not considered a sufficient ground by\nthe General Court in the Brosmann[9]\ncase, which confirmed that very different product such as city trotters and\nhiking boots can indeed be considered product concerned in a single\nanti-dumping investigation despite their differences.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the interested\nparty argued that due to the absence of production in the EU and the fact that\nthe interested party holds intellectual property rights is allegedly a\nconfirmation that roof-integrated solar modules are innovative and different\nfrom any other product. However, referring again to the footwear case\nmentioned by the interested party, the General Court held in Brosmann that\n\"the absence of Community production of that type of footwear and the\nexistence of a patent are not conclusive.\"[10]. As a result, patented\ntechnology footwear was considered product concerned in that case.\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interested party also\nargued that roof-integrated solar modules should be excluded from the\ndefinition of the product concerned, since they are sold at substantially\nhigher prices than standard modules. Also, in the footwear case STAF\nabove a certain price were excluded from the definition of the product\nconcerned. In this respect, it is noted that a roof-integrated solar module\ndoes combine the functionality of a solar module and roof tile or slate, as\nindicated in recital (83). A direct comparison of prices is therefore not\nmeaningful, as the added functionality naturally leads to higher prices.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to this\nargument, the interested party argued that on the basis of this argumentation,\nit would be impossible to ever invoke price differences as an additional\nindicator warranting the exclusion from the product scope. However, this\ninterpretation is too far-reaching. What is said in the previous recital is\nmerely that in this particular case where the roof-integrated modules combine\nthe functionality of the product concerned plus another product (in this case\nroof tile or slate), the price is naturally not meaningful. This in no way\nmeans that in other cases the price difference cannot be a useful indicator to\nestablish whether a product should be excluded from the definition of the\nproduct concerned.\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, the interested\nparty argued that its supplier of roof-integrated solar modules should be granted\naccess to the minimum price undertaking. However, it appears that the Chinese\nexporter did not co-operate in the investigation, and as a non-cooperating\nparty is not eligible to participate in the undertaking. These requests can\ntherefore not be accepted.\n2.3.14.\u00a0\u00a0 Mono and\nmulti-crystalline cells\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that there was no production of mono crystalline cells in the Union,\nand that its exports of mono crystalline cells were not competing with the EU\nindustry. Investigation showed however that there was indeed production of mono\ncrystalline cells in the Union. This argument is therefore rejected. In any\nevent, the General Court held in Brosmann that the absence of Community\nproduction of a particular product type is not decisive.\n2.3.15.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Consigned from\"\nclause\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nargued that the extension of the scope of the investigation to products\n\"consigned from\" the PRC, while the case was initiated only against\nproducts originating in the PRC was unjustified.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\ngoods consigned from the PRC were already covered at the initiation stage. In\npoint 5 of the Notice of Initiation it is stated that \"companies which\nship the product concerned from the People's Republic of China but consider\nthat part or even all of those exports do not have their customs origin in the\nPeople's Republic of China are invited to come forward in the investigation and\nto furnish all relevant information\". It is therefore clear that all\ncompanies consigning goods from the PRC had the opportunity to co-operate in\nthis investigation. Furthermore, since the product under investigation\nfrequently incorporates components and parts from different countries, it was\nalso announced in point 5 of the Notice of Initiation that \"special\nprovisions may be adopted\" to address this issue.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore considered\nthat all affected economic operators were duly informed of the possibility that\nspecial provisions in respect of goods consigned from the PRC may be adopted,\nif appropriate, and were invited to co-operate in the investigation. Thus the\nscope of the investigation was not extended to products \"consigned from\nthe PRC\", since these were covered from the outset.\n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure,\ninterested parties argued that irrespective of the provisions in the Notice of\nInitiation referred to in recital (91), the investigation was limited to goods\noriginating in the PRC and did not assess the impact of goods consigned from\nthe PRC.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nnoted that the following steps were taken to ensure that all goods consigned\nfrom the PRC were assessed during the investigation, and not only goods\noriginating in the PRC:\n\u00b7              \nAll companies which ship the product concerned\nfrom the PRC were invited to come forward in the investigation irrespective of\nthe origin of the goods.\n\u00b7              \nIn Annex A of the Notice of initiation,\nexporters were asked to report information for all products manufactured by the\ncompany. This information was not limited to goods originating in the PRC.\n\u00b7              \nOn the basis of this information, which\ncontained all exports to the EU irrespective of the origin of the goods, a\nrepresentative sample was selected.\n\u00b7              \nThe sampled producers received a questionnaire\nfor \"producers exporting to the European Union\", and the PRC was\nreferred to as \"country concerned\", not country of origin. It was\ntherefore clear that all goods irrespective of the origin of the goods were\ninvestigated.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it is\nconcluded that the investigation covered all goods originating in or consigned\nfrom the PRC, and that the findings of the investigation, including subsidization\nand injury, cover all goods originating in or consigned from the PRC.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\ninterested parties argued that the complaint contained only prima facie\nevidence concerning imports of solar panels originating in the PRC, not goods\nconsigned from the PRC. In this respect, it needs to be clarified that the\ncomplaint indeed covered goods \"from the PRC\", which can be seen from\nthe cover page submitted by the applicant bearing the stamp. Before this page,\nthere is another page on the file which indeed uses the wording\n\"originating in the People's Republic of China\". But this case was\nnot part of the document submitted by the complainant, but added as a cover\npage by the Commission Services, using the name of the investigation rather\nthan repeating the title of the complaint. It is therefore considered that the\ncomplaint covered all goods from the PRC, whether originating in the PRC or\nnot.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese exporting producers\nfurther argued that exporting producers in third countries cannot reasonably be\nexpected to have known that their products could also be targeted by the\ninvestigation. In this respect it is noted that the measures do not apply to\ngoods which are in transit in the sense of Article V GATT. Therefore, exporting\nproducers which have no operations in the PRC are not affected by the measures.\nFurthermore, no exporting producers in third countries came forward raising the\nissue that the products they export are subject to the measures.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same exporting\nproducers argued that exporting producers in third countries were not asked to\ncome forward, and not given the opportunity to show that their products are not\nsubsidised. The Institutions consider that those exporting producers without\nany operations in the PRC are not affected by the measures, as their goods, if\nconsigned from the PRC, will have been in transit. All other exporting\nproducers were informed by the Notice of Initiation that their operations are\npart of the investigation.\n2.3.16.\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the above, the product scope is definitively defined as crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels and cells of the type used in crystalline silicon\nPV modules or panels, originating in or consigned from the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, unless they are in transit in the sense of Article V GATT. The cells\nhave a thickness not exceeding 400 micrometers. This product is currently\nfalling within CN codes ex 8501 31 00, ex 8501 32 00, ex 8501 33 00, ex 8501 34\n00, ex 8501 61 20, ex 8501 61 80, ex 8501 62 00, ex 8501 63 00, ex 8501 64 00\nand ex 8541 40 90. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfollowing product types are excluded from the definition of the product\nconcerned:\n\u2013              \nsolar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells, are portable and supply electricity to devices or charge batteries,\n\u2013              \nthin film photovoltaic products,\n\u2013              \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic products that\nare permanently integrated into electrical goods, where the function of the\nelectrical goods is other than power generation, and where these electrical\ngoods consume the electricity generated by the integrated crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic cell(s).\n\u2013              \nmodules or panels with a output voltage not\nexceeding 50 V DC and a power output not exceeding 50 W solely for direct use\nas battery chargers in systems with the same voltage and power characteristics.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDISATION\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncomplainant alleged that the PRC is heavily subsidising its photovoltaic\nindustry (\u201cPV industry\u201d) and referred to a number of policy and planning\ndocuments as well as legislation which are the basis for the state support in\nthe sector. The Commission reviewed and analysed the documents mentioned in the\ncomplaint as well as additional documents submitted by the GOC and sampled\nexporting producers in the course of the investigation and found that many of\nthem indeed show that the PV industry in the PRC receives preferential\ntreatment in many areas.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC\nincluded the PV industry amongst \u201cstrategic\u201d industries in the 12th\nFive-year Plan[11]. The GOC has also issued a specific plan for the solar photovoltaic\nindustry (subordinate to the main 12th Five-year Plan), i.e. The 12th\nFive-year Plan for the Solar Photovoltaic Industry. In this plan the GOC\nexpressed its support for \u201csuperior enterprises\u201d[12] and \u201ckey\nenterprises\u201d[13], committed itself to \u201cpromote the implementation of various\nphotovoltaic support policies\u201d[14], and \u201cformulate\noverall preparation of supporting policies on industry, finance, taxation \u2026\u201d[15]. The Decision No 40 of the State Council suggests that the GOC will\nactively support the development of new energy industry and expedite the\ndevelopment of solar energy[16], instructs all financial institutions to provide credit support only\nto encouraged projects (the category in which the PV projects belong) and\npromises the implementation of \u201cother preferential policies on the\nencouraged projects\u201d[17]. Another State Council Decision of 10 October 2010 talks about\nexpansion of the \u201cintensity of fiscal and financial policy support\u201d,\nencourages the financial institutions to \u201cexpand the credit support\u201d and\npromises to \u201cmake use of the fiscal preferential policies such as risk\ncompensation\u201d[18] for new strategic industries, a category where the solar PV\nindustry belongs. The National Outline for the Medium and Long-term Science and\nTechnology Development (2006 \u2013 2020) promises to \u201cgive the first\nplace to policy finance\u201d, \u201cencourage financial institutions to grant\npreferential credit support to major national scientific and technological\nindustrialisation projects\u201d, to \u201cEncourage financial institutions to\nimprove and strengthen financial services to high-tech enterprises\u201d and to \u201cimplement\nthe preferential tax policies to promote the development of high-tech\nenterprises\u201d [19]. Also the Law of the PRC on Scientific and\nTechnological Progress lists a number of measures for the support of strategic\nindustries including the solar PV industry. Inter alia, it shows\nthat the state shall encourage and give guidance to financial institutions in\nsupporting the development of high and new technology industries by granting\nloans[20], instructs the policy oriented financial institutions to give\npriority to the development of high and new technology industries in offering\nfinancial services[21], provides for \u201cdiscount interest and guaranty to the loans\u201d\nreceived by certain enterprises and \u201cspecial aid\u201d by the policy oriented\nfinancial institutions to projects encouraged by state[22]. The\npractical applications of these measures are detailed below.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks \n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Both the GOC and the sampled\nChinese exporting producers submitted questionnaire replies and accepted\non-spot visits[23]\nin order to verify the replies. \n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the GOC, following the analysis of the\nquestionnaire reply, the Commission sent a deficiency letter and a pre-verification\nletter, followed up with subsequent correspondence concerning the agenda of the\nverification visit. The Commission provided to the GOC ample time for the\npreparation and submission of its representations whenever this was requested\nand justified. Indeed, a substantial deadline extension was granted to the GOC,\ni.e. 30 days extension for the reply to the questionnaire which resulted in an\neventual deadline of 69 days for the submission of the questionnaire reply and the\nCommission gave the GOC 25 days for the reply to the deficiency letter. Therefore, overall, the GOC has had more than three months to\nprovide the requested information requested by the Commission.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe on-spot verification visit to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in Beijing\nand four financial institutions (China Development Bank, Export Import Bank of\nChina, Huaxia Bank and SINOSURE) the Commission endeavoured to verify\ninformation provided on the basis of the supporting documents that were used to\nprepare the GOC's response, in line with the provisions of Articles 11 and 26\nof the basic Regulation. In doing so, the Commission came preliminarily to the\nconclusion that the lack of information and supporting documents available from\nthe GOC did not allow a proper verification of the reply to the questionnaire.\nMoreover, certain information was not submitted at all although it was\nspecifically requested and certain questions were simply not replied to.\nConsequently, the GOC was made aware of the consequences of non-cooperation in\naccordance with Article 28(1) and (6) of the basic Regulation.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also submitted that the Commission was imposing an unreasonable burden on\nthe GOC and that it had requested irrelevant and unnecessary information in the\nquestionnaire and subsequent deficiency letter. \n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the requested information it is noted that the Commission requested\nonly information concerning allegations in the complaint that is deemed\nnecessary for the purposes of arriving at a representative finding and remained\nconsistent in its requests by asking for the same data and information during\nthe investigating process and requesting the GOC to explain the submitted\ninformation and its implication for the investigated schemes. In other words,\nthe Commission only requested information that was necessary to assess the\nexistence and level of subsidisation available to the product concerned\npursuant to the subsidy schemes alleged in the complaint.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-cooperation\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 As already referred to in\nrecital (106) above, following the on spot verification visits, on 23 May 2013,\nthe Commission notified the GOC that it was considering the application of\nfacts available in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation. The\nCommission sent this letter, since it had come to the preliminary conclusion\nthat the lack of information and supporting evidence available from the GOC did\nnot allow for a proper verification of the reply to the anti-subsidy\nquestionnaire, deficiency letter and other submissions made by the GOC in the\ncourse of the proceeding at hand. Moreover, it was found on spot that certain\ninformation was also withheld in the questionnaire reply and subsequent\nsubmissions by the GOC, although it had been specifically requested by the\nCommission. In addition certain questions were simply not replied to. The\npotential application of facts available concerned the government plans,\nprojects, various legislation and other documents; Preferential policy loans,\nother financing, guarantees and insurance; PBOC circulars; verifications at\nbanks; Export credit insurance and Sinosure verification; the Golden Sun\nDemonstration programme; direct tax exemption and reduction programmes; indirect\ntax and import tariff programmes; provision of inputs at less than adequate remuneration:\npolysilicon, aluminium extrusions and glass; and the provision of Land Use\nRights.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 3 June 2013\nthe GOC objected the Commission\u2019s preliminary intention to apply the provisions\nof Article 28 of the basic Regulation, reasoning that the conditions required to\ndisregard the information submitted or even to \u201cfill in information gaps\u201d had not\nbeen met in this case. \n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed\nthat \u201cdoubts\u201d as to the accuracy of information, which arise solely from the\nfact that information submitted could not be verified to the Commission\u2019s \u201cutmost\u201d\nsatisfaction, should not lead to that information being disregarded. The Commission\ndisagrees with this claim as it does not represent the reality. Indeed, the Commission\ndid not \u201cdisregard\u201d any of the information solely on the basis that it could\nnot verify it during the on-the-spot verification visit. However, if the\ninformation and explanation provided by the GOC was found to be either\ncontradictory and/or incomplete when compared to the other information\navailable to the Commission and, at the same time it was not possible to verify\nit during the on spot verification visit, the Commission could not take such\ninformation at its face value. Due weight is attached to each piece of\ninformation depending on the degree of non-cooperation from the GOC. It is also\nnoted that the Commission did not take an issue with the format in which the\ninformation was provided, as the GOC alleged, but rather with its inaccuracy\nand/or incompleteness.\n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nsome of the information requested by the Commission involved such a burden that\nthe GOC did not have the practical ability to provide it. In this respect it is\nnoted that the Commission requested only information which was necessary to verify\nthe allegations made by the complainant (and supported by prima facie evidence)\nand gave the GOC ample time and opportunity to submit such information. In\naddition, the Commission is fully aware that the significant number of detailed\nallegations of the complainant in this case obliged it to request a substantial\namount of information from the GOC. However, as explained above (recitals (104)\nto (107)), the information sought was not excessive and due time was allowed\nfor it to be provided.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Further the GOC pointed to\nthe distinction between disregarding the submitted information and\nsupplementing the information received with facts actually on records. While\nthe Commission is fully aware of this distinction and acts in line with the\nrelevant provisions of Article 28 of the basic Regulation it must point out\nthat when the submitted information is in contradiction with other information\navailable on the same matter to the Commission it is not possible to supplement\nthis information. On such occasions (e.g. submitted information on the\nownership of banks) the Commission had to decide which information is more\nreliable. In doing so the Commission ensured that the use of facts available is\nnot punitive and is based on facts actually available.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission had no grounds on which to consider the GOC as being non-cooperative\nin this case as it either ignored or misunderstood its obligation to consider\nthe \u201cpractical ability\u201d of the GOC to respond to its demand. According to the GOC,\nthe investigation as a whole has been unduly burdensome such that cooperation\nin general has been rendered impossible, and the Commission as an investigating\nauthority has continually refused to work with the GOC so as to mitigate such\nburdens. This claim is a clear misinterpretation of facts. The Commission, to\nmeet its legal obligations following the receipt of properly documented\ncomplaint and at the same time to respect relevant WTO jurisprudence, requested\nfrom the GOC only the information necessary to verify and assess the\nallegations in the complaint supported by sufficient evidence. The Commission\noffered assistance to the GOC in the cover letter to the questionnaire as well\nas in the questionnaire itself. Also in the deficiency letter, the GOC was\ninvited to contact the Commission should it have any questions concerning the\nrequested information. The Commission also granted exceptionally long deadline\nextensions for the information to be submitted (see recital (104) above).\nFurthermore, in this investigation, the Commission requested\ntransaction-specific information from GOC only with regard to the sampled\nexporters, not to all solar panel producers in China, thus narrowing down the\npotential volume of required information to a major extent. The Commission\nnotes that the GOC appears to conflate arguments concerning its practical\nability to provide data with other issues. For example, when discussing the\nCommission\u2019s allegedly excessive request for information on banks and financial\ninstitutions, it bases it argument mainly on the alleged insufficiency of the\ncomplaint, claiming that it is based on \u201cillegal determinations\u201d in the Coated\nFine Paper case. Therefore, the GOC\u2019s complaint seems to relate to the\nquality of evidence for initiation, not its practical ability to provide\ninformation. Indeed, in its letter of 3 June 2013 the GOC repeated its claim\nfrom the previous submissions that initiation of many of the programmes did not\nmeet the evidentiary threshold of the Article 11.2 of the WTO SCM Agreement and\nthat by initiating on these programme the Commission violated Article 11.3 of\nthe WTO SCM Agreement. The Commission already replied to these claims in a\nletter and Memorandum to the GOC and since no new claims were raised in the\nletter of 3 June 2013 there is no need to re-address the same claims for second\ntime in this regulation. \n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthe Commission did not provide the GOC enough time to complete the\nquestionnaire. This is simply incorrect. As explained in recital (104) above\nthe Commission granted to the GOC substantial extensions of deadlines,\nproviding the GOC maximum possible time without this having a substantial\nnegative impact on the timely completion of the case. The time allowed for the\ncompletion of the questionnaire and reply to the deficiency letter was\nsubstantially more than the time required by Article 11(2) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission ignored its request for aid in determining the relative necessity of\nthe questionnaire responses for the purposes of avoiding facts available\ndeterminations. In its submission it referred to its request to the Commission\nto explain the purpose of particular requested information and to which factual\ndeterminations it would lead, in order to \u201censure that it could cooperate to\nthe best of its practical ability while at the same time providing the most\nessential information\u201d. Naturally, the Commission could not know before the\nactual information is provided to what conclusions it will lead. The GOC also\nclaims that the Commission structured the questionnaire so as to make it\n\u201cfunctionally impossible\u201d to complete and the Commission engaged in \u201cfishing\nexpeditions.\u201d The Commission categorically rejects these allegations. As\nexplained above, the questionnaire only requested the information which was\nnecessary to make its determination.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 It was also claimed by the\nGOC that the Commission insisted on the provision of documents which the GOC\ncould not by law produce or compel to be produced and in this context referred\nto relevant EU and WTO law which make it clear that only false or misleading\ninformation should be disregarded and that it had no \u201cpractical ability\u201d\nto provide certain information of which, as state secret or otherwise, its internal\nlaws strictly prohibit dissemination. It further claimed that the relevant\nprovisions of WTO ADA and ASCM which envisage ways in which confidential\ninformation can be provided to investigating authorities and granted\n\u201cconfidential treatment\u201d do not always apply in the case where the information\nis to be provided by the authority of third country, in this case the GOC. The\nGOC also claimed that the Commission will fall foul of the ASCM if it refuses\nto recognise the legal distinction between a government\u2019s practical ability to\nprovide information which it is legally prohibited from releasing, on one hand,\nand other sorts of confidential information for which it may request\nconfidential treatment in the normal course of an investigation. \n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission did not disregard any information which the GOC did not produce,\nwhatever the reason, because it is simply not possible to disregard something\nthat was not provided. On the other hand in a situation where the GOC did not\nprovide, or make available for inspection, certain information, and information\nof a similar nature was available to the Commission from other sources (mostly\npublicly available, but also from cooperating exporting producers or submitted\nby certain banks during on-spot investigations); the Commission included this\ninformation in the case file and used it in its determination. The Commission\ndoes not agree with the claim that the WTO ADA and ASCM provisions which\nenvisage ways in which confidential information can be provided to investigating\nauthorities and granted \u201cconfidential treatment\u201d do not apply to the GOC. In\nthis regard, the GOC is claiming that governments should be held to a different\nstandard of cooperation than that of exporters and that situation of\ngovernments warrants a \u201cmodicum of comity\u201d to which exporters are not entitled.\nWith regard to the conduct of countervailing duty investigations, the\nCommission does not agree. GOC is one of the interested parties in the\nproceeding for the purpose of the basic Regulation and at the same time, as an\n\u201cinterested Member\u201d, the PRC is bound by the WTO provisions and jurisprudence.\nArticle 28(1) of the basic Regulation states: \u201cIn\ncases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not\nprovide necessary information within the time limits provided in this\nRegulation, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final\nfindings, affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the facts\navailable.\u201c Article 12.7 of the WTO SCM\nAgreement, explicitly refers to the consequences of non-cooperation by\ngovernments (\"Interested Member): \u201cIn cases in which any interested\nMember or interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide,\nnecessary information within a reasonable period or significantly impedes the\ninvestigation, preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative,\nmay be made on the basis of the facts available.\u201d Therefore when the\ninvestigating country, in this case, the EU, exercises its WTO rights in a\ncountervailing duty investigation and requests information deemed necessary for\nthe purpose of the investigation, governments and exporters are under the same\nobligation to cooperate. In the course of the investigation the GOC often\nreferred to rules on confidentiality as a reason for not providing requested\ninformation, for example, the PBOC circulars, for verification purposes It is\nnoted that even if the GOC was, as it claims, \u201clegally prohibited from\nreleasing such information\u201d it is still bound by its WTO obligations to provide\ninformation deemed necessary for the investigation. In this regard, provisions\nof the municipal law or internal rules of a WTO Member cannot absolve it from\nits WTO obligations to cooperate with investigations; in such cases of\nconflict, it is incumbent upon the GOC to suggest ways in which access can be\nafforded to information so that it can be adequately verified. Notwithstanding\nthe above, the GOC never actually explained this claim and never provided any\nevidence (e.g. the legal provision by which it is \u201clegally prohibited\u201d from\nreleasing such information) in this regard. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore\nthe GOC claimed that the pre-verification letter of 25 March 2013 was not\nsufficiently detailed and it did not contain specific questions which will be\naddressed during the on-the-spot verification visit. In this respect it must be\nnoted that while there is no requirement for the Commission to send a list of\nall questions which will be asked during the on spot verification (and the\nCommission does not consider this appropriate), the pre-verification letter of 25\nMarch 2013 contained a very specific and detailed list of issues and documents\nwhich would be addressed in line with Article 26(3) of the basic Regulation and\nWTO requirements. However, the letter made it clear that the list was\nnon-exhaustive and that other issues and evidence may be addressed if\nappropriate. In this respect it should also be noted that the GOC did not\nobject the contents of this letter prior to the verification, although on the\nother hand it refused to discuss some points not explicitly raised in the\nletter, such as information on biggest banks in the PRC, involvement of China Communist\nParty (\u201cCCP\u201d) in the management of certain banks or access of some banks to the\nforeign currency reserves of State Administration of Foreign Reserves, claiming\nnot to be ready to reply to questions on these issues.\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also argued that the\nCommission was not flexible during the on-spot verification visit and in fact \u201cfixed\na peremptory time-limit in regard to any requests for changes by the GOC\u201d. In\nthe same vein it claimed that the Commission did not accept any of the\n\u201cworkable\u201d solutions proposed by the GOC concerning the verification at\nNational Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and refused to extend the verification\nuntil Monday 22 April 2013 to verify NBS. Furthermore, the Commission officials\nstarted the verifications with a delay virtually each working day because,\naccording to the GOC, of their late arrival. \n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the above claims, the Commission underlines that the degree of\nflexibility shown by its officials on the spot has been full and unconditional.\nThe Commission officials have exceptionally offered to verify documents and\nevidence the GOC sought to introduce well after the close of a certain subject,\nwell beyond the regular working hours on a number of occasions. This was done\nseveral times, even if it meant having to move at a very late hour to other\nverifications sites and/or return to sites where the Commission officials had already\nbeen and had already provided an opportunity to verify documents. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the GOC did not take up these offers in the cases in question, which\nstrongly suggest that the failure to submit the documents requested by the\nCommission during the regular hours had not been due to their time constraints\nor to the unwillingness of the Commission to verify them. As regards the delay\non the start of the verification visit, the Commission notes that the officials\nwere present on time every day but that, unfortunately, some delays were caused\nby the daily registration procedures to access the different verification sites\nrequired by the GOC or simply by the lack of GOC representatives to accompany\nthe officials when they arrived at verification sites which forced them to wait\nlong time before the start. The Commission also notes that the verification\nvisits lasted every day well beyond the normal working hours, and that it was\nthe GOC that cancelled the afternoon session of the verification visit the\nfirst day as the representatives of the Ministry of Technology decided not to\nparticipate in the visit (see recital (122)). In fact, if the GOC had accepted all\nthe repeated offers by the Commission officials to verify documents beyond the\nworking hours, the visits would have lasted longer and it was because of the\nGOC failure to fully cooperate that this was not the case.\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC further contested the Commission\u2019s practice not to accept new documents and\nevidence which require verification after the end of the verification session\nto which they belong. In this respect it must be clarified that it is not and\nnever was the intention of the Commission to disregard information provided in\nthis way outright. The Commission took account of all the information\nsubmitted, analysed its quality (e.g. the extract of audited financial\nstatements is treated in different way from a simple excel table or word\ndocument with figures not supported by any official source) and attributed it\nthe appropriate weight given the fact that it was unable to verify this\ninformation during the on-the-spot verification visit.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning\nthe six documents[24] submitted by the GOC in the course of the investigation and the\ncontent of which the GOC refused to discuss during the on-the-spot verification\nvisit, the GOC claimed that the Commission has no basis to apply facts\navailable in line with Article 28 of the basic Regulation. It also claimed that\nthe Commission failed to assist the GOC in understanding the requirement to\nprovide these documents and to demonstrate that all the documents concerned\nwere relevant despite that the GOC \u201chad specifically invited the Commission\nbefore the start of the verification to assist the GOC in understanding the\nrequirement to provide these documents and to demonstrate that that all the\ndocuments concerned were relevant\u201d. In this respect, firstly, it is noted\nthat all the documents directly pertain the industry concerned[25] and therefore their inclusion within the scope of verification was\nhighly relevant. Secondly, the wording the GOC used in its letter to the Commission\nof 11 April 2013 was different than the one referred to in its letter of 3 June\n2013. In fact the GOC stated, in its letter of 11 April 2013, that the\nverification of said documents \u201cis suspended unless the Commission can\nconvincingly demonstrate to what extent these documents are considered relevant\nto the current investigation, in particular the alleged subsidies\u201d. Since\nall these documents directly concern the industry concerned and even particular\nsubsidy schemes such as preferential lending or preferential tax schemes, as is\nobvious from their wording the Commission did not understand what could be\nadded to demonstrate their relevance even more. It was surprising for the\nCommission that the GOC did not appear to have a problem with the relevance of\nthese documents when they were submitted, but only when the Commission\nrequested explanations.\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 23 May 2013\nthe Commission stated that it was prevented from verifying most of the\nsubmitted information to original documentation and cross-checking it with the\nsource data which were used to prepare the replies of the GOC in respect to the\ninformation on the financial market and financial institutions in the PRC. The\nGOC objected that given the \u201cvery general and unspecific quote\u201d the Commission\nhas not provided the GOC an opportunity to meaningfully comment and therefore\ndoes not enable the GOC to exercise its right of defence in proper way. This\nclaim does not represent reality. In the questionnaire the Commission asked\nvery specific questions and, in line with normal practice of many investigating\nauthorities it attempted to verify the GOC answers during the on spot\nverification visit. \n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, the GOC in its\nreply to the questionnaire stated that \u201cthe loans to the industry concerned\naccount for very small portion of the total loans granted. For example, some\nbanks have described in their appendix questionnaire that the loans granted to\nthe industry concerned accounted for less than 1 % of total loans\u201d. During the\nverification the GOC was not able to support this statement with any evidence\nat all and simply referred the Commission to the banks. \n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also\nrequested statistics on the loans to the industry concerned. The GOC claimed\nthat it does not keep such records. When the Commission inquired whether the\nGOC attempted to compile such statistics and requested this information from\nthe banks the CBRC (Banking regulatory authority in the PRC) official present\nduring the verification replied that he did not know about this as another\ndepartment in the CBRC would be responsible for statistics. No statistics as\nrequested in the questionnaire and repeatedly in the deficiency process were\nsubmitted by the GOC. The Commission indicated again in its pre-verification\nletter that this topic would be covered.\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to banks, the Commission\nalso inquired during the verification visit about the risk and creditworthiness\nassessment, overall operating situation, management situation, credit level,\nfinancial usage, repayment ability, guarantee pattern and business cooperation\nbetween the banks and the borrowers, as the GOC made claims concerning these\nissues in its reply to the questionnaire. Again, despite the fact that these\ntopics were indicated in the pre-verification letter the GOC was not able to\nprovide any evidence supporting its own claims and referred the Commission to\nthe banks.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 In its reply to the deficiency letter the GOC submitted some\ninformation concerning the percentage of government ownership in some banks. It\nis noted that initially the GOC in the questionnaire reply stated that it does\nnot possess such information and that it only submitted information in this\nrespect after the Commission pointed out that Article 24 of the Commercial Bank\nLaw actually requires banks to report this information to the CBRC. When the\nCommission inquired during the verification visit what was the source of this\ninformation, the CBRC official present stated that he did not know as another\ndepartment of the CBRC is responsible for the collection of such data.\nAccording to Article 2 of the Interim Regulations on the Boards of\nSupervisors in Key State-owned Financial Institutions (submitted by EXIM\nBank in its reply to the deficiency letter) \u201cthe list of state-owned\nfinancial institutions to which the State Council dispatches boards of\nsupervisors shall be recommended by the administrative organ for boards of\nsupervisors in state-owned financial institutions\u201d. Since this legal\nprovision refers to the administrative organ for boards of supervisors in\nstate-owned financial institutions, it seems that the GOC is aware of which\nfinancial institutions it owns. Nevertheless, the Commission was not able to\nverify this information or even to identify the source of the information\nbecause of the non-cooperation from the GOC. The publicly available information\nsuggests that there are also other state-owned banks (which provided loans to\nthe sampled exporting producers) in addition to those reported by the GOC in\nits reply to the deficiency letter[26]. \n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 3 June 2013\nthe GOC claimed that the Commission did not either in its questionnaire or in\nthe deficiency letter, \u201cask for the \u201csupporting evidence or data source\u201d and\n\u201cnow suddenly alleges lack of supporting evidence or data source\u201d. To set the record\nstraight the Commission, like any other investigating authority, verifies the\ndata submitted by all parties in the proceeding and the GOC was aware of this\nas Commission pointed out already in its questionnaire and in the cover letter\nto the questionnaire that the replies could be subject to verification.\nMoreover, in its pre-verification letter the Commission included also this\nparticular topic among the issues to be covered during the verification[27]. Therefore the fact that the\nCommission is asking for supporting evidence of the statements made by the GOC\nwas certainly not a surprise for the GOC but the standard procedure followed but\nthe Commission in each and every case.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 When,\nduring the verification, the Commission asked the GOC to submit a list of 10\nbiggest banks in the PRC and the share of the market they represent, the CBRC\nreplied that it is able to submit such information but that it could not answer\nthe question before it was submitted in a written format. The Commission\nexplained that a question asked during the verification visit orally has the\nsame validity as any questions submitted in writing and pointed to the fact\nthat for the other oral questions the GOC did not request their submission in\nwriting before replying. In spite of this clarification, the GOC still did not provide\nthe information.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 In the questionnaire the\nCommission requested documents which were the basis for the establishment of\nthe CBRC and provided it with the mandate. The GOC submitted a document from\nthe National People\u2019s Congress simply stating that the CBRC shall be created.\nWhen the Commission inquired whether there are any other documents specifying\nthe mandate and purpose of the CBRC, the CBRC official present stated that\nthere are many other laws concerning the CBRC but that, if the Commission\nwanted to obtain these documents it should have requested them before the\nverification. It is noted that in the questionnaire the Commission requested\nthe GOC to \u201cprovide documents which were the basis for the establishment of\nthis authority and provided it with the mandate\u201d and therefore, it had\nrequested these documents before the verification.\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 When the Commission\nrequested statistics and reports from the banks which provided loans to the\nsampled exporters for the IP it pointed to Article 33 of the Law of the PRC\non Regulation of and Supervision over the Banking Industry[28] which suggests\nthat the CBRC collects such statistics. The CBRC official present stated that\nhe had to seek permission from the legal department first but he did not\nprovide any information in this respect before the end of the verification.\nAgain it must be noted that the Commission requested this information in the\nquestionnaire and deficiency letter and it had indicated in its\npre-verification letter that statistics would be a topic for the verification.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC further claimed that\nthe allegations in the complaint concerning Chinese banks being public bodies\nare based merely on simple assertions of state shareholding which in turn are\nbased on \u201cillegal\u201d determinations in the Coated Fine Paper case. This\nclaim is a misinterpretation of facts in the complaint. In the complaint, the complainant,\nin addition to the state ownership, refers, inter alia, to the loans\nprovided by banks based on political directives, to the government agencies\ndirecting financial institutions to increase credit and lending to enterprises\nfor promoting new technologies and products (including the PV industry). The Coated\nFine Paper findings on Chinese banks being public bodies were based on more\nelements than merely ownership (e.g. government intervention and guidance of\nbanks to direct preferential lending to the paper industry via Government plans)\nand these findings are fully in line with EU and WTO law. In addition, the\nfindings on the status of state-owned banks as public bodies were confirmed in Organic\nCoated Steel as well.\n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also continued to claim\nthat it was not in its practical ability to provide information on 3,800 banks\nand financial institutions which exist in the PRC and that, in any event the\nCBRC does not retain records concerning the percentage of government ownership\nin banks. The Commission does not understand why the GOC is referring\nrepeatedly to all banks in the PRC in connection with the GOC ownership in them\nwhen the information requested was explicitly limited to those banks \u201cwhere the\nGOC has direct or indirect shareholdership\u201d[29].\nAs explained in recital (127) above the claim of the GOC that the CBRC (or any\nother government authority) does not retain records on its ownership share of\nthe banks seems to be in contradiction with several Chinese legal provisions.\n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 3 June 2013\nthe GOC repeated its claim that it does not have the authority to require\n\u201cindependent banks\u201d to produce confidential information and pointed to the\nletter that had allegedly been sent to the banks on this matter. It is true\nthat during the verification the GOC showed the original of the letter intended\nfor the banks, but when the Commission requested the GOC to submit evidence to\nshow to which banks and financial institutions this letter was sent the GOC was\nnot able to provide such evidence. The GOC also alleged that some of the\ninstitutions indicated in Annex 7 to the deficiency letter were not banks. In\nthis regard the Commission notes that these institutions had been notified to\nthe Commission by the sampled exporting producers as institutions which\nextended loans to them.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission never addressed the issue of the PBOC Circulars\nYinFa [2003] and [2004] in its questionnaire or in the deficiency letters. It\nis noted that in the pre-verification letter the Commission included \u201cPBOC\nregulations/circulars/internal documentation concerning interest rates\nregulation in the PRC\u201d amongst the topics to be covered during the verification.\nIt is obvious that both circulars fall into this category. In its reply to the\ndeficiency letter the GOC even referred to an article on the PBOC website which\nreferred to one of the circulars. However the GOC did not provide any circulars\nfrom PBOC at all and only submitted information from the PBOC website which was\nincomplete in respect of the governance of interest rates on loans and deposits\nin China when compared to Circulars YinFa [2003] and [2004] which are both available\non the web. It is also noted that the GOC did not refuse to submit these documents\non the basis that it was not prepared for such question but rather because of\nthe alleged confidentiality of the circulars. In this regard it must be noted\nthat the GOC\u2019s claim concerning the confidentiality of the PBOC circulars is\ninconsistent with its own practice in this proceeding. In its comments to\ndefinitive disclosure the GOC submitted full version of another PBOC Circular\nto support its claim that the special loans provided by SOCBs were repealed and\nthe confidentiality alleged elsewhere did not seem to be an obstacle. In respect\nto the extracts from the PBOC website, the Commission took note of them and,\ndid not disregard their content. However to have the complete information on\nthe matter also required the information in the two circulars which complemented\nthe information submitted by the GOC.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\nExamination ('IE')\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 Claims for IE were submitted\nby 6 cooperating exporting producers pursuant to Article 27(3) of the basic\nRegulation, i.e. companies CNPV Dongying Solar Power Co. Ltd., Jiangsu Runda PV\nCo., Ltd., Kinve Solar Power Co., Ltd (Maanshan), Phono Solar Technology Co.\nLtd., Shandong Linuo Photovoltaic Hi-Tech Co. Ltd., and Shandong Linuo Solar\nPower Holdings Co. Ltd. It was not possible to grant these companies individual\nexaminations as, due to the high number of alleged subsidy schemes and time\nconsuming nature of the investigation, it would be unduly burdensome and could\nprevent completion of the investigation in good time.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific Schemes\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the\ninformation contained in the complaint the Commission sought information\nrelated to the following schemes, which allegedly involved the granting of\nsubsidies by the Governmental authority:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preferential policy loans, other\nfinancing, guarantees and insurance\n\u2013              \nPreferential policy loans\n\u2013              \nProvision of credit lines \n\u2013              \nExport credit subsidy programmes\n\u2013              \nExport Guarantees and Insurances for Green\nTechnologies\n\u2013              \nBenefits provided through granting of access to\noffshore holding companies and loan repayments by the government\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grant Programmes\n\u2013              \nExport product research development fund\n\u2013              \nSubsidies for development of \u201cFamous Brands\u201d and\nChina World Top Brands Programme\n\u2013              \nFunds for outward expansion of industries in\nGuandong Province\n\u2013              \nThe Golden Sun demonstration programme\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direct Tax Exemption ad Reduction\nprogrammes\n\u2013              \nThe two free/three half programme for foreign\ninvested enterprises (FIEs)\n\u2013              \nIncome tax reduction for export-oriented FIEs\n\u2013              \nIncome tax benefit for FIEs based on\ngeographical location\n\u2013              \nTax reduction for FIEs purchasing Chinese-made\nequipment\n\u2013              \nTax offset for research and development by FIEs\n\u2013              \nTax refunds for reinvestment of FIE profits in\nexport oriented enterprises\n\u2013              \nPreferential tax programmes for FIEs recognised\nas high or new technology enterprises\n\u2013              \nTax reduction for high and new-technology enterprises\ninvolved in designated projects\n\u2013              \nPreferential income tax policy for enterprises\nin the northeast region\n\u2013              \nGuandong province tax programmes\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indirect Tax and Import Tariff\nProgrammes\n\u2013              \nVAT exemptions and import tariff rebates for the\nuse of imported equipment \n\u2013              \nVAT rebates on FIE purchases of Chinese-made\nequipment\n\u2013              \nVAT ad tariff exemptions for purchases of fixed\nassets under the foreign trade development funds programme\n(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government provision of goods and\nservices for less than adequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nGovernment provision of polysilicon for less\nthan adequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nGovernment provision of aluminium extrusions for\nless than adequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nGovernment provision of glass for less than\nadequate remuneration\n\u2013              \nGovernment provision of power\n\u2013              \nGovernment provision of land and land-use rights\nfor less than adequate remuneration\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preferential\npolicy loans, other financing, guarantees and insurance\n(a)                   \nNon-cooperation and the use of facts available\n\u2013              \nFinancial market and institutions in China\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested from the GOC information concerning\nthe proportion of loans provided by the banks where the GOC is the largest or\nsole shareholder, banks where the GOC has a shareholding stake but is not the\nlargest shareholder, banks where the GOC is not a shareholder and banks which\nare foreign owned, to both industry as a whole and to the industry concerned by\nthis proceeding. The GOC replied that it does not retain records of the amounts\nand percentages of the loans provided by the state-owned banks and that the GOC\nalso does not retain the records of loans for the PV industry. The GOC did not\nsuggest any alternative source for this information.\n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\nattached a specific questionnaire (Appendix A) intended for the banks/financial\ninstitutions to the initial anti-subsidy questionnaire and asked the GOC to\nforward it to the banks/financial institutions which provided loans to the\nindustry concerned. The purpose of Appendix A was to verify allegations in the\ncomplaint that Chinese state-owned banks are public bodies. Inter alia,\nthe Commission sought information concerning the structure of government\ncontrol in those Chinese banks and the pursuit of government policies or\ninterests with respect to the photovoltaic industry (i.e. board of directors\nand board of shareholders, minutes of shareholders/directors meetings,\nnationality of shareholders/directors, lending policies and assessment of risk\nwith respect to loans provided to the cooperating exporting producers). In the\nreply to the questionnaire, the GOC submitted a reply to Appendix A only for five\nbanks (the China Development Bank (CDB), the EXIM Bank, the Bank of Shanghai, the\nBank of China[30] and the Huaxia Bank). In the deficiency letter, the Commission\nrepeated its initial request for information. To facilitate the cooperation of\nthe GOC, it provided a list of banks/financial institutions which provided\nloans to sampled companies and asked again the GOC to forward Appendix A to\nthese entities. No additional replies to Appendix A were submitted with the\nreply to the deficiency letter.\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also sought information about the state ownership of the banks and\nfinancial institutions. In its questionnaire reply, the GOC stated that it does\nnot retain any records concerning the ownership shares and it did not provide\nany suggestion on how to obtain this information. When the Commission, in its\ndeficiency letter, pointed out that it is mandatory to include this information\nin the Articles of Association of the banks and these are accessible by the GOC\nas a shareholder, the GOC submitted shareholding information of 16 banks.\nHowever, except for five banks, for which the GOC referred to the annual\nreports as a source, it did not provide any supporting evidence for this\ninformation and neither did it disclose what the source data for this\ninformation was. Concerning the other banks which provided loans to the\nindustry concerned, the GOC did not provide any information at all concerning its\nownership stake. Consequently, the Commission was unable to verify the accuracy\nand correctness of the reported data concerning the state\u2019s ownership stakes in\nthe banks and other financial institutions.\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the BB\nrating applied to the sampled exporting producers (for the purpose of the loan\nbenchmark) is \u201cextremely unfavourable\u201d and that the Commission \u201cin light\nof the actual facts of the case did not explain how did it come to the\nconclusion that this is the accurate or most reasonable conclusion. The GOC\nfurther claimed that this methodology amounts to \u201can impermissible adverse\ninference\u201d. Although this claim was made in relation to the one of the\nprevious cases (i.e. Coated Fine Paper) and before the disclosure of the\ninformation concerning the rating applied to the sample exporting producers in\nthis proceeding, it should be noted that the Commission did not apply \u201cadverse\nfacts available\u201d in this case or in any other cases to which the GOC referred\nin its submission. The Commission had only drawn appropriate conclusions from\nthe facts on the record, which showed a lack of proper credit risk assessment,\nsee recitals (175) to (178). It should be pointed out that during the IP the\nChinese PV industry was making heavy losses and it was clear that its financial\nstatus was extremely difficult. Several credit risk assessments supplied by\nsampled companies demonstrated that a BB assessment for the IP as a whole was\nnot unreasonable. In fact some credit risk assessments clearly demonstrate that\nseveral Groups were in fact more or less insolvent.\n\u2013              \nVerification at banks\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 In its pre-verification\nletter the Commission envisaged the verification of the banks which submitted\nreplies to the Appendix A to the questionnaire and provided a large proportion\nof loans to the sampled exporting producers, i.e. the China Development Bank,\nthe Export-Import Bank of China, the Bank of Shanghai and the Huaxia Bank and\nit included a detailed list of subjects that would be covered during the\nverification. In the initial questionnaire intended for the GOC, the Commission\nhad already made it clear that the information provided in the questionnaire\nreplies might be subject to an on-the-spot verification. In the\npre-verification letter the Commission had also stated that the GOC was \u201crequested\nto make all supporting documents available that were used to prepare your\nsubstantive response, including original source documents and applications\u201d.\nTwo other major providers of preferential financing to the sampled exporting\nproducers either did not submit requested information at all (Agricultural Bank\nof China) or the information was submitted on their behalf without a\npossibility to verify it (Bank of China). \n\u2013              \nBank of Shanghai\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nits pre-verification letter of 25 March 2013 the Commission notified the GOC of\nits intention to verify the Bank of Shanghai (\u201cBoS\u201d) and offered in order to\nfacilitate the verification visit for the GOC, should it be necessary, to\nextend the verification visit until 22 April 2013[31]. In\nits initial reply to the pre-verification letter of 5 April, the GOC did not\nconfirm whether the verification of BoS would take place but enquired whether\nthe Commission would be willing to verify the Bank of Shanghai in another\nlocation to the rest of the verification (i.e. Shanghai instead of Beijing). To\nfacilitate the verification visit, the Commission exceptionally agreed to this;\nhowever, it urged the GOC to confirm the verification in Shanghai by 9 April at\nthe latest (i.e. three working days before the start of the verification in\nBeijing) in order for the team to be able to arrange the practicalities related\nto such a change in the verification planning. Only on 11 April (one working\nday before the start of verification) did the GOC confirm that the BoS was\navailable for verification on 23 or 24 April 2013. On the same day the\nCommission communicated to the GOC that because of such late confirmation it\nwas not possible to arrange for the changes in the schedule. Moreover, the\ndates proposed by the GOC (23 or 24 of April) were beyond the period agreed between\nthe GOC and the Commission in which the verification was due to be carried out\nand even beyond the extension offered by the Commission. As a result the\nCommission was unable to verify the reply to the Appendix A submitted by the\nBoS and information concerning loans provided by this bank to the sampled\nexporting producers. Consequently the Commission in its letter of 23 May 2013\ninformed the GOC that it is considering the application of Article 28 of\nRegulation (EC) No 597/2009 in respect to the unverified information submitted\nby the BoS.\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nits letter of 3 June 2013 the GOC claimed that the verification of BoS did not\ntake place because of the inflexibility on the Commission side, that the\nCommission did not propose any alternative dates for the verification and\nsimply \u201cdeclined to consider the verification of Bank of Shanghai\u201d.\nThese claims are simply incorrect. The Commission stated clearly in its\npre-verification letter that it was initially proposed to verify the banks on\n17 and 18 April 2013 with a possibility of additional day on 22 April, leaving\nit to the GOC to propose appropriate times to visit the banks throughout the\nwhole period of verification (i.e. full working week plus additional day). Yet\nthe GOC proposed dates for verification of BoS outside this window and did so\nonly one working day before the start of verification visit. In the\nCommission\u2019s view, the flexibility offered was more than sufficient and\naltogether six alternative days were offered for the verification of BoS,\ncontrary to the GOC\u2019s claim.\n\u2013              \nHua Xia Bank\n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 23 May 2013\nthe Commission explained to the GOC that it was unable to verify certain parts\nof Huaixia Bank\u2019s (\u201cHuaxia\u201d) reply to Appendix A, namely the ownership\nstructure, the creditworthiness assessment of the sampled exporting producers\nand the risk premiums charged to different industries and in particular to the\nindustry concerned.\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 In its reply of 3 June 2013\nthe GOC claimed that Huaxia explained the ownership structure and provided\nfurther details and explanations to the Commission concerning its shareholders,\nthat the creditworthiness assessment of clients is covered by bank secrecy laws\nand contractual agreements between the banks and its clients.\n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect to the ownership structure it is noted that in its reply to the\nAppendix A Huaxia claimed that it was incorporated \u201cwithout any government\nshares\u201d and did not disclose any information on the government ownership\neven though this was specifically requested by the Commission in the Appendix\nA. The Commission pointed out that this is in contradiction to the other\ninformation provided by the GOC and that Huaxia admitted that some of the\nshareholders are state-owned and provided a paper with information in Chinese\non some of them. It is still not clear from the information submitted by Huaxia\nwhat is the proportion of state ownership of the bank.\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfor the creditworthiness assessment, the Commission notes that the bank was\nable to provide such document for one of the companies (after protecting the\nidentity of the company with some modifications in the document) while for the\nother requested documents it claimed that they are covered by secrecy laws and\ncontractual agreements between the banks and its clients. This discrepancy of\ntreatments difficult to understand.\n\u2013              \nExport Import Bank of China\n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 23 May 2013\nthe Commission informed the GOC that the replies of the Export-Import Bank of\nChina (\u201cEXIM\u201d) to the Appendix A and to the deficiency letters were incomplete\nand that EXIM failed to submit certain documents which were specifically\nrequested, i.e. Articles of Association, the Notice of Establishing\nExport-Import bank of China Issued by the State Council or Measures for the\nmanagement of Export Sellers\u2019s Credit for Hi-Tech products of the Export\n\u2013Import Bank of China. Concerning the Articles of Association, the GOC\nclaimed in its letter of 3 June 2013 that EXIM, because of its internal policy,\ncould not submit Articles of Association (which is an internal management\ndocument) but referred to the on-line version which was allegedly offered to be\nconsulted on the laptop provided by EXIM during the verification. The\nCommission is puzzled by this explanation which makes no sense. If the document\nwas available on-line during the verification the Commission see no reason why\nit could not have been submitted as repeatedly requested already in the\nquestionnaire, deficiency letter and again during the verification. In fact,\nthe claim that EXIM made this document available on the laptop during the\nverification is incorrect. EXIM stated that the Commission should review the\ndocument online but the Commission official explained that they do not have\ninternet access on the verification premises. In addition, EXIM did not even provide\na link to the online version of Articles of Association.\n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 As for the other two\ndocuments, EXIM reasoned that they could not be provided because of their\nconfidential nature and internal rules. It was the EXIM itself which stated in\nits reply to the deficiency letter that the \u201cEXIM bank was\nformed and operates in accordance with The\nNotice of Establishing Export-Import Bank of China Issued by the State Council and\nThe Articles of Association of Export-Import Bank of China \u201c. Therefore this was deemed an essential document for verification\nof the allegations in the complaint that EXIM is public body, but the\nCommission was denied access to this document. In this context it is noted that\nanother policy bank, i.e. CDB provided a similar document concerning its\nestablishment and also several other State Council notices were submitted in\nthis investigation. Also EXIM did not support its claims on the confidentiality\nby any evidence whatsoever. In addition, as explained in recital (117),\ngovernments cannot simply invoke internal rules in order to avoid obligations\nunder the SCM Agreement and basic Regulation. The same applies for the Measures\nfor the management of Export Sellers\u2019s Credit for Hi-Tech products of the\nExport\u2013Import Bank of China where EXIM claimed also confidentiality without\nany supporting evidence and even refused to discuss the purpose of this\ndocument.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 EXIM\nalso failed to provide information on the composition of the Board of Directors\nand Board of Supervisors, which was repeatedly requested, with the explanation\nthat \u201cthe composition of the Board of Directors is changing\u201d and that\nthe Commission\u2019s questions concerning the CCP affiliations of the members of\nthe Board\u2019s \u201care invasive and inappropriate questions in the context of an\nanti-subsidy investigation.\u201d The fact that the composition of the Board of\nDirectors is changing is not relevant for the purpose of this investigation.\nWhat is relevant is how the state is represented in the Boards of EXIM;\nhowever, the GOC and EXIM refused to provide this information. The Commission\nalso considers the CCP membership of senior management of the EXIM (and all\nbanks in this matter) essential for the purpose of establishing the extent of\nstate influence on the banks\u2019 management. According to the CCP Constitution \u201cThe\nParty must uphold and improve the basic economic system, with public ownership\nplaying a dominant role and different economic sectors developing side by\nside\u2026\u201d[32], therefore the examination of influence\nof the CCP in EXIM was deemed to be necessary for the purpose of this\ninvestigation and in particular to assess the level of state control in the\nbanks.\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the statistics on\nthe export of different categories of products already requested in the\nquestionnaire and which EXIM is legally obliged to report to the CBRC, the GOC\nclaimed in its letter of 3 June 2013 that it needed more time to prepare such\ninformation. In this respect it is noted that, since the Commission requested\nthis information already in the initial questionnaire, the GOC had more than\nthree and a half months to prepare this information but failed to do so. EXIM\nalleged that \u201cthis type of information can be found in annual reports\u201d;\nhowever, this is incorrect. The information in the annual reports the GOC referred\nto covers different periods than the information requested by the Commission in\nthe questionnaire and during the verification visit.\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC rightly claimed that\nin the questionnaire reply it submitted, inter alia, the amounts of\nexport credits for exports of mechanical and electrical products and new\nhigh-tech products. It is noted the Commission never contested the submission\nof these figures. The Commission contested the fact that, when it attempted to\nverify these figures during the verification visit, EXIM was not able to\nprovide any supporting evidence or even explain where are these figures come\nfrom. Similarly, the Commission was not allowed to verify the data concerning\nthe proportion of export credits to the PV industry which the GOC submitted in\nthe questionnaire reply. Interestingly enough, EXIM did not consider any of\nthese figures confidential but when the Commission asked for the source data to\nverify them, EXIM refused the access to it, citing confidentiality reasons.\nEXIM applied the same reasoning concerning the amounts of export credits given\nto the sampled producers and cooperating producers. It reported figures in the\nreply to the deficiency letter but did not allow the Commission to verify it on\nthe basis of the confidentiality. Effectively, it was not possible to verify\nthe vast majority of the statistics submitted by EXIM.\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 The EXIM also refused to\nexplain and support with relevant evidence the credit ratings of the sampled\nexporting producers and the analyses which led to these ratings.\n\u2013              \nChina Development Bank (\u201cCDB\u201d)\n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 3 June 2013\nthe GOC was concerned that the Commission asked \u201cpersonal questions\nconcerning the political party affiliations of members of the Boards and senior\nmanagement\u201d. This is not correct. The questions concerning the links of the\nBoard members and senior management to the CCP were purely of technical\ncharacter and, as explained in the recital (151) above, the reason for asking\nthem was to help determine the role of the CCP in Chinese economy.\n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 During the verification the\nCommission attempted to verify the creditworthiness assessment of the sampled\nexporting producers. CDB provided some general information but refused to\ndisclose any information in relation to creditworthiness assessment of the\nsampled exporting producers or even the risk evaluation and assessment report\nof the PV industry. \n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 In the reply to the\ndeficiency letter the CDB submitted a figure concerning the risk premium\ncharged for the industry concerned. During the verification the CDB corrected\nits reply in this respect but did not provide any supporting evidence for this\nfigure or explanation of what was the basis for this figure, despite repeated\nrequests from the Commission during the verification visit.\n(b)                   \nChinese state-owned banks are public bodies\n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant claims that SOCBs in the PRC are public\nbodies within the meaning of Article 2(b) of the basic Regulation.\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nWTO Appellate Body (AB), in its report in United States \u2013 Definitive Anti-Dumping\nand Countervailing Duties on Certain Products from China[33] (the AB report) defined a public body as an entity that\n\"possesses, exercises or is vested with governmental authority\". According\nto the AB, evidence that government exercises meaningful control over an entity\nand its conduct may serve as evidence that the relevant entity possesses\ngovernmental authority and exercises such authority in the performance of\ngovernmental functions. Where the evidence shows that the formal indicia of\ngovernment control are manifold, and there is also evidence that such control\nhas been exercised in a meaningful way, then such evidence may permit an\ninference that the entity concerned is exercising governmental authority[34]. The AB also considered that public bodies are also characterised\nby the \"performance of governmental functions\"[35] which\nwould \"ordinarily be considered part of governmental practice in the legal\norder of the relevant Member\"[36].\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 The following\nanalysis focuses on whether the SOCBs in question perform functions which are\nordinarily considered part of governmental practice in China and, if so, whether\nthey exercise government authority when doing so. The investigation has\nestablished that the Chinese financial market is characterised by government intervention\nbecause most of the major banks are state-owned. The Chinese authorities have\nprovided only very limited information concerning shareholding/ownership of\nbanks in the PRC. However, as further outlined below, the Commission compiled\navailable information in order to arrive at a representative finding. In\nperforming its analysis whether banks are entities possessing, vested with or\nexercising government authority (public bodies) the Commission also sought\ninformation concerning not only the government ownership of the banks but also\nother characteristics such as the government presence on the board of\ndirectors, the government control over their activities, the pursuit of\ngovernment policies or interests and whether entities were created by statute.\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 From\nthe available information it is concluded that the state-owned banks in the PRC\nhold the highest market share and are the predominant players in the Chinese\nfinancial market. According to the 2006 Deutsche Bank Research on the PRC's\nbanking sector[37], the state-owned banks' share may amount to more than 2/3 of the\nChinese market. For the same matter the WTO Trade Policy Review of China noted\nthat \u201cThe high degree of state ownership is another notable feature of the\nfinancial sector in China\u201d[38] and \"there has been little change in the market structure\nof China's banking sector, which is dominated by state-owned banks\"[39]. It is pertinent to note that the five largest state-owned\ncommercial banks (the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction\nBank of China, the Bank of Communications and the Industrial and Commercial\nBank) appear to represent more than half of the Chinese banking sector[40]. The government ownership of the five-largest state-owned banks was\nalso confirmed by the GOC in its reply to the deficiency letter.\n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also requested information concerning the structure of government\ncontrol in those Chinese banks and the pursuit of government policies or\ninterests with respect to the photovoltaic industry (i.e. board of directors\nand board of shareholders, minutes of shareholders/directors meetings,\nnationality of shareholders/directors, lending policies and assessment of risk\nwith respect to loans provided to the cooperating exporting producers).\nNevertheless, as noted in recital (139) above, the GOC provided only very\nlimited information in this respect and did not allow the verification of much\nof the submitted information. Consequently, the Commission had to use the facts\navailable. It concluded on the basis of the available data that those banks are\ncontrolled by the government by means of ownership, administrative control of\ntheir \u201ccommercial\u201d behaviour including the limits set on the deposits and loans\ninterest rates (see recitals (164) - (167) below) and in some cases even by the\nstatutory documents[41]. The relevant data used in order to arrive at the aforesaid\nfindings is derived from information submitted by the GOC, the annual reports\nof Chinese banks that were either submitted from GOC or publicly available,\ninformation retrieved from the 2006 Deutsche Bank Research on China's banking\nsector[42], WTO Policy review on China (2012)[43], China\n2030 World Bank Report[44] or 2010 OECD Economic survey on China[45],\ninformation submitted by the co-operating exporting producers and information\nexisting in the complaint. As for foreign banks, independent sources estimate\nthat they represent a minor part of the Chinese banking sector and consequently\nplay an insignificant role in policy lending; with relevant information\nsuggesting that this may represent as little as 2 % of the Chinese market[46]. Relevant publicly available information also confirms that Chinese\nbanks, particularly the large commercial banks, still rely on state-owned\nshareholders and the government for replenishment of capital when there is a\nlack of capital adequacy as result of credit expansion[47].\n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the banks that provided loans to the cooperating exporting\nproducers, the majority of them are state-owned banks. Indeed, on the basis of\nthe available information[48] it was found that the state-owned banks and other state-owned\nentities provided the great majority of loans to the cooperating exporting\nproducers. These included the major commercial and policy banks in the PRC like\nthe China Development Bank, the EXIM Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, the\nBank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Industrial and Commercial\nBank of China. With respect to the remaining state-owned banks concerned, again\nthe Commission requested the same information mentioned above concerning the\ngovernment control and the pursuit of government policies or interests with\nrespect to the photovoltaic industry. No such detailed information was\nprovided. It is therefore concluded that the banks are controlled by the\ngovernment. Such a meaningful control is evidenced inter alia by the\ngovernmental policy of support to the industry in question, which directs banks\nto act in a particular supportive manner (see recital (102) above). For these\nreasons the state-owned commercial and policy banks in the PRC should be\nconsidered public bodies.\n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 Another sign of GOC involvement\nin the Chinese financial market is the role played by the PBOC in setting the\nspecific limits on the way interest rates are set and fluctuate. Indeed, the investigation\nestablished that the PBOC has specific rules regulating the way interest rates\nfloat in the PRC. According to the information available, these rules are set\nout in the PBOC's Circular on the Issues about the Adjusting Interest Rates on\nDeposits and Loans-Yinfa (2004) No 251 (\"Circular 251\"). Financial\ninstitutions are requested to provide loan rates within a certain range of the\nbenchmark loan interest rate of the PBOC. For commercial bank loans and policy\nbank loans managed commercially there is no upper limit range but only a lower\nlimit range. For urban credit cooperatives and rural credit cooperatives there\nare both upper and lower limit ranges. For preferential loans and loans for\nwhich the State Council has specific regulations the interest rates are not\nallowed to float upwards. The Commission sought clarifications from the GOC on\nthe definition and wording stated in the Circular 251 as well as to its\npreceding legislation (Circular of the PBOC concerning expansion of Financial\nInstitution's Loan Interest Rate Float Range \u2013 YinFa [2003] No. 250). However,\nas described in the recital (135) above, the GOC refused to provide these\nCirculars which prevented the Commission from verifying their content and seeking\nexplanations. Since the GOC did not provide any relevant information in this\nrespect which would suggest the situation changed since March 2013 when the\nCommission concluded its anti-subsidy investigations concerning Organic Coated\nSteel[49] it is established that the PBOC is involved in and influences the setting\nof interest rates by state-owned commercial banks. The GOC did not provide any evidence that the situation as\nestablished in the Coated Fine Paper and Organic Coated Steel investigations\nhas changed. Therefore, on the basis of facts available and the other evidence\ncited above, it was concluded that the situation concerning the methodology for\ndetermining interest rates was the same during the entire IP.\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 Limits\non the loans interest rates together with the ceilings imposed on deposit rates\ncreate a situation in which the banks have guaranteed access to cheap capital\n(because of the deposit rates regulation) and are able to lend to the selected\nindustries at favourable rates. \n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 Banks\nare also subject to legal rules which require them, inter alia, to carry\nout their loan business according to the needs of the national economy[50], provide credit support to encouraged projects[51] or give priority to the development of high and new technology\nindustries[52]. Banks are under an obligation to follow these rules. The sampled\nexporting producers belong to the categories of encouraged projects as well as\nto the high and new technology industries category. \n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 Various\nindependent information sources suggest that the state involvement in the\nChinese financial sector is substantial and on-going. For example the finding\nof the (i) IMF 2006 Working Paper suggested that the bank liberalisation in the\nPRC is incomplete and credit risk is not properly reflected[53]; (ii) the IMF 2009 report highlighted the lack of interest rate\nliberalisation in China[54]; (iii) the IMF 2010 Country Report stated that cost of capital in\nChina is relatively low, credit allocation is sometimes determined by non-price\nmeans and high corporate saving is partly linked to low cost of various factor\ninputs (including capital and land)[55]; (iv)\nthe OECD 2010 Economic Survey of China[56] and\nOECD Economic Department Working Paper No. 747 on China's Financial Sector\nReforms[57] stated that ownership of financial institutions remains dominated\nby the State, raising issues as the extent to which banks' lending decisions\nare based purely on commercial considerations while banks' traditional role\nappears to be that of government agencies with ties to the government. \n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the above evidence, it is concluded that state-owned commercial\nand policy banks perform government functions on behalf of the GOC, namely mandatory promotion of certain sectors of the economy in line with\nstate planning and policy documents. The extensive\ngovernment ownership in the state-owned banks and other information on links\nbetween the state-owned banks and the government (including the non-cooperation\nof the GOC in this regard) confirms that the banks are controlled by the\ngovernment in the exercise of their public functions. The GOC exercises\nmeaningful control over state-owned commercial and policy banks through the\ngovernment\u2019s pervasive involvement in the financial sector and the requirement\nfor state-owned banks to follow government policies. State-owned commercial and\nPolicy banks are therefore considered to be public bodies because they possess,\nare vested with, and exercise, governmental authority.\n(c)                   \nPrivate banks in the PRC are entrusted and\ndirected by the GOC\n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also analysed whether the privately owned commercial banks in the\nPRC are entrusted or directed by the GOC to provide preferential (subsidised)\nloans to the photovoltaic producers, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iv)\nof the basic Regulation.\n\u2013              \nExistence of a GOC policy\n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 From\nthe section above concerning state involvement in the photovoltaic sector\n(recital (101)) and from the findings described below it is clear that the GOC\nhas a policy to provide preferential lending to the photovoltaic sector,\nbecause public bodies (state-owned commercial banks)[58] are\nengaged in such provision and hold a predominant place in the market, which\nenables them to offer below-market interest rates.\n\u2013              \nExtension of policy to private banks\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commercial banking law\n[2003] applies in the same way to state-owned commercial banks and privately\nowned commercial banks. For example Article 38 of this law instructs all\nCommercial banks (i.e. also those which are privately owned) to \"determine\nthe loan rate in accordance with the upper and lower limit of the loan rate set\nby the PBOC\", Article 34 of the Commercial Banking Law instructs the\ncommercial banks to \"carry out their loan business upon the needs of\nnational economy and the social development and with the spirit of state\nindustrial policies\".\n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 Several\ngovernment planning documents policy papers and laws refer to the preferential\nlending to the PV industry. For example, the State Council Decision of 10\nOctober 2010 to encourage development of 7 new strategic industries\npromises the expansion of the intensity of fiscal and financial policy support\nto the strategic industries[59] (PV\nindustry is listed amongst them), encourages financial institutions to \u201cto\nexpand the credit support\u201d to these industries and to \u201cmake use of the\nfiscal preferential policies such as risk compensation\u201d. Also the National\nOutline for Medium and Long-term Science and Technology Development (2006-2020)\nwhich identifies the Solar energy and photovoltaic cells under the Key fields\nand themes of priority[60] promises to \u201cencourage financial institutions to grant\npreferential credit support to major national scientific and technological\nindustrialisation projects\u201d and instructs the government to \u201cguide\nvarious financial institutions and private capitals to participate in science\nand technology development\u201d. The Law of the PRC on Scientific and\nTechnological Progress (Order N.82 of the President of the PRC) defines\nthat the state shall encourage and give guidance to financial\ninstitutions to support the development of high and new technology industries\nby granting loans and that the policy-oriented financial institutions shall\ngive priority to the development of high and new technology industries[61]. According to the same law the policy-oriented financial\ninstitutions shall, within the scope of their business, offer special aid to\nenterprises\u2019 projects of independent innovation encouraged by state[62].\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 Further\nthe above-mentioned limitation on the setting of interest rates by the PBOC\n(recitals (164) and (165)) is also binding for privately \u2013owned commercial\nbanks.\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 The above citations from\nlaws and regulations relevant for the banking sector show that the GOC policy\nto provide preferential lending to the photovoltaic industry extends also to\nprivately-owned commercial banks and in fact the GOC instructs them to \"carry\nout their loan business upon the needs of national economy and the social\ndevelopment and with the spirit of state industrial policies\"[63].\n\u2013              \nCredit risk assessment\n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission requested relevant information from the GOC in order to assess how\nthe banks in the PRC are performing credit risk assessment of the PV companies\nbefore deciding whether to grant them loans or not and deciding on the\nconditions of the loans which are granted. In the Appendix A to the\nquestionnaire the Commission requested information on how the banks take\naccount of risk when granting loans, how the creditworthiness of the borrower is\nassessed, what are the risk premiums charged for different companies/industries\nin the PRC by the bank, which are the factors the bank takes into account when\nassessing the loan application, the description of the loan application and\napproval process etc. However, neither the GOC nor the individual banks\nidentified in the questionnaire provided any evidence in this respect (with one\nexception referred to in recital (176) below. The GOC provided only replies of\ngeneral nature not supported by any evidence whatsoever that any kind of credit\nrisk assessment actually takes place.\n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 During the verifications of one of the banks the Commission\nwas able to review one risk assessment. Part of that credit risk assessment\nreferred to government support for the solar companies and state plans to\npromote the photovoltaic industry in general and this fact was reflected\npositively in the credit rating awarded to this company. This is an example of how\nthe government policy (and subsidies directed to a certain sector) influences\nthe decision-making of the banks when deciding on the terms of financing to\nsolar companies.\n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also\nrequested similar information from the cooperating exporting producers and\nattempted to verify it during the on-spot verification visits of sampled\nexporting producers. Most of the exporting producers replied that banks request\ncertain documents and perform some kind of credit risk analysis before the\nloans are granted. However, they could not support their claims with any\nevidence. During the on-spot verification, the Commission asked for the\nevidence that the banks requested such documents or that these documents were\nprovided to the banks by the companies, or any kind of report issued by the\nbanks proving that such credit risk analysis was performed. But the sampled\ngroups of exporting producers were not able to provide such evidence, neither\nwere they able to provide any other evidence supporting their claims.\n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 The information concerning credit risk assessment was\nrepeatedly requested from interested parties as it is considered crucial inter\nalia account taken of the information referred to in recital (167) above.\n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the findings\nconcerning the credit risk assessment in the PRC apply to state-owned\ncommercial banks, privately owned commercial banks as well as to the policy\nbanks. Indeed the above evidence leads to the conclusion that private banks in the\nPRC are required to follow government policies with regard to lending, in\nparticular to the PV sector and to act in the same way as state-owned banks,\nwhich have been found in recital (168) to be public bodies. It is therefore\nconcluded that private banks are entrusted and directed by the GOC to carry out\nfunctions normally vested in the government, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iv)\nof the basic Regulation.\n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, the above evidence demonstrates that even if the state-owned banks\nwere not considered to be public bodies, they would also be considered as\nentrusted and directed by the GOC to carry out functions normally vested in the\ngovernment, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iv) of the basic Regulation.\n(d)                   \nDistortions of Chinese financial market\n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 From\ninformation collected throughout this investigation it can be concluded that\nthe state-owned banks' share amounts to more than 2/3 of the Chinese market.\nThe five largest state-owned commercial banks (the Agricultural Bank, the Bank\nof China, the Construction Bank of China, the Bank of Communications and the Industrial\nand Commercial Bank ) represent more\nthan half of the Chinese banking sector[64]. In\naddition, the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Banks are\nfully state-owned. These seven banks provided the big majority of loans to the eight\nsampled exporting producers in the Solar panel case. This pervasive state-ownership\ncombined with the distortions of the Chinese financial market and with the\nChinese Government\u2019s policy to direct cheap money towards selected industries,\nundermines the level playing field in international trade and provides an\nunfair advantage to Chinese producers.\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 Banks in the PRC are not\nentirely free to decide the conditions of the loans. In respect of interest\nrates they are bound to stay within the limits set by the People\u2019s Bank of\nChina (PBOC). These limits together with the ceilings imposed on deposit rates\ncreate a situation in which the banks have guaranteed access to cheap capital\n(because of the deposit rates regulation) and are able to lend this on at\nfavourable rates to selected industries. \n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 Banks\nare also subject to legal rules which require them, inter alia, to carry\nout their loan business according to the needs of national economy[65], provide credit support to encouraged projects[66] or give priority to the development of high and new technology\nindustries[67]. Banks are under obligation to follow these rules. \n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto recent findings some big commercial banks in the PRC were granted access to\nstate foreign exchange reserves[68]. This\nsignificantly decreases their cost of capital and this \u201ccheap money\u201d is used\nfor USD and EUR loans for selected companies and projects in line with the\n\u201cgoing out\u201d policy. Thus, they are able to offer conditions which normal\ncommercial banks cannot match.\n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 Another\nmajor distortion in the financing of the photovoltaic industry is the special\nprivileged position of the China Development Bank (\u2018CDB\u2019) which is the major\nlender to this industry and provided big bulk of loans and credit lines to the\nsampled exporting producers. The CDB is financed almost completely by bond\nsales rather than by deposits and it is, after the Ministry of Finance, the\nsecond biggest bond issuer in the country. Through this special mechanism the\nCDB is able to finance itself cheaply and subsequently is able to offer loans\nat preferential conditions to selected industries[69].\n3.4.1.1.\u00a0 Preferential loans\n(a)         \nIntroduction\n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant alleged that\nthe GOC subsidizes its PV industry through preferential loans and directed\ncredit. \n(b)         \nLegal basis\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 The following legal\nprovisions provide for preferential lending in China: Law of the PRC on\nCommercial Banks, General Rules on Loans (implemented by the People\u2019s Bank of\nChina), Decision No 40 of the of the State Council on Promulgating and\nImplementing the Temporary Provisions on Promoting the Industrial Structure\nAdjustment.\n(c)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the totality of the evidence, it is\nconcluded that the vast majority of loans to the sampled groups of exporting\nproducers are provided by state-owned banks which have been found to be public\nbodies in recital (168) above, because they are vested with government\nauthority and exercise government functions. There is further evidence that\nthese banks effectively exercise government authority since, as it is explained\nin recital (164), there is a clear intervention by the State (i.e. the PBOC) in\nthe way commercial banks take decisions on interest rates for loans granted to\nChinese companies. In these circumstances, the lending practices of these\nentities are directly attributable to the government. The fact that banks\nexercise government authority is also confirmed by the way Articles 7 and 15 of\nthe General Rules on Loans (implemented by the PBOC), Decision 40\nand Article 34 of the Law on Commercial Banks act with respect to the\nfulfilment of the government industrial policies. There is also a great deal of\ncircumstantial evidence, supported by objective studies and reports, that a\nlarge amount of government intervention is still present in the Chinese\nfinancial system as already explained in recitals (172) and (178) above.\nFinally, the GOC failed to provide information which would have enabled a\ngreater understanding of the state-owned banks' relationship with government as\nexplained in recitals (139) and (140). Thus, in the case of loans provided by\nstate-owned commercial banks in the PRC, the Commission concludes that there is\na financial contribution to the PV producers in the form of a direct transfer\nof funds from the government within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the\nbasic Regulation. In addition, the same evidence\nshows that SOCBs (as well as privately owned banks) are entrusted or directed\nby the government and this consequently means that a financial contribution\nexists within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iv) of the basic Regulation.\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the analysis in recitals\n(169) to (178) above, it is also determined that privately-owned banks are\nentrusted and directed by the GOC to provide loans to the PV producers and that\na financial contribution exists under Articles 3(1)(a)(i) and 3(1)(a)(iv) of\nthe basic Regulation.\n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 A\nbenefit within the meaning of Articles 3(2) and 6(b) of the basic Regulation\nexists to the extent that the government loans, or loans from private bodies\nentrusted or directed by the government, are granted on terms more favourable\nthan the recipient could actually obtain on the market. Non-government loans in\nthe PRC do not provide an appropriate market benchmark, since it has been\nestablished that privately-owned banks are entrusted and directed by the GOC\nand therefore be presumed to follow the lending practices of the state-owned banks.\nTherefore, benchmarks have been constructed using the method described in\nrecitals (198) - (200) below. Use of this benchmark demonstrates that loans are\ngranted to the PV sector at below-market terms and conditions.\n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPV industry belongs to the encouraged category according to Decision No. 40.\nDecision No 40, is an Order from the State Council, which is the highest\nadministrative body in the PRC and in that regard the decision is legally\nbinding for other public bodies and the economic operators. It classifies the\nindustrial sectors into 'Encouraged, Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. This\nAct represents an industrial policy guideline that along with the Directory\nCatalogue shows how the GOC maintains a policy of encouraging and supporting\ngroups of enterprises or industries, such as the PV/New Energy industry,\nclassified by the Directory Catalogue as an 'Encouraged industry'. With respect\nto the number of industries listed as 'Encouraged' it is noted that these represent\nonly a portion of the Chinese economy. Furthermore, only certain activities\nwithin these encouraged sectors are given \"encouraged\" status.\nDecision No 40 also stipulates under Article 17 that the 'Encouraged investment\nprojects' shall benefit from specific privileges and incentives, inter alia,\nfrom financial support. On the other hand, with reference to the 'Restrictive\nand Eliminated Projects', Decision No 40 empowers the state authorities to\nintervene directly to regulate the market. In fact, Articles 18 and 19 provide\nthat the relevant authority prevents financial institutions from supplying\nloans to such 'Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. It is clear from the above\nthat Decision No 40 provides binding rules to all the economic institutions in\nthe form of directives on the promotion and support of encouraged industries,\none of which is the PV industry.\n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 As explained in recital (172) above the GOC directs\npreferential lending to the limited number of industries and the PV industry is\none of them. Taking all the above into\nconsideration it becomes clear that the authorities only allow the financial\ninstitutions to provide preferential loans to a limited number of\nindustries/companies which comply with the relevant policies of the GOC. On the\nbasis of the evidence on the file and in the absence of the cooperation from\nthe GOC on this matter it is concluded that the subsidies in form of\npreferential lending are not generally available and are therefore specific in\nthe meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation. Moreover, there was no\nevidence submitted by any of the interested parties suggesting that the subsidy\nis based on objective criteria or conditions under Article 4(2)(b) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(d)         \nConclusion\n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat all sampled exporting producers benefited from the preferential lending in\nthe investigation period.\n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the financing\nof the PV industry should be considered a subsidy.\n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the existence of\na financial contribution, a benefit to the exporting producers and specificity,\nthis subsidy should be considered countervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. According to Article 6(b) of\nthe basic Regulation the benefit conferred on the recipients is considered to\nbe the difference between the amount that the company pays on the government\nloan and the amount that the company would pay for a comparable commercial loan\nobtainable on the market.\n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above (recital (190)),\nsince the loans provided by Chinese banks reflect substantial government\nintervention in the banking sector and do not reflect rates that would be found\nin a functioning market, an appropriate market benchmark has been constructed\nusing the method described below. Furthermore, due to the lack of cooperation\nby the GOC, the Commission has also resorted to facts available in order to\nestablish an appropriate benchmark interest rate.\n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 When\nconstructing an appropriate benchmark for RMB denominated loans, it is\nconsidered reasonable to apply Chinese interest rates, adjusted to reflect\nnormal market risk. Indeed, in a context where the exporters' current financial\nstate has been established in a distorted market and there is no reliable\ninformation from the Chinese banks on the measurement of risk and the\nestablishment of credit ratings, it is considered necessary not to take the\ncreditworthiness of the Chinese exporters at face value, but to apply a mark-up\nto reflect the potential impact of the Chinese distorted market on their\nfinancial situation.\n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 The same situation applies\nfor the loans denominated in foreign currencies. The BB rated corporate bonds\nwith relevant denominations issued during the IP were used as a benchmark. \n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nrespect to the above as explained in recitals (138) to (140), both the GOC and\nthe cooperating exporting producers were requested to provide information on\nthe lending policies of the Chinese banks and the way loans were attributed to\nthe exporting producers. Although repeatedly requested, such information was\nnot obtained. Accordingly in view of this lack of cooperation and the totality\nof facts available, and in line with the provisions of Article 28(6) of the\nbasic Regulation, it is deemed appropriate to consider that all firms in China\nwould be accorded the highest grade of \"Non-investment grade\" bonds\nonly (BB at Bloomberg) and apply the appropriate premium expected on bonds\nissued by firms with this rating to the standard lending rate of the People's\nBank of China. The benefit to the exporting producers has been calculated by\ntaking the interest rate differential, expressed as a percentage, multiplied by\nthe outstanding amount of the loan, i.e. the interest not paid during the IP.\nThis amount was then allocated over the total turnover of the co-operating\nexporting producers.\n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preferential policy loans \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

The investigation confirmed that indeed all\ninvestigated companies received huge credit lines from Chinese banks which were\nin most cases provided free of charge or subject to very small fees. In normal\nmarket circumstances such credit lines are subject to substantial commitment\nand administration fees which allow the banks to compensate for the costs and\nrisks.\n(b)         \nFindings\nof the investigation\nCredit lines are a potential transfer of funds\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 The EC-Aircraft\npanel report confirmed that such credit lines, over and above the effects\nof the individual loans, can be potential direct transfers of funds under\nArticle 3(1)(a) (i) of the basic Regulation and thus financial contributions.\nThe panel found that the benefit of a potential transfer of funds arises from\nthe mere existence of an obligation to make a direct transfer of funds.\nThe panel also found that a credit line could, in and of itself, confer\na benefit to the recipient firm and was thus a potential transfer of funds\nseparate from any direct transfers of funds in the form of individual loans[70].\nThe banks providing the credit lines are public\nbodies or are entrusted by the government\n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 The credit lines were\nprovided to the sampled exporting producers by the same banks as the\npreferential loans described above. As established above these banks are public\nbodies (recitals (158) to (166)) or are entrusted and directed by the GOC to\nprovide preferential financing to the PV industry (recitals (169) to (178)). \n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above (recitals\n(158) to (185)) the Chinese market is distorted by laws and practices of the\nstate-owned banks and it was found that in most cases the credit lines were\nprovided free of charge or subject to very small fees. In normal market\ncircumstances such credit lines are subject to substantial commitment and\nadministration fees which allow the banks to compensate for the costs and\nrisks.\n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of benefit is\nrepresented by the fees normally applicable to commercial credit lines extended\nto the companies from which the sampled exporting producers were relieved in\nmost cases. The Commission used the fees applied to the credit line extended to\none of the sampled exporting producers by a foreign commercial bank.\n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPV industry belongs to the encouraged category according to the Decision No.\n40. Decision No 40 is an Order from the State Council, which is the highest\nadministrative body in the PRC and in that regard the decision is legally\nbinding for other public bodies and the economic operators. It classifies the\nindustrial sectors into 'Encouraged, Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. This\nAct represents an industrial policy guideline that along with the Directory\nCatalogue shows how the GOC maintains a policy of encouraging and supporting\ngroups of enterprises or industries, such as the PV/New Energy industry,\nclassified by the Directory Catalogue as an 'Encouraged industry'. With respect\nto the number of industries listed as 'Encouraged' it is noted that these\nrepresent only a portion of the Chinese economy. Furthermore, only certain\nactivities within these encouraged sectors are given \"encouraged\"\nstatus. Decision No 40 also stipulates under Article 17 that the 'Encouraged\ninvestment projects' shall benefit from specific privileges and incentives,\ninter alia, from financial support. On the other hand, with reference to the\n'Restrictive and Eliminated Projects', Decision No 40 empowers the state\nauthorities to intervene directly to regulate the market. In fact, Articles 18\nand 19 provide that the relevant authority prevents financial institutions from\nsupplying loans to such 'Restrictive and Eliminated Projects'. It is clear from\nthe above that Decision No 40 provides binding rules to all the economic\ninstitutions in the form of directives on the promotion and support of\nencouraged industries, one of which is the PV industry.\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nexplained in recitals (172) and (192) above the GOC directs the preferential\nlending of which the provision of credit lines is essential part to the limited\nnumber of industries. The PV industry belongs to this group of industries and\nbenefits from discriminatory preferential lending.\n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking\nall the above into consideration it becomes clear that the authorities only\nallow the financial institutions to provide preferential credit lines to a limited\nnumber of industries/companies which comply with the relevant policies of the\nGOC. On the basis of the evidence on the file and in the absence of the\ncooperation from the GOC on this matter it is concluded that the subsidies in\nform of disproportionate credit lines are not generally available and are\ntherefore specific in the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation.\nMoreover there was no evidence submitted by any of the interested parties\nsuggesting that the subsidy is based on objective criteria or conditions under\nArticle 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation.\n(c)         \nConclusion\n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat all groups of sampled exporting producers benefited from credit lines\nprovided free of charge or at below-market rates in the investigation period.\n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the extension\nof such credit lines to the PV industry should be considered a subsidy.\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the existence of\na financial contribution, a benefit to the exporting producers and specificity,\nthis subsidy should be considered countervailable.\n(d)         \nCalculation of subsidy amount\n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of credit\nlines free of charge or for below-market fees is considered a provision of\nfinancial services (Article 3(1)(a)(iii) of the basic Regulation) for less than\nadequate remuneration. The amount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in\nterms of the benefit conferred on the recipients, which is found to exist\nduring the IP. Because of the market distortions described in recitals (158) to\n(185) above the adequacy of the remuneration for the financial services (in\nthis case provision of credit lines) could not be determined in relation to\nprevailing market conditions in the PRC. Therefore in accordance with Article\n6(d)(ii) of the basic Regulation the benefit conferred on the recipients is considered\nto be the difference between the amount that the company pays for the provision\nof credit lines by Chinese banks and the amount that the company would pay for\na comparable commercial credit line obtainable on the market. Credit lines\ncould also be considered as a potential transfer of funds under Article under\nArticle 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation.\n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the sampled exporting\nproducers obtained a credit line from the bank whose headquarters is established\nin a financial jurisdiction other than the PRC and this credit line was subject\nto commitment and arrangement fees as is the usual practice on world financial\nmarkets. Although the credit line was extended by the Chinese subsidiary of the\nbank in question, it is considered to be a reasonable proxy for a benchmark. It\nwas considered appropriate to use the fees applied to this credit line as a\nbenchmark in accordance with the Article 6(d)(ii) of the basic Regulation. \n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 The level of the fees used a\nbenchmark was applied pro-rata to the amount of each credit line in question to\nobtain the amount of subsidy (minus any fees actually paid). In cases where the\nduration of the credit line was more than one year, the total amount of subsidy\nwas allocated over the duration of the credit line and an appropriate amount\nattributed to the IP.\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision of credit lines \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

The GOC submitted only a Notice issued jointly by the Ministry of\nCommerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) and Sinosure in 2004, but failed to submit a number of\nother relevant documents including for instance the so-called 840 Plan included\nin the Notice by the State Council of 27 May 2009[71]. \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards the verification of the questionnaire reply and Annex 1 concerning\nSinosure, the Commission was unable to obtain a number of documents and to\nverify a number of elements requested on spot. In particular, Sinosure did not\nsubmit the following information and evidence requested by the Commission: (a)\nthe 2012 financial statements, which, reportedly, would not yet be available\nyet on Sinosure's website; (b) the relevant documentation concerning the export\ncredit insurance with two of the sampled cooperating exporters, including\ncontracts, risk assessment, correspondence and proof of payments of premia; (c)\nspecific information on the senior managers appointed by the State Council; (d)\nevidence concerning the elements and advantages listed in the 2004 Notice\njointly issued by MOFCOM and Sinosure, including on the limitation approval, on\nthe rate flexibility and the discount within the premium floating range; (e)\nevidence concerning the long-term operating costs and profits of the export\ncredit insurance activity; (f) evidence concerning the assessment of the market\nsituation in the photovoltaic sector.\n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission was also unable to verify a number of elements included in the\nquestionnaire reply concerning Sinosure operations, including in particular its\nanswers concerning the risk assessment, the actual setting of the premium and\nthe application and approval process, given the refusal by Sinosure to discuss\nthe specific contracts with the sampled cooperating exporters. Sinosure was\nalso unable to clarify or submit supporting documents for some inconsistencies\nin the figures or other elements contained in its questionnaire and deficiency\nletter replies identified by the Commission.\n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC and Sinosure sought to justify this lack of cooperation on the basis of\nconfidentiality concerns during the verification visit and in the GOC letter of\n3 June 2013. In this regard, the pre-verification letter and subsequent email\ncorrespondence made it very clear that the Commission required the verification\nto be meaningful and would obviously take all necessary precautions to protect\nthe confidential information submitted or simply just provided for inspection,\nin accordance with its legal obligation to protect this information ensured by\nthe relevant strict EU rules. With regard to the documents Sinosure tried to\nsubmit well after termination of the verification visit and for which it failed\nto allow proper verification by the Commission, they cannot be taken into account\nas they were specially prepared for the investigation and the Commission could\nnot verify the source documents.\n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 Given this lack of\ncooperation by the GOC and Sinosure, the Commission was unable to verify a\nnumber of elements concerning the provision of export credit insurance cover by\nSinosure to the sampled cooperating exporting producers of the product\nconcerned. Therefore, some of the Commission\u2019s findings are based on the\ninformation available on the record in accordance with Article 28 of the basic\nRegulation.\n(c)         \nSinosure is a public body\n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\nestablished that Sinosure is a public body within the meaning of Article 2(b)\nof the basic Regulation and of the relevant WTO jurisprudence[72] as it possesses exercises or is vested with governmental authority.\nIn particular, the GOC exercises meaningful control over Sinosure[73] and Sinosure exercises governmental authority in its performance of\ngovernmental functions.\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission notes that\nthe activity of export credit insurance performed by Sinosure is integral part\nof the broader financial sector where it is established that the government\nintervention directly interferes and distorts the normal functioning of the\nfinancial market in the PRC (see recitals (185) and following above).\n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 Sinosure performs\ngovernmental functions in its role as the sole official institution for export\ncredit insurance in the PRC. It is therefore in a monopolistic position in the\nexport credit insurance market. The company confirmed that this market is not\nopen, although there are some international competitors conducting business\nindirectly in the PRC.\n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 The government exercises\nfull ownership and financial control over Sinosure. Sinosure is a State sole\nproprietorship owned 100 % from the State Council. The registered capital of\nRMB 4 billion comes from the venture fund of export credit insurance in line\nwith the state finance budget. Furthermore, the State injected in 2011 RMB 20\nbillion through the China Investment Corporation, the sovereign wealth fund of\nChina.[74] The Articles of Association (\u201cAoA\u201d) state that the business\ncompetent department of the company is the Ministry of Finance, and also\nrequires the company to submit financial and accounting reports and the fiscal\nbudget report to the Ministry of Finance for examination and approval.\n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to government\ncontrol, as a state sole proprietorship Sinosure does not have a Board of\nDirectors. As for the Board of Supervisors, all of the supervisors are\nappointed by the State Council and execute their duties according to the\n\u201cInterim Regulation on the Board of Supervisors of Important State-owned\nFinancial Institution.\u201d The senior management of Sinosure is also appointed by\nthe government. The company\u2019s Annual Report 2011 (\u201cAR 2011\u201d) shows that the\nChairman of Sinosure is the Secretary of the Party Committee, and the majority\nof the Senior Management are also Members of the Party Committee. Given the\nrefusal by Sinosure to submit further information on the Senior Management, it\ncan be concluded that the management is direct expression of the government\nthat directly appoints the members of the Board of Supervisors as well as of\nthe Senior Management. On this basis, Sinosure is meaningfully controlled by\nthe GOC.\n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 The performance of\ngovernment functions and policies by Sinosure emerges so clearly and explicitly\nthat it can be concluded that the company is a direct expression of the\ngovernment itself. Sinosure\u2019s Annual Report 2011 contains several statements in\nthis respect, namely: Sinosure \u201cproactively carried out the policy function of\nan ECA \u2026 and achieved a good start in the first year of the 12th \u201cFive-Year\nPlan\u201d period\u201d (p. 4 AR 2011); \u201cthe furtherance of corporate reform reinforced\nthe policy function of Sinosure as an ECA. The CCCPC Conference on Economy has\nlaid emphasis on such function and made clear requirements on credit insurance,\nwhich lined out our growth path\u201d (p. 5 AR 2011); \u201cIn the year of 2011, Sinosure\nimplemented CPC Central Committee\u2019s and State Council\u2019s strategies, decisions\nand arrangements as well as state policies on diplomacy, foreign trade,\nindustry and finance, gave full play to its policy function and achieved a fast\ngrowth\u201d (p. 11 AR 2011); \u201cSinosure fully executed the state policy of \u201cSpecial\nArrangement for Export Financing Insurance for Large Complete-set Equipment\u201d\nand fulfilled its obligations laid out by the State\u201d (p. 11 AR 2011).\n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninstitutional framework and other documents issued by the GOC under which\nSinosure operates further prove its function as a public body and that it is\nvested with the authority to carry out governmental policies. The Notice on\nthe Implementation of the Strategy of Promoting Trade through Science and\nTechnology by Utilising Export Credit Insurance (Shang Ji Fa[2004] No. 368 of\n26 July 2004) was issued jointly by MOFCOM and Sinosure in 2004\nand still governs Sinosure\u2019s activities. Among the objectives of this Notice is\nthe promotion of the export of high and new technology and of high value-added\nproducts through the further use of export credit insurance. The Notice\nexplicitly mandates Sinosure to support the key export industries specified in\nthe Directory of Chinese High and New Technology Products of 2006. This\nDirectory includes \u2018Solar Power Cells and Modules\u2019 among the eligible products\nand therefore they can be considered to be directly supported by Sinosure. The\nfollowing advantages are laid down in the Notice: a \u201cgreen channel\u201d, that is a\nspecific support for products covered in the catalogue, which should receive\napproval within five days if the underwriting conditions are met and the\nlimitation approval for insurance with priority; claim speed, to be completed\nwithin three months of receipt of the claim documents; rate flexibility,\nconsisting of the highest discount to the premium rate within the floating\nrange of Sinosure. The Notice also foresees that regional and local commerce\nauthorities shall take further measures to support the products covered in the\nDirectory. The Notice requires Sinosure to tailor the underwriting model based\non the national industrial policy and the characteristics of high and new\ntechnology product exports and to provide support to the innovation and R&D\nindustries especially supported by the state.\n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission is aware of other documents proving that Sinosure directly carries\nout governmental policies benefiting inter alia the exporting producers. The\nso-called 840 plan is detailed in the Notice by the State Council of 27\nMay 2009[75]. This name refers to the use of USD 84 Billion as export insurance\nand it is one of the six measures launched by the State Council in year 2009 to\nstabilize export demand further to the global crisis and the consequent\nincreased demand for export credit insurance. The six measures include notably\nan improved coverage of export credit insurance, the provision of short-term\nexport credit insurance on a scale of USD 84 billion in 2009 and a reduction of\nthe premium rate. As the only policy institution underwriting export credit\ninsurance, Sinosure is indicated as the executor of the plan. As for the\nreduction of the insurance premium, Sinosure was required to ensure that the\naverage rate of short-term export credit insurance would be reduced by 30 % on\nthe basis of the overall average rate in 2008.\n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nso-called 421 plan was included in the Notice on the issues to implement\nspecial arrangements for financing of insurance on the export of large complete\nsets of equipment issued jointly by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry\nof Finance on 22 June 2009. This was also an important policy supporting\nChina\u2019s \"going out\" policy in response to the 2009 global financial\ncrisis and provided USD 42.1 billion of financing insurance to support the\nexport of large complete sets of equipment. Sinosure and some other financial\ninstitutions would manage and provide the funding. Enterprises covered by this\ndocument could enjoy the preferential financial measures, including\nexport-credit insurance. Due to the non-cooperation of the Government of China,\nthe Commission was unable to request additional details on the application of\nthis notice. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Commission has\nreason to believe that the PV equipment and the PV sector are also covered by\nthis document.\n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 Other\ndocuments showing government support to the provision of short-term export\ncredit insurance include two documents concerning increased financial support\nto Strategic Emerging Industries (\u201cSEIs\u201d). The Notice by the State Council on\nCultivation and development of the State Council on Accelerating Emerging\nindustries of strategic decision, Guo Fa [2010] No. 32 of 18/10/2010, at Para\n7(C) encourages financial institutions to increase financial support. The\nImplementation guidelines for the development of SEIs issued jointly by all\nministries responsible (i.e. National Development and Reform Commission,\nMinistry of Commerce, Ministry of Science, and Ministry of Industry and\nInformation Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of\nFinance, State Administration of Taxation, General Administration of Customs,\nGeneral Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection Intellectual Property\nOffice) Guo Fa [2011] No. 310 of 21 October 2011, also specifically refers at\nPara (Xxvii) to the active support by way of inter alia export credit insurance\nto strategic emerging industries. These strategic emerging industries focus on\nproducts, technologies and services to develop the international market,\naerospace, high-end equipment manufacturing, a large amount or stimulate\ndomestic patented technology and standard export strategic emerging industrial\nproducts. Therefore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary there is reason\nto believe that also the product concerned and the sampled exporters qualify as\n\u2018strategic emerging industries\u2019 and are entitled to the ensuing benefits.\n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\nelements, the Commission concludes that Sinosure is a public body as it is\nvested with government authority to carry out government policies, is\nmeaningfully controlled by the government and exercises government functions.\n(d)         \nLegal Basis\n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nlegal bases for this programme are the following: the Notice on the\nImplementation of the Strategy of Promoting Trade through Science and\nTechnology by Utilising Export Credit Insurance (Shang Ji Fa[2004] No. 368),\nissued jointly by MOFCOM and Sinosure; the Export Directory of Chinese High and\nNew Technology Products of 2006; the so-called 840 plan included in the Notice\nby the State Council of 27 May 2009; the so-called the so-called 421 plan\nincluded in the Notice on the issues to implement special arrangements for\nfinancing of insurance on the export of large complete sets of equipment,\nissued jointly by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance on 22\nJune 2009; Notice on Cultivation and development of the State Council on\nAccelerating Emerging industries of strategic decision (Guo Fa [2010] No. 32 of\n18 October 2010), issued by the State Council and its Implementing Guidelines\n(Guo Fa [2011] No. 310 of 21 October 2011).\n(e)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nSinosure is a public body vested with government authority and executing\ngovernmental laws and plans, the provision of export credit insurance to\nproducers of the product concerned constitutes a financial contribution in the\nform of potential direct transfer of funds from the government within the\nmeaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation.\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the rebate of\npart of the premium paid by the exporting producers by the local authorities,\nthis also constitutes a direct transfer of funds in the form of a grant\naccording to Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation.\n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 A\nbenefit within the meaning of Articles 3(2) and 6(c) of the basic Regulation\nexists to the extent that Sinosure provides export credit insurance cover on\nterms more favourable than the recipient could normally obtain on the market,\nor that it provides insurance cover that would otherwise not be available at\nall on the market. An additional benefit within the meaning of Article 3(2)\nreceived by the exporting producer is the cash rebate of part of the insurance premium\npaid to Sinosure by some of the local authorities where some exporting\nproducers were established.\n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 The\n2004 Notice listed all the range of benefits conferred by Sinosure and/or by\nthe local authorities for enterprises falling in the 2006 Directory and\ncomplying with the national policies. The investigation has shown that the\ninsurance agreements concluded between Sinosure and the sampled exporting producers,\nand the rebates of part of the premia granted by the local authorities fully\nreflect these benefits. The \u201cGreen Express\u201d treatment consists of the\nsimplification and the speed in dealing with the process of providing cover and\nsettling the claims with a rapid assessment of the loss and subsequent\naccelerated payment to the client.\n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation also\nshowed that the measures taken further to the 2009 financial crisis and\ndetailed in the 840 plan and in the 421 plan, and later on in the 2011 measures\nin favour of strategic emerging industries, provided substantial benefits to\nthe exporting producers. These measures increased the availability of insurance\ncover and further reduced the premium charged by Sinosure, despite the\ndifficult economic situation and the substantially increased risks for Sinosure\nin providing insurance cover, and they are fully reflected in the insurance\ncover provided by Sinosure to the exporting producers. In particular, the\ninvestigation showed that the conditions and the premium charged in the\nrelevant years covering the IP have remained substantially the same or have\nimproved, despite the increase in the claims for default paid out by Sinosure\nand the substantially deteriorating situation of the PV sector.\n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nregard to the existence of a benefit, the Commission first examined to what\nextent Sinosure\u2019s premiums covered the cost of short-term export credit\ninsurance. Sinosure made the argument based on Item (j) of the WTO Agreement on\nSubsidies and Countervailing Measures (\u201cSCM\u201d), which considers as a\n\u2018prohibited\u2019 export subsidy under Article 3(1)(a) of that agreement the\nprovision of export credit insurance programmes at premium rates which are\ninadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes.\nIn its questionnaire reply, Sinosure simply referred to the profits and losses\nrealised over the last five years and concluded that since overall it made a\nprofit during this period, the provision of short-term export credit insurance\nto the exporting producers did not constitute a subsidy under the WTO SCM\nAgreement. As explained above (see recitals (221) and (222)), the Commission\nasked Sinosure to provide specific information and evidence concerning the\nlong-term profitability of its export credit insurance activities, including\npremium income and operating costs and losses of the programme in accordance\nwith the WTO SCM Agreement. However, Sinosure failed to submit the documents\nand evidence requested during the verification visit, insisting on the overall\nprofitability data as shown in its audited Annual Reports.\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission notes that,\neven if it would simply rely on Sinosure\u2019s Annual Reports without being able to\nverify the figures and the elements contained in these Reports, it would not be\nable to conclude that Sinosure has achieved long-term profits on its export\ncredit insurance division, which corresponds to the \u201cprogramme\u201d referred to in\nItem (j). Sinosure carries out a number of activities in addition to export\ncredit insurance, and the figures and data reported in\nthe Annual Report are consolidated data for all these activities and there is\nno precise breakdown of each of these activities. From some of the Annual\nReports (but not the recent one) it appears that the short-term export credit\ninsurance is by far the most important activity for Sinosure, but no precise\npercentages are available. As Sinosure refused to provide the requested\ninformation and evidence with regard to this latter activity only, which is\nrequired to carry out the analysis of the \u201cprogramme\u201d under Item (j) of Annex\n1of the WTO SCM Agreement, the Commission has to base its findings on the\nevidence available on record.\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission notes at the outset that according to Article 11 of Sinosure\u2019s Articles\nof Association the company operates at breakeven. In other words, by statute\nSinosure does not aim to maximize its profits, but has to aim merely to\nbreakeven in accordance to its function as the sole official export credit\ninsurer in the PRC. As explained above, the records on file have shown that the\nlegal and policy environment in which Sinosure operates requires the company to\nexecute the government policies and plans in fulfillment of its public policy\nmandate. Among the selected industries and enterprises specifically supported\nby the State, the exporting producers have had full access to export credit\ninsurance provided by Sinosure at preferential rates even in the aftermath of\nthe global crisis of 2009 and even when the photovoltaic sector has experienced\nan unprecedented crisis including during the IP. Therefore, Sinosure provides\nunlimited availability of insurance cover for the PV sector and the extremely\nlow insurance premium it offers do not reflect the actual risks incurred in\ninsuring the exports in this sector. Based on all these elements on the record,\nit could already be concluded that it cannot be excluded that the premium rates\ncharged by Sinosure are likely to be inadequate to cover its long-term\noperations, and in fact this would appear likely.\n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of cooperation by Sinosure, the Commission considered\neven additional elements further supporting this conclusion. The evidence\npublicly available explicitly already shows that in fact Sinosure operates in a\nsituation of long-term operating losses[76]. The\nCommission also analyzed the relevant figures in the income statement of\nSinosure\u2019s Annual Reports covering the years 2006 through 2011 submitted by\nSinosure to justify the profitability figures reported in its questionnaire reply.\nThese figures show that Sinosure included a significant long-term operating\nloss from its combined insurance activities that exclude investment income and\nother income. More specifically, in each single year between 2006 and 2011\n(with the sole exception of 2010) the claims paid out are already (almost)\nequal or (far) exceed the net premiums earned by Sinosure. If the operating\nexpenses and the commission expenses are also subtracted from the net premiums,\nthe result is an even more substantial loss. The figures show that despite the\nmodest gain in 2010, in the overall period the operating loss on the insurance\noperations is significant. It emerges from the Annual Reports that the\nsignificant contributors to Sinosure\u2019s overall income are investment income and\nother income, which are not relevant for assessing the viability of its export\ncredit insurance programme. As short-term export-credit insurance constitutes\nthe bulk of Sinosure\u2019s business activity, in the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary it is concluded that Sinosure has sustained a significant long-term\nloss from its export credit insurance programme. Given that Sinosure makes\nlosses on its export credit insurance programme, the existence of a benefit is\ndetermined by comparing the premiums paid by the exporting producers to those\navailable on the market. Sinosure is the sole official export credit insurer and\ntherefore fully controls the domestic market In the absence of any commercial\nbenchmark in the PRC for such instruments and given that the financial market\nin the PRC is distorted by government intervention, it is reasonable to use a\nbenchmark outside the PRC i.e. premiums charged in a normal market situation.\nOn this basis, as described in the section below on calculation of the subsidy\namount, the premiums are at below-market rates and a benefit is conferred.\n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 The above subsidies are\ncontingent upon export performance within the meaning of Article 4(4)(a) of the\nbasic Regulation because they cannot be obtained without exporting. In addition,\nthey are also specific under Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation because\naccess is limited to certain enterprises. The solar cells and modules are\nexplicitly listed in the 2006 Directory of High and New Technology Products,\nwhich is the condition to enjoy the preferential treatment laid down in the\n2004 Notice. Furthermore, one of Sinosure\u2019s main objectives is to implement the\nnational policies and plans, including the 12th five-year plan on the PV\nsector. The 840 plan and the 421 plans also benefit the PV sector among a few\nother sectors singled out in those plans (see recitals (232) and (233)). The PV\nsector is also considered as one of the encouraged industries according to\nDecision No. 40 and other planning documents and laws (see recital (207) and (208)).\nThis industry also falls in the category of the \u2018Strategic and Emerging\nindustries\u2019 enjoying a number of benefits according to governmental policies\n(see recital (102)). Most of the exporting producers also have the formal status of\nHigh and New Technology enterprises, which confers them a number of advantages\nbecause of the advantageous governmental policies.\n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis therefore evident that the benefits granted by Sinosure or by the local\nauthorities reimbursing part of the insurance premium are not available for all\nof the industrial sectors and for all of enterprises, but they are restricted\nonly to those sectors and enterprises that specifically comply with the\nrelevant government support policies and their underlying documents. The Commission\nconcludes that the benefits granted by Sinosure and/or by the local authorities\nto the producers of the product concerned are specific in the meaning of\nArticle 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation. Furthermore, as there was no evidence\nsuggesting that the subsidy is based on objective criteria or conditions under\nArticle 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation, the benefit is specific also in this\nrespect.\n(f)          \nConclusion\n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat six groups of sampled exporting producers benefited from the export credit\ninsurance provided by Sinosure in the investigation period.\n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of export\ncredit insurance by Sinosure to the PV industry is to be considered a subsidy,\nto the extent that premiums are at below-market rates.\n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the existence of\na financial contribution, a benefit to the exporting producers and specificity,\nthis subsidy should be considered countervailable.\n(g)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The calculation of the\nbenefit is akin to the situation involving loan guarantees. According to\nArticle 6(c) of the basic Regulation the benefit conferred on the recipients is\nconsidered to be the difference between the amount of the premium that the\ncompany pays on the short-term insurance provided by Sinosure and the amount of\nthe premium that the company would pay for comparable export-credit insurance\nobtainable on the market.\n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 As short-term export credit\ninsurance provided by Sinosure is the result of governmental policy objectives\nand as Sinosure is in a monopolistic situation in the domestic market in its\nfunction as the sole official export credit agency, an appropriate market\nbenchmark has been constructed using the method described below. Furthermore,\ndue to the lack of cooperation by the GOC and Sinosure, the Commission has also\nresorted to facts available in order to establish an appropriate market premium\nfor the insurance provided to the PV producers.\n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission believes that the most appropriate benchmark for which information\nis readily available are the premium rates applied by the Export-Import Bank\n(\u201cEx-Im Bank\u201d) of the United States of America. According to publicly available\ninformation,[77] the Ex-Im Bank is the official export credit agency of the US\nfederal government and is self-sustaining. The activities of Ex-Im Bank include\nexport credit insurance and other activities, such as working capital guarantees\nand loan guarantees (buyer financing). Its mission is to create and support\nU.S. jobs by supporting U.S. exports to international buyers. The Ex-Im bank\nacts as a government corporation by the Congress of the United States. There\nare therefore a number of similarities with Sinosure and the bank is considered\nto be an appropriate benchmark institution.\n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 The benchmark premium has\nbeen calculated by reference to the actual fees charged for exports to OECD\ncountries for whole turnover policies with a 90 % coverage of the amount\ninsured and a duration of 120 days. The actual premium is the median average\nfor the five different categories of foreign buyers depending on their solvency\nand risk of default. This represents the closest available benchmark to\ncalculate the premium that the producers of the product concerned would need to\npay on the market.\n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of benefit was\ncalculated using the information supplied by the GOC and relates to Sinosure amounts\ncovered by export credit insurance and the fees paid in the IP for such\ninsurance. The information supplied by the co-operating companies for Sinosure was\nnot used because it was clear that the GOC was more complete (for example not\nall companies reported their Sinosure policy in the questionnaire reply or\ndeclared it during the on spot verification).\n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the payment\nof part of the insurance premium by the local authorities, the benefit is\ncalculated as being the level of rebates and grants made to the sampled\ncompanies covering the IP period.\n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Guarantees and Insurances \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

It contained prima facie evidence that four among\nthe sampled exporters had received direct subsidies for the product concerned\nunder this programme. Further, it showed that one of the sampled exporters had\nbeen selected as the supplier of the product concerned with respect to 70% of\nthe total capacity installed by project operators (i.e. companies producing and\nselling electricity produced from PV systems) in 2011. The complaint also\ncontained information suggesting that Golden Sun funding was not allocated in a\ntransparent and competitive manner to project operators.\n(b)         \nNon-cooperation and use of facts\navailable\n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission requested\ninformation on the Golden Sun programme in the questionnaire, in the deficiency\nletter and during the on-spot verification visit to the GOC which the GOC\nfailed to provide, as specified in more details in recitals (104) and (105)\nabove. \n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfor the information requested in the questionnaire and in the deficiency\nletter, the GOC has persistently maintained that this grant programme is not\nintended for the producers of the product concerned. As a consequence, the GOC\nhas failed to provide replies to a number of questions concerning the programme\nand the benefits for the producers of the product concerned by answering 'not\napplicable'. The GOC also failed to submit all the relevant laws, regulations,\nadministrative guidelines and other acts as requested in the questionnaire,\nlimiting itself to the submission of the main legal basis only.\n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 At the beginning of the\nverification session on the Golden Sun programme, the Commission asked the GOC\nto submit all the annexes to the main legal basis already submitted and whether\nit intended to submit additional official documents concerning the programme.\nThe GOC submitted the requested annexes but replied that it did not intend to\nsubmit any additional document. The Commission then showed to the GOC a budget\ndocument concerning the actual projects financed and corresponding amounts\nawarded under this programme issued by the Ministry of Finance (\u201cMOF\u201d) that had\nbeen submitted by cooperating exporters (MOF Document No. 965 [2010] of 2\nDecember 2010). The appendices to this document show that one of the sampled\nexporters received substantial Golden Sun funding for its own projects and also\nas supplier of the eligible equipment for several projects funded by the Golden\nSun programme. The representatives of MOF present at verification were aware of\nthe document shown, and the Commission requested them to submit all similar\nbudget documents issued by the MOF for the years of implementation of the\nGolden Sun programme. While the MOF representatives agreed in principle to\nsubmit these documents, they never submitted them to the Commission.\n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also showed\nMOFCOM the budget documents concerning the Golden Sun Programme, issued by the\nlocal Department of Finance of a province and a municipality, submitted by one\nof the cooperating exporters, and asked the GOC to submit the relevant similar\ndocuments (i.e. issued by provinces or municipalities) concerning the\nprogramme. The GOC replied that it did not have these documents since they\nconcerned provinces and/or municipalities and thus it could not submit them.\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 In its letter of 3 June\n2013, the GOC restated its position that the Golden Sun programme is not intended\nfor the producers of the product concerned and clarified that while these\nproducers may have benefitted from this programme, they did so as project\noperators of power plants and not as producers of solar panels, since only projects\noperators can receive subsidies under this programme. This letter also claims\nthat the Commission only asked for three specifically named documents that were\nsubmitted by the GOC. This is incorrect as the Commission asked at verification\nfor specific budget documents issued by MOF (also expressly mentioned in the\nCommission letter of 23 May 2013) and by local departments where the exporting\nproducers were located (referring to specific documents submitted by the\nexporting producers), which the GOC decided not to provide.\n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission also\nrequested specific information on Golden Sun disbursements received by one\nsampled cooperating exporter where this exporter had supplied the product\nconcerned and received directly the proceeds from the government. The GOC again\nwas not in a position to explain the situation and provide any details during\nthe verification visit and simply contacted the legal counsel of the company, who\nhad purportedly explained that the situation had been clarified with the\nCommission officials during the verification visit, which was not entirely the\ncase. Additional details on the situation are explained below in recitals (276)-(278).\nAs further specified in recitals (275)-(278) below, the investigation has established that the sampled\ncooperating producers have indeed benefited from grants under the Golden Sun\nprogramme including specifically for the supply of the product concerned. The\nGOC position that this programme does not benefit the production of the product\nconcerned has been indisputably contradicted by the evidence and facts verified\nin the investigation.\n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 Given\nthis lack of cooperation by the GOC, the Commission was unable to verify\nseveral crucial aspects of the Golden Sun programme and of the actual benefits\nconferred to the producers of the product concerned. This was in addition to\nthe failure by the GOC to submit all the relevant documents requested, notably\nthe budgetary documents on the Golden Sun appropriations issued by the MOF for\nthe years of implementation of the programme. Therefore, certain findings of\nthe investigation are based on the best facts available on record in accordance\nwith Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\n(c)         \nLegal Basis\n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 The main legal basis is the\nNotice concerning the Implementation of the Golden Sun Demonstration Programme\nof 16 July 2009 and the annexed Golden Sun Demonstration programme Interim\nMeasures for Financial Assistance Fund Management, File CaiJian No. 397 [2009]\nissued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science, and the National Energy\nBoard; Circular regarding the Successful implementation to Assignments to The\nGolden Sun Demonstration Programme, File No. 718 [2009]; Circular regarding the\nSuccessful Fulfilment of the Golden Sun Demonstration Programme 2010, File No.\n622 [2010]; Circular on Instructions on Finance Subsidy Budget Indexes for\nConstruction Costs to The Golden Sun Demonstration Programmes 2010, File No.\n965 [2010] of 2 December 2010 issued by of the Ministry of Finance; Circular\nwith respect to Distribution of the Budgetary Target for the Fiscal Subsidy\nAppropriated for The Golden Sun Programmes 2011, JCJ File No. 336 of 1\nSeptember 2011 issued by the Hebei Department of Finance; the Circular with\nrespect to Distribution of the Budgetary Target for the Fiscal Subsidy Appropriated\nfor The Golden Sun Programmes 2011, HCJ File No. 135 of 8 November 2011 issued\nby the Hengshui Municipal Finance Bureau.\n(d)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 The Golden Sun programme was\nestablished in 2009 for promoting the technological progress and scaled\ndevelopment of the distributed solar PV system industry. The authorities\nresponsible for the programme at central level are the Ministry of Finance, the\nMinistry of Science and the National Energy Board. The Notice on Implementation\nof the Golden Sun Programme lists a number of criteria to be eligible for funds\nunder this programme, including: a) that enterprises be included in the local\nGolden Sun demonstration project implementation plan; b) have an installed\ncapacity of not less than 300 kWh; c) have a construction period of no more\nthan one year and an operation period of no less than twenty years; d) owners\nof the PV projects must have total assets of at least RMB 100 million and\ncapital of at least 30 % of the investment costs; e) the producers of\nintegrated system and key equipment used for the PV generation projects should\nbe selected via bidding procedures. Eligible projects can receive up to 50\npercent of the total investment costs from the government, whereas this ceiling\nis increased to 70 percent for project owners located in remote areas without\nan established electrical grid.\n(272)\u00a0\u00a0 As for the procedure,\nenterprises willing to receive funding under the programme must submit their\napplications and supporting documents to the relevant government authority. The\nfinance, technology and energy departments at the provincial level responsible\nfor the organisation of the programme submit a joint summary report to the\nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Science and the National Energy Board which\nare responsible for reviewing the provincial projects with regards to, the\ntechnical programs, the building conditions, the financing and all other\naspects. Following final approval by the government, the Ministry of Finance\nallocates the funds directly to the project owner and will keep the relevant\napproval and disbursement documents.\n(273)\u00a0\u00a0 In\npractice, project operators submit funding applications to the government after\nentering into a contract with supplier(s) of the eligible PV equipment (i.e.\nnamely the product concerned). According to the relevant legislation those\nsuppliers of the eligible PV equipment are selected via bidding procedures.\nHowever, the GOC has not clarified how it exercises its discretion in selecting\nproject operators for the local Golden Sun demonstration project implementation\nplans, and how these project operators select in turn the supplier of the\neligible PV equipment. The GOC and interested parties have not shown that the\nselection process is open, transparent and non-discriminatory, as they have\nfailed to provide the relevant documentation. There is no indication that any\nforeign PV equipment has been purchased. A substantial part of the eligible PV\nequipment has been provided by one single sampled cooperating producer. On the\nbasis of facts available, the Institutions conclude therefore that the Golden\nSun Programme has been used as a means to create artificial demand for the\nproducts of selected Chinese producers of the product concerned. . If the\ngovernment considers the project eligible it is supposed to grant the funds. \n(274)\u00a0\u00a0 The Golden Sun programme\nconfers a subsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) and Article 3(2) of\nthe basic Regulation in the form of a transfer of funds from the GOC in the\nform of grants to the producers of the product concerned.\n(275)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nparticular, the investigation has established that several sampled cooperating\nproducers have directly received grants under the Golden Sun programme for the\ninstallations of solar-generated power equipment at their premises. These\ngrants paid out to the sampled cooperating producers offset part of the costs\nthat otherwise they would incur are therefore directly linked to the product\nconcerned..\n(276)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\nthe investigation has established that sampled cooperating producers have also\nbenefited from funding under this programme for the purpose of supplying the\nproduct concerned to unrelated project operators. In particular, during the\non-the-spot investigation it was found that one sampled cooperating exporting exporter\nhad received directly from the GOC a substantial lump-sum payment for all of\nthe 40 projects funded under the Golden Sun programme for which it had supplied\nthe product concerned. Such an amount had not been reported by the sampled\ncooperating exporting producer in its questionnaire response. The 2010 Circular\nfrom the Ministry of Finance showed that this cooperating exporter was chosen\nto supply the product concerned to several unrelated project operators\nbelonging to both the private and the public sector. The Commission tried to\nseek information from the GOC with regard to this direct payment to the sampled\ncooperating exporter, as Article 13 of the Interim Measures on the Golden Sun\nprogramme in the 2009 Notice specifically requires that the grants be paid\ndirectly to the project operator (i.e. not to the supplier of the PV equipment)\nand the GOC explicitly confirmed this element at verification. As explained\nabove, the GOC was unable to provide any explanation during the verification\nvisit as to why a sampled exporter had received direct funding. In its letter\nof 3 June 2013, the GOC limits its comments to one of the 40 project only,\nsimply stating that there had been a financial arrangement between the project\noperator and the sampled cooperating exporting producer because the operator\ndid not have sufficient money to pay the sampled exporting producer and\ntherefore they agreed that the subsidy would be paid directly to the sampled\ncooperating exporting producer. As this unsubstantiated and very concise\nexplanation concerned only one project involving the sampled cooperating\nexporter out of the 40 projects listed in the MOF document is completely\ninsufficient for the Commission to clarify the situation.\n(277)\u00a0\u00a0 The sampled cooperating\nexporter sought to justify in its letter of 24 June 2013 that the direct payment\nfor 40 projects concerned was not reported as it constituted a \u2018user\u2019 subsidy\nfor the project operator and not for the supplier. This exporter did confirm\nthat it had received the direct lump-sum payment linked to the supplies in the\n40 projects listed in the MOF circular, adding that it is possible for the\ngovernment to transfer funds directly to the supplier and that the reason for\nthis is to ensure that these grants are used only for the authorised PV systems\nand to facilitate control. However, the exporter focused its reply on one\nproject for which documents have been collected on spot and ignored all the\nother 39 projects for which it directly received Golden Sun funding. Although\nthe exporter proved that the funds for this particular project had been booked\nas an account receivable and not as a prepayment of government grant, no other\nevidence has been submitted on the actual completion of this or any of the\nother projects, including on the actual supply of the product concerned for\nwhich funds had been received. Its explanation also did not shed light on the\ninconsistency of the government direct payments with the relevant implementing\nrules cited above, which provide that proceeds are normally transferred by the\nGOC to the project operator and not to the equipment supplier.\n(278)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission considers the GOC explanation concerning the financial arrangement\nbetween the sampled cooperating exporter and the project operator to be unconvincing,\nbecause it seems odd that two private parties may decide autonomously to enter\ninto an arrangement involving the action of a government (i.e. a direct payment\nfrom the government to the supplier in derogation to Article 13 of the 2009\nNotice) without the government also having been involved or perhaps even being\naware of it. The GOC has failed to provide more substantial evidence and\ncomments on this aspect of direct payments to suppliers and has decided to\nlimit its reply to only 1 unnamed project out of the 40 projects carried out by\nthe sampled cooperating exporters. The explanations provided by this exporter\nare also silent on this comment by the GOC on the difficult financial situation\nof the operator concerning a project that the GOC has not specified.\nFurthermore, the statements by the exporter concerning the possibility for a\ndirect payment and the underlying rationale do not find any confirmation from\nother sources and from the GOC.\n(279)\u00a0\u00a0 In light of the above limited\nand contradictory comments submitted by the GOC and by the sampled cooperating\nexporter, the only point in common and the conclusion that can be drawn is that\nthe direct payment of the lump-sum from the GOC to the sampled cooperating\nexporter was necessary to make sure that this exporter would receive the\nproceeds because there would be a risk of non-payment linked to the financial\ndifficulty of the project operator. The fact remains that the sampled\ncooperating exporter was not able to explain how it had used the lump-sum payment\nfrom the government, whether the PV equipment was finally provided to the\nproject operators and what price, if any, had been paid by the project\noperators. Given the absence of other evidence available on file or otherwise\nreasonably available to the Commission, it is therefore concluded on the basis\nof Article 28 of the basic Regulation that the lump-sum payment to the\ncooperating exporter constitutes a direct grant within the meaning of Article\n3(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation..\n(280)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission further\nconcludes that the grants provided to the suppliers of the product concerned,\neither as project operators or when allegedly supplying PV equipment to\nunrelated project operators, confer a benefit to them in accordance with Article\n3(2) of the basic Regulation. As project operators, the funding under the\nGolden Sun programme allows producers of the product concerned to save\ninstallation costs of solar-generated power equipment at their premises. As\nsuppliers of PV equipment to unrelated project operators, the funding under the\nGolden Sun programme is directly kept by the producers of the product concerned\nwithout the need to effectively provide the equipment and/or shields them from\nthe risk of non-payment of unrelated project operators. In the latter case,\nproducers of the product concerned obtain a payment that otherwise they would\nnot have obtained from the unrelated project operator.\n(281)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nsubsidy scheme is also specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the\nbasic Regulation given that the legislation itself, pursuant to which the\ngranting authority operates, limits access to this scheme only to the specific project\noperators meeting the several criteria listed in the legislation and more\nbroadly only to project operators involved in the solar power sector.\nFurthermore, as neither the selection of the supplier of PV equipment nor the\nselection of the project operators are based on an open, transparent and\nnon-discriminatory competitive process and that direct payments from the GOC to\nthe suppliers of PV equipment take place, the scheme is also specific because\nonly certain suppliers of PV equipment can de facto benefit from it.

Among the benefits for so-called\nForeign Invested Enterprises (\u201cFIEs\u201d) there is a subsidy programme referred to\nas \u2018Two Free / Three Half\u201d, which provides for a complete direct tax exemption\nfor the first two years of profitability of FIEs and for half of the applicable\nincome tax rate for the following three years. \n(285)\u00a0\u00a0 The two free/three half\nprogramme also exists in a different variant for companies recognised as New\nand High Technology Enterprises and that are located in certain designated\nareas. The benefits under this variant of the programme can also apply beyond\nthe year 2013. The investigation found that one of the cooperating exporters\n[Yingli Hainan] enjoy benefits under this programme starting in 2011 with full\ntax exemption for the years 2011 and 2012 and 50 % reduction of the tax rate in\nthe following three years.\n(286)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission sought to verify this programme during the verification visit with\nthe GOC. However, the GOC failed to provide information on this different\nvariant of the two free/three half programme. In its letter of 3 June 2013, the\nGOC argued that this programme was not alleged in the complaint and is not a\nreplacement programme of the variant of the two free three half programme for\nFIEs alleged in the complaint, which applies without geographic limitations.\nThe Commission takes note of these explanations given by the GOC and\nunderstands that this tax programme is formally a separate programme than the\ntwo free three half programme for FIEs. However, given that its benefits continue\nafter the alleged expiry of the FIE scheme, the mechanics, the nature and the\neffects of its benefits are the same as the ones under the programme for FIEs\nand that it has been reported by one of the sampled cooperating exporters, it\nconsiders that it has a close nexus with the two free/three half FIE programme,\nas a continuation of the same programme, and that it should be countervailed.\nIn this regard, the Commission notes that Article 10(1) of the basic Regulation\npermits investigation of any \u201calleged subsidy\u201d identified by the complainant\nand does not refer to any \u201calleged subsidy programme\u201d. Since in this case both\nprogrammes involve the same subsidy i.e. corporate tax revenue foregone, the\nCommission is entitled to investigate them as a single subsidy.\n(b)         \nLegal basis\n(287)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of this\nprogramme is Article 8 of the FIE Tax Law and Article 72 of the Implementation\nRules of the Income tax Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China of\nForeign-Invested Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises. According to the GOC,\nthis programme has been terminated with the adoption on 16 March 2007 of the\nEnterprise Income Tax Law (\u201cEIT Law\u201d) of 2008 at the 5th Session of the 10th\nNational People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, namely Article 57\nof the EIT Law, with a phase-out of its benefits until the end of the year\n2012. \n(288)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal basis of the\nspecial two free three half program is Decree No. 40 [2007] i.e. Notice of the State Council on the Implementation of Transitional\nPreferential Policies on Income Tax for High-tech Enterprise Set up in Special\nEconomic Zone and Shanghai Pudong New District, based on Article 57 (3) of the\nPRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, along with the\nAdministrative Measures for the determination of High and New Technology Enterprises.\n(c)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(289)\u00a0\u00a0 Only productive enterprises\nwith foreign investment scheduled to operate for a period of not less than ten\nyears are exempted from income tax. The exemption starts from the year in which\nthe enterprise begins to make a profit for the first two years, followed by a\nreduction of fifty per cent of the applicable tax rates for the following three\nyears. \n(290)\u00a0\u00a0 For the special variant\nscheme, eligible enterprises must also have the recognised status of New and\nHigh Technology enterprises with the specific administrative certification,\nthat is enterprises with core intellectual property and that can also satisfy\nthe conditions set out in Article 93 of the Implementation Regulations of the\nPRC EIT Law.\n(291)\u00a0\u00a0 Any company that intends to\napply for this scheme has to file the Annual Corporation Income Tax Return Form\nand the Appendices and financial statements with the State Administration of\nTaxation. These practices also apply to the special variant scheme.\n(292)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that this\nprogramme has been progressively phased out since the entry into force of the\nEIT Law in 2008 and its benefits are available until the end of the year 2012.\nThe GOC has also stated that there is no replacement programme for FIEs and the\ntax treatment of FIEs is now the same as for other corporate taxpayers. The\nCommission notes that this tax programme has conferred benefits during the IP\nas several PV producers have benefited from it during the IP. Furthermore, it\ncannot be ruled out that benefits are still available under this programme or\nthat a similar replacement programme is available or will be enacted in the\nfuture. Indeed, as explained above, the investigation showed that there are\nalso other variants of the \u201ctwo free/three half\u201d programme which continue to\nbenefit solar panel manufacturers. Therefore, this programme is found to be\nstill countervailable. \n(293)\u00a0\u00a0 The special variant scheme\nwas used by one cooperating exporter, i.e. Yingli Green Energy.\n(d)         \nConclusion\n(294)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme constitutes a\nsubsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation in the form of foregone government revenue which confers a benefit\nupon the recipient companies.\n(295)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy scheme is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation given\nthat the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, limits\nthe access to this scheme only to certain enterprises that qualify as FIEs and\nthat comply with the specific criteria laid down in the relevant legislation.\n(296)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, this subsidy\nshould be considered countervailable. \n(297)\u00a0\u00a0 For the variant scheme it\nshould be considered a subsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and\nArticle 3(2) of the basic Regulation in the form of foregone government revenue\nwhich confers a benefit upon the recipient companies.\n(298)\u00a0\u00a0 This subsidy scheme is\nspecific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation given\nthat the legislation itself, pursuant to which the granting authority operates,\nlimited the access to this scheme only to certain enterprises and industries\nclassified as encouraged, such as the PV industry. The scheme is also specific\nunder Article 4(3) because eligibility is limited to certain regions.\n(299)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, this variant\nshould be considered countervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(300)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namount of countervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit\nconferred on the recipients which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit\nconferred on the recipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable\naccording to the normal tax rate, after the deduction of what was paid with the\nreduced preferential tax rate. The amounts countervailed are based on the\nfigures in the companies\u2019 tax return for the year 2011. As the audited tax\nreturn for the tax year 2012 was not available at any of the sampled\ncooperating exporters, the figures for the whole of the year taxable 2011 were\ntaken into account.\n(301)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n7(2) of the basic Regulation this subsidy amount (numerator) has been allocated\nover the total sales turnover of the cooperating exporting producers during the\nIP, because the subsidy is not contingent upon export performance and was not\ngranted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or\ntransported.\n(302)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two free/three half programme \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

However, several sampled cooperating\nexporters reported that they have benefitted from a similar programme under the\n2008 EIT law, showing that the preferential R&D cost offset programme for\nFIEs has been replaced by a specific programme in 2008. The GOC has not\nprovided further information on the 150 % tax offset in its questionnaire reply\nor in the reply to the deficiency letter.\n(b)         \nLegal basis\n(308)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme is provided by\nArticle 30(1) of the EIT Law and from Article 95 of the Regulations\non the Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (\u201cEIT\nImplementing Regulations\u201d), and Administrative Measures for the\nDetermination of High and New Technology Enterprises (Guo Ke Fa Huo [2008]\nNo. 172), and Article 93 of the EIT Implementing Regulation, along with\nthe Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the issues concerning Enterprises\nIncome Tax Payment of High and New Technology Enterprises (Guo Shui Han\n[2008] No. 985).\n(309)\u00a0\u00a0 Article 95 states that an\nadditional 50 % deduction of R&D expenditures mentioned in Item 1 of Article\n30 shall be granted for such expenditures for high and new technology products\nso that they are subject to an amortization based on 150 % of the intangible\nassets costs.\n(c)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(310)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nnoted above the GOC did not provide any relevant information for this scheme in\nthe replies to the questionnaire and deficiency letter. This scheme was already\ncountervailed in the Coated Fine Paper investigation[78] and in the Organic Coated Steel investigation[79]. The relevant legal provisions indeed show that this scheme\nprovides a benefit limited to companies which are formally recognised as High\nand New Technology Enterprises. These companies also have to incur R&D\nexpenses for the purpose of developing new technologies, new products and new\ncrafts. Eligible enterprises can offset an additional 50 % of their R&D\nexpenses against their income tax liability. Also expenses from intangible\nR&D assets entitle eligible companies to a 150 % deduction of the actual\ncosts borne by these companies.\n(311)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation\nestablished that companies benefiting from this scheme shall file their Income\nTax Return and relevant Annexes. The actual amount of the benefit is included\nin both the tax return and Annex V. Only companies that have obtained the\nformal certificate recognising them as High and New Technology enterprises are entitled to this scheme.\n(d)         \nConclusion\n(312)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme constitutes a\nsubsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation in the form of revenue foregone by the government which confers a\nbenefit upon the recipient companies.\n(313)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nsubsidy is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic\nRegulation as the legislation itself limits the application of this scheme only\nto certain enterprises formally recognised as High and New Technology\nenterprises and that incur R&D expenses to develop new technologies, new\nproducts and new crafts.\n(314)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly,\nthis subsidy should be considered countervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(315)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable according to the\nnormal tax rate, after the subtraction of what was paid with the additional 50 %\ndeduction of the actual expenses on R&D for the approved projects. The\namounts countervailed are based on the figures in the companies\u2019 tax return for\nthe year 2011.

This\nprogramme has been found countervailable by the EU in the Coated Fine Paper\ninvestigation and in the Organic Coated Steel investigation ; it has\nalso been found countervailable by the US authorities.\n(b)         \nLegal basis\n(321)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nlegal basis of this programme are Article 28 (2) of the EIT Law along\nwith the Administrative Measures for the Determination of High and New\nTechnology Enterprises (Guo Ke Fa Huo [2008] No. 172), and Article 93 of\nthe EIT Implementing Regulation, along with the Notice of the State\nAdministration of Taxation on the issues concerning Enterprises Income Tax\nPayment of High and New Technology Enterprises (Guo Shui Han [2008] No.\n985).\n(c)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(322)\u00a0\u00a0 This scheme applies to\nrecognised High and New Technology Enterprises that need key support from the\nState. These enterprises shall have core independent intellectual property\nrights and must meet a number of requirements: (i) their producers are included\nin the scope of the products in the High-Tech Fields with Key State Support;\n(ii) the total expenses for R&D shall account for certain proportion of\ntotal sales income; (iii) income from high and new technology products shall\naccount for certain proportion of the total sales income; (iv) the personnel\nengaged in R&D shall account for a certain proportion of the total staff;\n(v) the other requirements set by the 2008 Administrative Measures for High and\nNew Tech Enterprises are met.\n(323)\u00a0\u00a0 Companies benefiting from\nthis scheme must file their Income Tax Return and relevant Annexes. The actual\namount of the benefit is included in both the tax return and Annex V. \n(d)         \nConclusion\n(324)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the scheme\nshould be considered a subsidy within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and\nArticle 3(2) of the basic Regulation because there is a financial contribution in\nthe form of foregone government revenue which confers a benefit upon the\nrecipient companies. The benefit for the recipient is equal to the tax saving\nenjoyed through this programme according to Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(325)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nsubsidy is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic\nRegulation since it is limited to the enterprises receiving the certification\nof High and New Tech Enterprises and complying with all the requirements of the\n2008 administrative measures. Furthermore, there are no objective criteria\nestablished by the legislation or the granting authority on the eligibility of\nthe scheme and this is not automatic pursuant to Article 4(2)(b) of the basic\nRegulation.\n(326)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, this subsidy\nshould be considered countervailable.\n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(327)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is considered to be the amount of total tax payable according to the\nnormal tax rate, after the deduction of what was paid with the reduced\npreferential tax rate. The amounts countervailed are based on the figures in\nthe companies\u2019 tax return for the year 2011. As the audited tax return for the\ntax year 2012 was not available at any of the sampled cooperating exporters,\nthe figures for the whole of the year taxable 2011 were taken into account.\n(328)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tax reduction for high and new-technology enterprises involved in designated projects \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

However the investigation\nhad shown that several sampled exporting producers benefited from this scheme\nduring the investigation period. The sampled exporters concerned submitted\ndetailed information concerning this scheme, including the amount of benefit\nreceived. Taking this into account it was concluded that the GOC did not\nprovide accurate information concerning this programme and as the situation of\nsome exporting producers shows this programme still continues. \n(339)\u00a0\u00a0 Since none of the requested\ninformation was provided by the GOC, the Commission relied on the information submitted\nby the sampled exporting producers.\n(340)\u00a0\u00a0 This programme is considered\nto provide a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) as FIEs are relieved from payment of\nVAT which would be otherwise due if they were not exempted. It therefore\nconfers a benefit on the recipient companies in the sense of Article 3(2) of\nthe basic Regulation. The programme is specific within the meaning of Article\n4(2)(a) of the basic Regulation since the legislation pursuant to which the\ngranting authority operates limits its access to foreign invested enterprises\nthat purchase domestically-manufactured equipment and fall under the encouraged\ncategory and the restricted B Category of the Catalogue of Foreign-funded\nIndustries and equipment purchased in the domestic market listed in the Catalogue\nof key industries, products and technologies the development of which is\nencouraged by the State. Further, the Trial Measures for Administration\nof Tax Rebate from the Purchase of Chinese-made Equipment for Foreign-invested\nProjects and the Notice of the Ministry of Finance limit the benefit to the\nFIEs that belong to the encouraged category in the Guiding Catalogue of\nforeign invested industries or the Catalogue of advantageous\nforeign-invested industries in the Central and Western regions in China. In\naddition, there are no objective criteria to limit eligibility for this\nprogramme and no conclusive evidence to conclude that eligibility is automatic\nunder Article 4(2)(b) of the basic Regulation. The programme is also specific\nunder Article 4(4)(b) of the basic Regulation because it is contingent upon the\nuse of domestic over imported goods.\n(d)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(341)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP.

It was found that one of the\nsampled groups of exporting producers, i.e. LDK Solar, received regularly\nsignificant electricity fee subsidies from the Financial Bureau of Xin Yu\nEconomic Zone. Although in this case the company did not benefit directly from\nthe lower electricity rate than otherwise available on the market, the\nsignificant rebates provided by the Financial Bureau of Xin Yu Economic Zone\neventually resulted in a situation where the company received benefits from the\nprovision of cheap electricity and are thus functionally equivalent to\ngovernment provision at below-market prices. In any event, even if the rebate\nis considered as a grant, the measure is closely connected to the complainant\u2019s\nallegation and falls within the scope of the investigation. In fact, the company\nconcerned in the LDK Group received a near total refund of its electricity fees\ndue in the IP.\n(349)\u00a0\u00a0 LDK Solar group received,\nthrough its related polysilicon producer, a financial contribution in the sense\nof Article 3(1)(a)(iii) of the basic Regulation in that that local government\nprovided electricity fee subsidies, or in the sense of Article 3(1)(a)(i). This\nconstitutes a government financial contribution in the form of provision of\ngoods other than general infrastructure within the meaning of the basic\nregulation. Alternatively, it is a direct transfer of funds.\n(350)\u00a0\u00a0 LDK Solar received a benefit\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation to the extent that\nthe government has provided electricity for less than adequate remuneration. It\nhas been established that this exporter was, because of the electricity fee\nsubsidies, effectively subject to a rate lower than the rate generally\navailable. The direct transfer of funds confers a benefit because it is a\nnon-repayable grant not available on the market.\n(351)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy in form of\nprovision of the cheap electricity by means of a rebate to one of the sampled\nproducers is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a) of the basic\nRegulation as the electricity fees subsidies have only been paid to LDK. The\nsubsidy is also regionally specific to certain enterprises within the Xin YU\nEconomic zone. The non-cooperation of LDK and the GOC in reporting this subsidy\nhas led to the above findings being made on the basis of facts available. \n(c)         \nCalculation of subsidy amount\n(352)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy amount was equal\nto the amount of the rebate covering the IP period.\n(353)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electricity at LTAR \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

The GOC\nalso stated that industrial and commercial land should be obtained by\ncompensation for the use in open market by bidding, auction and competition and\n\u201cregardless of the number of bids or the initial price, the price finally\npaid is representative of the market price which is determined by free market\nsupply and demand\u201d. The GOC also claimed that the LUR transfer shall not\ninclude restrictions in the announcement of transfer through tendering, auction\nand quotation that affect fair competition.\n(356)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC did not provide any data with respect to the actual land-use rights prices\nand initial land prices formulated by the government. The information provided\nby the GOC in respect of LUR transactions as requested in the questionnaire was\nincomplete. When correcting its initial reply to the questionnaire during the\nverification visit, it also confirmed that some of the reported transactions\nwere subject to bidding procedure. However, no details on the number of bids\nand the difference between initial and final price, as requested in the\nquestionnaire, was provided.\n(357)\u00a0\u00a0 During the verification the\nCommission requested from the GOC evidence to support its claims concerning the\ntransfers of LUR in China is assigned through bidding, quotation or auction. It\nis noted that according to Article 11 of Provisions on Assignment of the\nState-owned Construction Land Use Right through Bid Invitation, Auction and\nQuotation the responsible state authority issues public notice whenever the\nbidding/auction/quotation process takes place. On this basis, the Commission\nrequested all public notices for the transactions which were subject to these\nprocedures in order to collect and verify information requested in the\nquestionnaire. The GOC did not provide any of these notices as it claimed that\n\u201cthey do not exist anymore\u201d. As a result the Commission was unable to\nverify the information concerning the LUR transactions of sampled exporting\nproducers.\n(358)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed the\nGOC of its consideration to apply provisions of Article 28 of Regulation (EC)\nNo 597/2009 in respect to this subsidy scheme and since the GOC in its reply to\nCommission letter of 23 May 2013 did not provide a satisfactory explanation or\nany new evidence concerning this issue, the Commission had to base its findings\non the best facts available, i.e. in this case on the information submitted by\nthe sampled exporting producers and other publicly available information.\n(359)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission also requested from the GOC, under the assumption that there is no\nmarket price for land in the PRC, its views on possible benchmarks. Although\nthis was only an assumption and by no means a finding or conclusion at the time\nwhen the questionnaire was sent to the GOC, the GOC expressed its view that\nthis assumption is false and did not provide any concrete information on\npossible benchmarks. The GOC only submitted that \u201cto\nthe extent that any benchmark should be used, it should be the prices that\nChinese industries which are not favoured would have to pay for similar land\u201d.\nSince the GOC did not disclose which industries are not \u201cfavoured\u201d and neither\ndid it provide any information on prices which these industries are paying for\nindustrial land in China, the Commission was unable to assess whether they constitute\na suitable benchmark. In this respect it is noted that in its previous\ninvestigations concerning Coated Fine Paper and Organic Coated Steel\nthe Commission found that the provision of LUR to these industries also does\nnot respect market principles.\n(b)         \nLegal basis\n(360)\u00a0\u00a0 The land-use right provision\nin China falls under Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China.\n(c)         \nFindings of the investigation\n(361)\u00a0\u00a0 According to Article 2 of\nthe Land Administration Law, all land is government-owned since, according to\nthe Chinese constitution and relevant legal provisions, land belongs collectively\nto the People of China. No land can be sold but land-use rights may be assigned\naccording to the law. The State authorities can assign such rights through\npublic bidding, quotation or auction. \n(362)\u00a0\u00a0 The cooperating exporting\nproducers have reported information regarding the land they hold as well as\nmost of the relevant land-use rights contracts/certificates, but only very\nlimited information was provided by the GOC about pricing of land-use rights.\n(363)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned above the GOC\nclaimed that the land-use rights in China are assigned through bidding, auction\nand competition. This is also provided for in the Article 137 of the Real Right\nLaw of the People's Republic of China.\n(364)\u00a0\u00a0 However, it was found that this system as described by the\nGOC does not always work in the same way in practice. During the verification\nof sampled exporting producers, the Commission obtained some notices issued by\nrelevant authorities concerning LUR available for transfer. While one notice\nspecifically limits the potential buyers of the LUR to the photovoltaic\nindustry[80], another sets limits to the price initially set by the authorities\nand does not allow the market to determine the price.[81] The\nauctions themselves were not seen to provide a real competition because in many\nof the examples viewed during the on spot verifications of exporting producers\nonly one company made a bid (only the sampled PV producer) and therefore their\nopening bid (the value set by the local Land Bureau) formed the final price per\nsquare metre. \n(365)\u00a0\u00a0 The above evidence\ncontradicts the claims of the GOC that the prices paid for LUR in the PRC are\nrepresentative of the market price which is determined by free market supply\nand demand and that LUR transfer shall not include restrictions in the\nannouncement of transfer through tendering, auction and quotation that affect\nfair competition. It was also found that some sampled exporting producers\nreceived refunds from local authorities to compensate for the (already low)\nprices which they paid for the LURs.\n(366)\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the low\nprices, some of the sampled exporting producers received other funds related to\nthe purchase of LURs which effectively decreased the actual price paid for the\nLURs even more. \n(367)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfindings of the proceeding confirm that the situation concerning land provision\nand acquisition in the PRC is unclear and non-transparent and the prices are\noften arbitrarily set by the authorities. The authorities set the prices\naccording to the Urban Land Evaluation System which instructs them among other\ncriteria to consider also industrial policy when setting the price of\nindustrial land[82].\n(368)\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the independent\npublicly available information suggest that the land in the PRC is provided for\nbelow the normal market rates[83]\n(d)         \nConclusion\n(369)\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly,\nthe provision of land-use rights by the GOC should be considered a subsidy\nwithin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iii) and Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation in the form of provision of goods which confers a benefit upon the\nrecipient companies. As explained in recitals (364) to (367) above, there is no functioning market for\nland in the PRC and the use of an external benchmark (see recital (372) below) demonstrates\nthat the amount paid for land-use rights by the sampled exporters is well below\nthe normal market rate. In addition, the refunds from\nlocal authorities are direct transfers of funds which confer a benefit because\nthey are non-repayable grants not available on the market. The subsidy is\nspecific under Article 4 2(a) and 4 2(c) of the basic Regulation because the preferential\naccess to industrial land is limited only to companies belonging to certain\nindustries, in this case the photovoltaic industry, only certain transactions\nwere subject to a bidding process, prices are often being set by the\nauthorities and government practices in this area are unclear and\nnon-transparent. The situation concerning land in the PRC is also discussed in\nthe IMF Working Paper which confirms that the provision of LUR to Chinese\nindustries does not respect market conditions[84].\n(370)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, this subsidy\nis considered countervailable. \n(e)         \nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n(371)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nit was concluded that the situation in the PRC with respect to land-use rights\nis not market-driven, there appear to be no available private benchmarks at all\nin the PRC. Therefore, an adjustment of costs or prices in the PRC is not\npracticable. In these circumstances it is considered that there is no market in\nthe PRC and, in accordance with Article 6(d)(ii) of the basic Regulation, the\nuse of an external benchmark for measuring the amount of benefit is warranted.\nGiven that the GOC did not cooperate or failed to submit any proposal for an\nexternal benchmark the Commission had to resort to facts available in order to\nestablish an appropriate external benchmark. In this respect it is considered\nappropriate to use information from the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan as\nan appropriate benchmark. This information was also\nused in previous investigations concerning Coated Fine Paper and Organic\nCoated Steel.\n(372)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission considers that the land prices in Taiwan offer the best proxy to the\nareas in the PRC where the cooperating exporting producers are based. The\nmajority of the exporting producers are located in the developed high-GDP areas\nin provinces with a high population density.\n(373)\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of\ncountervailable subsidy is calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the\nrecipients, which is found to exist during the IP. The benefit conferred on the\nrecipients is calculated by taking into consideration the difference between\nthe amount actually paid by each company (reduced by the amount of local\ngovernment refunds) for land use rights and the amount that should have been\nnormally paid on the basis of the Taiwanese benchmark. \n(374)\u00a0\u00a0 In doing this calculation,\nthe Commission used the average land price per square meter established in\nTaiwan corrected for currency depreciation and GDP evolution as from the dates\nof the respective land use right contracts. The information concerning\nindustrial land prices was retrieved from the website of the Industrial Bureau\nof the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan. The currency depreciation and\nGDP evolution for Taiwan were calculated on the basis of inflation rates and\nevolution of GDP per capita at current prices in USD for Taiwan as published by\nthe IMF in its 2011 World Economic Outlook. In accordance with Article 7(3) of\nthe basic Regulation this subsidy amount (numerator) has been allocated to the\nIP using the normal life time of the land use right for industrial use land,\ni.e. 50 years. This amount has then been allocated over the total sales\nturnover of the co-operating exporting producers during the IP, because the\nsubsidy is not contingent upon export performance and was not granted by\nreference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported. \n(375)\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy rate established\nwith regard to this scheme during the IP for the sampled exporting producers\namounts to:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Land Use Rights at LTAR \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company/Group || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidy Rate \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

In this respect it\nis noted that the Commission did not make the document public. But it is not\npossible for the Commission to control the actions of several hundred\ninterested parties which received the disclosure document. If some of the\nparties decided to make the disclosure document public or to express their opinion\non the document the Commission had no means to prevent them to do so.\n3.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of the GOC\nconcerning allegedly erroneous statements in the definitive disclosure document\n(377)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission has violated the \u201cample opportunity\u201d requirement of Article 12.1 of\nthe SCM Agreement. According to the GOC the extensive deadline extensions\ngranted by the Commission for the reply to the questionnaire (as detailed in\nrecital (104) above) were not sufficient for this purpose. The GOC further\nclaimed that what is the \"reasonable period\" under Article 12.7 of\nthe ASCM would also constitute \"ample opportunity\u201d under Article 12.1 of\nthe ASCM for all other questionnaire-type documents. The GOC also claimed that\nit could only reach out to the sampled exporting producers once the sample was\nfinalised and therefore the time granted for the response between the receipt\nof the questionnaire and sampling decision was meaningless. The GOC claimed\nthat the Commission\u2019s \u201cdesire\u201d to complete the investigation quickly seems to\ntrump the \u201cnon-negotiable requirement\u201d to accord an ample opportunity under\nArticle 12.1. The Commission does not agree with these claims as it did its\nutmost to grant the maximum possible time to the GOC to submit replies to the questionnaire\nand deficiency letter. The GOC was also advised that it would be possible to\nsubmit requested documents up to the date of the verification visit. The\nCommission did not preclude the GOC from submitting any information throughout\nthe proceeding and on a number of occasions reminded the GOC of the possibility\nto request hearings where the information and views of the GOC could be\npresented. It is noted that no information submitted by the GOC throughout the\nproceeding was rejected for the reason of timing. The claim of the GOC that the\ntime granted for the response between the receipt of the questionnaire and the sampling\ndecision was useless is not correct. A major part of the questionnaire\nconcerned the overall level of subsidisation of the industry/product concerned\nand the GOC was not in any way limited by the sampling decision to collect\ninformation of general nature. More importantly, following the selection of the\nsample the GOC had still 43 days to collect information specific to the sampled\nexporting producers. The Commission acted in accordance with Article 12.1 of\nthe SCM Agreement and granted to the GOC ample opportunity to present all\nevidence which it considered relevant, bearing in mind that such an obligation\ncannot be open-ended, in order to ensure timely completion of the investigation.\n(378)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also claimed that the Commission initially requested detailed information\nabout non-sampled exporting producers which was not \"necessary\ninformation\" for the purpose of the investigation that is based on\nsampling. In this respect it is noted that at the time when the questionnaire\nintended for the GOC was dispatched, the decision on whether there will or will\nnot be sampling applied in this proceeding was not final. After the Commission\nreceived sampling replies from the Chinese exporting producers and it was\napparent that the cooperation from exporters\u2019 side was high, and once it became\nclear that the sampled exporters would cooperate by replying adequately to\ntheir questionnaires, the Commission did not insist on provision of company\nspecific information on subsidisation from non-sampled exporting producers.\nTherefore the Commission does not agree with this.\n(379)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that in the\ndefinitive disclosure document the Commission erroneously stated that the GOC\nwithheld certain information in the questionnaire reply and subsequent\nsubmissions. This is not correct. As the Commission already stated, in its\nletter of 23 May 2013 to the GOC, the GOC had failed to provide the requested\ninformation in respect to the state-owned financial institutions, documents\nrelated to Sinosure and provision of export credit insurance, documents related\nto the Golden Sun Demonstration Programme, and information related to the provision\nof Land-Use Rights.\n(380)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the GOC the\nCommission had not applied facts available as a mechanism to complete the\nmissing information as prescribed by Panels and the WTO disputes[85] and instead \u201cit has applied adverse inferences in a punitive\nmanner and further violated the provisions of SCM Agreement\u201d. The GOC\nfurther claimed that the Commission did not use facts available \u201csolely for\nthe purpose of replacing information that may be missing but as the specific\nbasis for all its findings of subsidisation in complete disregard of the\nsignificant amount of information provided by the GOC and financial\ninstitutions involved most often on ground of the alleged failure to provide\nperfect answers or to prove every figure\u201d. This is not what the Commission\ndid. All information including plans and legislation submitted by the GOC was\nconsidered and analysed and the findings are based on these documents as\nprovided by the GOC, wherever those documents were made available and\nverification confirmed their accurateness. The frequent citations from these\ndocuments supporting the findings are an example of how the Commission treated\nthe information submitted by the GOC. In recital (110) above the Commission\nclearly explains the only situations when the information submitted was not\ntaken at its face value.\n(381)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC further claimed that\nthe Commission contradicted itself when in the definitive disclosure document\nit claimed that in this investigation it did request transaction specific\ninformation only with regard to the sampled exporters and elsewhere in the same\ndocument it stated that \"the government questionnaire is not limited to\nthe sampled exporters.\" This is not true. The Commission did not make\ncontradictory statements. As already explained in the recital (378) above the\nCommission limited its initial request on the provision of the company specific\ninformation to the sampled exporting producers following the decision to apply\nsampling. However, in order to assess the countervailability of the alleged\nsubsidy schemes, the Commission requested also other information than\ninformation related to sampled exporting producers, such as information\nconcerning financial markets in China or market for land use rights. It is\ntherefore mentioned that \u201cthe government questionnaire is not limited to the\nsampled exporters\u201d.\n(382)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthe Commission seems to overlook that information cannot simply be rejected if\nit is not made available for verification. This is not how the Commission\ntreated information in this proceeding. On no occasion was the\n\u201cnon-availability of verification\u201d the sole reason for not accepting such\ninformation in full. However, when other information on the file was\ncontradicting it and at the same time the GOC was not able to support it with\nany sort of evidence, such information could not be accepted at its face value.\n(383)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the GOC, the Commission\nin paragraph 85 of the definitive disclosure document (replicated above in\nrecital (117)) \u201cacknowledged\u201d that the GOC does not control banking and\nfinancial institutions and cannot compel them to provide information. It is\nnoted that the Commission is not aware of such statement and after reviewing\nthe text of the recital it does not seem to be the case. \n(384)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the Commission\nseemed to concur with the GOC that the national laws cannot be superseded in\nthe case of an investigation by the requirements of the EU's basic AD\nRegulation or the SCM Agreement. The link the GOC made to the non-provision of\nallegedly confidential information is missing the point. The Commission however\nargued (recital (117) above) that the provisions of municipal law or internal\nrules of the WTO Member cannot absolve it from its WTO obligations to cooperate\nwith the investigations and in case of conflict it is up to the GOC to suggest\nthe ways in which access can be afforded to information so that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it can be\nadequately verified. The GOC referred to the situation when one bank official\nprovided one credit risk assessment for a sampled company as an example of\nsuggesting a way to verify allegedly limited information and stated that \u201cthe\nCommission was still not satisfied\u201d. On the contrary, as is clear from the\nwording of recital (148) above), the Commission did not take an issue with the\nverification of this particular document and took this information fully into\naccount in its findings. However, this was an exceptional situation and\nunfortunately was not replicated for most of the information of similar nature\nrequested in this proceeding.\n(385)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, the GOC\ncontinued to claim that \u201csensitive internal documents\u201d of banks were envisaged\nto be relevant information under the SCM Agreement, and their non-production\ncould not lead to the application of facts available. The Commission finds this\nstatement much too sweeping and does not see how proper verification (carried\nout with due confidentiality procedures in place) could be undertaken in all\ncases if such documents (including those involving transactions with clients)\nare simply withheld. In the absence of verifications, facts available may have\nto be used to fill gaps in fact-gathering.\n(386)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC repeatedly claimed\nthat the pre-verification letter did not contain specific questions concerning\nverification and referred to the Commission letter of 23 May 2013 which used\nthis wording. The Commission, however, in paragraph 86 of the definitive\ndisclosure document (replicated as recital (118) above) stated that the\npre-verification letter of 25 March 2013 contained a very specific and detailed\nlist of issues and documents which would be addressed during the verification,\nfully in line with the Article 26(3) of the basic Regulation and the WTO\nrequirements. The absence of a list of specific questions, provision of which\nhas no basis in the basic Regulation or WTO rules, is not an excuse for the GOC\nbeing unable to fully cooperate during the verification.\n(387)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission showed a complete absence of flexibility during the verification.\nThis is a misinterpretation of facts and situation before and during the\nverification visit. As already explained in paragraphs 88 \u2013 90 of the\ndefinitive disclosure document (replicated as recitals (120) - (122) above) the\ndegree of flexibility shown by the Commission was full and unconditional.\nUnfortunately, attempts by the GOC to provide information which there was no\npossibility to verify within the schedule of the on-site visits meant that such\ninformation could not be cross-checked and given the weight of a verified\ndocument. The GOC also reminded the Commission of WTO case law from the EC-Salmon\npanel that whether documents are \u201cverifiable\u201d is not always determined only by\nthe possibility of on-the-spot investigations and claimed that the Commission\ncannot reject information simply because it is not available at verification\nvisits. The Commission notes that such information, not being susceptible to\non-spot verification to test is reliability and accuracy, may be given less\nweight that if it had been properly verified and that this sometimes happened\nin the present case.\n(388)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC contests the\nCommission\u2019s alleged practice not to accept new documents and evidence which\nrequire verification after the end of the verification session to which they\nbelong. As already explained in the paragraph 89 of the definitive disclosure\ndocument (replicated in recital (121) above) this is not and never was the\ncase. It is true that the Commission cannot normally accept documents as\nverification exhibits once the verification session is over and it is not\npractically possible to verify such documents, but nothing prevents the GOC from\nsubmitting such documents in writing which in fact happened in this case as\nwell.\n(389)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission did not explain the reason for requesting the six documents referred\nto in recital (122) above and on this basis their verification was not permitted.\nThis claim was already raised by the GOC in its letter of 3 June 2013 and the\nCommission fully replied to it in recital (122) above. It is noted once again\nthat all these documents concern the industry concerned and even relate to\nparticular subsidy schemes such as preferential lending or preferential tax\nschemes. Therefore it is obvious from their names and content that they were\nrelevant for the investigation.[86]\nHowever the GOC simply refused to answer any questions in this respect during\nthe verification, citing the alleged irrelevance of the document for the\nproceeding as the only reason.\n(390)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC\nclaimed that it could not provide the supporting evidence for the information\nit provided in the questionnaire reply concerning percentage of loans granted\nto the industry concerned as this information was held by the banks which are\nindependent entities and not GOC departments and that the Commission should\nverify the figures at the banks. GOC referred to the provisions of the\nCommercial Banking Law which stipulates that the banks shall carry out their\nbusiness in accordance with the law (Article 4) and there shall be no\ninterference by local governments or government departments at various levels,\npublic organisations or individuals in the business operation of the banks\n(Article 5). The fact is that the GOC made a statement in the questionnaire\nreply and it was not able to support it all. The banks which the Commission\nattempted to verify were also not able to support this information with any\ninformation whatsoever. If this is to be considered as acceptable practice, the\ninvestigated party could simply make any statement which supports its case and\nthe investigated authority would have to accept it without having a chance to\nverify whether it represents reality. This is even more important taking into\naccount that this particular information is in contradiction with other\ninformation on the file. There are also other articles in the Commercial\nBanking Law which oblige the banks to carry out their loan business upon the\nneeds of national economy and the social development and with the spirit of the\nstate industrial policies (Article 34). As correctly pointed out by the GOC in\nits comments, the banks shall carry out their business activities in accordance\nwith law, i.e. also with the said provisions of Article 34 of the Commercial\nBanking Law. Therefore, this supposed bright line between the government and\nthe banks was not borne out by the facts.\n(391)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that it\nprovided all the information in respect to the ownership of the banks that it\npossesses. It also claimed that the reported figures concerning bank ownership\nare the official figures of CBRC and therefore there was no reason to believe\nthat the information provided by the GOC is false or misleading and apply\nprovisions of Article 28 of the basic Regulation. Further the GOC stated that it\nwas not aware what the source for the Commission statement in paragraph 95\n(replicated in recital (127) above) of the definitive disclosure document was (\u201cThe\npublicly available information suggests that there are also other state-owned\nbanks which provided loans to the sampled exporting producers\u201d), i.e. in addition\nto those reported by the GOC as being state-owned in its reply to the\ndeficiency letter. These claims could not be accepted. It is noted that the GOC\ninitially claimed in its questionnaire reply that it does not possess any\ninformation concerning its ownership in the banks. Only after the Commission\npointed out in the deficiency letter that, according to the Chinese\nlegislation, the GOC must collect such information, did the GOC provide some\ninformation in this respect. During the verification the CBRC official refused\nto support the figures on bank ownership with any evidence, refused to provide\nthe source of the information and did not explain where it comes from. It is\nalso noted that the GOC did not contest the fact that at least 5 other banks named\nby the Commission in the definitive disclosure document (see footnote in\nrecital (127)) are state-owned.\n(392)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC disagreed with the\nstatement in the paragraph 97 of the definitive disclosure document (replicated\nin the recital (129) above) that CBRC refused to answer the question concerning\nthe 10 biggest banks in China because it was not submitted in writing and\nclaimed that the Commission misinterpreted the facts, because the main reason for\nnot replying was that since this question was not in the pre-verification\nletter they needed time to prepare for it. In fact it is the GOC which\nmisinterprets the facts concerning this issue. The Commission did not insist on\nimmediate answer, but the CBRC refused to even look at the question on the\npretext that it was not provided in advance in writing. If the reason was\ninsufficient time to prepare the answer the GOC could have submitted the reply\nlater during the verification or by email (although without possibility for the\nCommission to verify it) as it has done with several other documents. However the\nGOC did not do this.\n(393)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC claimed that it provided\nall the documents concerning the establishment and the mandate of the CBRC which\nthe Commission requested in the questionnaire, and that since the Commission\ndid not raise any issues with this in the deficiency letter and did not ask for\nthis documents in the \"list of documents to be provided before the start\nof verification visit\" in Annex 2 to the pre-verification letter the GOC did\nnot feel obliged to provide any other documents. This is not true. The\nCommission requested all documents which were basis for the establishment and\nthe mandate of the CBRC but the GOC provided only some of them. It was only on\nthe basis of the statement of the CBRC official that the Commission learned\nthat there are also other documents in this respect. In fact the reply of the\nGOC in the questionnaire in this respect was incomplete and misleading as the\nGOC (CBRC) clearly knew about the existence of such additional documents as was\nadmitted by the CBRC during on-the-spot verification.\n(394)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that during\nthe verification the Commission did not actually request the statistics and\nreports from the banks which provided loans to the sampled exporters for the IP.\nThey claimed that the Commission only requested the 2012 statistical report\nsubmitted to the CBRC by the Bank of China and for this the CBRC official had\nto check with the legal services involved due to the confidentiality\nobligations. This is not correct. During the verification the Commission\nrepeated its request from the questionnaire and deficiency letter for the\nstatistics from all banks which provided loans to sampled exporters to be\nprovided[87].\n(395)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC further claimed that\nthe reference of the complainant in the complaint to the Coated Fine Paper case\nin which the Commission found \u201con the basis of adverse inferences\u201d that the\nstate-owed commercial banks [\u201cSOCBs\u201d] were acting as public bodies is an\n\u201cunsubstantiated assertion lacking context with regard to the nature and\nexistence of a subsidy granted to the exporting producers of the product\nconcerned and cannot therefore be considered as a sufficient evidence\u201d of the\nexistence of financial contribution by a government or public body within the\nmeaning of Article 11.2 of the SCM Agreement. Firstly it must be pointed out\nthat the findings concerned in the Coated Fine Paper case were not based\non adverse inferences but on facts available in accordance with Article 28 of\nthe basic Regulation and there is no subsequent ruling which would confirm the\nclaim of the GOC that the Commission finding in this respect is based on the\n\u201cimproper use of facts available. On the contrary, the Commission made similar\nfindings in respect of the SOCBs in another anti-subsidy case concerning\nimports from China, Organic Coated Steel, and also other investigating\nauthorities have come to the conclusion that Chinese SOCB\u2019s are public bodies,\nnotably the United States, in a finding which was upheld by the WTO Appellate\nBody.[88]\n(396)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC continued to claim\nthat the Commission requested certain information from all banks established in\nChina and that it was not within the GOC\u2019s practical ability to provide such\ninformation for \u201cover 3800\u201d banks. The Commission disagrees with this claim and\nonce again refers to the deficiency letter where, following the GOC reply to\nthe questionnaire, it limited the scope of the information requested only to\nbanks where the GOC has direct or indirect shareholdership[89].\n(397)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC also claimed that the\nCommission statement that it took account of the summary of the PBOC circulars in\nquestion from the website submitted during the verification is incorrect and\nthat this is proved by paragraph 133 of the definitive disclosure documents\n(replicated in recital (164) above). This is not correct. The recital (164)\ndoes not contradict the content of the website extracts. It takes it into\naccount but also relies on the actual content of the Circular which was, in\nfact, never contested by the GOC to date as not being accurate.\n(398)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission \u201chas extracted certain terms and phrases out of context from various\ndocuments\u201d, misinterpreted others and tried to tie them together in order to establish\nthat the GOC promotes the industry producing product concerned or to establish\nthat the SOCBS are public bodies. It argues that a \u201ccomplete reading\u201d of these\ndocuments (plans, outlines and decisions) would demonstrate that the\nCommission\u2019s findings lack legal basis and are not based on evidence. This is\nnot correct. The Commission analysed and considered all the documents,\nincluding those referred to in recital (102) in their totality, in exactly the\nmanner which the GOC advocates. \n(399)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning\nthe Decision No 40, the GOC claimed that in the definitive disclosure document the\nCommission quoted from it out of contexts \u201cto distort its correct meaning\u201d.\nAccording to the GOC it is clear from other provisions of Decision No 40 that\nit is geared towards the development of the use of renewable energy sources\nrather than classifying solar modules and cells as target of any expected\ndevelopment policy as proposed by the Commission. It is not true that the\nCommission\u2019s reference to the text of Article V of the Decision No 40 was out\nof context. The Commission is not arguing whether one of the purposes was or\nwas not the development of the use of renewable energy sources. The fact is\nthat in the Decision No 40 the State Council identified new energy industry and\nsolar energy as prioritised industries and therefore they fell under the\nencouraged category of projects in the Guiding Catalogue of the Industrial\nRestructuring. Taking into account Articles 17, 18 and 19 of the Decision\nNo 40 the financial institutions may only grant loans to industries/companies belonging\nto this category. This is a clear indication that the PV industry producing, inter\nalia, solar modules and cells is prioritised.\n(400)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that there\nis no reference in the text of the State Council Decision of 10 October to the\nsolar modules and cells or to the PV industry and that if any fiscal support\nhas been encouraged it is with regard to the objectives pertaining to the use\nof alternative energy which have no bearing on the development of module and\ncell production in general. The Commission disagrees. It must be noted that\nthis Decision of State Council does not seem to aim exclusively on the\npromotion of the use of alternative energy sources. From its title (Decision of\nthe State Council on Accelerating the Incubation and Development of Strategic\nEmerging Industries) as well as from the content (inter alia Articles\n1(1),1(2),2(2)) it is clear that he aim is to support the development of\nselected industries (in this case strategic emerging industries). This is also\nconfirmed by the fact that the objectives set in this Decision pertain directly\nto the output and performance of the strategic emerging industries (Article\n2(3). Also, there is clear link in the Decision between strategic emerging\nindustries and the PV industry which produces, inter alia, solar modules\nand cells. Firstly there is no doubt that the PV industry is a segment of\nalternative energy industry which is referred to in Article 2 of the Decision\nas an industry the state should incubate and develop. Secondly the sampled\nexporting producers belong to the category of high-tech industries which are\nmentioned in Article 2(2) of the Decision. Similarly the 12th\nfive-year plan includes the solar power industry amongst the strategic\nindustries and also the 12th Five Year Plan for the Solar\nPhotovoltaic Industry confirms that the State Council Decision \u201chas listed\nsolar photovoltaic industry in important field of strategic emerging\nindustries, which our country will develop in the future\u201d.[90]\n(401)\u00a0\u00a0 According\nto the GOC, the Commission cited the Medium and Long-term Science and\nTechnology Plan but failed to refer to single instance or provision where this\ndocument defines high-technology enterprises as including module and cell\nproducing enterprises or the PV industry in general. According to the GOC the\nobjectives of the Outline are only focused towards developing of alternative\nenergy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The Commission disagrees. The\nmajority of the investigated sampled exporting producers have been awarded high\nand new-technology enterprise certificates and on this basis benefited from\nsubsidies the provision of which was limited to high and new-technology\nenterprises (e.g. tax exemptions). The same types of individual support\nprogrammes which are mentioned in this Plan were used by the sampled exporters.\n(402)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the statement of the Commission that the Law of the PRC on the\nScientific and Technological Progress lists a number of measures for the\nsupport of strategic industries including the solar PV industry is not based on\nany facts and that this law does not mention the PV industry or strategic\nindustries and there is no basis to claim that the product concerned is\nincluded in the scope of this law. This is not correct. The basis for this\nstatement are Articles 18 and 34 of this law. According to Article 18 the State\nshall encourage and give guidance to financial institutions on supporting the\ndevelopment of high and new technology industries. According to Article 34 the\nPolicy-oriented financial institutions shall offer special aid to enterprises\u2019\nprojects encouraged by the State. The PV industry fall within the category of\nhigh and new technology industries and the also fall within the category of\nenterprises whose projects are encouraged by the State. Moreover Article 17 of\nthe same law promises preferential tax policies to, amongst others, entities\nwhich are engaged in projects covered by national scientific and technological\nplans. From the Article (401) above it is clear that the projects of companies\nin the PV industry fall within this scope. In conclusion, there are at least\nthree clear indications that the PV industry and companies producing and\nexporting product concerned are included in the scope of this law.\n(403)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also claimed that the Commission has considered plans, decisions and laws\nof the PRC as having the same legal effect and value and this is contrary to\nthe principles of legal interpretation, the legislation law of China and the\nrepeated arguments made by the GOC. According to the GOC the reference to the\ngeneral 5 year plan and specific PV plan has no legal reference because no\npositive evidence that the plans are legally binding was provided. This is not\ncorrect since the claim of the GOC that the plans are not binding is not\nsupported by other evidence on the file. To the contrary, the text of the Plan\nas submitted by the GOC in the questionnaire reply clearly states: \u201cThis plan\nwas deliberated and approved by the National People\u2019s Congress, and it has the\neffect of law.\u201d[91] [emphasis added] The GOC in its comments to the definitive\ndisclosure stated: \u201cAccording to the Legislation Law of China, the\nConstitution, laws, administrative legislation, local regulations, and rules\nare the legislation in China.\u201c Since the plan has an effect of law and the\nGOC confirmed that laws are the legislation in China the Commission arrived to\nthe conclusion that the plan is indeed legally binding. According to the\nexplanation of the GOC during the verification visit the sectoral and regional\n5-year plans stem from the general plan 5 year plan, therefore the Commission\nhad no basis to treat the sectoral PV five year plan (2011-2015) differently\nthan the general 5 year Plan.\n(404)\u00a0\u00a0 GOC cites the \u201cguidelines\nissued by the Commission on reimbursement/refunds\u201d as an example of a similarly\nnon-binding document in the EU context. The Commission supposes that the GOC\nrefers to the \u201cCommission Notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping\nduties\u201d (O.J. C127 of 29.5.2002 p.10). In fact, it is not accurate to\ncharacterise these guidelines as non-binding because they bind the Commission\nto the extent that they do not violate superior rules.. The Commission has\ndetermined that China\u2019s plans are legally binding. However, even assuming\nhypothetically this was not the case, it is clear that the national, sectoral\nand regional plans, emanating as they do from the highest levels of government\nand setting out government policy with regard to economic and industrial\ndevelopment, would have a high probative value with regard to the de-facto\nmandatory nature of their stated objectives. It is equally clear that they\ncould be invoked by the government to reprimand entities that were not\nimplementing them correctly. Therefore, they would still be highly relevant to\ndeterminations relating to government intervention in the economy and to the\ndirection and control of certain industries.\n3.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of parties\nconcerning preferential policy loans, other financing, guarantees in insurance\n(405)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that its\nfailure to provide responses to Appendix A should not lead to the application\nof facts available in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation.\nAccording to the GOC, if the Commission really intended to verify the\nallegations in the complaint that the Chinese state-owned banks are public bodies\nit would not have needed to load the questionnaires with requests for internal,\nsensitive, transaction-specific data concerning banks many of which were not in\nany way owned by the government. In this regard the GOC referred to the\ninformation concerning individual loans provided by the bank to the sampled\nexporting producers. The Commission does not agree with this claim. The purpose\nof the information requested in Appendix A was to verify whether the Chinese\nbanks are public bodies and whether they are entrusted and directed by the\ngovernment. With the exception to the information on individual loans the GOC\ndid not specify which other requested information it considered not to be\nrelevant for that purpose.\n(406)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that the\nquestions in Appendix A sought information on the ownership of the banks, on\nthe composition of the board of directors and board of shareholders, minutes of\nshareholders/directors meetings, links of the senior management to the state\nauthorities, sectoral breakdown of the loans, lending policies and assessment\nof risk with respect to loans provided to the cooperating exporting producers. The\nGOC claimed that for the findings on public bodies such request was \u201cmanifestly\nunreasonable\u201d and the scope of requested information was too broad. GOC\nalso claimed that the \u201cthreshold\u201d determination whether the entity is or is not\na public body must be made before such information was even requested. The\nCommission does not agree. In the view of high standards set by the WTO AB in\nDS 379[92] all the requested information is necessary, including findings on\nthe extent of government involvement in the financial system. For instance,\nevidence that entities act in a non-commercial manner can be to show\nentrustment and direction, if combined with indications of government inference.\nIn any event, it should be noted that once co-operation from the sampled\nexporting producers was forthcoming, the Commission decided to limit the\nrequested information on loans to these firms and did not draw any inferences\nfrom the GOC\u2019s failure to provide other information on individual loans which\nwas originally requested. However, all other requests for information remained\nrelevant to the investigation. Concerning the claim of the GOC that it could not\nhave provided some of the information on the Appendix A it is noted that the\nGOC has refused to provide the Appendices A in their totality with the\nexception of several banks. Taking the above into account it was concluded that\nthe GOC failed to provide the remainder of requested information within the\nreasonable period. \n(407)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC, invoking the WTO US-Hot-Rolled\nSteel Appellate Body Report (Para.99)[93],\nargues that it did not have the practical ability to provide the Commission\u2019s\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d requests for information and that the Commission\u2019s failure to\naddress this issue, and to link the various requests to the factual\ndeterminations to which they related, meant that the Commission has not acted\nin good faith. Although the case cited relates to cooperation by exporters in\nan anti-dumping case, the Commission accepts that, in the case of government\nquestionnaires in CVD cases, there is a need to strike a balance between the\ninformation required and the practical ability of the respondent to comply.\nHowever, this balance must be struck in the context of all the facts.\nDeterminations with regard to the status of state-owned banks in China as\npublic bodies had already been made in the Coated Fine Paper and Organic\nCoated Steel cases and in this case the complainant provided sufficient prima\nfacie evidence to show that the state-owned banks remained public bodies.\nTherefore, the GOC should have expected a fact-intensive enquiry if it wished\nto rebut this allegation. Unfortunately, the GOC continued to make claims e.g.\nthat it had little or no information on the government ownership of banks (a\nhighly relevant factor in the public body determination), that suggested that\nit was not acting to the best of its ability and refusing access to necessary\ninformation. This is one of the \u201climited circumstances\u201d where Article 12.7 of\nthe SCM Agreement can be applied (according to the WTO Panel Report[94]. In addition, while the Commission was aware that its\nrequests for information were, of necessity, quite extensive, cooperation is a\ntwo-way process and the GOC\u2019s reaction was initially to simply demand\nexplanations of which factual determinations the requests were tied to\n(something that cannot be determined in advance) rather than to propose ways in\nwhich the requests for information could be addressed in a reasonable manner.\n(408)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the verification\nof the Bank of Shanghai the GOC claimed that the fact that the verification did\nnot take place is not a sufficient reason to apply facts available and that in\nany event it is Commission's own fault that the verification did not take place.\nIn reply the Commission notes that the factual situation in respect to the\norganisation of the verification visit of the Bank of Shanghai was described in\nparagraphs 111 and 112 of the definitive disclosure document (replicated in\nrecitals (143) and (144) above). There was no change in the factual situation\nconcerning this verification and the Commission does not agree with the GOC's\ninterpretation of these facts and maintains that it made its best efforts for\nthe verification to take place but this was not possible because of the\nobstructions in the side of the GOC. The GOC invokes the WTO Panel Report[95], which concluded that the absence of an on-spot visit does not\nexhaust all possibilities of verifying documents. However, in the present\ninvestigation, the GOC only informed the Commission of the bank\u2019s availability\nfor verification one working day before the verification of the GOC started (after\nthe already extended deadline for such a confirmation), thus closing off any\npossibility of an on-spot visit because arrangements had been made and could\nnot be changed. In these circumstances it is concluded that the GOC did not act\nto the best of its ability and the Commission does not see any way in which the\nchecks provided by an on-spot visit could have been replicated by any other\nmeans.\n(409)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission cannot disregard the information provided by the HuaXia Bank in regards\nof its ownership structure for the reason that it is not \u201cideal in all\naspects\u201d. The Commission notes that the reason for not accepting this\ninformation was not that it was not ideal in all aspects. As already explained\nin the recital (147) above, the HuaXia Bank did not disclose any information on\nthe government ownership until the verification visit even though this was\nrequested by the Commission already in the initial questionnaire. After the\nCommission pointed out that the HuaXia Bank has some state-owned shareholders\nthe bank submitted a sheet of paper with the information from unknown source\nand in addition this information was in discrepancy with other information on\nthe file. It was not possible to accept such information.\n(410)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the HuaXia Bank\u2019s decision to provide only some of the\ncreditworthiness assessments as described in recital (148) above the GOC\nclaimed that the Commission received a reasonable explanation of why the other\nassesments could not be provided. The Commission does not agree. Since it was\nclearly stated in the pre-verification letter that such documents will be\nsubject of the verification visit the explanation that the \u201ctwo risk assessment\nreports were dealt with by other branches of the Bank and the responsible\nemployees were unavailable at the moment\u201d was not satisfactory. In addition,\nthe GOC raises the argument, repeated elsewhere in its comments, that\ninformation could not be produced because of client confidentiality. The\nCommission notes that there are provisions for the treatment of confidential\ninformation in its countervailing duty investigations[96] and that, in any event, most of the Commission\u2019s requests, on this\nand other issues, were to inspect, rather than copy, such information. In any\nevent, the Commission notes that a strict application of the \u201cclient\nconfidentiality\u201d principle could make verification of much relevant information\nin CVD investigations impossible. In such situations, it would become\nimpossible to cross-check exporter\u2019s replies on many issues and to make random\ninspections of recipients of certain schemes in cases where there was no\ncooperation from exporters or where the investigation was conducted on an\naggregate basis.\n(411)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that EXIM Bank fully cooperated with the investigation and certain\ndocuments requested by the Commission could not be provided due to internal\npolicy rules, state secrecy, confidentiality or other laws. Therefore\nnon-provision of these documents cannot lead to the application of facts\navailable. In accordance to the Commercial Banking Law these documents could\nnot be provided by the EXIM Bank officials during the verification. In this\nrespect, and contrary to the Commission assumption, the basic Regulation and\nthe SCM Agreement cannot supersede the sovereign laws of the PRC. GOC also\nclaimed that the questions on political party affiliations of senior officials\nare irrelevant and disturbing for the GOC. The Commission disagrees. While WTO\nrules (on which the basic Regulation is largely based) may not \u201csupersede\u201d\ndomestic law, this does not prevent inferences being drawn by the Commission\nwhen such domestic laws appear to frustrate reasonable requests for\ninformation. Furthermore, the fact is that while EXIM Bank provided some\nresponses in the reply to Appendix A it refused to support almost any of this\ninformation by source data or any sort of evidence. Therefore the information\nhas only a value of oral statement, not supported by verified written documents.\nIf this practice were to be accepted the EXIM Bank could have provided virtually\nany information and the investigating authority would have had to accept it\nwithout being able to assess its accuracy. The questions on the political party\naffiliations and CCP units within EXIM Bank (an any other bank in this matter)\nare highly relevant for the purpose of establishing the extent of state\ninfluence on the banks\u2019 management in the light of the particular role of CCP\nunder the Constitution of the PRC. In addition to the justification of such\nquestions which the Commission offered in the recital (151) above it is also\nnoted that in accordance with CCP Constitution, all organisations, including\nprivate commercial enterprises, are required to established \u201cprimary\norganisations of the party\u201d if the firm employs at least three party members. These\norganisations guarantee and oversee the implementation of the principles and\npolicies of the Party and the state and supports the meeting of shareholders,\nboard of directors, board of supervisors, and managers in the exercise of their\nfunctions and powers according to law[97]. The\nCompany Law of the PRC also obliges all companies in China to set up a CCP\norganisation within their organisational structure to carry our activities of\nthe CCP[98].Therefore, the CCP is demonstrably linked\nto the activities of the GOC and to the operation of all kinds of firms and\ninstitutions in China ; it is therefore legitimate to ask questions about party\naffiliations in this respect.\n(412)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the verification\nof CDB the GOC made the same claim in regards of the questions on political\naffiliations of management and the role of CCP in the bank. In this respect the\nCommission refers to the justifications in recitals (151) and (411) above. The\nGOC also claimed that the CDB could not provide the requested credit risk\nassessment reports because of the confidentiality reasons and that it provided\na template of the credit rating and also a concrete example of credit risk\nassessment with the company name blanked out. It is noted that the credit rating\ntemplate and the credit rating for unknown company of unknown industry is not\nan evidence of the credit risk assessment of one of the sampled exporters as\nrequested by the Commission. With regard to the confidentiality issues, the\nCommission refers to the explanation in Recital (410).\n(413)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission\u2019s finding that the State-owned commercial banks [SOCBs] are public\nbodies is inconsistent with Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement because the\nCommission has not based its determination on any evidence whatsoever and has\nnot provided a reasoned and adequate analysis of its determination that\ngovernment involvement in the Chinese financial sector is so substantial that\nbanks are required to follow preferential policies. The Commission fundamentally\ndisagrees with this claim. The independent information referred to in recitals (162)\nto (168) shows that the banks implement the preferential policies and this is\nalso clear from several Chinese plans, laws and policy documents referred to in\nrecital (102) above. The Commission reviewed, analysed and cited a number of\ndocuments published by the international organisations including WTO, World\nBank, IMF and OECD all of which conclude that the Chinese banking sector is subject\nto the significant state interventions in particular with regards to privileged\nrecipients of loans and interest-rate setting.\n(414)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC challenges the\nrelevance of several documents used as best facts available to which the\nCommission referred in relation to the public body determination concerning the\nSOCBs. As a preliminary remark, it must be pointed out that the Commission had\nto resort to best facts available only because of the non-cooperation of GOC\nand its refusal to provide the requested information.\n(415)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Deutsche Bank Research report (\u2018DB report\u2019) which the\nCommission cited in the recital (161) describes a historical situation in China\nand cannot provide a positive basis to assess the Chinese banking sector 7\nyears later. Firstly, the GOC is wrong in claiming that the report provides a\nbasis to assess situation \u201c7 years later\u201d. The report is from 2007 and the IP,\nwhich is the relevant period for the assessment of the banking sector in China\nfor the purpose of this proceeding, starts in the year 2011. Therefore the\nreport refers to a situation 4 years before the relevant period. Secondly the\nDB report is not the only document on which the Commission relies in its\nfindings but only a starting point of the Commissions analysis of the Chinese\nbanking sector and its ownership structure in particular. Thirdly the other\ninformation which the Commission referred to for the purpose of establishing\nthe ownership structure of the Chinese banking sector (WTO, IMF and OECD\nreports and working papers) is in line with the findings of the DB report. In\nthis context it must be noted that the GOC itself only provided a minimum of\nthe repeatedly requested information in this respect and never actually\ncontested the Commission\u2019s findings on the level of state ownership in the\nbanking sector and state interference in the banking system on factual basis.\n(416)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also challenges the Commission\u2019s reference to the 2012 WTO Trade Policy\nReview report with the claim that the statement that \u201cthere has been generally\nlittle change in the market structure of China\u2019s banking sector\u201d was stated\nin comparison to the previous review period in year 2010. The Commission does\nnot disagree with this claim. In fact the Commission, in its definitive\ndisclosure document, cited the WTO Trade Policy Review reports from 2010 and\n2012 in the same recital (161) in order to demonstrate that very little has\nchanged in the period of two years. While the 2010 report stated that \u201cthe\nhigh degree of state ownership is another notable feature of the financial\nsector in China\u201d the 2012 report confirmed that little changed in this\nrespect. The GOC also cited from the 2012 report and on the basis of these\ncitations claimed that the report contradicts the Commission\u2019s assessment in\nrecital (161) above. This claim could not be accepted. None of the citations\nfrom the report reproduced in the GOC\u2019s comments to definitive disclosure\ncontradicts or even put in question the Commission\u2019s assessment in recital (161).\n(417)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthe Commission\u2019s findings in recital (162) above lack positive evidence because\nthe Commission (in addition to the DB report and WTO Trade Policy Reviews\ndiscussed in recitals above) \u201csimply refers to the World Bank Report and the\nEconomic survey etc., but does not provide any reasoned and adequate\nexplanation to support its findings\u201d. This claim could not be accepted. In\nthis respect it is noted that the World Bank report states, inter alia,\nthe following: \u201cDespite impressive progress\nin reforming and deepening the financial sector in the past three decades,\nChina\u2019s financial system remains repressed and suffers from key structural\nimbalances. The current system, characterized by dominance of state-owned\nbanks, strong state intervention, and remaining controls on interest rates, has\nbeen remarkably successful in mobilizing savings and allocating capital to\nstrategic sectors during China\u2019s economic take-off\u201d, or \u201cIn parallel, direct and indirect controls of financial\ninstitutions must give way to armslength market-based arrangements. This would\nmean an autonomous central bank adopting open market operations and using\ninterest rates, rather than credit ceilings, to manage liquidity. Commercial\nbanks would use commercial principles and creditworthiness analysis, rather\nthan follow government signals, to guide lending\u201d and \u201cThe government at\nall levels has been closely involved in the commercial operations of financial\ninstitutions, either through holding of shares or indirect influences, mainly\nbecause it is heavily dependent on the use of commercial bank credit for policy\ngoals\u201d. The 2010 OECD Economic Survey on China describes the PBOC policies\non lending rates floor and deposit rate ceiling as a disincentive for the banks\nto price risk appropriately and a counter productive measure for competition in\nthe banking sector and states that the purpose is to safeguard profitability of\nthe predominantly state-owned banking sector.\n(418)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC further claims that the Commission\u2019s determination that the PBOC is\ninvolved in and influences the setting of interest rates by State-owned\ncommercial banks lacks proper reasoning and evidentiary basis. In this respect\nthe GOC stated that the Commission ought to have known that in July 2013, the\nfloor lending rates were abolished. Firstly it must by noted that the\nCommission did not analyse the situation of the banking market in China in July\n2013 as it was not relevant for this investigation. Secondly the claim that the\nCommission\u2019s determination lacks proper reasoning and evidentiary basis is\nincorrect. The relevant circulars clearly state the PBOC sets limits on lending\nas well as on deposit rates. And thirdly, the OECD Economic Survey: China 2010\ncited in recital (162) above also confirms the existence of such limits.\n(419)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the \u201cCommission knew that the circulars,\nincluding the 8 June and 8 July 2012 circulars issued after the Coated Fine Paper\nfindings had altered the interest rate practice of the PBOC in significant way\u201d.\nThis is incorrect. The Commission could not know if or how exactly the practice\nchanged as the GOC refused to provide these circulars. Even the summaries from\nthe PBOC websites submitted during the verification, but which the GOC\nincorrectly claims that the Commission completely disregarded, confirm that\nsuch limits still exist. \n(420)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also claimed that \u201cthe Commission did not appear to base its finding on\nactual \u201cfacts available\u201d which contradicts the historical information that the\nCommission possessed, but rather made it incumbent upon the GOC to prove that\nthe state of affairs examined during the Organic Coated Steel had changed.\u201d In\nview of the explanation in the recitals (415) - (419) above it is clear that\nthis claim is incorrect. There are no facts available on the file which contradict\nCommission\u2019s findings and the findings are not based only on the historical\ninformation but on positive evidence, based on all the information relevant for\nthe IP.\n(421)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the four points claimed by the Commission in the recital (166)\nabove are incorrect and lack proper legal assessment. GOC argued that the\nreference to the Article 34 of the Commercial Banking Law that banks are \u201cto\ncarry out their loan business according to the needs of the national economy\u201d\nis completely neutral. It is not clear what the GOC meant by the term \u201cneutral\u201d\nbut according to the plans, policy documents and laws cited in recital (102)\nabove the development of the PV industry and its financial and other support\nseems to be amongst the needs of national economy in China. In the context of\nthe financial support encouraged and expressed in these documents it is clear\nthat the banks shall support the companies belonging to the PV industry.\nConcerning the finding that the banks are subject to legal rules which require\nthem to provide credit supports to encouraged projects for which the Commission\nrelied on the wording of the State Council Decision No 40, the GOC claimed that\n\u201cit is absolutely misplaced\u201d because the Decision does not state or\nindicate that the solar industry is an encouraged project. This claim is also\nincorrect. From recital (399) above, it is clear that the solar industry\nbelongs to the category of encouraged industries/ projects. The GOC made a\nsimilar claim concerning the Law of the PRC on Scientific and Technological\nProgress and the Commission\u2019s finding that it requires the banks to give\npriority to the development of high and new technology industries and that the\nsampled producers fall in the high-tech category. According to the GOC, the Commission\ndid not make any legal analysis on the issue of whether the solar industry of\nmodules and cells production described as high-tech industry falls within the\nscope of this law. This is not correct. The Commission made a clear link\nbetween the category high-tech industries and the solar industry producing\nmodules and cells. This is explained in detail in recital (402) above.\n(422)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission statement that the state involvement in the\nChinese financial sector is substantial and on-going is not supported by\npositive evidence. The GOC contested the evidence cited by the Commission and\nclaimed that the 2009 IMF report which highlights the lack of interest rate\nliberalisation is irrelevant because the interest rates have been completely\nliberalised in China. This is not correct. The evidence on the file confirms\nthat the interest rates liberalisation in China is not finished and this was\nalso confirmed by the PBOC officials present during the verification visit. In\nregards of the 2010 IMF Country Report referred to by the Commission the GOC\nclaimed that the Commission completely disregarded IMF findings on financial\nsector liberalisation. This is not true. The Commission did not disregard any\nrelevant findings of the IMF in this report which were relevant. The IMF\nfindings to which the GOC referred to in its comments are not contradicting any\nof the Commission\u2019s findings on the state involvement in the Chinese financial\nsector and certainly not in respect of the state ownership or loan and deposits\ninterest rate policy. The fact that the Report stated that progress has been\nmade in recent years in developing a more market-based financial system in\nChina does not mean that the Report said that there actually is a market-based\nfinancial system in China. With regard to the OECD surveys cited by the\nCommission, the GOC claimed that it cannot be concluded that banks do not\noperate independently in China on the basis \u201cof one phrase to the exclusion\nof significant progress with regard to the liberalisation of the banking\nsector\u201d. Concerning this claim it must be noted that the Commission never\nmade any conclusion on the basis of \u201cone phrase\u201d but as demonstrated in the\nabove text, on the basis of several documents compiled by independent international\norganisations.\n(423)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission\u2019s analysis concerning the public body\ndetermination \u201cis completely flawed\u201d and its conclusion in recital (168)\nabove is inconsistent with the WTO AB\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpublic body\u201d\nin the US - Definitive Anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Certain\nProducts for China. One exporting producer also claimed that the\nCommission\u2019s reasoning concerning public body determination is \u201clegally\nerroneous\u201d. The GOC claimed that the Commission failed to establish that SOCBs\nposses, are vested with, and exercise governmental authority and that it has\nnot established i) that the functions in question which are alleged to be\nperformed by the SOCBs are those that are executed by a government in general,\ni.e. are governmental functions in the first place, ii) the common features\nwhich the SOCBs share with the government besides the shareholding which was\nalso not established for all the SOCBs; and iii) that all the SOCBs posses the\nrequisite governmental authority in order to be able to exercise it or were\nvested with the power to execute the governmental functions concerned. These\nclaims had to be rejected. The Commission refers to its analysis of this issue\nin recitals (158) - (167) . Lending is mentioned in the subsidy definition\nunder Article 3.1(a)(i) of the basic Regulation as a government function. In the\npresent investigation SOCBs are instructed by a requirement, through plans and\nother policy documents, to promote certain sectors, including the PV sector. On\nthe basis of facts available, it was also concluded that there is substantial\ngovernment ownership of banks in China and that the government exercises\nmeaningful control over the SOCBs. Since the GOC did not provide the requested\ninformation on the government ownership of all SOCB\u2019s in China, the Commission\nmade its findings on the facts available. Thus, the Commission concludes that\nthe SOCBs act as an arm of government performing a public function in\nimplementing the GOC\u2019s preferential lending policies to certain sectors.\n(424)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that the Commission failed to establish\ndirection or entrustment of private banks in China and in particular that the\nCommission has not established that the GOC gave an explicit and\naffirmative delegation or command or responsibility or authority to the private\nbanks and the SOCBs to provide preferential loans. The Commission does not\nagree with this claim. As explained in recitals (170) - (173), there is a\ngovernment policy in China to provide preferential lending support the PV\nindustry. Private banks are obliged to implement that government policy: The\nGOC through the Law on Commercial Banks instructed all banks in China to \u201ccarry out their loan business upon the needs of national economy and\nthe social development and with the spirit of the state industrial policies\u201d. These needs and state industrial policies are, inter alia,\nset in various plans and policy documents and the provision of preferential\nfinancing to selected industries including the PV industry is one of them. The\nGOC also claimed that the relevant Article of the Law on Commercial Banks has\nbeen extracted out of context and that it does not explicitly demonstrate any\ndelegation or command, grant of responsibility or exercise of authority by the\nGOC on any commercial bank. The Commission does not agree that the Article 34\nhas been taken out of context as already explained in recital (390) above and\nconsiders its wording a clear, legally binding instruction to all banks in\nChina. The Commission also does not agree with the GOC\u2019s claim that the\ndocuments providing for the preferential lending to the PV industry referred to\nin recital (102) are \u201cinadequate legal basis\u201d. This is explained in length in\nrecitals (399) - (403) above.\n(425)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nexporting producer claimed that the Commission has not demonstrated\nforeign-owned banks in China are entrusted and directed by the GOC. This claim\nhad to be rejected. The Commission demonstrated entrustment and direction for\nall privately owned banks in China (inter alia recitals (169) - (172) and (424)\nabove) and the banks with foreign ownership belong to this category. \n(426)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of the entrustment and direction determination the GOC also claimed\nthat the Commission had made conclusions on the basis of credit risk assessment\nof one sampled exporter provided by one bank and applied them to all banks in\nChina and thereby used adverse inferences in this regard. It is noted that the\nGOC as well as the banks refused to provide any other credit risk assessments\nof other sampled exporting producers. Since the Commission was forced to apply\nfacts available in this regard and the credit risk assessment mentioned above\nis best facts available the Commission partly based its conclusions on this\ndocument. But it is reiterated that the conclusions were made on the basis of\nfacts available and not adverse inferences.\n(427)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC objected to the Commission\u2019s assessment of the distortion of the Chinese\nfinancial market \u201cas it is legally flawed\u201d. The GOC claimed that there\nis no evidence pertaining to the IP which would indicate that the SOCBs account\nfor 2/3 of the Chinese financial market. The Commission disagrees with this\nclaim. In the absence of the information on the banking sector ownership which\nwas repeatedly requested but not provided by the GOC the Commission applied\nfact available. The Commission referred to the DB report in this respects which\nstates that the SOCBs account for more than 2/3 of the Chinese financial\nmarket. This is further corroborated by the evidence from the WTO, IMF, OECD\nand World Bank documents which confirm that the state presence in the Chinese\nbanking sector had not significantly changed in the IP. The GOC also claimed\nthat the Commission\u2019s statement concerning the interest rates (namely that the\nbanks are bound to stay within the limits set by the PBOC)is incorrect because\nthe floor lending rate has been completely abolished. This is not correct. It\nis true that the GOC in its comments claimed that the floor lending rates has\nbeen abolished in July 2013, but this is more than one year after the end of\nthe IP. It is also correct to say that the ceilings on the deposits rates are\nstill in place. Therefore the Commission\u2019s finding that the banks are not\nentirely free to decide the conditions of the loans (at least in regards to the\nIP) is correct and supported by the evidence on the file. The GOC also disputed\nthe Commission\u2019s findings in recitals (183) - (188) on the basis of the alleged\nnon-relevance of several plans, policy documents and laws cited by the\nCommission. Commission does not agree with this claim and refers to the\nrecitals (399) - (403) above where it explained why these documents are\nrelevant for such findings. The GOC also stated that the Commission\u2019s finding\nthat certain banks were granted access to the SAFE foreign exchange reserves is\nmisplaced because the evidence to which the Commission referred only named EXIM\nBank and CDB and explained that the loans sourced from these reserves are only\ngiven to state-owned enterprises. The Commission does not agree. The evidence\nonly states that when this program started it was initially available only to\npolicy banks CDB and EXIM, but also mentions a major loan of the Bank of China,\nwhich indicates that the initial restriction has been removed. Also the claim\nthat the evidence \u201cclearly states that the loans are given to only state-owned\nenterprise like Sinopec\u201d is not accurate. It actually stated that major\nstate-owned enterprises are preferred, but does not indicate that the provision\nof such loans was limited to them. And in any event, given the size of the EXIM\nBank and CDB and their impact on the financial market in China, even if the\nprogram was limited to them it would mean a significant distortion of the\nfinancial market as a whole.\n(428)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that the Commission has not established\nspecificity in regards of preferential lending and its specificity analysis is\nlegally incoherent because it did not establish whether the Decision No 40\nrefers to projects or industries. According to the GOC the fact that the\n\u201cextremely wide array of economic sectors and industries are covered by\nDecision No. 40, this document does not explicitly limit access of the alleged\nsubsidy to certain enterprises as is required to be established by the WTO\njurisprudence\u201d. The Commission does not agree with this claim. With respect to encouraged projects, it is\nrecalled that these cover only certain activities within limited number of\nindustrial sectors and thus this categorisation, covering only a subset of\nenterprises in China, cannot be considered as of a general nature and\nnon-specific. The Commission considered this as the most natural interpretation\nin the absence of any explanation (and corroborating documents) as to how the\nGOC precisely applied the notion of the PV industry e.g. for the purposes of\nDecision 40 and the related Guiding Catalogue of the\nIndustrial Restructuring. Moreover as explained in\nrecital (102) above the solar PV industry also belongs to the category of\nstrategic industries as defined by the 12th five-year plan and on\nthis basis enjoys access to preferential financing which is clear from the\ncitations from various planning and policy documents and laws in the same\nrecital.\n(429)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also claimed that the Commission has not established the existence of\nbenefit concerning preferential lending because the use for the external\nbenchmark for the purpose of the benefit establishment was not supported by the Commission findings. According to the GOC,\nthe Commission had no basis to apply the BB rating as it did not provide any\nevidence that the BB rating is more likely to be undistorted credit rating that\nany other rating and its application \u201creflects the impermissible adverse\ninferences made in violation of Article 12.7 of the SCM Agreement\u201d. This\nclaim had to be rejected. Given the distortions and\nthe lack of proper creditworthiness or risk assessment of the sampled exporting\nproducers by the lending banks, the Commission could not have taken the credit\nrating (if they had any at all) of the individual exporting producers at its\nface value. The BB rating is in this case not adverse inference and it is not unfavourable\nfor the exporting producers because it is the best non- investment rating on\nthe market.\n(430)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant claimed that\nthe Commission should have used a less favourable credit rating than BB grade\nfor the benchmark construction for some exporting producers which were in\nparticularly bad financial situation. For the reasons explained in Recital (429)\nabove, the Commission considered the BB rating (non-investment grade) to appropriately\nreflect the financial situation of sampled exporting producers during the IP.\n(431)\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint also requested\nthat the Commission discloses the calculation of mark-up for loans in Chinese\ncurrency. The Commission explained the methodology in paragraph 169 of\ndefinitive disclosure document (replicated in recital (198) above). In line\nwith the methodology from Coated Fine Paper and Organic Coated Steel\nproceedings the Commission adjusted the Chinese interest rates by adding the\ninterest differential between the best rated bonds and BB rated bonds traded on\nmarkets in the IP.\n(432)\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that the Commission, in order to establish the benefit from preferential\nlending should compare the lending rates of the \u201cfavoured\u201d industries with\nthose of the \u201cnon-favoured\u201d industries. In view of the Commission analysis of\nthe financial market (recitals (181) - (185)) this claim had to be rejected. Taking\ninto account the established distortions the interest rates in Chinese\nfinancial market are deemed to be unreliable. \n(433)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nfor the EUR and USD loans the Commission should not resort to the external\nbenchmark because one of the key elements on which the Commission based its\ndistortion analysis, i.e. the PBOC limitations on interest rates does not exist\nfor such loans. This claim had to be rejected. The PBOC limitations on the\ninterest rates are just one of the key elements which the Commission used in\nits analysis of the Chinese financial market. As explained in recitals (180) - (184)\nabove there is number of other distortions which justified on their own the use\nof external benchmark also for EUR and USD denominated loans.\n(434)\u00a0\u00a0 Several exporters and the\nGOC claim that the Agreements between exporters and certain state-owned banks (referred\nto as \"the Agreements\" in this section) are not equivalent to credit\nlines and do not amount to a financial contribution because they do not contain\nan obligation or commitment for the bank to provide future funding under\nparticular terms and conditions. They also refer to the conclusions of the EC-Aircraft\npanel, which stated that the \"mere possibility\" that a government\nmay transfer funds under the fulfilment of a pre-defined condition will not be\nsufficient to demonstrate the existence of a financial contribution. They noted\nthe panel's statement that the contractual arrangement should \u201cin and\nof itself, be claimed and capable of conferring a benefit on the recipient that\nis separate and independent to the benefit that might be conferred from any\nfuture transfer of funds.\u201d\n(435)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard the findings of\nthe EC-Aircraft panel, the Commission notes that such findings are not\nexhaustive with regard to the scope of credit lines or other similar agreements\nan do not bind the Commission's interpretation of the basic Regulation in this\ncase. Nevertheless, the Commission does not disagree with the panel's\nconclusions, but with the application of those conclusions to the present\ninvestigation by the GOC. The Agreements normally provide for the state-owned\nbank to lend up to the requisite amount of money, sometimes in conjunction with\npossible improvements in the performance of the firm involved. So, on the one hand,\nthe text of the Agreements may contain textually less explicit or automatic\nobligations concerning the terms and conditions of future lending than those\nwhich feature some types of Credit Line Agreements. They are sometimes supplemented\nby separate loan or credit agreements. However, it has been noted that loans\nunder these Agreements are usually made on very similar, not to say identical\nterms. On the other hand, the Agreements contain a number of provisions which\ngo far beyond the normal language of credit line agreements and which amount to\nthe creation of a guaranteed support mechanism by the bank in question. The\nCommission considers that in this case the written provisions of the Agreements\nare not necessarily conclusive, because \u201cobligations\u201d or \u201ccommitments\u201d to\ntransfer funds may be expressed in written or unwritten form and that their\nexistence should be determined on the basis of the totality of the facts on the\nrecord.\n(436)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the exact\nnature of the commitments or obligations of the state-owned banks under the\nAgreements depends upon:\n(a)                   \nThe text of the Agreements: The Commission notes that provisions in the most\nsignificant agreements involving large state-owned banks and particular\nexporting producers are broadly similar. The agreements establish a close link\nbetween the bank and exporter with regard to a transfer of funds. They provide\nfor the transfer of the requisite amount of money, sometimes upon the\nfulfilment of certain conditions related to performance and credit rating. The\nAgreements entitle the firm to \u201cfavourable treatment\u201d when applying for a loan\ncompared to firms which have not signed such agreements. Some of the\namounts of potential funding are huge compared to the firms\u2019 annual turnover. The\namounts of credit promised to the sampled exporters accounted for more than 3\ntimes their annual turnover. Furthermore, the Agreements provide for the bank\nto give strong support to the development of the company in question. There are\nreferences to \u201ca long-term stable strategic partnership\u201d between the\nbank and the firm, to the bank giving \u201cpriority\u201d to the firm\u2019s key\nconstruction projects, offering \u201clong-term stable financial support\u201d to\nthe firm \u201cin respect of its asset acquisition and reorganization,\nfundamental formation of each business unit, technical improvement project, \u201cGo\nGlobal\u201d project and other businesses\u2026.\u201d and helping the firm to \u201cformulate\na medium and long term development planning by virtue of its professional\nadvantages, institutional advantages and performance advantages.\u201d Agreements\nalso mention that they comply with national macro-economic and industrial\npolicy. Therefore, it would seem that the strategic support given to the firm,\ncombined with the \u201cfavourable treatment\u201d accorded by the Agreements make it highly\nlikely that the firm will be automatically eligible to draw down loans from the\nAgreements.\n(b)                   \nThe nature and objectives of the lenders: The lenders are state-owned banks which have been found to\nbe public bodies or other banks which have been found to be entrusted and\ndirected by the government and therefore act as an arm of the GOC. They have\nalso been found to provide loans at well below market rates. For example,\ncertain Agreements refers to the bank\u2019s \u201cfinancing advantage\u201d and its\nsupport for \u201chigh-tech industry\u2026having priority in development with the\ngovernment concession\u201d.\n(c)                   \nThe government attitude towards the borrower: Borrowers belong to the strategic emerging industries as\nshown in the recital (102) above.\n(d)                   \nThe degree of cooperation of the government\nwith the investigation: The providers of the credit\nlines (state-owned banks and banks entrusted and directed by the government)\nhave failed to fully cooperate with the investigation and findings relating to\nthem have been made on facts available.\n(e)                   \nThe market perception of the Agreements: Companies seem to value the Agreements as evidence that they have\nthe state backing behind them and publicly announce the conclusions of such\nagreements to send a positive signal to markets and potential investors. For\ninstance, on 9 July 2010, Yingli Solar issued a press release announcing a\n\u201cstrategic cooperation agreement\u201d with CDB, under which CDB \u201cexpects to grant credit\nfacilities with an aggregate maximum amount of RMB 36 million to support Yingli\nGroup and its affiliates\u201d. The Chief Financial Officer of Yingli stated that, \u201dThis\nagreement raised two parties' cooperation to a\nnew level, which we believe will give us the ability to pursue opportunities\nthat will allow us to strengthen our leadership position in the PV industry.\" Jinko Solar, on 26 January 2011, characterised an RMB 50 billion\ncredit facility from the Bank of China as a \u201cstrategic cooperation\nagreement\u201d which would \u201cfurther strengthen our position as a leading solar\nproduct manufacturer\u201d. The press release went on to state that \u201cWith the\nlong-term financial support of the BOC, we are confident we will deliver\nexcellent results in 2011 as well as meet our long-term growth targets.\u201d On\n14 April 2010, Trina Solar was reported as intending to use the $4.4 billion\ncredit agreement with CDB \u201cfor market expansion\u201d. All these\nannouncements suggest that the exporting producers concerned see the Agreements\nas an established, rather than an uncertain, source of financing\n(f)                     \nOperation of the Agreements: Numerous individual loans have been\ndrawn down by exporting producers i.e. the agreements lead to an actual\ntransfer of funds, usually at well below market rates.\n(437)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of all the\nevidence, it is concluded that the Agreements are offered by the banks as part\nof a government strategy to promote the PV industry and are considered to be of\ngreat value by the exporters concerned, irrespective of whether any funds are\nactually transferred. This contradicts the arguments of the parties that they\nare effectively of no value. Although the Agreements have the characteristics\nof normal credit lines, they go beyond the terms and conditions of normal\ncredit lines and are effectively strategic partnerships between public bodies\nand firms to pursue government policy. In this regard, they operate as a\nmechanism of state support/guarantee, which enhance the market position\nof the exporters concerned and enable them to expand their capacity and output\nwith the certainty that they will receive the required funding.. In the absence\nof such support/guarantee, the exporters would evidently be perceived by the\nmarkets as being in a weaker position. Consequently, they qualify as a\npotential transfer of funds or as a provision of financial services. Such a\nvaluable \u201cguarantee\u201d would have some value in the market and, at the very\nleast, would involve the payment of a substantial fee. In view of this, the\nAgreements also confer a benefit which is, in the words of the EC-Aircraft panel\n\u201cseparate and independent to the benefit that might be conferred from any\nfuture transfer of funds\u201d, due, inter alia, to the potential\nobligation of payments by the Government. They are more than just a\nvague \u201cpromise to provide \u201ccheap\u201d financing\u201d[99] and\nclearly make the recipients \u201cbetter off\u201d than they would be absent the\nAgreement.\n(438)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the amount of\nthe benefit, this has been established on the basis of the fees charged for\ncredit line obtained by one of the sampled exporting producers. This credit\nline was granted by a bank whose headquarters is established in the financial\njurisdiction other than PRC and it is shows all the elements of commercial\ncredit lines available on world financial markets and other agreements found in\nthe commercial sector. It is also noted that this credit lines is not\nsubstantially different in its conditions from the other commercial credit\nlines obtained by the sampled exporting producers, where fees are charged,\nincluding those from foreign banks. In view of the above analysis, this is a\nconservative benchmark, as the evidence indicates that the Agreements are in\nreality more valuable to firms as a stand-alone measure than a standard credit\nline. However, the Commission considered the required fees to serve as\nreasonably proxy for those that would be payable under the Agreements.\n(439)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthe banks which undertook the Agreements with the sampled exporters are not\npublic bodies or were not entrusted by the government to do so. This claim had\nto be rejected. The banks involved were the same banks which provided\npreferential financing and in the recitals (159) - (168) and (169) - (180) above\nthe Commission provided a detailed explanation why they are public bodies\nand/or why they are entrusted and directed by the GOC.\n(440)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the Commission\u2019s\nclaim that in normal market circumstances credit lines are subject to\nsubstantial commitment and administration fees is groundless as such fees only\napply to \u201ccommitted credit lines\u201d. This claim had to be rejected. As stated in\nthe recital above the credit line used as a benchmark is not substantially\ndifferent in its conditions from the other commercial credit lines obtained by\nthe sampled exporting producers, including from banks outside China. Moreover\none of the banks which concluded several such agreements with sampled exporting\nproducers seems to charge similar fees to its clients abroad[100].\n(441)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC also claimed that the Commission has not provided evidence to support its\nstatement that the Government provision of credit lines (i.e. the Agreements)\nis part of preferential lending. This is not correct. The provision of credit\nlines is the standard part of financing provided by banks to companies and the\nAgreements are separate and distinct measures falling under the scope of\npreferential lending. As stated in recital (102) above the GOC provides through\na number of planning and policy documents and laws for the preferential\nfinancing to the PV industry. In addition numerous loans were drawn under these\nagreements, which clearly shows that they are an integral part of preferential financing\nof the PV industry. \n(442)\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\nclaimed that the provision of credit lines is not a specific subsidy. This\nclaim had to be rejected. As explained in recital (441) above the provision of\ncredit lines is an integral part of preferential lending and therefore the\nspecificity analysis in recitals (191), (192), (209) and (428) above equally\napplies to the provision of credit lines. \n(443)\u00a0\u00a0 According to the complainant,\nthe Commission should have established a subsidy margin for the use of export\nbuyers credits, as the EXIM Bank refused to cooperate. The Commission should\nhave used the information in the complaint and the US DOC findings in the similar\nPV case. This claim could not be accepted. The Commission investigated the\nallegations in the complaint but no evidence was found that the sampled\nexporting producers benefited from such measures during the IP. It is noted\nthat the investigation periods for the US case and for the case at hand were\ndifferent.\n3.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of parties\nconcerning Export Guarantee and Insurance for green technologies\n(444)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the documents\nrequested by the Commission at the verification visit as specified in recitals (220)\nand (221), the GOC claimed that it has not been clarified when the 840 Plan was\nrequested, that Sinosure\u2019s 2012 financial statements were not available at the\ntime of verification, and that information concerning the sampled companies\nwere confidential and in any event the relevant contracts were not held at the\nheadquarters of Sinosure. The Commission refers to its explanations included in\nrecitals (219), (220), and (223) which deal with all these arguments. With\nregard to the 840 Plan, the Commission adds that it asked for all of the relevant\ndocuments concerning the activity of Sinosure and the alleged subsidy programme\nbenefiting the sampled exporters, and that this 840 Plan is certainly relevant\nfor its findings, together with all the other documents specified in recital (236),\nas supported by the explanations in recital (232). As for the Sinosure\u2019s 2012\nfinancial statements, the Commission asked for the trial accounts, if the 2012\nfinancial statements were not finalised, but Sinosure also refused to provide\nany trial accounts for 2012.\n(445)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claimed that\nthere is no legal or factual evidence to support the conclusion that the\nphotovoltaic industry is a \u201cstrategic industry\u201d and that this would be the\nresult of a presumption. The Commission refers to the explanation in recital (231)\nand recalls that this point was specifically confirmed by the GOC during the\nverification visit. With regard to the similar claim concerning the 840 plan,\nthe 421 plan and the measures to support \u201cStrategic Emerging Industries\u201d and to\nthe claim that the plans would not be legally binding, the Commission refers to\nthe explanations in recitals (232) - (234) respectively. It further notes that\nthe GOC has failed to submit these documents and discuss them with the\nCommission, and that there is no evidence on the record proving that the\nCommission conclusions are incorrect.\n(446)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC and one sampled\nexporter claim that the rebates and grants for the payment of export credit\ninsurance premia granted by the local authorities have been illegally countervailed\nbecause it has not been established that they constitute subsidies within the\nmeaning of the WTO SCM Agreement. The Commission refers to its analysis on the\nfindings of the investigation and in particular to recitals (239) and (247).\nThe Commission further notes that the rebates and grants are inextricably\ninterlinked with the export credit insurance programme because their repayment\nis the consequence of the payment of the premium to Sinosure under the main\nexport credit insurance policy. Last but not least, these rebates also fall\nunder the scope of the Notice [2004] No. 368 issued jointly by MOFCOM and\nSinosure, which provides that \u201cthe regional and local government authorities\nshall jointly make further effort to implement further support measures to the\nproducts included in the Directory and the high and new technological\nenterprises for export credit insurance\u201d.\n(447)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also challenge the\nfinding concerning Item (j) of Annex 1 of the WTO SCM Agreement that Sinosure\nshort-term export credit insurance programme was operated at premium rates\ninadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programme.\nIn support of this the GOC cites the jurisprudence of the WTO Panel finding in US-Upland\nCotton and presents explanations based on different sets of figures and\narguments contained in Sinosure Annual Reports. The GOC also questions the\nCommission reference to Article 11 of Sinosure\u2019s Articles of Association and to\nthe article from the law firm Stewart Law. The Commission restates all of its\narguments in recitals (242) - (245) and recalls that its conclusions are based\non the best available evidence in the file due to the lack of cooperation of\nthe GOC which prevented the Commission from obtaining the relevant information\nit had asked for. For its findings, the Commission considered a number of\nelements and evidence on file, among which were Sinosure\u2019s Article of\nAssociation and the article from the law firm Stewart Law. The Commission\nconsiders that, while none of these elements is determinant in itself, these\nand all the other elements are relevant for its determination. As for the US-Upland\nCotton jurisprudence, the Commission has fully taken it into account in its\nfindings and the quotes of this jurisprudence from the GOC are indeed very\npertinent.\n(448)\u00a0\u00a0 In challenging the\nCommission analysis in recital (245), the GOC submits a table with figures\ntaken from the Income Statement of Sinosure\u2019s publicly available Annual Reports\nfor the period 2006-2011 and concludes that it is evident that the premiums\nreceived were higher than the operating costs of the programme. First, the\nCommission notes that the table provided by the GOC does not include in the\nrelevant row concerning amounts of the commissions paid by Sinosure but only\nthe operating expenses. Second, the figures indisputably show that in each\nsingle year from 2006 until 2011 with the exception of 2010 the amounts of net\npremium are never higher than the amounts of the net claims plus the operating\nexpenses, even ignoring the payments of commissions which have been omitted by\nthe GOC. This includes the year 2011, which partly covers the investigation\nperiod, and the amount of the loss is quite substantial in certain years (e.g.\n2008). Third, the Commission notes that for 2010 the GOC has indicated a\ndisproportionately low amount of net claims paid (premiums paid are stated to\nbe 20 times higher than the claims paid), which is not reflected in the Annual\nReport of 2010. This amount reported by the GOC for the year 2010 is based on massive\nex-post adjustments concerning recovery of claims and change in outstanding\nclaims reserves which only appear in the Annual Report of 2011 with reference\nto the year 2010. These adjustments appear to be of an extraordinary and\nabnormal nature and are only reflected in the report of the following year. The\nCommission also notes that for 2011 the GOC has instead reported the amounts\nincluded in the 2011 Annual Report. The Commission finds subsequent adjustments\ndifficult to reconcile with the actual situation, especially given the absence\nof cooperation and of further explanation by the GOC or Sinosure in the course\nof the investigation. According to US-Upland Cotton as quoted by the GOC\nitself, \u201cthe reference to \u201clong-term\u201d in item (j) to refer to a period of\nsufficient duration as to ensure an objective examination which allows a\nthorough appraisal of the programme and which avoids attributing overdue\nsignificance to any unique or atypical experiences on a given day, month,\ntrimester, half-year, year or other specific time period\u201d [emphasis\nadded]. The Commission considers the period 2006-2011 as a sufficiently\nlong-term period to consider, and Sinosure has incurred a loss in each year of\nthis period. The situation of 2010 is either to be considered unique or\natypical if one takes into account the adjusted figures in the 2011 Annual\nReport and thus of limited significance, or the ordinary unadjusted figures in\nthe 2010 Annual Report must be taken into account as relevant which show that\nthe result is just slightly above break-even. Given the significant losses\nincurred in other years, this confirms the Commission findings that Sinosure\nis, overall, in a position of long-term loss during the period 2006-2011. In\naddition, even if the data from 2010 were taken into account as being\nrepresentative, the fact remains that Sinosure made losses in five out the six\nyears from 2006 to 2011. The other tables and sets of figures submitted by the\nGOC to challenge the Commission findings on item (j) WTO SCM Agreement cannot be\nreconciled with other information present on the record and/or are not\nverifiable, In any event, they do not by themselves demonstrate that Sinosure\nbroke even on its short-term export credit insurance programme during the\nperiod 2006-2011.\n(449)\u00a0\u00a0 As for the benchmark for the\ncalculation of the benefit, the GOC considers the establishment of an\nout-of-country benchmark inconsistent with the SCM Agreement, but it does not\nadd any argument to justify this claim. The Commission refers to its\nexplanation in recital (245).\n(450)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC and one sampled\ncooperating exporter challenge the benchmark used in that the Commission has\nnot justified why: (i) the premium calculation is based on US EXIM bank data;\n(ii) it has used Italy as the importing country and not Germany, which is the\nmain export market for the product concerned; (iii) it has taken the time\nperiod of 120 days and not 60 days or any other shorter period; (iv) it has not\nused the premium calculation for direct exports but rather for the Financial\nInstitution Buyer Credit (FIBC) Export Insurance. With regard to (i), the\nCommission refers to recital (253). With respect to (ii), the Commission\nbelieves that Italy represents the right balance between the EU country with\nthe lowest risk and EU countries with significantly higher risks and\nconsequently premia charged, which are also markets for the product concerned.\nAs for (iii), in the absence of a specific simulation based on a period of 90\ndays available on the EXIM Bank website the Commission considers the duration\nof 120 days as the most appropriate to represent the terms of sales during the\ninvestigation period. With regard to (iv), the Commission was not able to\nobtain a simulation for the calculation of the premium for direct exports and\nconsiders this benchmark to reflect the general risk situation in the country\nof purchase.\n(451)\u00a0\u00a0 One sampled cooperating\nexporter claims that it has purchased export credit insurance for some of its\nexports but it has paid regular insurance premia and did not enjoy the Green\nExpress programme or any other beneficial treatment alleged by the complaint.\nIn the absence of evidence proving this claim, the Commission refers to its\nfindings on this programme in Section 3.4.1.4 if this regulation. As regards\n\u2018Green Express\u2019, the Commission refers to its findings in recital (240) and\nnotes that this constitutes a specific aspect of Sinosure\u2019s short-term credit\ninsurance programme and that the Commission findings are not limited to this\naspect but to the programme as a whole.\n3.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Golden Sun demonstration\nprogramme\n(452)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC further argues that\nthis programme provides grants for \u201cdistributed solar PV systems\u201d rather than\nfor the producers/exporters of the product concerned and that the relevant\ncriteria in the legislation are not directed to module and cell producers. In\nthis respect the GOC claims to have provided the relevant documentation on the\nprogramme and that even coordinated with the sampled companies to prove this\npoint. Three sampled cooperating exporters claim that this is a \u2018user subsidy\u2019\nand does not confer a benefit to the product concerned, and therefore it is not\ncountervailable within the meaning of Articles 1(1) and 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation, Article VI:3 GATT 1994, and Article 19.1 of the WTO SCM Agreement.\nThese exporters refer to the EU decision in the Biodiesel from the United\nStates case (Recital 97 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/2009, OJ L\n67 of 12.03.2009 p. 50 and to the WTO jurisprudence in U.S.-Lead Bars (Paras\n6.50, 6.53, 6.56 and 6.57 of the Panel Report), Canada-Measures\nAffecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft (Para. 9.112 of the Panel Report),\nBrazil-Export Financing Programme for Aircraft (Para. 7.24 of the Panel\nReport), and Canada-Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft (Paras.\n157 and 159 of the Appellate Body Report).\n(453)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission refers to its findings of the investigation and in particular to\nRecitals (243) - (246) of this Regulation, which\nprovide exhaustive explanations on the above arguments and confirm that the\ndetermination is consistent with the relevant provisions and with the\njurisprudence quoted by the GOC and the cooperating sampled exporters. The\nCommission restates that the grants under the programme are directly linked to\nthe product concerned because the eligible \u201cdistributed solar PV systems\u201d\nspecifically include the supply of modules and cells as a significant part of\nthe projects and therefore the nexus between the benefit conferred by the\ngovernment and the product concerned is direct and inextricable. As also\nspecified particularly in Recitals (244) and (245), the investigation has\nconfirmed that direct payments have been effected by the GOC to several sampled\ncooperating exporters (i.e. the purpose of installing solar panels to generate\nenergy for their own use, including in the production process of the\nproduct concerned) using inter alia their own manufactured solar modules\nand cells. It has also been established that the direct payments made to the\nexporters in their capacity as suppliers of the product concerned to\nthird-party project operators are in fact at odds with the provisions in the\nrelevant legislation and that the GOC has failed to provide evidence to\nreconcile the situation (see namely Recitals (245) and (246)). The limited\nexplanation provided by the GOC and the sampled cooperating exporter that the\ndirect transfer of funds, in violation of the Chinese legislation, was\nnecessary because the project operator was in financial difficulty and to\nensure that the grants would be used only for authorised PV systems strongly\nindicates that, in the absence of this direct transfer from the government, the\nsampled cooperating exporter acting as supplier would not have been able to\nreceive any money for the supply of the product concerned and that the\ngovernment would not have been able to ensure that the subsidy would be used\nfor its intended purpose. From this perspective and in the absence of further\nevidence these payments must be viewed as a direct grant from the GOC to the producer\nof the product concerned, which would not otherwise have received any money for\nthe supply of the product concerned (assuming that this supply ever took place,\nfor which again there is no evidence on the record). On this basis the\nCommission believes that the arguments raised by the GOC and by the sampled\ncooperating exporters are legally unfounded.\n(454)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC also claims that for\nsituations in which the benefits from the programme concerned the supply of the\nproduct concerned to unrelated project operators, the Commission was obliged to\nconduct a pass-through analysis to establish this point, citing the WTO\ndecision in US-Softwood Lumber IV (paras. 141 and 142 of the Appellate\nBody Report). The Commission refers to the explanations in Recitals (244) -\n(246) and in Recital (352) above to dismiss this claim. Furthermore, due to the\nnon-cooperation of the GOC and interested parties, the Commission was not in a\nposition to carry out a pass-through analysis. Therefore there is no question\nof pass-through and the WTO jurisprudence quoted is irrelevant in this\nsituation given that the proceeds were directly paid to the producers of the\nproduct concerned and directly linked to the supply of inter alia the\nproduct concerned. Since these payments were non-repayable grants, there is a\nfinancial contribution (a direct transfer of funds) and the Commission is\nentitled to presume that they confer a benefit to the recipient (the\nproducers), in the absence of any evidence on further use made of the sums\nconcerned. Had payments under this programme been made by the government to\nthird-party project operators and the equipment acquired for fair market value,\nthere would be no benefit to the exporters concerned. However, in a situation\nwhere payments are made to the exporting producers, the amounts used by these\ncompanies for the installation of solar panels confer a benefit because it\nrelieves them of costs they would otherwise have incurred in this process. If\nthe exporting producer is unable to demonstrate that a part of the grant has\nbeen transferred to third-party users, it is presumed, on the basis of facts\navailable, that this part of the grant confers a benefit to the exporter as a\ngeneral subsidy which benefits the company\u2019s activities as a whole. This is the\ncase here.\n(455)\u00a0\u00a0 Two sampled cooperating\nexporters claim that the Golden Sun programme is not specific because the\nrelevant requirements in the Chinese legislation are objective and all\nenterprises meeting them can benefit from the programme, and eligibility is\nopen to all companies, whether or not manufacturers of the product concerned.\nThe Commission refers to its finding of specificity in Recital (247) showing\nthat the conditions and selection criteria are not objective and do not apply\nautomatically. The relevant required criteria confirm that the programme is\nlimited only to the limited subset of enterprises able to fulfil them, namely\nthose with a substantial installed capacity of at least 300kWh and with\nsubstantial assets of at least RMB 100 million. The selection criteria also\nrefer to the need for the recipient enterprises to be included in the local\nGolden Sun demonstration project implementation plan, and the investigation has\nestablished that the inclusion in these local plans depend on a discretionary\ndecision of the competent authorities not transparent and not based on\nobjective criteria. The Commission adds that eligible \u201cdistributed solar\nsystems\u201d rely on the manufacture and supply of solar-powered generating\nequipment the bulk of which is made by solar modules and cells. Therefore,\ncontrary to the arguments of the sampled exporters this scheme is also specific\nin that only producers of solar systems, or in other words producers of the\nproduct concerned, are in practice eligible for the benefits under this\nprogramme either directly in their quality as project owners or indirectly in\ntheir alleged quality as suppliers of the product concerned to projects owners.\nTherefore, also considering the absence of cooperation of the GOC that has\nfailed to provide all the budget documents requested by the Commission (see\nRecitals (234)-(239)), it is concluded that this programme is also de facto specific\nunder Article 4(2)(c) of the basic Regulation because mainly producers of\nthe product concerned in fact benefit directly or indirectly from this\nprogramme. The subsidy is also used by a limited number of enterprises (the\nproducers of the product concerned), or is used predominantly or\ndisproportionately by these firms, since they are only a subset of the allegedly\npotential recipients but seem to receive all the funding.\n3.5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direct Tax Exemption and\nReduction programmes\n3.5.5.1.\u00a0 The two free/three half\nprogramme for foreign invested enterprises\n(456)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC reiterates its\nargument that the programme concerning foreign invested enterprises (FIEs)\nalleged in the complaint was terminated as of 2013. The Commission notes that\nthe investigation period ends well before the year 2013 and thus benefits\ngranted under this programme during the IP are countervailable. This is\nconfirmed by the finding of the investigation, which has found benefits\nconferred during the IP under this programme to several sampled cooperating\nexporters. The benefits conferred under the programme, even if the programme\nwas terminated in 2013, also continue in the future.\n(457)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC and one sampled cooperating exporter further claim that the variant scheme\nfor High and New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs) cannot be countervailed on the\nbasis of Article 10(1) of the basic Regulation as it was not alleged in the\ncomplaint. The Commission refers to its detailed rebuttal of this argument\ncontained in recital (286). The Commission also recalls that the GOC has\ndecided not to cooperate during the investigation concerning the variant of\nthis programme. In addition to these elements, the Commission notes that the\ncomplaint lists other preferential direct tax schemes for HNTEs in addition to\nthe two free/three half variant for FIEs (section 4.2.5.1 of the complaint),\nthat is either the tax reductions for HNTEs (section 4.2.5.9 of the complaint)\nor the preferential tax programmes for FIEs recognised as HTNE (section 4.2.5.8\nof the complaint). Therefore, this programme may also be considered to have a\nvery close nexus with either or both of these other alleged tax programmes in\nthat it concerns a reduction of the direct tax rate and is specifically\ntargeting the same set of beneficiaries HNTEs. Once again, cooperation by the\nGOC could have allowed the Commission to assess properly and thoroughly all the\nelements that relate to the nexus with the programmes alleged in the complaint\nand to fill any information gaps that are present in the complaint, which is\nbased on the prima facie evidence reasonably available to the\ncomplainant. On the basis of these arguments, the Commission restates that\ncountervailing this programme is fully in line with Article 10(1) of the basic\nRegulation, as this provision allows for the investigation of any \u201calleged\nsubsidy\u201d identified by the complainant, not just to a specific programme. In\nthis case, the alleged subsidy, the foregoing of government tax revenue\ntargeting the same type of beneficiaries, is common to all the programmes in\nquestion.\n(458)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the\ncalculation of the subsidy amount, two sampled cooperating exporters argue that\nthe Commission has erroneously used the full year figures in the 2011 Annual\nIncome Tax Return despite the fact that the IP covers half of 2011 and half of\n2012, and this violates the calculation method in Section E(a)(ii) of the\nCommission Guidelines for the calculation of the amount of subsidy in\ncountervailing duty investigations, OJ C 394, 17.12.1998, p. 6. One of these\nexporters further claims that, since the full 2012 tax return was not available\nat the time of verification, for 2012 the Commission should have based its\ncalculation on the quarterly income tax declarations concerning the first half\nof the year 2012 collected on spot and/or on the profit and loss tables for\n2012, which show that the company was in a loss position.\n(459)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission refers to recital (300) and restates the importance that the\ncalculation of benefit be based on final audited tax returns for a certain tax\nyear. The Commission adds that the final settlement of the 2011 tax return\nduring the IP makes any benefit claimed on the return final, further underlying\nthe correctness of its approach. The Commission\ncannot base its calculation on quarterly tax returns, because these returns\nreflect the on-going provisional situation at the time of filing and by\ndefinition do not take into account the final consolidated situation of the\nannual tax year. The objective of these returns is to ensure liquidity to the\ngovernment in case taxes are provisionally due, but they reflect only the\npartial situation at the time of filing. It may well be the case that if the\ncompany turns a substantial profit in the last two quarters of the year that\nmore than offset the losses in the initial quarters, then it will report a\ntaxable profit on the final tax return. Therefore while the provisional tax\nreturns in 2012 give a partial indication of the situation of the exporter at\nthe time of filing and explains why the Commission collected them, their\nrelevance is not absolute as it cannot be excluded that the situation at the\nend of the fiscal year as shown on the definitive return is completely\ndifferent. As for the profit and loss tables concerning the year 2012, the\nCommission notes that financial accounting does not always correspond to the\nfiscal accounting and it may well be that the obligation to report items of\nincome and loss for direct tax purposes may substantially differ from the\nreporting obligations for accounting purposes. There may also be adjustment for\ntax purposes that are not fully reflected on the financial accounts. In sum,\nthe fact that a company is in a loss position in its financial accounts does\nnot necessarily mean that it will be in the same loss position in its final tax\nreturn. Based on these arguments the Commission confirms that the subsidy\ncalculation for direct tax schemes must necessarily rely on the final figures\nappearing on the final audited income tax return and not on periodical tax\nstatement or on definitive or trial accounting statements.\n3.5.5.2.\u00a0 Tax offset for research and\ndevelopment by FIEs\n(460)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claims to be\ninformed for the first time that the Commission is countervailing an R&D\nprogramme which is not a replacement programme of the R&D programme for\nFIEs alleged in the complaint. The GOC relies on similar arguments used for the\nprevious scheme as explained in recital (457) and argues that countervailing\nthis scheme violates Articles 11 and 13 of the WTO SCM Agreement. The GOC goes\non to claim that the R&D programme for FIEs was terminated in 2008 and the\nnew R&D programme included in the new Chinese Enterprise Income Tax Law is\nnot a replacement programme since it does not refer to FIEs and it does not\nrequire the R&D expense to be 10% higher than the previous year.\n(461)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission notes that\nthe GOC did not provide information on this scheme in the reply to the\nquestionnaire reply and to the deficiency letter, but that this scheme was\nalready countervailed in previous investigations (see recital (310)). However,\nthe Commission also notes that this programme was discussed during the verification\nvisit with the GOC and that the relevant implementation provisions were\ncollected as an exhibit (they had also been submitted by one of the sampled\nexporters). Therefore the GOC\u2019s allegation that it is the first time that it\nwas informed of the potential countervailability of this programme is unfounded,\nalso given that several sampled cooperating exporters with which the GOC\ncoordinated its reply have reported this programme in their questionnaire\nreplies. The GOC was fully aware of this fact since it inspected several times\nthe non-confidential file. The findings of the investigation show that this\nprogramme is countervailable (recitals (310) - (314) above). The Commission\nadds that this programme is clearly a replacement of the previous programme targeting\nFIEs, because of the close nexus shown by the same form and amount of the tax\nbenefit (additional tax offset deductible from the taxable base), the same\nratio and the same underlying situation (eligible costs for R&D activities)\nwith only slight variations. These slight variations were brought in line with\nthe reform of the new EIT law in 2008, but the nature and substance of the\nprogramme remains fundamentally the same. The Commission also refers to the\narguments on the standard of initiation set out in recital (457).\n(462)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC and one sampled cooperating exporter also claim that this programme is not\nspecific because the Commission has not demonstrated that obtaining the\ncertificate of HNTE is limited to certain enterprises. The Commission refers to\nits explanation in recital (313) above and in recitals (321) and (325)\nconcerning another tax programme for the HNTEs. The Commission adds that the\nimplementing rules for the application of this programme (see recital (321)) here\nfurther confirm the specificity finding of HNTEs as only companies in sectors\nsupported by governmental policies and eligible under the relevant Government\nCatalogues and Guidelines can obtain the relevant certificate. For instance,\nonly enterprises engaged in an R&D project prescribed in the High and New\nTech Fields under the Key Support of the State and the Guidelines for Current\nPriorities for Development in Key Sectors of the Hi-Tech Industry of 2007 by\nthe NDRC or R&D activities included in the scope of the Notice of the State\nCouncil on Implementing the Several Supporting Policies for the Outline of the\nState Medium and Long-term Scientific and Technological Development\n(2006-2020), No. 6 [2006] of the State Council) can obtain this certificate. It\nis therefore clear that this tax programme is limited only to those specific\ncompanies in the relevant sectors and R&D activities supported by the GOC,\nincluding companies in the encouraged PV sector.\n(463)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the\ncalculation of the subsidy amount, two sampled cooperating exporters argue that\nthe Commission has erroneously used the figures in their 2011 Annual Income Tax\nReturn whereas the IP covers half of 2011 and half of 2012, and that this\nviolates the calculation method in Section E(a)(iii) of the Commission Guidelines\nfor the calculation of the amount of subsidy in countervailing duty\ninvestigation of 1998. The Commission refers to all the arguments developed in\nRecital (459) which are equally pertinent to dismiss this claim for this\nprogramme. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the argument concerning a\npurported tax loss position in the 2012 tax year has limited or no relevance,\nbecause a tax deduction can be carried forward by five additional tax years and\nset off against any taxable income declared in the five following years.\nTherefore, even if the Commission would accept that these companies have made a\ntax loss in the year 2012 or the final audited 2012 tax return were available\nand would show a tax loss (which is not the case here), it would still take account\nof the benefits under this programme as it could not be excluded that the\nbenefits from the tax deduction accrued in 2012 would be used as soon as the\ncompany would report taxable income in any of the following five tax years.\n3.5.5.3.\u00a0 Tax reduction for high and\nNew Technology Enterprises involved in designated projects\n(464)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC and one cooperating\nexporter argue that this programme is not specific, that specificity analysis\nis not based on any facts, and that the requirements to obtain HTNE states\nshould be considered objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility\nfor the subsidy and the eligibility for this programme is automatic. With\nregard to the specificity finding concerning the limitation of this programme\nand of the R&D tax offset also to HNTEs, the Commission refers to its\nexplanation in recitals (321) and (325), and also to recital (462) equally\napplicable for this programme. The Commission restates that in particular the\nimplementing measures and documents listed above show that the application of\nthis programme and the recognition of HNTE status, far from being available to\nall enterprises and relying on objective criteria, is limited only to certain\nsectors and enterprises supported by the GOC on the basis of criteria that do\nnot appear to be objective or neutral. The eligibility for benefits under this\nprogramme is also not automatic but depends on the granting of HNTE\ncertificate, which is released after a discretionary procedure by the competent\nauthorities and is therefore not automatic.\n(465)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating exporter\nclaims that the Commission erroneously calculated the subsidy benefit from this\nprogramme because it used the 2011 audited tax return whereas the quarterly tax\ndeclarations for Q1 and Q2 of 2012 were available and collected at\nverification, and in any event the Commission could have requested copy of the\nfinal annual income tax declaration for 2012 as soon as it would have been\navailable. This exporter also argues that if the 2011 tax return is used to calculate\nthe subsidy benefit, then the 2011 company turnover and not the turnover during\nthe IP should be used. The Commission refers to its explanation in recital (459)\nabove. The Commission further notes that in its pre-verification letter to the\nsampled exporters, including the exporter in question, it had specifically\nrequested the original full tax statements/returns for fiscal years covering\nthe IP and the three preceding years. Therefore this cooperating exporter could\nand should have submitted the 2012 return as soon as available, and the\nCommission notes that it has not done so even as recently as it sent its\ncomments to the disclosure document. With regard to the argument that the\nCommission should use the 2011 turnover to calculate the benefit, it notes that\nthe amount of benefit from the 2011 tax return is considered to be reasonably\nreflective of the situation in the IP, especially as the payment of tax for\n2011 was due in the IP (month) and final data for 2012 were not available at\nthe time of verification. In any event, the Commission cannot use different\ndenominators to measure different subsidies, otherwise the percentage figures\nwill not be comparable and consistency in the calculation is not guaranteed.\nThe Commission finally adds that it does not have verified figures for the 2011\nturnover but it only has verified turnover figures for the IP.\n3.5.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments of parties\nconcerning the provision of land use rights for less than adequate remuneration\n(466)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission did not determine the specificity under Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the\nASCM and did not clearly substantiate its determination of specificity on the\nbasis of positive evidence, as required by Article 2.4 of the ASCM. According\nto GOC the Commission had not provided any factual evidence as to which are the\ncertain industries that are accorded LURs at preferential rates and the legal\nbasis of its assessment that the industry producing solar cells and modules\nforms part of these industries. One exporting producer made similar claim. These\nclaims had to be rejected. The Commission cited in the recital (364) above the\nexamples of the LUR notices where the relevant authorities limited the\npotential buyers for the set price to the photovoltaic industry and set price\nlimits on the LUR purchased by the sampled exporting producers. In the absence\nof any other information requested from the GOC and, given the government\nsupport to the PV industry, along with discretionary and non-transparent nature\nof the allocation of land-use rights, the Commission considered that this\ninformation establish the existence of specificity. \n(467)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC and several\nexporting producers claimed that the LUR benchmark selected by the Commission\nis not adequate. The GOC also claimed that the Commission did not do its best\nto identify a benchmark that approximates the market conditions that would\nprevail in the absence of the distortion as required by the WTO Panel ruling inthe\nUS \u2013 Definitive Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties on Certain Products\nfrom China[101] . This claim had to be rejected. The Commission indeed looked in detail in the various indicators\nand compared Taiwan and PRC as a whole as well as individual Chinese provinces\nconcerned. After such an analysis the Commission considers Taiwan as an\nappropriate benchmark because of the totality of the information on the file\ni.e. (i) the comparable level of economic development and economic structure prevailing\nin Taiwan and big majority of the Chinese provinces and cities where the co -operating\nexporting producers are established, (ii) the physical proximity of China and\nTaiwan, (iii) the high degree of industrial infrastructure that both Taiwan and\nthese Chinese provinces have, (iv) the strong economic ties and cross border\ntrade between Taiwan and the PRC, (v) the high density of population in the\nChinese provinces concerned and in Taiwan, (vi) the similarity between the type\nof land and transactions used for constructing the relevant benchmark in Taiwan\nwith those in the PRC and (vii) the common demographic, linguistic and cultural\ncharacteristics in both Taiwan and the PRC. Furthermore, most of the provinces\nconcerned are considered top manufacturing provinces in the PRC. Although the\nGDP per capita of Taiwan and these provinces and cities is not identical, the\nGDP of these provinces and cities has grown rapidly in recent years i.e. they\nare catching up with Taiwan. In addition, recent data suggest that the both PRC\nas a whole, as well as the provinces and cities concerned have much higher GDP\ngrowth rate than Taiwan, i.e. they are catching up very fast. However, it is\nimportant to note that the exact comparison made between the GDP of a\nnon-market economy (the PRC) and the GDP of a well- established market economy\n(Taiwan) is not a decisive fact because it is normal for a non-market economy\nto lag behind a functioning market economy in terms of GDP. In addition, many\nother factors e.g. planning rules, environmental policy may affect the supply\nand demand of industrial land. The real issue is what would be the 'prevailing\nmarket conditions' with regard to LUR in the Chinese provinces concerned if it\nwas a functioning market economy and on the basis of all evidence, it is\nconcluded that they would be very similar to those of Taiwan.\n3.5.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other comments\n(468)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant claimed that\nthe Commission should disclose additional subsidy schemes found during the\ninvestigation and also establish subsidy margins for such schemes not mentioned\nin the complaint. In this respect it is noted that the all the subsidies which\nmet the legal requirements for initiation were investigated by the Commission.\n(469)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant claimed that\nthe Commission should have established a subsidy margin with regards to the\nprovision of polysilicon for less than adequate remuneration on the basis of\nthe information in the complaint and on the basis of the US DOC findings in\nsimilar PV case. The Commission investigated this programme and, on the basis\nof the information received from sampled exporting producers and the GOC,\nconcluded that there was no benefit from this programme during the IP,\nprincipally because import prices of polysilicon were lower than prices charged\nby Chinese suppliers. It is noted that the investigation period for the US case\nand for the case at hand were different.\n(470)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant also claimed\nthat the Commission should have established a subsidy margin with regards to provision\nof electricity for less than adequate remuneration. This claim had to be\nrejected. The Commission did not find sufficient evidence that the sampled\nexporting producers, with the exception of LDK, benefited from preferential\nprovision of electricity in the IP.\n(471)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission\u2019s calculation methodology resulted in the \u201cdouble counting at the level\nof the ant-dumping and anti-subsidy margin calculations\u201d. According to the GOC\nthe Commission should have deducted the subsidy margin calculated for the\nexport credit insurance programme from the dumping margins on the basis that it\nis an export subsidy. The GOC also claimed that the Commission should have\ndeducted from the dumping margin the subsidy margins calculated on the basis of\nout-of-country benchmarks. It reasoned that \u201cpart of dumping calculated based\non an analogue country normal value is actually same subsidisation that has\nbeen countervailed in the parallel anti-subsidy investigation\". Neither\nof these claims would have any impact\non the level of the resulting measures as in\nthe present case the combined duties are limited by the injury margin. The GOC\nalso confirmed this in the comments to definitive disclosure\ndocument. Therefore it was not considered necessary to address the\nsubstance of these claims.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amount of countervailable\nsubsidies\n(472)\u00a0\u00a0 The\namounts of countervailable subsidies in accordance with the provisions of the\nbasic Regulation, expressed ad valorem, for the investigated companies are set\nout in the table below:\n Exporting producer || Definitive subsidy margin \n Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

They\nconstitute the Union industry within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the basic\nRegulation and will hereafter be referred to as \u2018the Union industry\u2019. The\nInstitutions have verified claims by interested parties that there was a higher\nnumber; this verification has revealed that the alleged additional producers\nwere in reality mostly exporting producers, importers related to those,\ndistributors and installers. \n(476)\u00a0\u00a0 All available information\nconcerning the Union industry, including information provided in the complaint,\nmacroeconomic data provided by Europressedienst, an independent consultancy\nfirm (\u2018the consultant\u2019) and the verified questionnaire responses of the sampled\nUnion producers were used to establish the total Union production in the IP\nsince complete public information on production was not available. As modules\nand cells are imported into the Union under customs headings covering other\nproducts not subject to the present investigation and the reported import\nvolumes are in tonnes, Eurostat could not be used to determine import volumes\nand values, which were based on the data provided by the consultant. When\npossible, the data received from the consultant were cross-checked with other\navailable public sources and with the verified questionnaire replies.\n(477)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the total\nUnion production was estimated to be around 4 GW for modules and 2 GW for cells\nduring the IP.\n(478)\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital (21)\nabove, nine Union producers were selected in the sample representing 18 % - 21\n% of the total Union production of modules and 17 % - 24 % of the total Union\nproduction of cells. \n(479)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe fact that data provided by the consultant were used to determine, inter\nalia, Union production, Union production capacity as well as other\nmacroeconomic injury indicators concerning the Union industry and import data.\nThese parties questioned the independence of the consultant alleging that it was\nlinked to the complainant. They also requested clarifications on what basis the\nconsultant was selected by the Commission and questioned its expertise in\ncollecting economic data related to the PV sector. In this regard, it was\nclaimed that the Commission should have based its findings on data from other\navailable sources, in particular known research institutes. Lastly, a reference\nto Best Practices for the submission of economic evidence and data collection\nin cases concerning the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and in merger\ncases was made by AFASE to contest the reliability of the data submitted by the\nconsultant.\n(480)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged links\nbetween the consultant and the complainant, the relevant interested parties did\nnot submit any evidence showing that such links existed. Likewise, the\ninvestigation did not bring into light any evidence of a relationship going\nbeyond purely commercial character. Following final disclosure one interested\nparty claimed that there were indications that the prima facie evidence\nprovided by the complainant Union industry in the complaint were based on data\nprovided by the same consultant. Even though it is acknowledged that findings\nfor some indicators were indeed similar to the evidence provided in the complaint\nthat does not necessarily mean that they were established on the basis of one\nsource only. In this regard, the complaint provides the various sources used. The\nclaims in this regard had therefore to be rejected. \n(481)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission considered it appropriate to make use of this consultancy in the\ncurrent investigation, due to the unavailability from other publicly available\nsources of the necessary macroeconomic data covering the total Union market as\nwell as import data. Prior to selecting Europressedienst the Commission\nassessed the methodology used by the consultant for the collection of the\nrelevant data as well as the consultant\u2019s ability to provide the necessary data\nseparately for all product types and for the entire period considered.\n(482)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nduring the investigation, data provided by the consultant were counter checked\nwhen possible with other available sources and were confirmed. In this respect,\nit is noted that several research companies specialised in collecting PV\nstatistics exist on the market and the figures reported are almost never\nidentical. This is due to the fact that precise figures are difficult to derive\nfor any research institute and therefore the reported PV market indicators will\nalways be based on estimates, independently of the provider of such figure. In\nthis context, the cross-checking exercise carried out by the Commission\nconsisted of comparing the trends of the data received from the consultant with\nthe trends of the same data published by other research companies, the\nCommission's Joint Research Center ('JRC') and the EPIA on the same topics, when\navailable. No significant differences were noticed as a result of the\ncross-checking exercise and the trends of the indicators for which the\ncross-checking was done were similar. Provisional anti-dumping findings were\ntherefore not solely based on data provided by the consultant but also on the\nCommission\u2019s own analysis and assessment of these data. In addition, as\nmentioned above in recital (8), after the imposition of provisional anti-dumping\nmeasures a verification visit took place at the premises of the consultant. The\nCommission carried out the on-the-spot check at the consultant\u2019s premises to\nverify the reliability of the methodology and data supplied. The on-the-spot\ncheck was carried out as a follow-up of the cross-checking of the data by the\nCommission and to obtain further assurance as regards the reliability and\nquality of the data and related methodology. The on-the-spot verification was\nconsidered appropriate in application of the principle of good administration, even\nif those data were not provided by an interested party but by a consultant. As\na result, the Commission was further reassured of the reliability of the data\nprovided by the consultant.\n(483)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nparty claimed that the methodology of cross checking used by the Commission was\nnot explained in sufficient detail and requested that the other sources used\nfor the cross checking should be disclosed. This party argued further that the\nmethodology used was in any event invalid insofar that only trends of various\nsources were compared and not absolute values. \n(484)\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the other sources\nused to cross check the data provided by the consultant are concerned, these\nwere reports published by the JRC and by 'EPIA on the same topics. As for the\ncomparison of data with other sources it is noted that they showed not only\nsimilar trends but also similar magnitudes. Therefore, it was concluded that\nthe methodology used was appropriate and the claims in this regard were\nrejected.\n(485)\u00a0\u00a0 The consultant\u2019s main\nactivity is collecting data linked to the PV sector and developing an\nup-to-date database of companies active in the PV market.. These data are\npublished in specialised photovoltaic magazines and also used by individual\ncompanies for which it carries out specialised research. The database developed\nby Europressedienst is regularly up-dated and re-published. In addition, the\nconsultant has several years of experience in this sector. More precisely, the\nmethodology of the consultant is to collect, cross-check and agglomerate\ninformation using various sources available in the market. To this end, it\ncollects the data via standard questionnaires sent to the companies listed in\nthe database or via phone, especially from the Union producers, or during the\nspecialised fairs, notably from producers in third countries. When the\ninformation cannot be obtained through the channels just mentioned,\nEuropressedienst checks the financial reports of companies in the photovoltaic\nsector or co-operates on a freely basis with other research institutes with a\nview to obtaining or cross-checking the data. It was verified that these\nsources were used by the consultant in its daily activity. In the light of the\nabove, it was considered appropriate to make use of Europressedienst\u2019s services\nin the present investigation and the parties\u2019 claims in this respect were\ntherefore rejected.\n(486)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the Best\nPractices for the submission of economic evidence issued by the competent\nservice of the Commission (\u2018the Best Practices\u2019), the following remarks should\nbe made. First of all, it is a document that cannot engage the Commission, as\nit has not been adopted by the College, but published by the competent service\nwith the purpose of providing recommendations to parties as to how to present\neconomic evidence. Secondly, the Best Practices concern the submission of\neconomic analysis and data used in competition investigations pursuant to Article\n101 and 102 TFEU and in merger cases. The applicable rules, standards of proof\nand investigating powers of the Commission in those competition cases cannot be\ncompared to trade defence investigations, to which an entirely different set of\nrules applies. \n(487)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe methodology used by the consultant claiming that it would not reach\nrecognised scientific standards. However, as mentioned above in recital (481) above,\nthe methodology was assessed and the resulting data were cross-checked and\nverified and as a result were considered in line with other published data and\ntherefore reasonably reliable. Specific points raised\nby certain interested parties, were clarified bilaterally and made available in\nthe open file of the investigation for inspection by interested parties.\n(488)\u00a0\u00a0 The CCCME argued that the\nmethodology of data aggregation was not clarified. This claim was rejected as\nthe relevant information was made available to all interested parties in the\nfile open for inspection by interested parties.\n(489)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties reiterated their concerns on the selection of the consultant by\nthe Commission and on the quality of the data supplied. In this respect it was\nclaimed that the consultant\u2019s data can be ordered and purchased on an ad hoc\nbasis to meet the specifically identified requests of potential clients and may therefore not be objective. In addition, CCCME\ncontested that the data collected by the consultant can be considered as\npositive evidence within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation\nsince the data was to a large extent based on assumptions and estimations.\nFurthermore, it was claimed that the data supplied were not sufficiently\nsupported by evidence in the file and that they were not of an affirmative,\nobjective and verifiable character.\n(490)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of these claims,\nreference is made to the recitals (481) - (482) above where additional\ninformation was provided regarding the selection of the consultant. In\naddition, it is noted that the Commission hired the consultant on the basis of\nthe best available information at that moment in time and in full compliance\nwith the Commission Financial Regulation applicable to the procedure.\nFurthermore, it is recalled that the consultant\u2019s capacity to provide all the\nneeded data in due time was of great importance since the Commission was bound\nto statutory deadlines for the publication of the provisional findings in the\non-going investigation. \n(491)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the quality of\nthe data supplied and whether it can be considered as positive evidence in\naccordance with Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation, as mentioned above in\nrecital (482), the consultant\u2019s methodology for collecting the data was\nexamined and it was assessed that it was of satisfactory quality. In addition,\nas also mentioned above in the same recital, the data supplied by the\nconsultant were cross-checked when possible with other sources and found to be\nreasonably accurate. Finally, it is noted that the consultant has one database\nwhich is up-dated on a regular basis, independently of the clients\u2019 needs and\nrequests. The same database is used to aggregate and deliver PV statistics to\nvarious clients, and therefore the allegation that data were not objective had\nto be rejected. \n(492)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\ninterested party claimed that the Commission had not disclosed the sources, the\nmethodology used and the companies with which the consultant co-operated to\ncompile the macroeconomic data supplied. Another interested party reiterated\nthat the methodology applied by the consultant suggests inaccurate results.\nSeveral interested parties requested further information concerning the\nmethodology used by the consultant such as the average response rates to the\nquestionnaires/interviews, the percentage of data collected through each\nchannel, how these were verified, the approximations/assumptions used to\ngenerate the data, the number of companies for which approximations were made,\nand at least a range of the number of employees of the consultant.\n(493)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of these claims, it\nis noted that subsequently to the imposition of the provisional findings, the\nCommission provided interested parties with the methodology and with the\nsources used by the consultant in aggregating the data and addressed specific\nquestions of the interested parties in this regard following the provisional anti-dumping\ndisclosure. The additional requests for information of the interested parties\nconcerned following final disclosure are considered to be covered by the\ninformation made available after the imposition of provisional duties to the\nextent that the confidentiality limitations allowed it. In addition, it is\nunderlined that the Commission verified on-the-spot the way the data had been\ncollected and aggregated by the consultant and the relevant underlying\nassumptions for aggregating the data. The results of the verification were\nsatisfactory and the Commission was reassured of the reasonableness of the\nunderlying assumptions and of the quality of the data supplied by the\nconsultant. Furthermore, the parties did not contest the data as such. \n(494)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nfinal disclosure, another party requested clarifications with regard to the\nnumber of Union producers considered by the consultant in its data collection\nand the overlap between these and the around 215 Union producers known to the\nCommission. In this respect, it is clarified that the Union producers\nconsidered by the consultant are largely the same than the ones known to\nrepresent the Union industry in this investigation mentioned in recital (475)\nabove. \n(495)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that the Commission has conducted the injury analysis in an\ninconsistent manner since it was done separately for modules and cells while\nthe injury and subsidy margin calculations had been established as a weighted\naverage for modules and cells together. In this respect, it is noted that while\nindicators were shown separately for each product type, the conclusions reached\nfor each indicator refer to the product under investigation as a whole. It is\nalso recalled that modules and cells are one single product and therefore the subsidy\nmargins and the injury elimination level were established on this basis.\nTherefore, the claim was rejected.\n(496)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, another party\nclaimed that the calculation of the values of macroeconomic indicators during\nthe IP was wrongly based on a simple average of the years 2011 and 2012 as such\nmethodology would not be objective and would not lead to results reflecting the\nreality during the IP. It is clarified that a simple average of the data was\nonly used in case where there were similar trends in the periods concerned. In\ncase trends were different, the methodology was adapted accordingly by taking\ninto consideration market reality. The party concerned did not develop to what extend\nthe results of the methodology used would not reflect market reality. These claims\nwere therefore rejected.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the\nrelevant Union market\n(497)\u00a0\u00a0 Part of the Union industry\nis vertically integrated and a substantial part of the Union industry\u2019s\nproduction was destined for captive use, in particular for the production of\ncells.\n(498)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish\nwhether or not the Union industry suffered material injury and to determine\nconsumption and other economic indicators, it was examined whether and to what\nextent the subsequent use of the Union industry\u2019s production of the like\nproduct (\u2018captive\u2019 use) had to be taken into account.\n(499)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide a\npicture as complete as possible of the situation of the Union industry, data\nhave been analysed for the entire activity of the like product and it was\nsubsequently determined whether the production was destined for captive use or\nfree market. \n(500)\u00a0\u00a0 It was found that the\nfollowing economic indicators related to the Union industry should be examined\nby referring to the total activity (including the captive use of the industry):\nconsumption, sales volume, production, production capacity, capacity\nutilisation, growth, investments, stocks, employment, productivity, cash flow,\nreturn on investment, ability to raise capital and magnitude of the amount of\nthe countervailable subsidies. This is because the investigation showed that\nthose indicators could reasonably be examined by referring to the whole\nactivity as the production destined for captive use was equally affected by the\ncompetition of imports from the country concerned. Hereinafter the captive and\nthe free market together are referred to as \u2018total market\u2019.\n(501)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards profitability,\nthe analysis focused on the free market since prices in the captive market were\nfound not to always reflect market prices and did not have an impact on this\nindicator. \n(502)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties argued that\nthe injury should have been assessed separately for the captive and for the\nfree market. One party argued that data relating to cells destined for captive\nuse should have been excluded from the injury assessment on the grounds that\nthey were not affected by the subsidised imports.\n(503)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has shown that vertically integrated Union producers were forced\nto import subsidised products (cells) and to cease production of these products\nat cost above the import price, as a consequence of the price pressure exerted\nby the subsidised imports. Furthermore, the investigation also revealed that\nthe free market and the captive market displayed the same trends in prices,\nwhich also showed that they were equally affected by the imports concerned. \n(504)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties reiterated that the Commission failed to provide an adequate and\nreasoned analysis of the captive market or why a separate analysis had not been\ncarried out. One party claimed that no information was provided about the\nsignificance of the Union production destined for captive use. In addition, it\nwas claimed that recital (106) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation\nconcluding that prices in the captive market did not always reflect market\nprices, contradicted the conclusions set out in recital (503) above that the\nfree market and captive market displayed similar trends in prices.\n(505)\u00a0\u00a0 It is firstly noted that\nrecital (105) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation sets out the reasons\nas to why it was considered appropriate to examine injury indicators (except\nfor profitability) referring to the total activity of the Union industry\nincluding captive use. In this regard it is recalled, as set out in the same\nrecital, that the investigation revealed that the production destined for\ncaptive use was equally affected by the competition of the imports from the\nPRC, which as such was not contested by the interested parties concerned.\nTherefore, the claim that no explanations were given as to why no separate\nanalysis took place had to be rejected. Likewise, as it follows from this\nconclusion, it had also to be rejected that such separate analysis of the\ncaptive market should have taken place. \n(506)\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, while on the basis\nof the above the significance of the Union production destined for captive use\nwas not considered an essential element, it is noted that the Union production\nof cells destined for captive use represented about half of the total\nproduction in the IP. Finally, it is clarified that the fact that prices in the\ncaptive market do not reflect the prices in the free market is not necessarily\ncontradicting the fact that both prices followed the same trends, as they may\nstill be at different levels or price movements may be at a higher or lower\ndegree and thus depicting a different picture. On the basis of the above, the\nclaims concerning the captive market were rejected.\n(507)\u00a0\u00a0 The parties concerned did\nnot provide any information which could have devaluated this finding. On these\ngrounds, the claims in this respect were rejected\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(508)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union consumption\ncomprised the total volume of imports of the product concerned and the volume\nof total sales of the like product in the Union, including those destined for\ncaptive use. No complete data for the total sales of the Union industry on the\nUnion market were available. Furthermore, imports into the Union were\nregistered under customs headings covering other products not subject to the\npresent investigation and the reported Eurostat import volumes were in tonnes.\nConsequently, Eurostat could not be used to determine import volumes and\nvalues. Therefore, the Union consumption was based on data provided by the consultant\nas described above and cross-checked with public sources such as market\nresearches and publicly available studies and with the verified questionnaire\nreplies. \n(509)\u00a0\u00a0 Union\nconsumption developed as follows:\nTable\n1- a\nUnion\nconsumption for modules (in MW)\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2009 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2010 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2011 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Total market || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 465 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12 198 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19 878 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17 538 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index (2009=100) || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 223 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 364 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 321 \nSource: Europressedienst \nTable\n1-b\nUnion\nconsumption for cells (in MW)\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2009 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2010 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2011 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Total market || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 155 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 327 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 315 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 021 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index (2009=100) || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 154 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 200 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 187 \nSource: Europressedienst\n(510)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe period considered, the total Union consumption increased by 221 % for\nmodules and by 87 % for cells between 2009 and the IP, but decreased in the IP\ncompared to 2011. In overall terms the Union consumption of the product under\ninvestigation grew significantly when compared to its 2009 level. \n(511)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat data concerning the Union consumption of the product under investigation\nvary significantly, depending on the source used.

In view of the explanations\nand conclusions reached in the recitals (481) to (483) above concerning the\nreliability of the data provided by the consultant used in the investigation,\nthis argument was rejected. \n(512)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party argued that\nUnion consumption should not be established by merely adding up available\nmodule production capacities in the Union and that rather the module consumption\nfor the Union\u2019s industry own projects should be deducted therefrom. This\nargument was rejected, as consumption of modules was established on the basis\nof newly installed capacities in the Union. This is a common practice for\ndetermining the module consumption. For cells, the consumption was determined\non the basis of the Union production of modules.\n(513)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party argued that\nthat the methodology described by the consultant admits the difficulty to\nestablish reliable consumption figures. It was further argued that import data\nas well as export sales from the Union industry were either based on\nunverifiable estimations or incomplete data and that the cross checking of the\nCommission was not sufficient to allow the conclusion that those data were\nindeed reliable and accurate. \n(514)\u00a0\u00a0 As already mentioned above\nin recitals (481) to (482) above the quality of the data and the methodologies\nused to collect them was verified by the Commission during an on-spot visit on\nthe basis of which it was considered that the methodologies used were\nappropriate and the results accurate and reasonably reliable. This claim was\ntherefore rejected. \n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country\nconcerned\n4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share of\nthe imports from the country concerned\n(515)\u00a0\u00a0 Imports\ninto the Union from the country concerned developed as described in the tables\nbelow.

This led to significant market share increases of the imports from the\ncountry concerned into the Union. More specifically, the market shares of\nimports from the country concerned increased from [60 % - 65 %] to [78 % - 83 %]\nfor modules and from [5 % - 10 %] to [22 % - 27 %] for cells. In overall terms\nthe imports of the product concerned from the PRC increased significantly in terms\nof volume and market share between 2009 and the IP.\n(517)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nshould be noted that the increase in imports from the country concerned was\nmuch higher than the increase in the Union consumption for the product\nconcerned. Consequently, the exporting producers were able to benefit from\nUnion\u2019s growing consumption and their position on the market became stronger\ndue to larger market shares.\n(518)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat data concerning import volumes of the product under investigation vary\nsignificantly, depending on the source used. This party argued that reliable\ndata can only be established on the basis of the information gathered from\nspecialised institutions or research centres. In view of the explanations and\nconclusions reached in the recitals (481) to (483) above, concerning the reliability\nof the data used in the investigation, this argument was rejected.\n(519)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\ninterested party contested the methodology to determine the total import value\nfrom the PRC claiming that it had been based on transactions made at CIF level\nduty unpaid and it is therefore doubtful whether these transactions had been\ndestined for Union consumption. In respect of this claim, it is clarified that\nthe total import value from PRC as provided by the consultant had not been used\nin the findings and that only import volumes and import prices were determined\nduring the investigation.. As the methodology to determine import prices was\nnot contested as such by the interested party concerned reference is made to\nthe relevant findings in recitals (520) to (528) below. Therefore, the above\nclaim was rejected \n4.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of imports and price\nundercutting\n(520)\u00a0\u00a0 The average price of imports into the Union from the country\nconcerned developed as follows:\nTable\n3-a\nImport\nprice of modules from PRC (in EUR/kW)\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Import prices || 2 100 || 1 660 || 1 350 || 764 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 79 || 64 || 36 \nSource: Europressedienst and verified\nsample questionnaire replies\nTable\n3-b\nImport\nprice of cells from PRC (in EUR/kW)\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Import prices || 890 || 650 || 620 || 516 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 73 || 70 || 58 \nSource: Europressedienst and verified\nquestionnaire replies\n(521)\u00a0\u00a0 The average import price\nfrom the PRC dropped significantly over the period considered for modules and\ncells. For modules, the average import price decreased by 64 %, from 2100\nEUR/kW in 2009 to 764 EUR/kW in the IP. Likewise, the average import price of\ncells from PRC dropped by 42 %, from 890 EUR/kW to 516 EUR/kW. \n(522)\u00a0\u00a0 In overall terms, the price\nof the product concerned decreased significantly between 2009 and IP.\n(523)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating unrelated\nimporter claimed that import prices should have been established on the basis\nof its imports of the product concerned in the Union as provided by this\nimporter during the investigation. However, the data provided by this importer during\nthe investigation only represented a fraction of the total imports in the Union\nand no meaningful conclusions could be drawn as to the average import price of\nall imports from the PRC during the whole period under consideration covering\nseveral years on this basis. Therefore, this claim was rejected. \n(524)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe methodology to determine the prices was not explained, in particular as to\nhow the data of various sources had been merged and reconciled. In addition it\nwas argued that importation costs should have been based on the verified\ninformation collected during the investigation rather than on estimates. \n(525)\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that the\nmethodology made available to interested parties is sufficiently complete to\nunderstand as to how figures were established. As far as \u2018importation\u2019 cost is\nconcerned, it is clarified that an adjustment was made to on-the-spot-prices to\narrive to CIF prices. The estimation made was confirmed with the data collected\nduring the investigation.\n(526)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to determine price\nundercutting during the IP, the weighted average sales prices per product type\nof the sampled Union producers charged to unrelated customers on the Union\nmarket, adjusted to an ex-works level, were compared to the corresponding\nweighted average prices per product type of the imports from the cooperating\nChinese exporting producers to the first independent customer on the Union\nmarket, established on a CIF basis, with appropriate adjustments for post-importation\ncosts, i.e. custom clearance, handling and loading costs. The average\npost-importation costs of the sampled importers of modules were used when their\ndata were available.\n(527)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nprice comparison was made on a type-by-type basis for transactions at the same\nlevel of trade, duly adjusted where necessary, and after deduction of rebates\nand discounts. The result of the comparison, when expressed as a percentage of\nthe sampled Union producers\u2019 turnover during the IP, showed weighted average undercutting\nmargins within the ranges of [19,8 % - 37,5 %] for modules and [12,6 %-53,8 %]\nfor cells, and [19,8 %-37,5 %] in overall terms for the product concerned.\n(528)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nshould be noted that for one sampled exporting producer a negative price\nundercutting for cells was calculated. However, as the exported quantities were\nnot significant this cannot be considered representative. Moreover, another\nsampled exporting producer, contested the source for the adjustment for mono\ncells to multi cells, without however substantiating the argument. Indeed the\nspecific adjustment was not contested by the exporting producer nor did they\nprovide any new information or evidence, therefore this claim was rejected. \n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry\n4.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\n(529)\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant\nto Article 8(4) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined all relevant\neconomic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the Union\nindustry. As mentioned in recitals (14) to (22)\nabove, sampling was used for the examination of injury suffered by the Union\nindustry.\n(530)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of the\ninjury analysis, the Commission distinguished between macroeconomic and\nmicroeconomic injury indicators. The Commission analysed the macroeconomic\nindicators for the period considered on the basis of the data obtained from the\nindependent consultant as cross checked whenever possible with other available sources\nand from the sampled Union producers\u2019 verified questionnaire responses. The\nCommission analysed the microeconomic indicators on the basis of the sampled\nUnion producers\u2019 verified questionnaire responses.\n(531)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe purpose of this investigation, the following macroeconomic indicators were\nassessed on the basis of information relating to all producers of the like\nproduct in the Union: production, production capacity, capacity utilisation,\nsales volume, market share, growth, employment, productivity, magnitude of the\namount of countervailable subsidies and recovery from past subsidisation or\ndumping. \n(532)\u00a0\u00a0 The following microeconomic\nindicators were assessed on the basis of information relating to the sampled\nproducers of the like product in the Union: average unit prices, unit cost,\nlabour costs, inventories, profitability, cash flow, investments, return on\ninvestments and ability to raise capital.\n(533)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party claimed that market conditions of the product concerned differ\nper Member State and that therefore the injury analysis should be made at the\nlevel of each Member State separately. This allegation was not substantiated.\nIn addition, the investigation did not reveal any particular circumstances\njustifying an injury analysis per Member State. This claim was therefore\nrejected. \n(534)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties questioned the\noverall reliability of macroeconomic injury indicators used by the Commission\nfor the purpose of this investigation. They argued that the trends established\nfor a number of these indicators diverged from the trends for the same\nindicators established for the sampled Union producers. Particular reference\nwas made to Union production, productivity, sales, average labour costs and\nemployment. \n(535)\u00a0\u00a0 The macroeconomic indicators\nwere established in relation to all producers in the Union. In case the same\ndata are compiled in relation to individual Union producers or a group of Union\nproducers (i.e. the sampled Union producers), the trends are not necessarily\nidentical, as e.g. the weight of each company considered is not taken into\nconsideration in such comparison. Therefore, the results of the exercise of comparing\nthe macroeconomic indicators for all Union producers and those for sampled\nUnion producers are not necessarily meaningful and do not allow for the\nconclusion that the one or the other set of data is unreliable. In any event,\nwhen comparing the trends of the macroeconomic indicators of the Union industry\nwith the same consolidated indicators of the sampled Union producers,\ndifferences in trends can be noted for several indicators, such as the\nproduction, production capacity, sales volumes, employment and productivity of\nthe Union industry between 2011 and the IP. For all these indicators, the\nsampled Union producers performed better than the overall Union industry. The\nreason is that in the IP many Union producers, not included in the sample,\nstopped their production or became insolvent, thus having a negative impact on\nthe macroeconomic indicator calculated at the Union level. These claims were\ntherefore rejected.\n(536)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the conclusion as set out in recital (153) to the Provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation that the analysis of the situation of the Union industry showed a\nclear downward trend of all main injury indicators was based on data provided\nby the consultant. In this respect, it is clarified that, on the one hand, the\nmacroeconomic indicators, as listed in Tables 4-a to 6-c to the Provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation, were based on data obtained from the consultant and cross-checked\nwhen possible with other available sources. On the other hand, the microeconomic\nindicators, as listed in the Tables 7-a to 11-c to the Provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation, were based on data collected from the sampled Union producers and\nverified on-the-spot by the Commission. It should also be noted that\ndeterminant factors for the injurious situation of the Union industry such as\nthe profitability levels of the Union industry, the average sales price in the\nUnion as well as price undercutting calculations were based on data collected\nfrom the sampled Union producers and exporting producers as verified\non-the-spot. The above claim was therefore rejected.\n4.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macroeconomic indicators\n4.5.2.1.\u00a0 Production, production\ncapacity and capacity utilisation\n(537)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntotal Union production, production capacity and capacity utilisation developed as\nfollows over the period considered:\n Table 4-a \n Modules \u2013 production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (MW) \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Production volume || 2 155 || 3 327 || 4 315 || 4 021 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 154 || 200 || 187 \n Production capacity || 4 739 || 6 983 || 9 500 || 9 740 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 147 || 200 || 206 \n Capacity utilisation || 45 % || 48 % || 45 % || 41 % \nSource: Europressedienst\n Table 4-b \n Cells \u2013 production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (MW) \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Production volume || 1 683 || 2 376 || 2 723 || 2 024 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 141 || 162 || 120 \n Production capacity || 2 324 || 3 264 || 3 498 || 3 231 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 140 || 151 || 139 \n Capacity utilisation || 72 % || 73 % || 78 % || 63 % \nSource: Europressedienst\n(538)\u00a0\u00a0 The overall Union production of\nmodules increased by 87 % during the period considered. Production reached a\npeak in 2011 and then dropped in the IP. The Union production of modules\nincreased at a much slower pace than the growth in consumption, which more than\ntripled during the same period. Against the background of a significant\nincrease in consumption, the Union producers doubled their production capacity\nfor modules during the period considered. However, in spite of higher\nproduction levels, the Union industry\u2019s capacity utilisation rate decreased by\n4 percentage points, reaching only 41 % during the IP. \n(539)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union production of cells increased by 20 % in overall terms\nduring the period considered. It reached a peak in 2011 and decreased after\nthat in the IP. The Union production of cells followed the trend of Union\nconsumption with a slower increase until 2011 and then a more pronounced fall\nin the IP. In line with the evolution of Union consumption, the Union industry\nfirst increased their capacity by 51 % until 2011 and then this decreased\nduring the IP. In overall terms, the capacity increased by 39 % during the\nperiod considered. The capacity utilisation rate increased until 2011 reaching\na peak of 78 % and then decreased by 15 percentage points during the IP.\nOverall, the capacity utilisation of the Union industry of cells decreased over\nthe period considered reaching 63 % during the IP.\n(540)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore,\nthe Union industry expanded their capacity in response to an increased\nconsumption. However, the Union industry\u2019s production levels increased at a\nmuch slower pace than the consumption, which led to a decrease of the capacity\nutilisation rates for the product concerned during the period considered. \n(541)\u00a0\u00a0 AFASE\nclaimed that the production volume established for modules and cells in recital\n(537) above and the production capacity of the Union industry established for\nmodules and cells in the same recital were overestimated and provided data from\nother sources (i.e. EPIA, IMS and BNEF) showing lower volumes. These figures\nare those retained in recital (537) above.\n(542)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nproduction volume established in recital (537) above is based on information\ncovering both publicly listed companies and non-listed companies. The development of the Union production as established in recital (537)\nabove is furthermore in line with the development of Union consumption\nestablished in recital (509). To the contrary the data provided by AFASE on\nproduction volumes showed different trends with the Union consumption as\nestablished in recital (509) and with the statistics of Union consumption\npublished by the EPIA.\n(543)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfar as production capacity is concerned, the investigation revealed that the\nfindings as set out in recital (537) included the production capacities of\ncompanies that filed for insolvency or stopped production during the IP, while\nthey had not sold their production plants and machinery and thus able to resume\nproduction very quickly. Likewise, as mentioned above in recital (542), the\nfigures in recital (537) included data from non-listed companies. \n(544)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally,\nthe data provided by the independent consultant were counter-checked and\nverified and found to be reasonably accurate. On the basis of the above, the\ndata provided by AFASE based on other available sources were not found to be\nnecessarily in contradiction with the findings of the Provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation. \n(545)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nany event, accepting the figures provided by AFASE would not have an impact on\nthe overall finding that the Union industry suffered material injury as the\ntrend of these indicators, i.e. Union production and Union production capacity\nwould be even more pronounced.\n(546)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating\nunrelated importer argued that production volume, production capacity and\ncapacity utilisation should have been established on the basis of the data of\nthe sampled Union producers only. However as these are macroeconomic indicators\nthey should be established at the level of all Union producers in order to\nestablish a meaningful and complete picture of the situation of the Union\nindustry. This claim was therefore rejected.\n(547)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty requested the Commission to clarify how the annual Union production had\nbeen calculated by the consultant. Another party requested the Commission to give\nfurther explanations concerning the reconciliation of the different data\navailable related to the total Union production capacity. Another party\nsuggested that the total Union production and production capacity should have\nbeen obtained from the Union producers selected in the sample as this would\nhave given a more reliable result. In this regard, it was alleged that publicly\navailable data were imprecise due to the confidential character of these data\nand that any research centre or consultant had to base its analysis on a number\nof estimations and assumptions.\n(548)\u00a0\u00a0 It is clarified that the\nannual Union production was calculated on the basis of the figures reported by\nthe Union producers to the consultant. When the annual production of a certain\nUnion producer could not be obtained for a specific year, this was estimated by\napplying the capacity utilisation rate from the previous year to the new\nproduction capacity of that year. The Institutions have also compared the\nfigure obtained by the consultant with the figures reported in the replies of\nthe Union industry to the standing questionnaires prior to initiation. Both\nfigures are similar.\n(549)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the request to\nprovide further explanations concerning the reconciliation of the different\ndata available for Union production capacity, it is noted that this information\nhad already been provided in the open file open for inspection to the\ninterested parties. Therefore, this request was rejected.\n(550)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the Union\nproduction and production capacity are macroeconomic indicators and therefore have\nto be established at the level of the entire Union industry rather than on the\nlevel of the sampled Union producers. \n(551)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty argued that the methodology used to collect production data (mainly\ninterviews and visits of production sites) did not allow for reliable results\ndue to the confidential character of these data and as a consequence the\nreluctance of companies to disclose them. Such methodology cannot therefore be\nconsidered as adequate. This was allegedly confirmed by the fact that although\na much higher number of Union producers was used by the consultant than the one\ntaken into account by the Commission during the examination of standing at initiation\nstage, the total production volume established by the consultant is lower than\nthe total production volume established by the Commission for the purpose of\nthe examination of the standing. This party further claimed that consequently\nthe information related to this injury indicator cannot be considered as\npositive evidence within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. \n(552)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis first clarified that the number of producers taken into consideration by the\nconsultant on the one hand and the Commission on the other hand was largely the\nsame and that the argument that results were inconsistent had therefore to be\nrejected. It is further recalled that the data collected by the consultant were\ncross checked with other sources wherever possible and it was found that the\nestimations were sufficiently reliable. It is therefore confirmed that the\ninformation on production data provided by the consultant was considered as\npositive evidence within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. \n4.5.2.2.\u00a0 Sales volumes and market\nshare \n(553)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry\u2019s sales volume and market share developed as\nfollows over the period considered:\n Table 5-a \n Modules - sales volume and market share (in MW) \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Sales volume on the Union market || 1 037 || 1 890 || 2 683 || 2 357 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 182 || 259 || 227 \n Market share || 19 % || 15 % || 13 % || 13 % \nSource: Europressedienst\n Table 5-b \n Cells - sales volume and market share (in MW) \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Sales volume total market || 1 470 || 1 913 || 2 245 || 1 545 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 130 || 153 || 105 \n Market share || 68 % || 57 % || 52 % || 38 % \nSource: Europressedienst\n(554)\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe period considered, the sales volume of modules increased by 127 %. However,\nin the context of an increase in consumption of 221 %, this was translated into\na decrease of the Union industry\u2019s market share from 19 % in 2009 to 13 %\nduring the IP. As regards cells, the Union industry\u2019s sales increased only\nmarginally by 5 % while consumption increased by 87 % resulting in a market\nshare reduction from 68 % in 2009 to 38 % in the IP. In\nresponse to a growing consumption, the Union industry\u2019s sales of modules and\ncells grew much less than the imports from the country concerned. Thus, the\nUnion industry could not benefit from the growing consumption. As a\nconsequence, the market shares for modules and cells decreased over the period\nconsidered.\n(555)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party claimed that the market share of the Union industry for\nmodules was already only 19 % in 2009 and that a decrease by 6 percentage\npoints during the period considered cannot be considered as injury. \n(556)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndecrease in market share by 6 percentage points over the period considered has\nto be seen against the background of an increase of the Union consumption for\nmodules by over 200 % over the same period. As mentioned above, even under the\nscenario of an increased consumption it could not increase its sales volume\naccordingly and suffered losses in market share. This argument had therefore to\nbe rejected.\n(557)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\nmethodology used to collect sales data (mainly interviews and visits of production\nsites) did not allow for reliable results due to the confidential character of\nthese data and as a consequence the reluctance of companies to disclose them.\nSuch methodology cannot therefore be considered as adequate. Likewise, they\ncannot be considered as positive evidence within the meaning of Article 8(1) of\nthe basic Regulation. As mentioned above in recital (482) above the data\ncollected by the consultant were cross checked with other sources wherever\npossible and it was found that the estimations were sufficiently reliable. It\nis therefore confirmed that the information on sales data provided by the\nconsultant was considered as positive evidence within the meaning of Article 8(1)\nof the basic Regulation.\n4.5.2.3.\u00a0 Employment and productivity \n(558)\u00a0\u00a0 Employment and productivity developed as follows during the period\nconsidered: \n Table 6-a \n Modules \u2013employment and productivity \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Number of employees || 11 779 || 15 792 || 17 505 || 16 419 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 134 || 149 || 139 \n Productivity (kW/employee) || 183 || 211 || 247 || 245 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 115 || 135 || 134 \n Source: Europressedienst Table 6-b \n Cells \u2013 employment and productivity \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Number of employees || 5 281 || 5 937 || 5 641 || 4 782 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 112 || 107 || 91 \n Productivity (kW/employee) || 319 || 400 || 483 || 423 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 126 || 151 || 133 \nSource: Europressedienst\n(559)\u00a0\u00a0 Employment\nfor modules increased between 2009 and the IP by 39 %, while it decreased by 9\n% for cells. However, it is noted that employment increased until 2011 and then\ndecreased during the IP for modules. For cells, employment increased until 2010\nand then decreased during 2011 and IP. The total productivity showed positive\ntrends for modules and cells increasing by 34 % and 33 %. This is partly due to\nthe efforts of the Union industry to respond to the pressure of the subsidised\nimports from the PRC. \n(560)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in line with the decrease in Union production of modules\nbetween 2011 and the IP, employment for modules also decreased during the same\nperiod. For cells, the employment increased until 2010 and then decreased in\n2011 and in the IP while the Union production of cells grew steadily until 2011\nand then started to fall.\n(561)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none party claimed that the methodology to establish total employment in the\nUnion during the period considered was incorrect. This party alleged that\nwherever the employment rate of a specific Union producer was not available,\nthe average employment of those Union producers for which this information was\navailable was taken into consideration instead. This had to be rejected as the\nmethodology to establish total employment was different, i.e. in case\nemployment data for a certain Union producer was not available, this figure was\nestimated on the basis of data of that same company from the previous year(s).\nAs mentioned above in recital (482) this methodology was verified and found\nreasonable. Therefore, the claim was rejected.\n4.5.2.4.\u00a0 Magnitude of the amount of\nthe countervailable subsidies and recovery from past subsidisation or dumping\n(562)\u00a0\u00a0 All subsidy margins are significantly above the de minimis\nlevel. As regards the impact of the magnitude of the amount of the\ncountervailable subsidies on the Union industry, given the volume and prices of\nimports from the country concerned, the impact can be considered substantial.\n(563)\u00a0\u00a0 Since this is the first anti-subsidy proceeding regarding the\nproduct concerned, no data are available to assess effects of possible past\ndumping or subsidisation.\n4.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microeconomic indicators\n4.5.3.1.\u00a0 Prices and factors affecting\nprices\n(564)\u00a0\u00a0 The average sales prices of the sampled Union producers to unrelated\ncustomers in the Union developed as follows over the period considered:\n Table 7-a \n Modules - average sales prices in the Union \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Average sales price in the Union on free market (EUR/kW) || 2 198,75 || 1 777,15 || 1 359,35 || 1 030,83 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 81 || 62 || 47 \n Cost of production (EUR/kW) || 2 155,02 || 1 599,44 || 1 400,13 || 1 123,60 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 74 || 65 || 52 \n Source: verified questionnaire replies Table 7-b || \n Cells- average sales prices in the Union || \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP || \n Average sales price in the Union on free market (EUR/kW) || 1 525,09 || 1 160,99 || 777,62 || 474,91 || \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 76 || 51 || 31 || \n Cost of production (EUR/kW) || 1 647,10 || 1 021,67 || 1 057,56 || 745,61 || \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 62 || 64 || 45 || \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n(565)\u00a0\u00a0 Sales prices fell sharply i.e. by 53 % for modules and by 69 % for\ncells during the period considered. Sales prices fell continuously throughout\nthe period considered, but the decrease in prices was particularly pronounced\nduring the IP where they collapsed to unsustainable levels. Over the period\nconsidered the cost of production fell by 48 % for modules and by 55 % for\ncells. The Union industry could neither benefit from its continuous efforts to\nincrease its cost efficiency nor from the impact of the decrease in cost of the\nmain raw material, polysilicon. This was mainly due to the increasing price\npressure of the subsidised imports which had a negative effect on the sales\nprices of the Union industry which decreased even more than efficiency gains.\nThis can be seen in the negative trend of the Union industry\u2019s profitability as\ndescribed in recital (579) below. Overall there was a significant decrease of\nthe average sales price and the cost of production of the like product with\ndevastating effect on Union industry\u2019s profitability. \n(566)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party contested the findings that the decrease of the average sales\nprices had a devastating effect on the profitability of the Union industry. It\nclaimed that the average cost of the Union industry decreased equally and that\ntherefore a decrease in price is natural. However, as described in recital (565)\nabove, the investigation established that Union industry sales price decreased\neven more than its average cost of production and therefore such decrease in\ncosts was not reflected in the Union industry\u2019 profitability. It is therefore\nconfirmed that the decrease in sales price of the Union industry had a\ndevastating effect on the profitability of the Union industry and the claims in\nthis regard were rejected. \n(567)\u00a0\u00a0 Another\nparty contested the conclusion in recital (138) to the provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation that prices were at unsustainable levels in the IP, claiming that\nthis would be for market forces to decide. The same party also objected to the\nconclusion in the same recital that the Union industry was not able to benefit\nfrom cost decreases due to the price pressure of the subsidised imports. In\nthis regard, the Institutions observe the following: \"unsustainable\nlevel\" refers to the fact that the Union industry was selling at loss, and\ntherefore could not survive in the long term. The question whether the price\nlevel is sustainable is therefore only a question of the relationship between\nproduction costs and prices. By \"not being able to benefit from cost\ndecreases\", it is referred to the fact that costs fell less quickly than\nprices. Both those statements are backed up with evidence in recital (138) to the\nprovisional anti-dumping Regulation. Therefore, this argument had to be\nrejected.\n4.5.3.2.\u00a0 Labour costs\n(568)\u00a0\u00a0 The average labour costs of the sampled Union producers developed as\nfollows over the period considered:\n Table 8-a \n Modules- average labour costs per employee \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Average labour cost per employee (EUR) || 38 194 || 40 793 || 41 781 || 42 977 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 107 || 110 || 113 \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n Table 8-b || \n Cells - average labour cost per employee || \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP || \n Average labour cost per employee (EUR) || 49 677 || 49 357 || 49 140 || 49 350 || \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 99 || 99 || 99 || \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n(569)\u00a0\u00a0 Between 2009 and the IP, the average labour cost per employee for\nmodules continuously increased overall by 13 %. Regarding cells, the average\nlabour cost remained stable throughout the period considered and slightly\ndecreased by 1 % between 2009 and 2010 but then remained stable until the IP.\nThe overall increase of labour cost can be partly explained by the simultaneous\nincrease in productivity (modules and cells) and the evolution of inflation. \n(570)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party claimed that there has not been any inflation during the\nperiod considered and that therefore the overall increase of labour costs could\nnot have been caused by this factor. \n(571)\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast to what was\nclaimed by the party concerned, the investigation revealed that there has been\ninflation during the period considered and that the increase in labour cost, limited\nto modules, can be explained by the inflation and the increase in productivity.\n\n(572)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the injurious situation of the Union industry was caused by the increase\nin labour costs and the parallel decrease in productivity. However, first it should\nbe noted that labour cost remained stable in case of cells, while productivity\nincreased both for cells and modules. Therefore, the increase of the latter can\nbe explained by increased productivity. Moreover the investigation has shown\nthat labour costs do not represent a significant part of the cost of\nproduction, as already cited in recital (203) to the provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation. Therefore, this argument had to be rejected. \n4.5.3.3.\u00a0 Inventories\n(573)\u00a0\u00a0 Stock levels of the sampled Union producers developed as follows\nover the period considered: \n Table 9-a Modules - inventories || \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Closing Stocks (in kW) || 28 612 || 40 479 || 74 502 || 65 415 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 141 || 260 || 229 \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n Table 9-b \n Cells - inventories \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Closing Stocks (in kW) || 16 995 || 23 829 || 76 889 || 68 236 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 140 || 452 || 402 \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n(574)\u00a0\u00a0 Stocks increased significantly i.e. by 129 % for modules and by 302\n% for cells over the period considered. Concerning modules, stocks increased\ncontinuously reaching very high levels in 2011 (by 160 %), while it decreased\nin the IP but still remaining at very high levels in comparison with the\nbeginning of the period considered. Concerning cells, the development was even\nmore pronounced, with an increase in stocks between 2009 and 2011 more than 350\n%. Likewise, the stocks decreased during the IP but remained at very high\nlevels in comparison with the beginning of the period considered.\n(575)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed that given the adverse current situation,\nUnion producers would tend to hold limited stocks for the like product, basing\ntheir production on orders. Therefore, the increase in stocks for the like\nproduct over the period considered is not a relevant factor in establishing if\nthe Union industry suffered material injury.\n(576)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nparty argued that the presentation of the stock values in recital (141) to the provisional\nanti-dumping Regulation was misleading as stocks were expressed in kW rather\nthan MW unlike the Union industry\u2019s production volume. \n(577)\u00a0\u00a0 Whether\nstocks are expressed in kW or in MW as such was considered irrelevant in the\ndetermination whether or not the Union industry suffered material injury. The\nargument was therefore rejected.\n(578)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties claimed that stocks should have been determined for the whole\nUnion industry and that the figures of only ten Union producers were not\nrepresentative. It is clarified that the stocks were considered as a\nmicroeconomic indicator and should therefore be established on the basis of the\ninformation collected on a per company basis, in this case from the sample of\nUnion producers considered as representative for the whole Union industry. The\nabove claim was therefore rejected.\n4.5.3.4.\u00a0 Profitability, cash flow,\ninvestments and return on investments, ability to raise capital \n(579)\u00a0\u00a0 Profitability and cash flow developed as follows over the period\nconsidered:\n Table 10\u2013a \n Modules - profitability and cash flow \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Profitability of sales in the Union to unrelated customers (% of sales turnover) || 2 % || 10 % || -3 % || -9 % \n Cash flow || 13 % || 10 % || 12 % || 3 % \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n Table 10-b || \n Cells - profitability and cash flow || \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP || \n Profitability of sales in the Union to unrelated customers (% of sales turnover) || -8 % || 12 % || -36 % || -57 % || \n Cash flow || 75 % || 52 % || -0,3 % || -46 % || \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n(580)\u00a0\u00a0 Profitability\nof the sampled Union producers was established by expressing the pre-tax net\nprofit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union, as\nthe percentage of the turnover of such sales. \n(581)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nprofitability decreased sharply and turned to losses over the period considered\nfor the like product. The profitability dropped by 11 percentage points for\nmodules and by 49 percentage points for cells. \n(582)\u00a0\u00a0 Profitability\nfor the like product increased between 2009 and 2010 but then decreased\nsignificantly in 2011 where Union industry realized losses and further\ndecreased significantly in the IP. Losses were particularly high for cells. \n(583)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntrend of net cash flow, which is the ability of the sampled Union producers to\nself-finance their activities, likewise followed a negative trend between 2009\nand the IP. Thus, decreasing by 10 percentage points for modules with a slight\nincrease in 2011, the highest decrease of the cash flow occurred between 2011\nand the IP. The decline of cash flow for cells was more pronounced than modules\nand reached significantly negative levels during the IP. Therefore, the cash\nflow for the like product decreased over the period considered.\n(584)\u00a0\u00a0 The figures below represent the evolution of investments and return\non investments of the sampled Union producers in relation to the total market\nduring the period considered:\n Table 11-a Modules - investments and return on investments || \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Investments (EUR) || 12 081 999 || 50 105 017 || 64 643 322 || 32 730 559 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 415 || 535 || 271 \n Return on investments || -15 % || 19 % || -15 % || -17 % \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n Table 11-b \n Cells - investments and return on investment \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Investments (EUR) || 31 448 407 || 34 451 675 || 10 234 050 || 6 986 347 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 110 || 33 || 22 \n Return on investments || -4 % || 10 % || -20 % || -19 % \nSource: verified questionnaire replies\n(585)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntable above shows that the Union industry increased its investments by 171 %\nfor modules between 2009 and the IP. This was mainly linked to the significant\nadditions of capacity. However, during the same period, the Union industry\ndecreased its investments by 78 % for cells; the investments made were mainly\nlinked to R&D as well as improving and maintaining production technology\nand process in order to improve efficiency. Since the Union industry could not\nafford making additional investments for cells during the period considered,\nthe level of investments during the IP was rather low. As investments were\nfinanced basically by cash flow and intercompany loans, the decrease in the cash\nflow had immediate effect on the level of investments made. \n(586)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nreturn on investments (\u2018ROI\u2019) was expressed as the profit in percentage of the\nnet book value of investments. ROI of the like product followed the similar\nnegative trends as the other financial performance indicators between 2009 and\nthe IP for all the three types of product. For cells, while there was an\nincrease in 2009 and 2010, ROI decreased significantly in 2011 reaching\nnegative levels. For modules, ROI was at negative levels throughout the period\nconsidered, except in 2010 where it reached 19 %. Overall, it decreased during\nthe period considered reaching -17 % in the IP for cells, i.e. by 1 %, however\nstill remaining at significant negative levels, i.e. -19 %. Overall ROI\nfor the like product showed negative trends during the period considered. \n(587)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nability to raise capital was analysed in relation to the total market and it\nhas been found that there was a constant deterioration of the ability of the\nUnion industry to generate cash for the like product and, consequently, a\nweakening of the financial situation of the Union industry.\n(588)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party alleged\nthat investment figures as shown above were too low when compared to the\nproduction capacity of the Union industry as shown in recital (538). In support\nof this claim the party submitted to be aware of the investment made by one\nUnion producer in capacity increases which was at a much higher cost. The party\nconcerned concluded that therefore the established production capacity of the\nUnion industry must have been overestimated. It is noted that this claim was\nnot supported by any evidence, in particular as regards the investment made by\nthe Union producer in question. In contrast, the investment figures in the provisional\nanti-dumping Regulation were based on actual and verified information from the\nsampled Union producers. It should be noted that this claim was also based on\nthe comparison between the total investments of the sampled Union producers and\nthe total production capacity of the whole Union industry, which cannot be\nconsidered an appropriate basis for comparison as not the total investments of\nthe whole Union industry was taken into consideration. Therefore, this argument\nhad to be rejected. \n4.5.3.5.\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\n(589)\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of the situation of the Union industry showed a clear\ndownward trend of the main injury indicators. Against a generally increasing\nconsumption, overall production increased for modules and cells in the period\nconsidered. Although the volume of sales increased, the market share of the\nUnion industry shrank in the IP due to the higher increase of the consumption\nduring the period considered. Average sales price fell sharply throughout the\nperiod considered, negatively impacting on all the financial performance\nindicators such as profitability, cash flow, return on investments and ability\nto raise capital.\n(590)\u00a0\u00a0 Over the period considered, the overall Union industry's sales\nvolume increased. However, the increase in sales volumes of the Union industry\nwas accompanied by a tremendous decrease in average sales price. \n(591)\u00a0\u00a0 During\nthe period considered, imports of the interested parties from the PRC increased\nin terms of volumes and market share. At the same time, import prices continuously\ndecreased, undercutting significantly the Union industry\u2019s average price on the\nUnion market. \n(592)\u00a0\u00a0 Several\ninterested parties claimed that the Union industry and in specific the sampled\nUnion producers were performing well. It was claimed that the evolution of\ncertain injury indicators, namely production volume, production capacity, sales\nand employment but even in some sampled producers\u2019 profitability, were\nincreasing and would not show material injury. These allegations were not\nconfirmed by the results of the investigation, which has shown clear downward\ntrends of many injury indicators, relevant for the conclusion that the Union\nindustry suffered material injury.\n(593)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the investigation confirmed in particular the\nfact that the sales prices are below the production costs, thus having a\nnegative effect on the Union industry\u2019s profitability, reaching negative levels\nduring the IP. It is concluded that should subsidised imports continue to enter\nthe Union market, the losses of the Union industry would be likely to lead to\nthe permanent discontinuation of any sizeable Union production of the like\nproduct. This seems to be confirmed by the developments during and after the\nIP, i.e. some companies has declared insolvency and/or stopped temporarily or\npermanently production. \n(594)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the foregoing, it is concluded that the Union\nindustry suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 8(4) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSATION \n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(595)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n8(5) and (6) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry was caused by the subsidised imports from\nthe country concerned. Furthermore, known factors other than subsidised imports,\nwhich might have injured the Union industry, were examined to ensure that any\ninjury caused by those factors was not attributed to subsidised imports.\n(596)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that market conditions of the product concerned differ per Member State\nand that therefore the causality analysis should be made at the level of each\nMember State separately. \n(597)\u00a0\u00a0 National support schemes\ndetermine to a certain extent the size of the Member States\u2019 markets. The\ninvestigation has however also revealed that demand does not exclusively depend\non support schemes. Depending on geographical location (sun exposure) and the\nelectricity price at a given location, solar panels appear to have reached, or\nwere at least close to, grid parity (i.e. when the cost to produce solar energy\nequals the cost to produce conventional energy), which means that certain\ninvestments take place independently of support schemes. Therefore, it could\nnot be established that market conditions depend exclusively on support schemes\nand this claim was therefore rejected. \n(598)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nclaimed that the causation analysis conducted did not separate, distinguish and\nquantify the injurious effects of the subsidised imports from the effects of\nother known factors which at the same time are injuring the Union industry.\nMoreover, it was claimed that the Commission failed to undertake a collective\nanalysis of these other known factors. \n(599)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to this claim it\nshould be noted that the Commission, as per established practice, first\nexamined whether there is a causal link between the subsidised imports and the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and secondly examined whether any of the\nother known factors had broken the causal link established between the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and the subsidised imports. In this\nanalysis, the effects of the other known factors on the situation of the Union\nindustry were assessed, distinguished and separated from the injurious effects\nof the subsidised imports to ensure that injuries caused by these factors were\nnot attributed to the subsidized imports. It was found that none of them had a\nsignificant impact, if any, on the situation of the industry that could reverse\nthe fact that the material injury assessed must be attributed to the subsidised\nimports. On these grounds the argument was dismissed. \n(600)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, several interested parties reiterated the above arguments. In this\nregard it was claimed that the Commission should establish explicitly, through\na reasoned and adequate explanation, that the injury caused by factors other\nthan the subsidised imports is not attributed to these imports. \n(601)\u00a0\u00a0 In this investigation, it\nwas concluded, after examining all the facts, that the subsidised imports taken\nin isolation have caused material injury to the Union industry. In this\nrespect, quantifying the effects of other known factors was not possible and\ntherefore a qualitative assessment was carried out as set out in recitals (164)\nto (222) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation. In conclusion, it was\nconfirmed that the material injury of the Union industry was caused by the subsidised\nimports. Indeed the effects of other factors on the Union\u2019s industry\u2019s negative\ndevelopment were considered to be limited. It should be noted that, under\nArticle 8(5) and (6) of the basic Regulation, no obligation is imposed as to\nthe form of the attribution and non-attribution analyses which should be\ncarried out. On the contrary, under Article 8(5) and (6) of the basic\nRegulation, those analyses must be carried out in such a way as to enable the\ninjurious effects of the subsidised imports to be separated and distinguished\nfrom the injurious effects caused by other factors. The investigation did not\nreveal any evidence that all other known factors which may have contributed to\nthe injury suffered, together or in isolation, broke the causal link between\nthe subsidised imports and the material injury suffered by the Union industry.\nGiven the above analysis, it was confirmed that other known factors were not\nsuch as to reverse the finding that the material injury suffered by the Union\nindustry must be attributed to the subsidised imports. On these grounds these\narguments were dismissed. \n(602)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties claimed\nthat the national support schemes, the sun exposure and the electricity prices (including\nregulatory charges) differ per Member State and that furthermore there are\ndifferent market segments in each market (the residential- installations of\nless than 40 kW, commercial and industrial- installations between 40 kW and 1MW\nand the utility market segment- installations between 1 MW and 10 MW). In view\nof this, they claimed that the causation analysis should be conducted\nseparately for each Member State on the one hand and for the large-scale and\nthe residential segments on the other hand.\n(603)\u00a0\u00a0 After the final disclosure\nsome interested parties reiterated their claim that the causation analysis\nshould be conducted on a per Member State basis, without however providing\nfurther arguments or new evidence in this respect. \n(604)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown\nthat sales and import prices are similar across the Union. It can therefore be\nconsidered that there is indeed one market for the product under investigation.\nThe investigation did also not reveal that producers in each Member State or\nregion concentrated their activities in this specific market or that the subsidised\nimports concentrated in one Member State or region. Moreover, none of the\ninterested parties argued that subsidization and injury should be analysed on a\nper Member States basis which would however be a pre-condition for conducting a\nseparate causation analysis per Member State. The investigation did not reveal\nany evidence that this would have been an appropriate approach, in particular\ngiven that there were similar prices across the Union of the product under\nconsideration at Union level. Moreover, it is noted that the sun exposure can\nbe different in different regions of the same Member States, e.g. Southern\nFrance has more sun exposure than Northern France, or different regions within\none Member State can have different support schemes (e.g. Belgium) and that\ntherefore the impact of these factors on the demand may vary from one region to\nanother within the same Member State. However, the differences in the\nregulatory framework of each Member State and/or region and the differences in\nconditions such as sun exposure do not warrant a separate causation analysis,\nand thus separate injury and subsidization analysis. Therefore, these arguments\nhad to be rejected. \n(605)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nargued that while other factors are relevant, the national support schemes\nremain the main factor in determining the demand. The same party also contested\nthat grid parity was reached at least in some locations arguing that prices of\nmodules increased since the IP while electricity prices decreased. It further\nargued that, in any event, at least in certain Member States, the regulatory,\neconomic and technical conditions do not allow for the connection to the grid\nand for those Member States it was therefore irrelevant whether or not grid\nparity was reached. This party however did not provide any supporting evidence\nfor the above allegations. In any event the above arguments confirm that the\nsituation with regard to national support schemes as well as grid parity may be\ndifferent to a certain extent between Member States. Moreover, none of the\ninformation submitted was of such a nature to show that an analysis separately\nper Member State would be warranted. The arguments were therefore rejected.\n(606)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party reiterated the claim and provided some\ninformation allegedly showing the different market conditions per Member State\nand per segment. However, the information submitted could not be considered as\nconclusive as it consisted of a power point presentation without any supporting\nevidence, and therefore, did not show that an analysis separately per Member\nState would be warranted. The claim of this party was therefore rejected.\n(607)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it was\nconcluded that an analysis of the causation per Member State and/or region and\nper segment would not correspond to market reality. \n(608)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nGOC claimed that the Commission has conducted the causation analysis in an\ninconsistent manner as the injury analysis was done separately for modules and\ncells, while the causation analysis did not separate between product types. In\nthis respect, it is noted that while the injury indicators were indeed shown\nseparately for each product type, the conclusions reached for each indicator\nrefer to the product under investigation as a whole. It is also recalled that\nmodules and cells are one single product and therefore the causation analysis\nwas conducted on this basis. Therefore, the claim was rejected.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of subsidised\nimports \n(609)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that subsidised imports from the PRC increased\ndramatically over the period considered, increasing their volumes significantly\nby around 300 % for modules and around 400 % for cells and their market share from\n[60 % - 65 %] in 2009 to [78 % - 83 %] in the IP for modules, and from [5\n% - 10 %] in 2009 to [22 % - 27 %] in the IP for cells . Therefore, it is\nconfirmed that volume of imports and market share for the product concerned\nincreased dramatically during the period considered. There was a clear\ncoincidence in time between the increase in subsidised imports and the loss of\nmarket share of the Union industry. The investigation also established that, as\nmentioned in recital (527) above, the subsidised imports undercut the prices of\nthe Union industry during the IP. \n(610)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that the prices of the subsidised imports decreased by 64\n% for modules and by 42 % for cells during the period considered and led to an\nincrease of undercutting. Against this price pressure, the Union industry\nunderwent considerable effort to decrease its production costs. Despite these\nefforts the exceptionally low level of Chinese import prices forced the Union\nindustry to further decrease its sales price to unprofitable levels. Thus, the\nprofitability of the Union industry decreased dramatically during the period\nconsidered and showed losses during the IP. \n(611)\u00a0\u00a0 Based\non the above, it is concluded that the presence of Chinese imports and the\nincrease of the market share of subsidised imports from the PRC at prices\nconstantly undercutting those of the Union industry have had a determining role\nin the material injury suffered by the Union industry, which is reflected in\nparticular in its poor financial situation and in the deterioration of most of\nthe injury indicators. \n(612)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party contested\nthat there was a sufficient correlation between the subsidised imports of the\nproduct concerned from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Union\nindustry. It was argued that this would be supported, on the one hand, by the\nfact that from 2009 to 2010 the Union industry\u2019s profit margin for cells\nsignificantly increased (from loss making to 12 % profit) while Chinese imports\nwere 36 % lower priced than Union industry\u2019 prices and doubled their market\nshare during the same period. On the other hand, between 2010 and 2011 Chinese\nimports only gained 6 percentage points of market share, even though\nconsumption increased much more during the same period, while the Union\nindustry realised nonetheless a loss of 36 %. This party argued further that,\nas regards the IP, imports of cells from other third countries were at the same\nprice level as Chinese imports but gained more market share corresponding to\nthe loss of market share of the Union industry. \n(613)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat there was a constant increase of Chinese market share for modules and\ncells over the period considered (17 percentage points for modules, 17\npercentage points for cells). Indeed, as mentioned above in recital (609), subsidised\nimports from the PRC increased significantly while import prices decreased. In\nparallel, the Union industry lost market share over the period considered and,\nas described in recitals (589) to (593) above, all main injury indicators\nshowed a negative trend. Therefore it is confirmed that there is a clear\ncoincidence in time between the increase in subsidised imports and the loss of\nmarket share of the Union industry. \n(614)\u00a0\u00a0 The above mentioned\ncorrelation in time was established for all product types separately. In\naddition, the analysis of the impact of the imports on the Union industry\u2019s\nprofit margin separately for each year of the period considered does not lead\nto meaningful results as the existence of subsidy and material injury as well\nas a causal link between them does not need to be established for each year\nseparately. The correlation between the subsidised imports and the material\ninjury is sufficiently demonstrated when analysing the developments over the\nwhole period considered.\n(615)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also noted that the\nprofitability of the Union industry is one of the factors mentioned in Article\n8(4) of the basic Regulation which should be investigated when examining the\nimpact of the subsidised imports on the Union industry\u2019s situation. The fact\nalone that the Union industry was profitable during a specific year does not\nnecessarily mean that it did not suffer any material injury. Moreover, the loss\nof the market share of the Union industry should not correspond exactly to the\nincrease of the market share of the subsidised imports in order to establish a\ncausal link between the injury and the subsidised imports. Finally, other factors\n(e.g. imports of other third countries or development of the consumption) which\ncould have had an impact on the injurious situation of the Union industry were\nexamined and addressed separately in recitals (619) to (732) below.\n(616)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ncoincidence between the increasing subsidised imports in significant\nquantities, which undercut prices of the Union industry and, the increasingly\nprecarious situation of the Union industry is a clear indicator of causation in\nthe present case, as established in recitals (609) to (611) above. The claims\nwith regard to the lack of any correlation between the subsidised imports and\nthe material injury suffered by the Union industry were therefore rejected.\n(617)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party continued to contest the causation\nanalysis as the profitability of the Union industry was not analysed\nspecifically in relation to certain years (in particular 2010), but for the\nwhole period considered. \n(618)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it should be\nnoted that no valid conclusions can be drawn concerning causality by isolating\none specific year of the period considered while ignoring the development of\nthe Union industry during the entire period considered and its correlations\nwith the development of the subsidised imports. Such analysis can only lead to\na partial picture and no sound conclusions can be drawn therefrom. Thus, the\nprofitability rates that drove also other financial indicators that the Union\nindustry achieved during 2010, was high because of the particularly strong jump\nin Union consumption, driven by very generous support schemes, that allowed\nUnion industry to have their strongest sales improvement that same year, but\nonly of a temporary nature and in any event not sustainable for this type of\nindustry. Therefore, this argument had to be rejected.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors \n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from other third\ncountries \n(619)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nvolume of imports from other third countries during the period considered for\nmodules increased by 19 % while the market share decreased over the period\nconsidered from 18,4 % to 6,8 %. Taiwan is the second largest exporter after\nthe PRC.\n(620)\u00a0\u00a0 The volume of imports from\nother third countries for cells increased by 186 % during the period considered\nwhich translated in an increase of market share from around 24 % in 2009 to\naround 36 % during the IP. As for cells, Taiwan is second largest exporter\nafter the PRC, by far exceeding import quantities and market shares from the\nother third countries, but still below those from the PRC.\n(621)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nimport prices of third countries of modules and cells were on average higher\nthan the average unit price of the Chinese imports. The information available\nas regards imports from Taiwan shows that the average import price for modules\nwas higher than the average Chinese import price for modules, while the average\nimport price for cells was in the same range as the average Chinese import\nprice for cells. However, since no detailed price information per product type\nwas available, the price comparison on an average basis can only be used as an\nindication but no firm conclusions can be drawn on this basis. Throughout the\nperiod considered, volume of imports of cells from Taiwan increased\ncontinuously, resulting in a gain of market share of around 14 percentage\npoints. Therefore, even if it is acknowledged that imports of cells from Taiwan\nmay have contributed to the injury suffered by the Union industry, it cannot be\nconcluded that they broke the causal link between the subsidised imports from\nthe PRC and the injury suffered by the Union industry, as the import volume of\ncells from the PRC was slightly higher than the import from Taiwan. As far as\nthe prices are concerned, although the average indicative prices are in the\nsame range, no conclusion can be drawn on that basis since no information are\navailable concerning the specific types of the imported cells. However, overall\nfor the product under investigation, despite their increase in market share,\nthe volumes were lower than the PRC and their price levels were generally\nhigher with the exception of cells during the IP. On these grounds, in\nparticular in view of the import volumes and market shares from other third\ncountries as well as their price levels, which are on average similar or higher\nthan those from the Union industry it can be concluded that third country\nimports did not break the causal link between the subsidised imports and the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry.\n(622)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nmade comments following the final disclosure with regard to the findings\nconcerning imports from other third countries. However, these parties did not\nbring into light new information and supporting evidence which could have\naltered the relevant findings. \n(623)\u00a0\u00a0 Those parties underlined in\nparticular the volume of imports of cells from Taiwan. However, the absolute\nvolume of imports of the product concerned from Taiwan (1132 MW) represents\nonly a very small share (less than 5%) of the overall Union consumption (21559\nMW) and compared to imports from the PRC (15005 MW). Therefore, imports from\nTaiwan have, if at all, only marginally contributed to injury of the Union\nindustry, and not broken the causal link.\nTable 12\nImports and market shares from\nother third countries \n MODULES || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume of imports from all other third countries (MW) || 1 003 || 1 702 || 1 385 || 1 195 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 169 || 138 || 119 \n Market share of imports from all other third countries || 18,4 % || 14,0 % || 7,0 % || 6,8 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 2 385,34 || 1 852,23 || 1 430,90 || 1 218,41 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 60 || 51 \n Volume of imports from Taiwan (MW) || 49 || 144 || 140 || 135 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 294 || 286 || 276 \n Market share of imports from Taiwan || 0,9 % || 1,2 % || 0,7 % || 0,8 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 2 102,04 || 1 659,72 || 1 350,00 || 1 125,93 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 79 || 64 || 54 \n Volume of imports from USA (MW) || 140 || 180 || 51 || 60 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 129 || 36 || 43 \n Market share of imports from USA || 2,6 % || 1,5 % || 0,3 % || 0,3 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 2 400,00 || 1 872,22 || 1 431,37 || 1 233,33 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 60 || 51 \n Volume of imports from rest of Asia (MW) || 720 || 1.140 || 1.029 || 879 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 158 || 143 || 122 \n Market share of imports from rest of Asia || 13,2 % || 9,3 % || 5,2 % || 5,0 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 2 400,00 || 1 870,18 || 1 440,23 || 1 229,81 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 60 || 51 \n Volume of imports from rest of the World (MW) || 94 || 238 || 165 || 121 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 253 || 176 || 129 \n Market share of imports from rest of the World || 1,7 % || 2,0 % || 0,8 % || 0,7 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 2 404,26 || 1 869,75 || 1 442,42 || 1 231,40 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 60 || 51 \nSource: Europressedienst\n CELLS || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume of imports from all other third countries (MW) || 510 || 884 || 1 100 || 1 457 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 173 || 216 || 286 \n Market share of imports from all other third countries || 23,7 % || 26,6 % || 25,5 % || 36,2 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 1 166,67 || 1 072,40 || 751,82 || 553,88 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 92 || 64 || 47 \n Volume of imports from Taiwan (MW) || 235 || 400 || 540 || 997 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 170 || 230 || 424 \n Market share of imports from Taiwan || 10,9 % || 12,0 % || 12,5 % || 24,8 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 948,94 || 1 100,00 || 670,37 || 514,54 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 116 || 71 || 54 \n Volume of imports from USA (MW) || 40 || 40 || 40 || 33 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 100 || 100 || 83 \n Market share of imports from USA || 1,9 % || 1,2 % || 0,9 % || 0,8 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 1 350,00 || 1 050,00 || 825,00 || 636,36 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 61 || 47 \n Volume of imports from Japan (MW) || 60 || 154 || 170 || 145 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 257 || 283 || 242 \n Market share of imports from Japan || 2,8 % || 4,6 % || 3,9 % || 3,6 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 1 350,00 || 1 051,95 || 829,41 || 641,38 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 61 || 48 \n Volume of imports from rest of the world (MW) || 175 || 290 || 350 || 282 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 166 || 200 || 161 \n Market share of imports from rest of the world || 8,1 % || 8,7 % || 8,1 % || 7,0 % \n Average import price EUR/kW || 1 348,57 || 1 051,72 || 831,43 || 638,30 \n (Index 2009 = 100) || 100 || 78 || 62 || 47 \nSource: Europressedienst\n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non subsidised imports from\nthe PRC \n(624)\u00a0\u00a0 Non subsidised imports from\nthe PRC were carefully analysed and were found not to have any significant\nimpact on the situation of the Union industry, susceptible of breaking the\ncausal link established between the subsidised imports and the injury suffered\nby the Union industry.\n5.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of the Union\nconsumption \n(625)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (509) above, Union consumption\nincreased by 221 % for modules and by 87 % for cells during the period\nconsidered. Consumption reached a peak in 2011 and dropped during the IP while\nstill remaining far above the level at the beginning of the period considered\nin 2009. The Union industry could not benefit from this increase in consumption\nas its market share fell from 19 % to 13 % for modules and from 68 % to 38 %\nfor cells during the same period. At the same time, the market share of the PRC\nwas increasing sharply, until 2011 and then remained stable at significant high\nlevel during the IP, when consumption fell. Therefore, in view of the fact\nthat, despite a decrease in Union consumption in the IP, the subsidised imports\nfrom the PRC either maintained their market share (modules) or increased it\n(cells) to the detriment of the Union industry over the period considered, it\ncannot be concluded that the decrease in consumption was such as to break the\ncausal link between the subsidised imports and the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry. Moreover, the investigation showed that,\nas the capacity of the Union industry was in any event much lower than the\nlevels of consumption, the shrinking consumption in the IP could not have had\nan impact on the injurious situation of the Union industry.\n(626)\u00a0\u00a0 Based\non the information available it is difficult to establish to what extend the\ndemand is driven by the Member States support schemes. Indeed, as mentioned\nbelow in recital (632) a variety of support schemes exists and interaction\nbetween those and demand is highly complex and therefore their precise impact\nis difficult to quantify. However, the evidence available also indicates that\neven in the absence of support schemes the demand for solar energy will\ncontinue to exist and will even grow over time, albeit at lower levels than in\nthe context of support schemes. In this context, several parties argued that grid\nparity had already been reached or nearly reached in some regions of the Union.\n(627)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the imports from the PRC did not capture the entire increase in\nconsumption and that, while in the case of modules the Union industry lost\nmarket share between 2009 and 2010, it still increased its profitability during\nthe same period. Furthermore, it was argued that in 2009 when imports for cells\nfrom PRC had only 8 % market share, the Union industry still suffered 8 % loss.\n\n(628)\u00a0\u00a0 As already\nmentioned in recitals (609) to (616) above, despite the decrease in Union\nconsumption in the IP, the subsidised imports from the PRC either maintained\ntheir market share (modules) or increased it (cells) to the detriment of the\nUnion industry over the period considered. Therefore, it cannot be concluded\nthat the decrease in consumption was such as to break the causal link between\nthe subsidised imports and the injury suffered by the Union industry. Moreover,\nthe investigation showed that as the capacity of the Union industry was in any\nevent much lower than the levels of consumption, the shrinking consumption in\nthe IP could not have had an impact on the injurious situation of the Union\nindustry. Therefore, this claim was rejected. \n(629)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\ncontested that the demand in the Union will continue to exist even in the\nabsence of the national support schemes. This party argued that there is a\ncorrelation between demand and support schemes and that in the absence of such\nschemes projects in the PV sector it would not be profitable anymore and\ntherefore the demand for solar panels will disappear as well. However, the party did not provide any evidence which could\ndevaluate the findings above under recital (626). In the absence of any new\ninformation in this regard, this claim was rejected.\n(630)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure, the\nGOC argued that the fact that the Union industry\u2019s capacity did in any event\nnot meet the Union demand is irrelevant since the sales volume of modules of\nthe Union industry decreased in line with the decrease in consumption and\nreiterated that the decrease in consumption between 2011 and the IP caused the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry. While indeed between 2011 and\nthe IP the Union consumption decrease and the sales volume of modules decreased\nwith a similar trend, this has to be seen in relation to the development of the\nChinese subsidised prices, significantly undercutting the Union industry\nprices, thus forcing the Union industry selling at losses. In this regard it is\nrecalled, as mentioned in recital (111) to the provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation that imports from the PRC either maintained their market share\n(modules) or increased it (cells) when the consumption was decreasing. At the\nsame time Chinese import prices decreased significantly and substantially\nundercut the Union industry\u2019s sales prices. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n5.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feed-in-tariffs ('FITs') as\nthe main example of support schemes\n(631)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been claimed by\nseveral interested parties that the cause of the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry was linked to the reductions in the feed-in-tariffs implemented by the\nMember States. Those cuts had allegedly led to a decrease of the solar\ninstallations and reduced demand for the product under investigation in the\nUnion market, thus causing material injury to the Union industry. \n(632)\u00a0\u00a0 Member States introduced FITs, quota obligations with\ntradable green certificates, investment grants and tax incentives to support\nrenewable energy generation. Support is also granted in certain Member States\nfrom EU structural funds. The most frequently implemented support instruments\nfor solar energy were FITs. The analysis of the\nCommission focused on this type of support scheme.\n(633)\u00a0\u00a0 FITs are a financial support\ninstrument aiming to achieve mandatory national targets for the use of\nrenewable energy, as prescribed by the Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of\nthe use of energy from renewable sources. The level of support and the way FITs\noperate vary by Member State. By means of FITs grid operators are bound to buy\nsolar energy at prices which ensure that solar energy producers (usually the\nowners of the solar installations) recover their costs and earn reasonable\nrates of return. FITs, as other support schemes, are in most cases also subject\nto State aid control pursuant to articles 107, 108 TFEU, which ensures the absence\nof overcompensation for electricity producers.\n(634)\u00a0\u00a0 In spite of the national\ndifferences, three phenomena could be observed as regards the evolution of FITs\nin the Union: (i) the reduction of the FIT rates, (ii) the suspension of the\nFIT scheme as a whole (Spain) and (iii) the introduction of capacity thresholds\n(\u2018caps\u2019) for the installations eligible for financing as well as overall caps\non the yearly installed new supported capacity at the Member State level. As\nregards the caps, they appear to have been introduced mainly during 2012 and,\nmost likely, do therefore not have any effect on the consumption during the IP.\nConsequently, the analysis focused on the recent FIT suspensions in Spain and\nreductions of FIT rates in most Member States. It was analysed whether they had\nan impact on the demand in the Union market and whether this could have caused\nthe material injury suffered by the Union industry. In this regard, it was\nconsidered that the impact of the evolution of FITs with regard to the demand of\nmodules was also representative for the situation with regard to cells. Indeed,\nas cells are indispensable for the production of modules and as they are not\nused in other production processes, a decrease in demand for modules triggers\nautomatically a decrease in demand for cells. \n(635)\u00a0\u00a0 While\nthe investigation confirmed the link between the evolution of FITs and\nconsumption, the investigation established that the decrease in consumption\nbetween 2011 and the IP did not contribute to break the causal link between the\nsubsidised imports from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Union\nindustry as described in detail in recital (625) above. Indeed, the\ninvestigation showed that while the situation of the Union industry was\ndeteriorating, the exporting producers were able to maintain their high market\nshares for modules (80 %) and even increased their market shares slightly for\ncells (from 20 % in 2011 to 22 % during the IP). In addition it should be noted\nthat the average price of modules charged by the Union industry dropped by 53 %\nover the period considered, mainly due to the significant increase of\nsubsidised imports and the substantial price pressure they exerted on the Union\nmarket. Therefore, the loss in profitability suffered by the Union industry\ncannot be mainly attributed to the FIT cutbacks.\n(636)\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\nit is acknowledged that FITs generated demand for solar energy and that recent\nFIT suspensions (as in Spain) and reductions in other Member States lowered the\nconsumption for the product under investigation during the IP, thus possibly\nhaving contributed to the injury suffered by the Union industry. However, the\ndecrease in consumption during the IP was not such as to break the causal link\nbetween the subsidised imports and the injury suffered by the Union industry.\n(637)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties argued that\nFITs cutbacks rendered the solar investment opportunities unattractive for\ninvestors and thus lowered the demand for the product concerned in the Union. \n(638)\u00a0\u00a0 While\nthe investigation confirmed a link between the FIT rates and the level of\ninvestments in the solar industry, it also showed that investments in the solar\nenergy are less dependent in regions with high sun exposure where production of\nsolar energy is more efficient and in regions with high electricity prices.\nIndeed, showed that investments are still being made (e.g. in Spain) in spite\nof the suspension of the FIT scheme. Moreover, the investigation showed that\nsolar energy investment opportunities still remained attractive even with lower\nFIT rates. On the basis of the above, this claim\nwas rejected. \n(639)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed that\nthe FIT developments exercised a strong downward pressure on prices and\ntherefore on the profitability of the Union industry. One interested party claimed\nthat only the impact of the development of FITs on the demand was examined,\nwhile the impact on prices should also have been analysed instead. In the same\ncontext, several interested parties argued that most of the Member States\nimplemented major cutbacks already in 2010 thus putting a downward pressure on\nthe prices for modules.\n(640)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of this claim it should be noted that the Member States implemented FIT\ncutbacks at different moments in time and at different speeds and that drawing\na general picture for the entire Union is rather difficult. Irrespective of the\nmoment when the FIT rates reached very low levels, the significant decrease in\nthe Union prices and profitability during the period considered cannot be\nsolely or mainly explained by the reduction of FITs. First, on the basis of the\ninformation collected for Germany and Italy that represented together around\n75% of the Union consumption in 2011, the drop in the average sales price was\nmore pronounced than the decrease in the FIT rates during the IP. Second, the\nevidence collected shows that, for some countries such as Italy, even in the\ncontext of very generous FIT rates, the Union industry had to decrease\nsignificantly their prices. Finally, during the IP, the Union industry had to sell\nat prices below their cost of production, which was mainly a consequence of the\nfact that the Chinese exporting producers had 80% of the Union consumption and\ntherefore the power to influence the price-setting mechanism.\n(641)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation further established that up to 2011 the higher FIT rates together\nwith the decrease in the prices of modules in the Union rendered the\ninvestments in solar energy extremely attractive as investors were earning very\nhigh rates on return. Therefore, this resulted in a high number of investments\nand consequently high demand of solar panels. As a consequence of the increased\ndemand, the total amount of FITs paid increased significantly and most Member\nStates revised the existing FIT schemes downwards to avoid inter alia an\nincrease of electricity costs. This shows that FIT cutbacks may also have been\nthe result of the decreasing prices and not vice versa. Therefore, this claim\nwas rejected. \n(642)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure one\nparty claimed that there was a contradiction between the recital (640) above, that an assessment of the demand for the\nUnion as a whole is difficult, and the recital (608)\nabove stating that a causation analysis per Member State would not lead to\nmeaningful results. In this respect, it is clarified that in the assessment\nmade as described in recital (640) above, reference is made to the difficulty to\ndraw a general picture of the FIT developments for the entire Union and not to\nthe Union demand as claimed by the interested party. As a consequence, it\nfollows that no contradiction exists between the two recitals and therefore the\nclaim was rejected.\n(643)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that even in the context of high FIT rates, the module price may\ndecrease significantly due to technological development, economies of scale,\ncost reductions and growing global production capacity. In respect of this\nclaim, it is noted that the evidence collected shows that the Italian producers\nhad to reduce their prices below the cost of production even when FIT rates\nwere high. While the factors mentioned above may indeed have had an impact on\nthe average costs they cannot explain why Union producers had to reduce their\nprices below their cost of production. Therefore, it is concluded that it was\nmainly the subsidised imports from the PRC that pushed the prices to\nunsustainable levels and this claim was rejected.\n(644)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that the conclusion drawn in recital (641) above, that FIT\ncutbacks may have also been the result of the decreasing prices and not vice\nversa, is not supported by any evidence.\n(645)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the\nconclusions drawn in recital (641) above were based on the information\navailable during the investigation and the scenario described was indeed\nconsidered as reasonable given the circumstances in this specific market.\nTherefore, this argument was rejected.\n(646)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty disagreed with the conclusion that the downward price pressure on Union\nproducers was mainly exerted by the subsidised imports and claimed that, to the\ncontrary, it was the FIT cutbacks that forced the Union producers to reduce\ntheir prices. The same party reiterated that when FITs were reduced, the PV\nsystem prices decreased in line with the decrease in FITs so that costs for\nproject developers do not increase, which ultimately caused the price pressure\non the Union producers. \n(647)\u00a0\u00a0 Since no conclusive evidence\nwas brought in support of these claims, the Commission maintained its analysis\nand conclusions as stated in recitals (640) to (641) above. \n(648)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party claimed that\nmarkets are driven by the development of FITs and provided information showing\nthe number of PV installations for the years 2012 and 2013 in the UK. The\ninformation provided by this party was a publication of the UK government based\non the weekly registrations in the UK Central FiT Register (CFR). It is noted\nthat this information related mostly to a period outside the IP and referred\nonly to one Member State, while the current investigation focused on the\nsituation of the Union market as a whole. In any event, it is not contested\nthat FIT levels influence demand, as the profitability of investments in\nlocations with less solar radiation depends on the FIT level. However, in order\nto show that the level at which FIT were set during the IP has caused the\ninjury, interested parties would have had to show that a price increase of the\nUnion producers to the non-injurious level would have meant that the Union\nproducers would not have been able to sell the product concerned because\ninvestments into PV systems would not have been viable at those price levels.\nNo such evidence has been provided. This argument was therefore rejected.\n(649)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed that\nin the context of the low FIT rates, investments in PV projects were\neconomically viable only when supplied with the lower priced solar panels\nimported from the PRC. Therefore, it was argued that the FIT cutbacks caused\nmaterial injury to the Union industry. Another party argued that the level of\nthe FIT rate influences the price setting mechanism for modules.\n(650)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that the\ncost of a module at which a project would still be economically viable varies\nby Member State or by region in function of numerous factors such as FITs,\nother regulatory incentives, sun exposure, conventional electricity prices,\netc. In addition, the investigation showed that current installations depend\nless and less on the FITs as PV grid parity is likely to have been reached for\ncertain types of installations in several regions in Europe, such as a large\nportion of Italy, Spain, Portugal, southern France and Greece. On the above\ngrounds, the claims made in this regard were rejected.\n(651)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the Commission did not investigate whether Union industry failed to\nanticipate that government support schemes would be abruptly withdrawn or\ndecreased. No arguments were brought in support of this claim. However, it\nshould be noted that, based on the evidence collected, there is no information\nindicating that the Union industry responded to the market signals (i.e.\ndevelopment in consumption) and other available information (i.e. reduction in\nsupport schemes) in an unreasonable way. Therefore, this claim was rejected. \n(652)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the FIT cutbacks caused Union industry sales decline because investments\nhad been viable only at the affordable Chinese prices. The evidence collected\nin fact shows only a slight decrease in the sales of the Union industry during the\nIP, in contrast to what it would be expected had the PV projects been feasible\nonly with Chinese modules. On the contrary, the sales of module of the Union\nindustry increased until 2011 and then slightly decreased in the IP, following\nthe same trend as of the consumption. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n(653)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the decrease in FITs forced Union industry to decrease their prices to\nkeep the interests of the investors in PV energy and to keep developing demand\nand growth. \n(654)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the Union industry was forced to decrease its prices mainly due to the\npressure of the subsidised imports and not to the FIT cutbacks. This is\nindicated by the fact that the most significant decrease in the prices of the\nUnion industry occurred in 2010 and 2011, before the major FIT cutbacks took\nplace. Indeed, the increase in subsidized imports from the PRC significantly\nundercutting the Union industry\u2019s prices forced the Union industry to cut down\ntheir prices to increasingly low levels. On these grounds, the claim was\ntherefore rejected.\n(655)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nargued that the findings as set out in recitals (174) and (175) to the provisional\nanti-dumping Regulation that the FIT changes did not break the causal link has\nno factual or legal basis and is inconsistent with Article 8(5) of the basic\nRegulation because the Commission failed to assess the level of injury caused\nby the FIT reductions and because it considered that the significant drop in\nthe Union industry\u2019s price had been a consequence only of the subsidised Chinese\nimports. The same party argued that the decrease in the price of modules and\ncells was a global phenomenon and not due to the pressure of the Chinese\nimports.\n(656)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of the claim that\nthe Commission failed to assess the level of injury caused by the FIT cutbacks,\nreference is made to recitals (628) and (629) above as well as (640) and (641),\nwhere the Commission concluded that neither the decrease in demand nor the\nimpact of FITs on Union prices were as such as to break the causal link between\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry and the subsidized imports from the PRC,\nirrespective of whether and to which extent they were possibly caused by the\nFITs cutbacks. Therefore, the claim that the Commission\u2019s findings have no\nfactual basis was rejected. As regards the claim that the decrease in the price\nof modules and cells was a global phenomenon, reference is made to recitals (619)\nto (621) above where import volumes and prices from other countries than the\nPRC into the Union are assessed. While indeed there was a global downward trend\nin the prices of modules and cells, the subsidized import prices from the PRC\nhave exacerbated the downward trend to loss making levels. On the basis of the\nabove, this claim was rejected.\n(657)\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, FITs have been\nan important factor for the development of the PV market in the Union and the\nevolution of consumption of the product under investigation was influenced by\nthe existence of the FITs. However, the investigation showed that the\nconsumption did not decrease significantly despite important FIT cutbacks. Furthermore,\nthe investigation showed that the decrease in Union prices did not occur mainly\ndue to the FIT cutbacks. Therefore, it is concluded that the developments of\nFITs were not such as to break the causal link between the subsidised imports\nand the material injury suffered by the Union industry. \n5.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other financial support\ngranted to the Union industry\n(658)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the material injury suffered by the Union industry was due to a\ndecrease of financial support granted to the Union industry. In support of this\nclaim, information was provided based on subsidies granted to one of the Union\nproducers prior to the period considered (between 2003 and 2006). \n(659)\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence provided did\nnot reveal any link between the material injury suffered by the Union industry\nand any alleged subsidy received by one of the Union producers during the\nperiod preceding the period considered. Moreover, as this information predates\nthe period considered, it seems to be irrelevant. Therefore, no link could be\nestablished between any alleged subsidy received by the Union industry and the\nmaterial injury suffered. On this ground, the argument was rejected. \n5.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overcapacity\n(660)\u00a0\u00a0 It has been claimed that the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry was due to an overcapacity in\nthe Union market and in the global market in general. It was also argued that\nthe overcapacity in the global market led to the consolidation of the Union\nindustry that is currently taking place and that any injury suffered was a\nconsequence of too many production facilities. Moreover, several interested\nparties claimed that the material injury suffered by the Union industry was\nlinked to the self-inflicted overexpansion of capacity of the Union industry.\nOn the contrary, some interested parties claimed that the injury suffered by\nthe Union industry is due to the Union industry\u2019s failure to make the necessary\ninvestments in capacity additions.\n(661)\u00a0\u00a0 While the Union industry\nindeed increased its production capacity, its total production volume did not\ncover the increasing consumption levels in the Union market during the period\nconsidered. Thus, the increase of the Union industry production capacity was\nreasonable and followed market developments, i.e. the increase in consumption.\nIt cannot therefore be considered as a cause of the injury suffered. \n(662)\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, on this basis, the\nargument that the Union industry did not invest in capacity expansion was not\nconfirmed during the investigation. To the contrary however, as mentioned\nabove, throughout the period considered the Union industry progressively\nincreased capacity and had available excess capacity throughout the period\nconsidered, indicating that it was capable of supplying additional demand.\nTherefore, this argument had to be rejected. \n(663)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that all operators in the market, including the ones in the downstream\nand upstream sectors were in a difficult situation which was due to the\novercapacity in the global market and the resulted change of the market. In\nthis regard it was argued that the product under investigation has become a\ncommodity where individual producers are not able anymore to set prices but\nwhere prices are subject to worldwide demand and supply. It was alleged that\nthis situation has caused the material injury of the Union industry rather than\nthe subsidised imports.\n(664)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation confirmed the\nexistence of overcapacity in the global market, mainly originating in the PRC.\nConcerning the market change that would allegedly bring the product under\ninvestigation to be a commodity, this would not justify unfair price behaviour\nand unfair trade practices. In this respect, it should be noted that the Union\nindustry has been producing and selling the product under investigation for\nmore than 20 years, while the PRC industry of the product concerned developed\nonly recently (around mid of last decade), mainly attracted by the\nfeed-in-tariffs and other policy incentives in Union and the subsequent\nincrease in demand. On these grounds, the arguments above were rejected.\n(665)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the overcapacity led to price rationalization. In this regard, it should\nbe noted, on the one hand, that the overcapacity led in fact to a \u2018race to the\nbottom\u2019 and the suppression of the prices of Union industry, which on average\nexceeded the reduction of the costs of production. On the other hand, the\ncapacity increases by the Union industry followed the market developments and\nwere considered reasonable. Moreover, the increase in production capacity of\ncells was at a lower level than modules. The claim in this regard had therefore\nto be rejected. \n(666)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry is due to the Union\nindustry\u2019s focus only on specialized investments and its failure to make the\nnecessary investments in capacity additions and cost reductions. Likewise, this\nclaim could not be confirmed by the findings of the investigation which showed\nthat the Union industry increased its production capacity and efficiency during\nthe period considered. This claim was therefore rejected.\n(667)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, an interested\nparty claimed that the Union industry increased its production capacity in\nspite of already low capacity utilisation rates, thus resulting in self-inflicted\ninjury. However this claim was based on the comparison between the trend of\ninvestments of the sampled Union producers and the trend of the capacity\nutilisation of the whole Union industry, which is not an appropriate basis for\ncomparison. Furthermore, the investigation showed that the Union industry had\nnot expanded its production capacities on a scale which exceeded the\ndevelopment of Union consumption, therefore this argument was rejected. \n(668)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the evidence\ncollected indicates that through investments in new machinery, the Union\nindustry could reduce its cost of production and become more cost competitive. Therefore,\nthis argument had to be rejected. \n(669)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, some interested parties contested that the capacity additions of\nthe Union industry were reasonable and followed market developments and in\nparticular the development of the Union consumption. However, as far as modules\nare concerned the production capacity increased by 106%, while the Union\nconsumption increased by 221% over the period considered, i.e. more than\ndouble. Likewise, as far as cells are concerned, the production capacity\nincreased by 39%, while the Union consumption increased by 87% during the\nperiod considered. This shows that the increase in capacity was substantially\nbelow the increase in consumption and can therefore not be considered as unreasonable\ngiven that there never was overcapacity in the Union. Moreover, the analysis\nwhether the capacity additions were reasonable should not be based on a year to\nyear analysis, but should take into consideration the trend during the whole\nperiod considered. Thus, capacity additions will typically only become fully\noperational after a certain period of time after the investment made and the\nisolated analysis of one year may lead to a distorted picture. This argument\nwas therefore rejected.\n5.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of raw material\nprices \n(670)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nclaimed that the material injury suffered by the Union industry was linked to\nthe evolution of prices of polysilicon, the main raw material for the\nproduction of wafers. It was argued that the Union industry concluded long term\nfixed priced supply contracts and could therefore not benefit from the decrease\nin polysilicon prices during the period considered.\n(671)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat although the Union industry had long term supply contracts for\npolysilicon, the terms of these contracts were mostly renegotiated based on the\nprice developments of polysilicon and contract prices reached levels close to\nor sometimes even lower than prices on the spot market.\n(672)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nargued that the Union industry or at least part of it could not benefit from\nthe decrease in prices of polysilicon, during the IP, because of long term\ncontracts for raw material. These parties claimed that the renegotiations or\ntermination of long term contracts of polysilicon and/or wafers resulted in\npenalties. To support this argument, these parties provided press articles\nreporting that some Union producers were facing litigation or that they\nterminated their contracts. Some parties provided information allegedly\nconfirming that the long term contracts could not be re-negotiated. \n(673)\u00a0\u00a0 Polysilicon is the main raw\nmaterial for the wafers producers. The investigation revealed that polysilicon\nprices increased in 2008 when they reached their peak at around 500$/kg, but\ndecreased again in 2009 reaching about 50-55 $/kg at the end of 2009 with only\na slight upwards trend in 2010 and early 2011. Prices dropped significantly\nduring the IP resulting in the 30$/kg (JRC Scientific and Policy Reports, PV\nStatus Report 2012). It should be noted that the impact of polysilicon prices\non the Union industry could only be rather marginal as any effect on the cost\nof production of cells and modules was diluted through the value chain.\nMoreover, the above mentioned press articles referred to post-IP developments,\nwhich did not affect the situation of the Union industry concerned during the\nIP, and cannot therefore be taken into account. It can be confirmed that the\nUnion industry was indeed able to renegotiate not only the prices of the\nlong-term contracts but also any contractual penalties relating to these\nlong-term contracts. \n(674)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested parties\nargued further that it is sufficient that only some Union producers have been\naffected by the long term contracts and that the situation of the overall Union\nindustry is irrelevant. It claimed that higher costs do not necessarily have to\naffect all operators in the same way. This argument ignores the finding that\noverall, for the Union industry, the average polysilicon prices were in many\ncases not found to be higher than the market prices or than the spot prices and\nthat therefore the issue whether higher costs affect all or only few operators\nwas not considered pertinent. This argument was therefore rejected.\n(675)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nrequested that the Commission separate, distinguish and quantify the effects of\neach factor having an impact on the situation of the Union industry; in\nparticular the effect of the significant drop in polysilicon prices should be\nconsidered separately. In this regard, it was argued that it was the decrease\nin the polysilicon prices rather than the price pressure from the Chinese\nimports that caused the decrease in sales prices. As far as the Union industry\nis concerned its average selling prices decreased much further than the\ndecrease of the average cost of production, on which the decline of raw\nmaterial prices could have an impact. This argument was therefore rejected.\n(676)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, some interested parties reiterated that the impact of the decrease\nof polysilicon prices on the Union industry\u2019s cost was not limited or diluted\nthrough the value chain as concluded in the investigation. However, as already\nmentioned in recital (255) above, polysilicon is the main raw material for\nwafers producers, thus any impact on the production cost of cells or modules\nwas found to be diluted in the value chain. The interested parties did not\nprovide any evidence which could have devaluated this finding. Moreover, the\ninvestigation showed that the decrease of polysilicon prices over the period\nconsidered was reflected in the average cost of production of cells and modules\nof the sampled Union industry which decreased to a similar degree than the\npolysilicon prices. One interested party questioned the impact of alleged\npenalties that the Union industry had to pay due to the re-negotiation of the\nsupplier contracts. In this regard, it cannot be excluded that some producers\nmay have had to pay penalties for the cancellation of wafers supply contracts\nduring the period considered. However, the Commission did not find any evidence\nthat these penalties could have had an effect on the situation of the Union\nindustry as a whole or would be representative. Such evidence was also not\nprovided by the interested party in question. While it can therefore not be\ncompletely excluded that penalties could have had a certain negative impact on limited\nnumber of Union producers, the overall impact on the Union industry is at best\nmarginal and hence could not break the causal link between the subsidised imports\nand the material injury suffered by the whole Union industry. Therefore, these\narguments had to be rejected.\n(677)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the decrease of sales prices of the product under investigation in\nthe Union is partly due to the reduction in the price of polysilicon. However,\nin this regard, it should be noted that the investigation showed that the\nimports from the PRC were subsidised and substantially undercutting the prices\nof the Union industry. The price decrease therefore goes beyond the reduction\nin production costs that can be explained by the decrease in the raw material\nprices. If the price decrease was merely the effect of the decrease of the raw\nmaterial prices, the Union industry would not have been forced to decrease\ntheir sales prices below their cost of production. Therefore, this claim has to\nbe rejected. \n(678)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nreiterated that the litigation of one Union producer after the IP may has\naffected the situation of at least this Union producer already during the IP.\nThis party did not explain however how and to what extend such event that\noccurred after the IP could indeed have had an effect on this producer\u2019s\nsituation during the IP. Likewise, the investigation did not reveal any\nevidence showing such effects. Therefore this claim had to be rejected.\n(679)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same\ninterested party questioned the above mentioned findings, as allegedly no\nevidence was shown. However, the findings of the investigation were based on\nfacts and positive evidence, non-confidential versions of which were available\nto all interested parties. \n(680)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nit is concluded that even if some specific Union producers may have been\naffected by long term contracts, the Union industry, overall, did not suffer\nfrom these long term contracts and was able to fully benefit from the price\ndecrease in raw material prices. The long term contracts were therefore not\nfound to break the causal link between the subsisdised imports and the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. \n5.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Self-inflicted injury:\nimpact of automation, size, economies of scale, consolidation, innovation, cost\nefficiency, imports of the Union industry\n(681)\u00a0\u00a0 Several\ninterested parties claimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry was\ndue to the high degree of automation of the production process. It was claimed\nthat the small-scale producers had a disadvantage compared to the larger\nvertically integrated producers and therefore any injury suffered by the small\nscale producers cannot be attributed to the subsidised imports. In this context\nit was also claimed that in any event, overall, the Union industry was of a\nsmall size and therefore was not able to benefit from economies of scale. \n(682)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that also the small-scale producers in Union market had a\nhigh level of automation in their production process with a positive effect to\ntheir production costs. Most Union producers have specialised in one part of\nthe production process (cells or modules), which, through specialisation,\nincreased their competitiveness with regard to the specific product type they\nwere producing. The argument that impact of the high degree automation caused\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry, had therefore to be rejected. \n(683)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the price pressure resulted in the consolidation of the Union\nindustry and the Chinese industry, the latter being the cause of the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. However, the investigation showed that\nthe consolidation was rather a consequence of the subsidised imports and the\nunfair trade practices. Furthermore, this party did not support with any\nevidence to what extend the consolidation process could have been the cause of\nthe injury suffered. \n(684)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\nit was claimed that the lack of vertical integration of the Union industry is\nthe cause of the injury suffered. In general the vertically integrated\nproducers in normal market conditions should have more security over their\nsupply chain. However, the investigation showed that the advantage of vertical\nintegration by part of the Union industry that was vertically integrated could\nnot be fully exploited as the price pressure from subsidised imports was\nextremely high. Moreover, the Union industry, even the vertically integrated\nUnion producers, due to the subsidized imports could not fully benefit from\nhigh capacity utilisation rates to achieve economies of scale. Furthermore, the\ninvestigation did not reveal any correlation between vertical integration and\nbetter profitability rates, as the high price pressure has altered this\ncorrelation. \n(685)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the Union industry lacked technical innovation as well as\ninvestments in new technology. However, the investigation did not bring to\nlight any factual evidence confirming these allegations. To the contrary, the\ninvestigation showed that the majority of the investments made by the Union\nindustry were dedicated to new machinery and R&D and that there are no\nmeaningful differences in technology between the products world-wide.\n(686)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, one interested\nparty claimed that the material injury suffered is due to the poor project\nexecution (failed projects). In this respect, it should be noted that the\nargument was not substantiated. In addition, any failed project could rather be\nconsidered as a consequence of the subsidised imports. The argument had\ntherefore to be rejected.\n(687)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nclaimed that the Union industry was not able to rationalize its costs in time\nto respond to the developments in the world market. Other parties claimed that\nlabour and overhead costs are higher in the Union than in the PRC.\n(688)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the cost of production of the Union industry was steadily decreasing\nduring the period considered. Productivity increased for modules and cells. As\nmentioned above, due to the surge of subsidised imports from the PRC and the\nconsequent significant price pressure on the Union market, the Union industry\nwas not able to benefit from the reductions in cost. \n(689)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the\nexporting producers in the PRC do not enjoy any comparative advantage with\nregard to raw materials (polysilicon) and the machinery used as both were\nmostly imported from the Union. As far as labour and overhead costs, including\ndepreciation are concerned, they represented on average less than 10 % of the\ntotal cost of a module in the IP and are not considered to have played any\nsignificant role. As far as electricity costs are concerned, they represented\non average less than 1 % of the total cost of a module in the IP and are not\nconsidered to have played any significant role. Moreover, the claim that the\nChinese were using the newest equipment was not substantiated.\n(690)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it was claimed\nthat some Union producers sourced cells and/or modules from the country\nconcerned, and re-sold those products on the Union market as their own. Injury\nresulting from these transactions should not be attributed to the subsidized imports.\nHowever, the investigation revealed that imports from the Union industry of the\nproduct concerned were complementary in nature as well as limited in terms of\nvolume when compared to the total Union production and therefore their effect,\nif any would only be marginal and could not be considered breaking the causal\nlink between the subsidized imports and the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry. \n(691)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in order to match\nthe decreasing price trend of the imports from the PRC, the Union industry had\nto make considerable efforts to rationalize its cost of production. Despite the\nefforts of the Union industry, this cost rationalization could not be reflected\nin the sales price due to the significant undercutting exerted by the\nsubsidised imports. \n(692)\u00a0\u00a0 Certain interested party\nclaimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the Union\nindustry\u2019s lack of sufficient economies of scale. It was argued that\nsmall-scale producers had a disadvantage compared to larger vertically\nintegrated producers and therefore any injury suffered by these producers\ncannot be attributed to the subsidised imports. Another interested party argued\nthat the automation of the production process is costly and that therefore\neconomies of scale are even more important to reduce the cost of production.\n(693)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat the Union industry, even the larger and vertically integrated ones, due to\nthe subsidised imports, could not fully benefit from high capacity utilization\nrates to achieve economies of scale. In any event, the investigation did not\nreveal any correlation between size, vertical integration and better\nprofitability rates, as the high price pressure from subsidised imports has\naltered this correlation. The investigation has showed that the benefit of\neconomies of scale no longer existed in a market where the utilization rates\nwere low, which was also true for the Chinese producers. Therefore, these\narguments were rejected. \n(694)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, one interested\nparty claimed that investors and banks would not finance projects if the module\nmanufacturer is too small, as larger producers provide better guarantees and\nare more \u2018bankable\u2019. In other terms, investors and banks are reluctant to\nfinance PV related projects using modules produced in the Union. However, the\ninvestigation showed that any possible preference of investors and banks to\nfinance Chinese producers which have larger production capacities is the result\nof the distortion that subsidised imports have created on the Union market. As\nmentioned above, the size of the production lines does not play a role if\nutilisation rates remain low. Therefore, this argument was dismissed \n(695)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the Union industry had an unfavourable cost structure compared to its\nChinese competitors, as the latter enjoyed lower labour, electricity and\ndepreciation costs, and in addition had the newest equipment. However, the\nparty concerned was unable to provide new information or supporting evidence that\ncould reverse the findings of this investigation in this regard. In particular,\nthe claim that the Chinese producers were using the newest equipment was\naddressed by the findings in recital (203) to the Provisional anti-dumping Regulation,\nstating that the exporting producers in the PRC did not enjoy any comparative\nadvantage, in particular because machinery and equipment was imported from the\nEuropean Union. The above claims were therefore rejected.\n(696)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe Chinese enjoyed a comparative advantage with regard to polysilicon prices\nand to economies of scales which resulted in lower cost of the machinery. This\nparty did not provide any new information or supporting evidence in this\nregard. The claim of this party had therefore to be rejected. \n(697)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, one interested\nparty claimed that some Union producers sourced cells and/or modules from the\ncountry concerned, and re-sold those products on the Union market as their own.\nIt requested that injury resulting from these transactions is not attributed to\nthe subsidised imports. However, the investigation revealed that imports from\nthe Union industry of the product concerned were complementary in nature as\nwell as limited in terms of volume when compared to the total Union production\nand therefore their effect, if any, would only be marginal and could not be\nconsidered as breaking the causal link between the subsidised imports and the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. \n(698)\u00a0\u00a0 One unrelated importer\nargued that the fact that the number of employees increased should be\nconsidered in the analysis. In respect of this claim, it is noted that\nemployment increased between 2009 and 2011 for modules and then decreased\nduring the IP. For cells, the employment increased until 2010 and then\ndecreased in 2011 and further decreased in the IP. It is further noted that for\nmodules, employment followed the trend of the Union production. For cells, as\nthe Chinese imports increased their market share during the entire period to\nthe detriment of the Union industry, the Union industry could not benefit from\nthe growing consumption as expected. Therefore, the employment decrease in 2011\nand in the IP corresponds to companies that either had become insolvent or\nstopped their cell production.\n(699)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure one interested party reiterated that the injury suffered by the\nUnion industry was due to the small scale and the lack of economies of scale.\nAs already explained in the recital (682) above and in recitals (195) and \u2013(196)\nto the provisional anti-dumping Regulation, even in the global market, the size\nand therefore the benefit of economies of scale cannot longer exist where the\nutilization rates were generally low, and where enormous overcapacities existed\nworld-wide. Therefore this claim had to be rejected. \n(700)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same party\nreiterated that the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the\ninability of the Union industry to realize any cost advantage. This party\nclaimed that this was in particular due the fact that most of the Union\nproducers were vertically integrated. However, this party did not provide any\nfurther information to what extend the fact that producers are vertically\nintegrated could have had a negative impact on their cost structure. Therefore this\nclaim had to be rejected\n(701)\u00a0\u00a0 On these grounds, all the\nabove mentioned arguments had to be rejected.\n5.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competition from thin film\nPV products and other PV technologies\n(702)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nclaimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry was caused by the\ncompetition from thin film PV products and other PV technologies, as these\ntechnologies were interchangeable and with same end use. It was also argued\nthat thin film was competing with the product under investigation especially\nfor ground-mounted and commercial/industrial rooftop systems, which constitute\na substantial part of the total Union PV market. \n(703)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that thin film PV products are produced from different raw\nmaterials and do not use crystalline silicon wafers. In general, they have much\nlower conversion efficiencies and a lower wattage output than crystalline\nsilicon modules. As a result, they cannot be used on restricted areas such as\nroof-tops, i.e. they are not fully interchangeable with the product concerned.\nThe investigation also showed that although thin film PV products are less\nexpensive than the product under investigation, they only capture a limited\nmarket share of the total Union solar market, during the period considered.\nTherefore, although there may be some competition between the thin film\nproducts and the product concerned, this competition is considered to be limited.\n(704)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated that the competition from thin film\nproducts likely caused the material injury suffered by the Union industry. In\nthis regard, the party submitted that in Germany the market share of thin film\nproducts in the total solar market was substantial during most of the IP and\nonly declined towards the beginning of 2012.\n(705)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nindeed that the average prices of thin film products were at lower levels than\nthe average price levels of the product under investigation. \n(706)\u00a0\u00a0 However, as set out in\nrecital (703) above thin film products have much lower conversion efficiencies\nand a lower wattage output than crystalline silicon modules and therefore\ncompetition between these product, if any, could not contribute to the injury\nof the Union industry, as crystalline silicon modules are the dominant\ntechnology in the Union solar market. The JRC PV Status Report 2012 stated that\nas a consequence of the drop in polysilicon prices, thin film has in the last\nyears lost market share to crystalline silicon modules. \n(707)\u00a0\u00a0 On these grounds, these arguments\nwere rejected. \n5.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0 Financial crisis and its\neffects\n(708)\u00a0\u00a0 It was claimed that the\nfinancial crisis and the economic recession had a negative effect on the access\nto finance for the Union industry and thus caused the injury suffered by the\nUnion industry.\n(709)\u00a0\u00a0 The ability of the Union\nindustry to raise capital decreased significantly during the period considered.\nAs the solar industry is capital intensive, the ability to raise capital is\ncrucial. The economic recession had a certain impact on the situation of the\nUnion industry. The investigation showed, however, that despite the growth of\nthe Union market between 2009 and 2011, the situation of the Union industry\ndeteriorated as a result of the subsidised imports from the PRC heavily\nundercutting the Union industry\u2019s sales prices. It was therefore concluded that\nthe potential effects of the financial crisis was aggravated by the increase of\nsubsidised imports from the PRC and that the limited access to finance was\nlargely a consequence of the negative market climate, the situation and\nprospects of the Union industry a consequence of the subsidised imports. \n(710)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover it was examined\nwhether the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the Union\u2019s\nindustry failure to seek appropriate financing while they were profitable. The\ninvestigation showed that e.g in 2010 that Union industry was still profitable,\nthe level of investment increased for modules by 315 % compared to 2009, while\nat the same time for cells by 10 %. As the PV industry is capital intensive, it\nis expected that the Union industry is continuously seeking appropriate\nfinancing in order to improve its cost efficiency and compete with the unfair subsidised\nimports. Therefore, it is concluded that, the lack of access to finance was a\nresult of the distorted situation and not the cause.\n(711)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated that the injurious effects of the\nfinancial crisis should be separated and distinguished and not be attributed to\nthe subsidised imports. This party referred to publicly available information\nindicating that at least one Union producer perceived the financial crisis as\nthe main cause for its injurious situation. The current investigation based its\nfindings on specific company data which go significantly beyond publicly\navailable statements of specific companies. Therefore, the publicly available\nstatement to which reference was made cannot devaluate the findings that while the\nfinancial crisis had a certain impact on the situation of the Union industry,\nit could not break the causal link between the subsidised imports and the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry. Therefore, this claim had to be\nrejected.\n(712)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the different access to financing between the Union industry as\ncompared to the Chinese exporting producers should be taken into consideration.\nThis party claimed that this was one of the main factors which caused the\nmaterial injury to the Union industry and not the subsidised imports. However,\nthe preferential access to financing of a number of Chinese exporting producers\nhas been found to distort the market and may well be one of the main reasons\nallowing Chinese exporting producers to export the product concerned at subsidised\nprices. This factor can therefore not break the causal link between the subsidised\nimports and the material injury suffered by the Union industry. This claim was\ntherefore rejected.\n(713)\u00a0\u00a0 On these grounds, it was\nconcluded that, while the financial crises had a certain impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry, it could not break the causal link between the\nsubsidised imports and the injury suffered by the Union industry. The arguments\nwere therefore rejected.\n5.3.11.\u00a0\u00a0 Export performance of the\nUnion industry\n(714)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the Union industry\u2019s export sales dropped significantly during the\nperiod considered and especially between 2009 and 2011 for modules and between\n2009 and first quarter of 2012 for cells and that this has caused the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. \n(715)\u00a0\u00a0 However, as shown in the\ntable below, the export volumes for modules remain significant despite a slight\ndecrease in the IP and average price levels during the IP were above the\naverage costs of modules throughout the period considered. Therefore, this\ncould not have caused the injury suffered by the Union industry. As for cells,\nthe export volumes represented only around 12 % of the total production volume\nof cells. Therefore, despite the low prices during the IP, this could only have\nhad limited impact on the situation of the Union industry. The arguments in\nthis respect had therefore to be rejected.\nTable\n13-a\nModules\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ||

industry\u2019s export performance was not such\nas to contribute to the material injury suffered by the Union industry.\nTherefore, the parties\u2019 arguments in this respect had to be rejected. \n5.3.12.\u00a0\u00a0 The discovery of shale gas\ndeposits in the Union\n(717)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party claimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry was\ncaused by the discovery of shale gas deposits in the Union and the prospect of\nincreasing production of cheap shale gas in the Union has reduced public and\nprivate investments in renewable energy projects.\n(718)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation found that\nthe consumption for the product under investigation increased substantially\nthroughout the period considered, as already mentioned in recital (509) above.\nMoreover, the investigation did not bring into light any factual evidence that\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the discovery of shale gas\ndeposits in the Union. The claim was therefore rejected. \n5.3.13.\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\u2019s\nEmissions Trading Scheme (ETS)\n(719)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party claimed that\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry was caused by the low investments in\nsolar energy production due to the low market prices for the European Union\u2019s\nEmissions Trading Scheme CO2 emission credits. \n(720)\u00a0\u00a0 No evidence was however\nprovided and the investigation did not bring into light any factual\ncircumstances confirming these allegations. To the contrary, the investigation\nshowed that the consumption of the product under investigation was increasing\nsubstantially during the period considered. On these grounds, the claim was\nrejected. \n5.3.14.\u00a0\u00a0 Management decisions\n(721)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the material injury suffered by at least one of the Union\nproducers was caused by a wrong management decisions. These allegations were\nbased on the annuals accounts, some information contained in a letter sent by a\nshareholder of the company to the other shareholders and a press article.\n(722)\u00a0\u00a0 None of the information in\nthe file showed that any of the management decisions of the company concerned\nwere unusual or imprudent or had an impact on the entire Union industry.\nTherefore, the arguments in this respect were rejected. \n5.3.15.\u00a0\u00a0 Other government policies\n(723)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the material injury suffered by the Union industry was caused by other\ngovernment policies such as renewable energy policies, policies aimed at\nencouraging innovation, policies of cutting red tape, trade facilitation\npolicies and grid access regulations, as these policies benefit the exporting\nproducers. However, even if it is true that certain of the claimed policies\nmight facilitate imports from other third countries and overall growth of solar\nindustry, these policies would also benefit the Union industry. Moreover, these\npolicies should not be meant that such imports in the Union should be made at\ninjurious subsidised prices. Therefore, the arguments in this respect were\nrejected. \n5.3.16.\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(724)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the forerunner disadvantage\nand the lack of political support from the European Commission in previous\nyears. This party also claimed that apart from the national support schemes,\nalso population, GDP, electricity consumption, financing opportunities and\nconnectability to the grid are important factors in each market. However, the\nabove party was not able to substantiate its claims which were therefore\nrejected. \n(725)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party reiterated that the injury suffered by\nthe Union industry was due to the forerunner disadvantage. However, the claim\nwas neither analysed nor substantiated; therefore it had to be rejected.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cumulative assessment of\nthose other factors that have been found to contribute to injury\n(726)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown\nthat the following other factors may have contributed to injury: Imports of the\nproduct concerned from Taiwan; Reduction in the level of FIT; Long-term polysilicon\ncontracts of a limited number of Union producers; the financial and economic\ncrisis.\n(727)\u00a0\u00a0 As has been shown above in\nsections 5.3.1 respectively 5.3.7, the possible contribution of imports from\nTaiwan and of long-term polysilicon contracts of a limited number of Union\nproducers are, at best, marginal, as any impact of them was further diluted\nthrough the value chain. \n(728)\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the economic\nand financial crisis, the investigation has shown that the main reason for\ndifficulties of the Union industry in accessing the capital needed for\ninvestments were the subsidised imports, which prevented the Union industry\nfrom selling its products at profitable prices when the Union market showed\nstrong growth rates (2009-2011).\n(729)\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to FIT, third\nparties have not been able to demonstrate that FIT levels during the IP would\nhave been so low that they would have prevented Union producers from selling\nthe product concerned at non-injurious prices. The Institutions take the view\nthat reductions in FIT levels may explain reduced demand, as investments in\ncertain locations were no longer viable. They cannot, however, break the causal\nlink, even taken together with the other factors that have been found to\ncontribute to injury, because they were still at a level at which, absent the subsidised\nimports, the Union producers could have sold their products at non-injurious\nprices.\n(730)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, even if the\ncumulative effect of the four other factors possibly contributing to injury is\nassessed, the causal link between subsidization and injury is not broken. \n5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation \n(731)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has\nestablished a causal link between the material injury suffered by the Union\nindustry and the subsidised imports from the PRC. Other possible causes of\ninjury, such as imports from other third countries, non subsidised imports from\nthe PRC, consumption, FITs, other financial support granted to the Union\nindustry, overcapacity, impact of raw material prices, self-inflicted injury,\ncompetition from thin-film, financial crisis and its effects, export\nperformance of the Union industry, the discovery of shale gas deposits in the\nUnion, managements decisions, the European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading Schemes,\nother government policies were analysed and none of them was found to be such\nas to break the causal link established between the subsidised imports from the\nPRC and the material injury suffered by the Union industry. \n(732)\u00a0\u00a0 All\nthe effects of the injury factors other than the subsidised imports have been\nindividually and collectively analysed. Therefore, it is concluded that the\ncollective assessment of all the factors that may have had an impact on the\ninjurious situation of the Union industry (i.e. imports of third countries,\nFITs, impact of raw material prices, financial crisis) collectively fail to\nexplain the injury suffered by the Union industry in particular in terms of low\nprices and financial losses due to the penetration of low priced imports in\nsignificant quantities of the product concerned from the PRC. Based on the\nabove analysis, which has properly distinguished and separated the effects of\nall known factors on the situation of the Union industry from the injurious\neffects of the subsidised imports, it was therefore concluded that there was a\ncausal link between the subsidised imports from the PRC and the material injury\nsuffered by the Union industry during the IP.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks \n(733)\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n31 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether, despite the above findings\non injurious subsidisation, compelling reasons existed for concluding that it\nwas not in the Union interest to adopt countervailing measures in this\nparticular case. For this purpose, and in accordance with Article 31(1) of the\nbasic Regulation, the analysis of the Union interest was based on an appreciation\nof all the various interests involved, including those of the Union industry,\ncompanies in the upstream and downstream markets of the PV sector, importers,\nusers and consumers of the product concerned.\n(734)\u00a0\u00a0 Around\n150 operators made themselves known after the initiation of the parallel\nanti-dumping investigation and were duly considered in the framework of the\ncurrent investigation. Specific questionnaires were sent to unrelated\nimporters, upstream operators (including a raw material producer and suppliers\nof production equipment for the product under investigation), downstream\noperators (including project developers and installers) and BEUC a consumer\norganisation. Three associations representing various operators (Union\nindustry, upstream and downstream operators) in the PV sector submitted\ninformation.\n(735)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nwas claimed that the assessment of the Union interest was not based on a\nrepresentative number of operators. \n(736)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission has contacted\nthe different operators in the following manner.\n(737)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nconcerns upstream and downstream operators: as mentioned above in recital (734),\nthe Commission sent specific questionnaires to about 150 operators including\nthose unrelated importers that had come forward after the initiation of the\ninvestigation, and which had therefore the opportunity to provide the relevant\ndata to the Commission. Twenty-one questionnaire replies were received. Moreover,\nnot only the replies to the questionnaires but also verifiable and duly\nsubstantiated comments and submissions provided by interested parties within\nthe deadlines were taken into consideration in the investigation, irrespective\nof whether or not these parties had replied to the questionnaire. In\nparticular, AFASE has transmitted to the Commission comments on behalf of its\nmembers - PV operators that were also analysed.\n(738)\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns unrelated\nimporters, as mentioned in recital (25) above, the Commission contacted all the\n250 unrelated importers made known by the complainant and selected a\nprovisional sample in accordance with Article 27 of the basic Regulation to\ncover the largest representative volume of imports which can reasonably be\ninvestigated within the time available. However, only one of the companies\nprovisionally selected was indeed, after verification, confirmed to be an\nunrelated importer. At a later stage of the investigation, further unrelated\nimporters, which had initially submitted a sampling form at the initiation\nstage but were not sampled, were invited to cooperate further with the investigation.\nSix of them agreed and received a questionnaire, and five submitted a reply out\nof which three were considered to be sufficiently complete. The definitive\nsample of unrelated importers therefore comprises four unrelated importers,\nrepresenting a range of 2 % to 5 % of the imports of the product concerned.\nWith regards to that low percentage, it has to be kept in mind that the\nmajority of imports of the product concerned into the Union does not take place\nvia unrelated importers.\n(739)\u00a0\u00a0 To sum up, for the analysis\nof Union interest, the following information has been relied on: \n\u2013              \nthe questionnaire replies received from eight\nsampled Union producers and four sampled unrelated importers as well as the\nreplies to the specific questionnaire received from eight upstream and thirteen\ndownstream operators (seven project developers/installers; six service\nproviders also active in the PV sector) out of 150 operators that had come\nforward after the initiation and received the specific questionnaires; \n\u2013              \nthe data verified during the on-site\nverifications at the premises of eight Union producers, one unrelated importer,\ntwo upstream operators, four downstream operators (project\ndevelopers/installers) and one association (see recital (17) to the provisional\nantidumping Regulation and recital (29) above)\n\u2013              \nthe data on Union interest submitted by other\ninterested parties, including associations, as well as publicly available data\non the evolution of the PV market in Europe, in particular: EPIA\u2019s Global\nMarket Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017. \n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(740)\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry directly\nemployed about 21 000 people in the IP in the production and sale of the like\nproduct. \n(741)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation\nestablished that the Union industry has suffered material injury caused by the\nsubsidised imports from the country concerned during the IP. It is recalled\nthat a number of injury indicators showed a negative trend during the period\nconsidered. In particular, injury indicators related to the financial performance\nof the cooperating Union producers, such as profitability, cash flow and return\non investments were seriously affected. In fact, the Union producers of modules\nand cells were loss making in 2011 and in the IP. Consequently, some Union\nproducers were already forced to close down their production facilities while\nsome others have faced insolvency. In the absence of measures, a further\ndeterioration in the Union industry\u2019s economic situation appears very likely.\n(742)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis expected that the imposition of countervailing measures duties will restore\nfair trade conditions on the Union market, allowing the Union industry to align\nthe prices of the like product to reflect the costs of production thus\nimproving its profitability. It can also be expected that the imposition of\ncountervailing measures would enable the Union industry to regain at least part\nof the market share lost during the period considered, with a positive impact\non its overall financial situation. Moreover the Union industry should be able\nto have better access to capital and to further invest in R & D and\ninnovation in the PV market. Finally, the investigation also pointed to a\npossible restarting of the business activity of the Union producers who were\nforced to stop the production as a result of the pressure of the Chinese\nimports. Overall, under this scenario, not only the existing 21 000 jobs of the\nUnion industry (in the IP) would be secured but there would also be a\nreasonable prospect for further production expansion and increase in employment.\n(743)\u00a0\u00a0 Should measures not be\nimposed, further losses in the market share are expected with a further\ndeterioration of the Union industry\u2019s profitability. This would be\nunsustainable in the short to medium-term. As a consequence, in addition to the\nlarge number of the Union producers that were already forced out of the market,\nother producers could be facing insolvency which would in the short to medium\nterm lead to a likely disappearance of the Union industry with the consequent\nsignificant impact of the existing jobs.\n(744)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\ncontested that the Union industry would be able to benefit from any\ncountervailing measures arguing that (i) the measures will lower the demand for\nPV products in the Union and therefore the Union industry will not be able to\nincrease their sales, (ii) the Union industry has small production facilities\nand is therefore not able to meet the demand of certain types of installations\nsuch as commercial rooftop and large ground-mounted installations, (iii) the\nUnion producers are not \u2018bankable\u2019 (iv) the imposition of duties on cells will de\nfacto increase the cost of production of the Union producers of modules and\nmake them less attractive for consumers, (v) in case of significant drop of\nChinese imports, the producers from other third countries will most likely take\nadvantage of the fewer imports from the PRC.\n(745)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the claim that\nmeasures will lower the demand for PV products in the Union and therefore the\nUnion industry will not be able to increase their sales, it is noted that the\nparties were unable to provide any verifiable evidence of the existence of a\ndirect link between the imposition of measures and the decrease demand for PV\nproduct which proved to be influenced over the years by several factors.\n(746)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the claim that\nthe Union industry has small production facilities and is therefore not able to\nmeet the demand of certain types of installations such as commercial rooftop\nand large ground-mounted installations, it should be noted that the\ninvestigation has showed that the Union industry has the capacity to supply\nboth the commercial and industrial-installations (between 40 KW and 1MW) and\nthe utility market segment- installations (1 MW and 10 MW). Moreover, the\ninvestigation did not reveal that products supplied by different manufacturers\ncould not be used in the same project. This claim was therefore rejected. \n(747)\u00a0\u00a0 The argument that the Union\nindustry would not benefit from the measures because Union producers are not \u201cbankable\u201d\nand that investments funds would not accept to finance projects using EU-made\nmodules was not substantiated. In any event, it is expected that the imposition\nof measures will restore fair market conditions which should reassure investors,\nincluding from the banking sector, as to the ability of Union industry to\ndevelop viable projects. On these grounds, this argument was rejected. \n(748)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nreference to the claim that the imposition of duties on cells will de facto\nincrease the cost of production of the Union producers of modules and make them\nless attractive for consumers, while it is not excluded that a certain increase\nin prices could occur further to the imposition of duties, it should also be\nconsidered that public available sources indicate that the price trend of\nmodules and cells is downward. Thus, even if the cost of cells might increase\nas a result of measures, the overall decreasing trend of prices should result\nin decreasing costs of modules. The producers in question may also decide to\nsource their cells in the Union, and no longer from the PRC. Finally, it is\nexpected that the imposition of measures will increase the capacity utilization\nof cells producers in the Union thus increasing their economy of scale and as a\nconsequence reduce costs. This claim was therefore rejected. \n(749)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nargument that in case of a significant drop of Chinese imports further to the\nimposition of measures, the other third countries will most likely take\nadvantage of this, rather than the Union industry was not confirmed by the\ninvestigation. The investigation did not reveal any clear indications that the\nother third countries would direct their exports massively to the Union market,\nin particular taking into account the likely expansion of other third country markets,\nnotably in Asia, as forecasted by publicly available sources. Finally, there is\nno indication that even if imports from other third countries would increase as\na result of a drop of Chinese imports, the Union industry will not be able to\ncompete with imports from these countries.\n(750)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the final disclosure some parties argued that it is unrealistic to\nexpect the emergence of a sustainable Union industry manufacturing modules and cells\nbecause there is no rational investor that would invest in the Union producers\nthat allegedly suffer from an unfavourable cost structure and can therefore not\nproduce at competitive prices. The investigation did not confirm that the Union\nindustry is suffering from an unfavourable costs structure, as explained in\nrecitals (202) and (203) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation. Therefore,\nabsent subsidized imports and utilising the production capacities to a larger\nextent should bring economies of scale and allow for the emergence of a\nsustainable Union industry. In view of the above the argument was rejected.\n(751)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\ndemand in the Union is driven by the development of FITs and the expected\nreturn on investment by the investors is linked to this development. In\nparticular, it claimed that, if prices increase in the Union, as a consequence\nof the duties, and FITs do not follow this increase accordingly, demand will\ndecrease and the Union industry will not benefit from the duties imposed. \n(752)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the above claim, it is noted that despite the correlation between the\nlevel of FITs and the demand for PV installations, the evidence collected\nduring the investigation indicates that future demand will be less and less\ndependent on FITs and other support schemes as PV grid parity is likely to have\nbeen reached by certain types of installations in several places in the Union.\nFurthermore, the expected return on investment should be based on fair market\nprices. Finally, while it is not excluded that a certain increase in prices may\noccur further to the imposition of measures, it should be noted that public\navailable sources indicate that the overall price trend is downward. The\nargument was therefore rejected.\n(753)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties have\npointed out that because demand for solar panels is driven by support schemes,\nin particular FIT, and by the level of electricity prices for the final\nconsumer (which determine grid parity), price elasticity of demand can be very\nhigh. Whereas it is correct that an important increase in prices may lead to an\nimportant reduction of demand because of the particular nature of the market\npointed out by those interested parties, the argument has to be rejected\nbecause it is very unlikely that price increases caused by the measures will be\nimportant, for the following reasons. First of all, all available sources\nconfirm that the important decrease in prices for the product concerned\nthroughout the IP and since the IP until today will continue. Secondly, the\neconomic effect of the undertaking that has been accepted by the Commission is\nthat Chinese exporting producers will supply the product concerned at a minimum\nimport price of less than 60 c/W, which is far below the price that has been\nobserved during the IP, at a volume that corresponds roughly to their current\nmarket share. At this price level, demand is very unlikely to drop in a\nsignificant manner, as that price level ensures sufficient demand both under\nthe current level of support provided by support schemes and under the current\nlevels of grid parity. Furthermore, the price of electricity for final\nconsumers is expected to increase, whereas the price of the product concerned\nis expected to decrease. Through an indexation formula, the undertaking ensures\nthat further price decreases of the product concerned are taken into account\nfor the minimum import price. Therefore, those arguments have to be rejected.\n(754)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties argued\nthat the interest of the Union industry is not significant since the value\nadded created by the upstream and downstream industries is far more significant\nthan the value added created by the Union industry in the PV value chain. The\nargument that the various segments in the PV sector have a different added\nvalue is not disputed. The investigation established that the Union industry\nhas suffered material injury caused by unfair trade practices. Indeed some\nUnion producers have already been forced to close down and in the absence of\nmeasures, a further deterioration appears certain. As all segments in the PV\nsector are closely interrelated, the disappearance of the Union production\nwould be detrimental to the whole PV sector making it fully dependent on\noutsourced supply. Therefore, also for reasons of security of supply, the\nargument was therefore rejected.\n(755)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the final disclosure, one interested party reiterated the claim that the\nhigher value-added created by the upstream and downstream industry, as compared\nto the Union industry of the product concerned, is relevant to whether\ncountervailing duties should be imposed. In this respect, it is confirmed that in\nassessing the Union interest the Institutions did balance the positive and\nnegative consequences the duties may have on the various economic operators.\nWhereas the impact on the upstream and downstream industry is limited, the\nmeasures will afford the Union industry the possibility to recover from\ninjurious subsidisation.\n(756)\u00a0\u00a0 One party contested the\nnumber of jobs that would be secured by the imposition of measures. It claimed\nthat the Union industry employs about 6 000 people, and not 25 000 as reported\nin recital (229) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation. \n(757)\u00a0\u00a0 No evidence was however\nprovided to support the above claim and therefore it was dismissed. It is\nclarified that in view of the exclusion of wafers from the product scope, the\nemployment in the Union industry amounted to around 21 000 employees during the\nIP. Interested parties did not provide any proof that the number of employees\nin the Union industry has changed significantly post-IP.\n(758)\u00a0\u00a0 In conclusion, the\ninvestigation proved that the Union industry suffered material injury from the subsidized\nimports from the PRC, being unable to recoup the investment through profitable\nsales. It is expected that the imposition of measures will restore fair trade\nconditions on the Union market, allowing the Union industry to compete on equal\nfooting. The likely decrease in imports from the PRC should enable the Union\nindustry to increase their sales in the Union and thus better utilise the\navailable production capacities in the short term. This in turn may bring\neconomies of scale. While it is possible that the prices of the like product\nwill raise in a short period of time due to the measures, the overall descending\nprice trend is likely to be maintained also thanks, on the one hand, to the\nfurther decrease of cost of production of the product under investigation, and,\non the other hand, the competitive pressure from the third countries'\nproducers, which would also compete in the Union market.\n(759)\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore concluded\nthat the imposition of definitive countervailing measures would be in the\ninterest of the Union industry.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters\n(760)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (26)\nabove the situation of the sampled importers was analysed.\n(761)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall,\nduring the IP, the activity of the four cooperating unrelated\nimporters related to the product concerned varied\nbetween 60 % and 100 % of their total business. In addition, the four\ncooperating unrelated importers sourced from the PRC between 16 % to 100 % of\ntheir total imports of modules, only one sourcing exclusively from the country\nconcerned. The profitability of the four cooperating unrelated\nimporters related to the product concerned was on\naverage 2.3 % in the IP.\n(762)\u00a0\u00a0 An argument was put forward\nthat the imposition of measures on the product concerned will negatively affect\nthe importers\u2019 business activity. Firstly, the imposition of duties should not\nresult in the elimination of all imports from the PRC. Secondly, although it\ncan be expected that the imposition of measures may have a negative effect on\nthe financial situation of the importers importing only from the PRC, in view\nof the possible increase of imports from other third countries, the importers\nsourcing from the PRC should be in the position to shift their sources of\nsupply.\n(763)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the impact of the duties on the unrelated importers was underestimated as\nthere are no immediate alternative sources of supply that could replace the\nChinese imports of the product concerned if the duties were imposed and that\nchanging a source of supply is difficult in view of the fact that the major\nproduction is based in the PRC and this would entail additional significant\ncosts. \n(764)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nrecalled that the imposition of measures should not result in the disappearance\nof the imports of the product concerned from the PRC. The investigation indicated\nthat the possible decrease of imports from the PRC will impact in particular\nthose importers that source the product concerned exclusively from the PRC,\nwhich is the case only for one out of the four cooperating unrelated importers.\nConcerning the impact of measures on the unrelated importers' financial\nsituation, it was not excluded that it can be negative, but it has been\nconcluded that this will largely depend on their capacity to switch sources of\nsupply or to pass at least part of the possible price increase on to their\ncustomers. For operators importing the product also from other sources than the\nPRC or importing also other products than the product concerned the negative\nimpact will be further limited. The Commission therefore considers that\nalthough there is likely to be a negative impact on the importers of the\nproduct concerned, this impact will, on average, remain limited.\n(765)\u00a0\u00a0 One unrelated importer\nargued that it needs significant working time and financial investment before\naccepting the products of a new supplier. In this respect a claim was made in\nreply to the final disclosure that relevant evidence was provided to the\nverification team at the time of the on-the-spot visit on the long testing\nrequirement that an importer must do before taking the decision to supply from\na particular exporter. \n(766)\u00a0\u00a0 It is acknowledged that the setting\nof a new relationship between an importer and a supplier may entail additional\ncosts and time investment (e.g. in testing the product). However, this does not\noutweigh the need to restore fair competition in the market.. At the same time,\nchanging suppliers seems to be a normal risk calculated in an importers'\nprofessional activity and is related to the fact that the PV market is maturing\nand thus undergoes constant changes (e.g. bankruptcies, consolidations)\nrequiring switching to new suppliers. Moreover, it can be assumed that new\ntypes of modules that reach the market on a constant basis (containing e.g. new\nefficiency characteristics) also require testing. In this respect, testing of a\nnew product (even from the same supplier) appears to be a standard rather than\nan unusual activity. The argument is therefore rejected.\n(767)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure two parties reiterated the claim that the interest of the unrelated\nimporters was not properly considered. One party claimed that the lack of the\nnon-confidential version of the replies to the questionnaires by the additional\ncooperating importers did not allow a proper assessment by the parties. It\nquestioned the Commission's assessment regarding the possibility that other third\ncountry imports in the Union would increase thus allowing the importers to\nswitch their supplies, on the basis of the allegation that other third markets\nare booming. To this end, the party claimed that such assumption is in\ncontradiction with the conclusion set out in recital (749) above i.e .that , imports\nfrom other third countries would not be massive. Another party questioned\nwhether the Commission respected the principle of non-discrimination as the\nUnion producers were given more prominence in the Commission's assessment than\nthe other operators.\n(768)\u00a0\u00a0 First, it is confirmed that\nthe non-confidential version of the replies to the questionnaires received\nafter the publication of the provisional anti-dumping Regulation by the\nadditional cooperating importers was included in the file for consultation by\ninterested parties. Secondly, there is no contradiction between the assumption\nthat the imports from other third countries can increase in response to lower\nimports from the PRC and that such increase should not be massive in view of\nthe growing demand for PV installations world-wide. At the same time, as the\nUnion industry is expected to retake a certain part of the market share that\nwas previously held by products from the PRC, a certain loss in business for\nunrelated importers cannot be excluded. However, it is observed that the\noverall size of the PV market is expected to continue to grow in the long term,\nas grid parity is reached in more and more locations. Finally, it is clarified\nthat, as in all trade defence investigations, while the situation of the Union\nindustry was assessed in order to establish if it suffered material injury due\nto the subsidised imports, in the context of the Union interest analysis the\ninterest of the Union industry was assessed on an equal basis to the other\neconomic operators, including the unrelated importers. It is also clarified\nthat the investigation whether or not the Union industry suffered material\ninjury is governed in particular by Article 8(4) to the basic Regulation which\nset the minimum standards of such investigation. The Union interest is only\nanalysed once a positive determination of injurious subsidisation was made in\naccordance with the standards set out in Article 31 to the basic Regulation. As\na result it was considered that the likely negative impact of the measures on\ncertain importers, in particular those sourcing exclusively from the PRC, did\nnot outweigh the benefits of the measures for the Union industry and the mid-\nand long term benefits to the Union PV market resulting from fair competition.\n(769)\u00a0\u00a0 It was therefore concluded\nthat the imposition of measures at the proposed level may have a certain\nnegative impact on the situation of unrelated importers of the product\nconcerned.\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the upstream\noperators\n(770)\u00a0\u00a0 The upstream operators are\nmainly active in the production of the raw materials and in the production and\nengineering of the manufacturing equipment for the product under investigation.\nEight replies were received to the questionnaires from the upstream operators.\nTwo verification visits were carried out covering a raw material producer and a\nproducer of manufacturing equipment.\n(771)\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, during the IP, the\nactivity of the eight cooperating upstream operators related to the product\nunder investigation varied in proportion to their total activity and only for\none cooperating company represented 100 % of its business, while for the others\nit varied between 6 % and 80 %. On average, in the IP, the activity related to\nthe product concerned represented around 41 % of the total activity of the\ncooperating upstream operators. In terms of jobs, the eight cooperating\nupstream operators employed in the IP about 4 200 people. Profitability varied\naccording to segment and individual company from high rates to slightly\nnegative profitability. The investigation showed that those operators with a\nnegative profitability suffered from the deteriorated situation of the Union\nindustry, as some of the clients they lost were Union producers of the product\nunder investigation, and from the decline in consumption. Following the\nexclusion of wafers from the product scope, the producers in the Union of this\nproduct should benefit from the imposition of duties, since the Union industry\nis expected to increase its production of cells and modules. \n(772)\u00a0\u00a0 The sales of the Union\nupstream operators covered the Union, the PRC and other third countries. In the\nIP, the repartition of the sales corresponded on average to around 20 % of\nsales in the Union, almost 50 % to the PRC and around 30 % to other third\ncountries.\n(773)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties in the upstream\nsector claimed that the imposition of countervailing measures would affect\ntheir business activities negatively as the PRC is their main exporting market.\nIt was argued that the duties would seriously limit the imports of the product\nconcerned from the PRC to the Union as a result of which the PRC would limit\nthe imports of polysilicon and production equipment from the Union. As a\nconsequence, the Union upstream operators in the Union would allegedly need to\nscale down their business activities and reduce employment. \n(774)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the aim of\nthe duty is not to eliminate the Chinese imports of the product concerned but\nto restore a level playing field. Thus, the Chinese imports should continue to\nsupply the Union market to a certain degree, but at fair prices. Furthermore,\nthe investigation showed that the Union upstream operators are present globally\non different national markets and therefore do not depend exclusively on their export\nto the PRC. It is thus reasonable to assume that in the global PV market, Union\nupstream operators would likely be able to compensate the eventual decrease in\nthe export to the PRC by the export to the other markets which according to\npublicly available market studies are expected to grow. In any case, the\nChinese PV market is already facing a significant production overcapacity and\ntherefore it is doubtful whether the Union machinery producers would be able to\nsell much more of manufacturing equipment in the short to medium term in the\nPRC.\n(775)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties made the\nargument that a majority of inputs in the PV value chain comes from the Union\nand that such advantageous situation may cease should the duties be imposed. In\nreply to the final disclosure one party pointed out that the measures in this\ncase may trigger other measures, which the PRC may impose on the Union\nproducts.\n(776)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, Chinese\nimports are expected to continue to supply the Union market even with duties in\nplace. In addition, various publicly available sources in the PV sector, such\nas EPIA\u2019s Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017, forecast that the\npossible contraction in demand in the Union should be only in the short-term\n(in 2013 and 2014) and that consumption in the Union will increase again in the\nfollowing years. Furthermore, addressing unfair trade practises is likely to allow\nbuilding a sustainable growth in the PV market in the Union in the mid and\nlong-term, from which all operators in the Union should benefit. Finally, as\nregards the argument on the possible retaliation of the PRC in reply to the\nmeasures in this case, it is recalled that the PRC as any other WTO member, may\nhave a recourse to trade defence investigations only in justified circumstances\nand any such investigation has to comply with strict WTO rules. The Commission monitors\nany such investigation to ensure that the WTO rules are respected. The argument\nwas therefore rejected.\n(777)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties contested the\nargument that the decreased exports of Union PV upstream operators to the PRC\nmight be compensated by exports to other markets arguing that the duties will\ndecrease the world-wide demand for the product. \n(778)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it is firstly noted that Chinese imports are not expected to\ncease completely as a result of the duties. In addition, the information\ncollected in the course of the investigation did not establish any correlation\nbetween the development of the imports from the PRC in the Union market and the\nexports from the PRC to other markets. Moreover, public available sources, such\nas EPIA\u2019s Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017, forecast that the\nPV market world-wide will grow in the next years. As far as the Chinese PV market\nis concerned, there are indications that the domestic consumption in the PRC\nwill increase substantially (e.g. as indicated by EPIA). In view of the above,\nthe exports of the Union upstream operators to the PRC are not expected to drop\nsignificantly as a consequence of the imposition of measures.\n(779)\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be noted that\nthe contraction of demand in the Union in 2013 and 2014 may have a negative\nimpact on the upstream operators. This however cannot be linked, at least not\nfor its major part, to the duties. Moreover, concerning the Union producers of\nmachinery for the PV industry, due to the existing substantial spare capacity\nin the PRC, it is unlikely that their exports to the PRC can significantly\nincrease even under the scenario that the Chinese producers increase their production\nvolume. Finally, the information gathered during the investigation indicated\nthat the machinery producers may also be impacted by the Chinese 12th\nfive-year plan for Solar Photovoltaic Industry which foresees that by 2015 80 %\nof the manufacturing equipment for cells should come from the PRC. As long as\nthis change is achieved in compliance with WTO rules, this may also further\nlimit the possibility of manufacturers of machinery in the Union to compete in\nthe Chinese market. The above argument was therefore rejected. \n(780)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure the GOC argued that the 12th five-year plan for the Solar\nPhotovoltaic Industry offers only some general guiding principles that are not\nbinding as there are no enforcement powers foreseen, and that therefore it\nshould not be considered as an indication that the possibility of manufacturers\nof machinery in the Union to compete in the Chinese market will be limited. In\nthis respect it is noted that the GOC included the PV industry amongst strategic industries in the 12th\nfive-year plan and also issued a specific plan for the solar photovoltaic\nindustry. In this plan the GOC expressed its support for \u201csuperior\nenterprises\u201d and \u201ckey enterprises\u201d, committed itself to \u201cpromote\nthe implementation of various photovoltaic support policies\u201d, and \u201cformulate\noverall preparation of supporting policies on industry, finance, taxation \u2026\u201d.\nFurthermore, as the plan contains\nessential directives to be achieved by the Chinese industry during the period\nof five years it has a deep\nimpact on the business landscape, both within the PRC and in countries that do\nbusiness with the PRC. Considering the above,\nthere are clear indications that the freedom of choice of the Chinese\nmanufacturers of cells and the competitive pressure of the Union producers of\nthe manufacturing equipment exporting to the Chinese market is restricted by\nthe plan. Therefore this argument was rejected.\n(781)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating raw material\nproducer contested the prospect of other markets compensation for the decreased\nproduction on the Chinese market, in view of the substantial installed\nproduction capacity in the PRC, which could not be easily built elsewhere. This\nargument is dismissed since there are no indications of the alleged decreased\nproduction on the Chinese market.\n(782)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\ncontested the number of employees in the upstream sector quoted in recital\n(236) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation. It is clarified that the\nnumber of 4 200 employees only refers to the cooperating upstream operators,\nsuch as equipment manufacturers and polysilicon supplier, based on their\nquestionnaire replies, and not to the whole sector. \n(783)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that the impact of the countervailing measures on the machinery producers\nwould not be significant, while the impact on the raw material supplier may be\nnegative in the short term in view of the possible reduction of its sales to\nthe PRC. \n6.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of downstream\noperators\n(784)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ndownstream operators are mainly active in project development, marketing, communications\nand PV installations. Thirteen replies to the downstream questionnaires were\nreceived from the downstream operators, i.e. seven from operators whose\nactivity is directly related to the like product (namely the project developers\nand installers) and six from service providers in the PV sector (logistics,\ntransport, public relations, etc.) i.e. operators whose activity is not\ndirectly related to the product under investigation. These questionnaire\nreplies included the reply received from one unrelated importers which turned\nout to qualify as downstream operator, as its main activity is installation\n(see recital (25) above).\n(785)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrecital (242) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation, it was assessed that\noverall, the activity of the downstream operators (installers and project\ndevelopers) in relation to the product under investigation varied as compared\nto their total activity. On average, in the IP, it represented 41 %. The\nprofitability of the cooperating operators related to the product under\ninvestigation was on average around 11 %, in the IP. In terms of jobs, the\nseven cooperating downstream operators employed in the IP about 550 people.\n(786)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe representativity of the data concerning the downstream operators on\nturnover, profitability and employment derived by the Commission from the\nreplies to the questionnaires by the seven downstream operators. AFASE\nsubmitted a \u2018survey\u2019 conducted amongst its members (installers) to illustrate\nthat for the majority of the installers the PV business constitutes a primary\nsource of income. AFASE further alleged that the downstream operators, in\nparticular installers, in contrast to the findings set out in recital (242) to\nthe provisional anti-dumping Regulation would only realise one-digit profit\nmargins which do not allow for absorption of any duties. \n(787)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the\nrepresentativity of the data used in the provisional anti-dumping Regulation the\nCommission has used all the data provided by those downstream operators that\nhave filled in the specific questionnaire, as well as the submissions provided\nby AFASE, as explained in recital (737) above. \n(788)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the claim that\nthe PV business constitutes a primary source of income for installers, further\nanalysis of the questionnaire replies submitted by the seven downstream\noperators (installers and project developers) confirmed that the activity\ndirectly related to the like product under investigation represented on average\naround 42% of the total activity of these operators and the profitability equalled\n11 % on average. However, when taking into account also their activities (not directly\nrelated to the product under investigation), their overall importance increases\nsubstantially for three out of the seven operators. As a result, the\ncorresponding ratio would range from around 45 % to 100 % during the IP. In\naddition, for the seven operators (installers and project developers) the\nprofitability of the PV activity including the activities not directly linked\nto the product under investigation would amount to 9% on average. Employment-wise,\nthe PV activity including the activities not directly linked to the product under\ninvestigation would amount to around 660 full-time jobs in the IP for the seven\noperators. Apart from PV projects and installations these operators were also\nactive in wind energy installations and production of electrical equipment. \n(789)\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that any\nimpact of measures on the downstream operators has to be primarily assessed on\ntheir activity directly related to the product under investigation which in the\nIP reached a profitability of 11 % on average. However, even if it is assessed\non the basis of the overall PV activity not directly related to the product under\ninvestigation the conclusions will not change significantly since, overall, the\nvarious factors taken into account, namely profitability and possibility to\nabsorb part of the duty, do not vary significantly (the profitability decreases\nfrom 11 % on average to 9 % on average). In reply to the final disclosure one\nparty on which premises the Commission had carried out a verification visit\ncontested the representativity of the conclusion on profitability of the\ninstallers and developers, which, as far as it is concerned, would allegedly be\nbased only on a single transaction. This argument is dismissed as the\nCommission calculated the profitability of the downstream operators, on the\nbasis of all data submitted by the downstream operators in their questionnaire\nreplies.\n(790)\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the survey\nconducted by AFASE amongst its members, it is firstly noted that all operators\nhad the opportunity to come forward at the initiation of the investigation and\nto reply to the specific questionnaire designed for downstream operators\nrequesting the necessary information for the assessment of the impact of duties\non these operators. Secondly, the identity of the installers was not provided\nin the survey which did not allow for a verification of e.g. the relevance and\nreliability of the data provided. Thirdly, while a number of questions asked in\nthis survey concerned the installers' capacity to absorb the possible duties,\nthe survey lacked any reference to the profit achieved by these installers in\nthe IP, thus missing an important element for the evaluation of the impact of\nmeasures. As a consequence no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from the\nsurvey provided. \n(791)\u00a0\u00a0 An\nargument was raised that measures are not in the interest of the Union as they\nwill increase the price of modules, thus discouraging the end-users/consumers\nfrom making installations. Consequently, the downstream operators would have\nfar fewer orders and would have to scale down their businesses. This assessment\nwas based on a study made by Prognos on the possible loss of jobs submitted in\nthe course of investigation. The study foresees that the great majority of jobs\nin the PV market of the Union are in danger, if duties are imposed. The study\nuses an estimation by the EPIA according to which the total number of direct\njobs existing in 2011 at all stages of the Union PV market including Union\nproducers, importers, the upstream and downstream operators is 265 000. Taking\nas a starting point the 2011 estimation on the total direct PV jobs, the study\nby Prognos concluded that out of 265 000 jobs up to 242 000 jobs will be lost\nin three years, depending on the level of duties. Most of the job losses will\nallegedly occur in the downstream market, which in 2011 was said by Prognos to\nemploy about 220 000 people.\n(792)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation did not confirm the above scenario and pointed to a much lower\nnumber of direct jobs existing in the Union PV market in 2011, during the IP\nand in 2012.\n(793)\u00a0\u00a0 To start with, the\ninvestigation raised doubt as to the accuracy of the total number of direct PV\njobs as estimated by EPIA. In particular, during the verification visit at the\nEPIA, it turned out that the underlying data leading to a conclusion of 265 000\nwas imprecise and did not allow for such conclusion. In fact, the information\nobtained during the verification visit indicates that the number of direct PV\njobs calculated for 2011 would have a margin of error of up to 20 %. In\naddition, the estimation includes employment in other European countries\noutside the Union as well the employment related to thin film product, which\nfalls outside the scope of this investigation. \n(794)\u00a0\u00a0 It is clarified that the\nmargin of error of 20 % in the total number of direct PV jobs as estimated by\nthe European PV association, which may apply upward or downward, became\napparent during the verification visit at EPIA. It shows the difficulty to\nassess precise figures on employment in the downstream sector as there are few\nsources, often contradictory, of data collection. \n(795)\u00a0\u00a0 Despite these doubts, even\nif the original estimation of jobs was used to analyse the impact on the\nmeasures the following remarks must be made. The estimation covers the European\nPV jobs in 2011, which was correlated with a very high number of PV\ninstallations in the Union that year (about 20 GW). It is reasonable to assume\nthat in view of the decline in installations reaching about 17,5 GW in the IP\nand 15 GW in 2012 the number of downstream jobs in particular, as directly\ncorrelated to the level of installations decreased accordingly. To this end,\npublicly available specialised press indicated that in Germany, the largest\nnational market, between 2011 and 2012 the employment in the PV sector\ndecreased from 128 000 to 100 000, including the jobs on the side of the producers.\nFurthermore, the investigation raised serious doubts on whether the figure\nincluded only full time jobs dedicated solely to the PV industry. To this end,\nthe investigation revealed that, especially in the downstream market\n(installations) the PV activity is in general only a part of a much broader\nbusiness activity, primary business activity being heating or electricity\ninstallations, plumbing etc. \n(796)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nlikely that the imposition of measures may lead to an increase of prices in the\nUnion of the product under the investigation thus possibly generating less PV\ninstallations in the short term. Nevertheless the jobs in this part of the\nmarket may be negatively affected only to a limited extent in view of the\nfollowing. Firstly, the PV related activity for at least some of the installers\nconstitutes only part of their business activities and is also seasonal.\nTherefore, the installers should be able to carry out other activities in a situation\nof reduced demand for PV installations. As the renewable and energy efficiency\nobjectives agreed at the level of the Union are legally binding on Member\nStates, it is to be expected that reduced demand for solar installations will\ntranslate into increased demand for other forms of renewable electricity and\nenergy efficiency. Many of the employees in the downstream sector are likely to\nhave the skills necessary to benefit from the increased demand in these\nneighbouring sectors. Secondly, in view of the existing profits in the\ndownstream market (see recital (785) above) installers should be able to absorb\npart of the price increase thus limiting the impact on the final prices and on\nthe demand for PV installations.\n(797)\u00a0\u00a0 Independently of the\nimposition of duties, the publicly available forecasts on the demand for the PV\ninstallations indicate a likely contraction in demand in 2013, with annual\ninstallations of between 9,8 GW and 16,5 GW in 2013, which would likely have in\nany event a negative impact on the number of jobs in the downstream market.\n(798)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, it is remarked that\nthe possible increase of PV prices would be likely to happen in any event as\nthe production of the PRC supplying the Union market appears to be largely\nloss-making, which is an unsustainable situation. \n(799)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfar as job losses are concerned, the information gathered during the\ninvestigation confirmed that the downstream sector has been experiencing job\nlosses as a result of the contraction of the demand for PV installations in the\nUnion of about 5 GW between 2011 and 2012. These job losses cannot be linked to\nthe measures as they reflected a market evolution. Moreover, a further\ncontraction of demand is foreseen in 2013 and 2014 and will most likely result\nin further job losses in the PV sector. Similarly, such evolution of the demand\nwas forecasted by major research centres before the initiation of the\ninvestigation and therefore such job losses cannot be attributed to the\nimposition of measures.\n(800)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion industry submitted a study by a consultant PriceWaterHouseCoopers (\u2018PWC\u2019)\non the possible impact of measure on PV related jobs. The PWC study refers to the\nstudy by Prognos, which envisaged high job losses in the PV market resulting\nfrom the imposition of measures, which was submitted by AFASE prior to the imposition\nof provisional anti-dumping duties and which was addressed in recital (791) above.\nThe PWC study criticised the study by Prognos pointing to the fact that the\ntotal job losses estimated by Prognos exceeded in fact the total number of\nexisting PV jobs in the Union. Regarding the impact of duties in the Union\nmarket, PWC reached opposite conclusions than Prognos, forecasting a net\npositive impact on jobs in the Union and that the benefits outweigh the\npossible negative effects of the duties (e.g. on demand). \n(801)\u00a0\u00a0 AFASE argued that the\nCommission did not disclose the source of the margin of error of 20 % for the\ndirect PV jobs calculated for 2011 by EPIA. \n(802)\u00a0\u00a0 This margin of error of 20%,\nwhich may apply upward or downward, became apparent during the verification\nvisit at EPIA. It shows the difficulty to assess precise figures on employment\nin the downstream sector as there are few sources, often contradictory, of data\ncollection. \n(803)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the final disclosure some parties claimed that\nthe Commission's analysis was silent about the fact that the duties will only\nadd to the loss of jobs resulting from the smaller number of PV installations\nafter 2011. It was argued that such job losses, in particular in the downstream\nsector, are closely linked to the fact that the PV installers are dependent on\nthe solar installations. In addition, AFASE criticised the Commission for not\nhaving properly considered the survey it conducted amongst its members and a\nsimilar survey conducted by a UK Solar Trade Association, which allegedly\nillustrated such dependence. \n(804)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged\nsilence of the Commission concerning the impact of the duties on jobs,\nreference is made to recitals (799) and (800) above, where the claims\nconcerning the impact of the measures on jobs in the PV sector are addressed\nand where it is acknowledged that indeed the jobs in the downstream sector\nmight be affected in the short term due to the measures. \n(805)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the survey\nconducted by AFASE and the UK Solar Trade Association, in response to the final disclosure the identity of the\ncompanies participating in the interview was provided. The surveys remained\nhowever deficient, since for example certain replies were incomplete. The\nanalysis of the surveys showed the following. Concerning the survey by AFASE,\nit is firstly noted that the majority of the 50 installers who replied to the\ninterview declared to be exclusively active in the PV market. 15 out of 50\ninstallers declared to be also active in other non-PV activities such heating,\nelectrical installations, and wind to a certain extent. In case of the UK\nsurvey, 21 out of 31 UK companies who replied to the interview had also other\nthan PV activities. This result shows that with regards to a nearly a half of\nthe project developers and installers, the finding set out in recital (247) to\nthe provisional anti-dumping Regulation on the ability to perform other\nactivities such as electrical and heating installations, plumbing and other\ngreen energies installations, is correct. It is, however, recognized that this\nability may exist to a lesser extent than assumed in the provisional anti-dumping\nRegulation. Its mitigating impact on job losses may therefore be less important\nthan initially assumed. Secondly, some of the operators surveyed by AFASE and\nthe UK Solar Trade Association have been using products produced in the Union\nand some foresee buying non-Chinese products following the measures to avoid a\nprice increase. Thus, their dependence on the Chinese imports and the impact of\nthe measures is expected to be reduced as they can access products produced in\nthe Union. Thirdly, the estimation of the impact of the measures on the\nbusinesses of all surveyed operators\u2019 did not allow for firm conclusions as\ntheir assessment was very diverse. Some companies were even unable to assess\nsuch impact. Fourthly, also the answers to the question about the number of the\nPV projects that risk cancelling in case of duties ranged from 'not many' to\n'all projects' in the UK survey. Some operators were unable to make an\nestimation. Finally, both surveys lacked the question about the profitability\nof the economic operators interviewed, which is important for the assessment of\nthe possible absorption of the price increase, if any, resulting from the duty.\n(806)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed that\ninstallers cannot easily change their activities or switch to other green\nenergy installations because of the very different technologies and know-how\ninvolved. Therefore, should the duties be imposed, they would go out of\nbusiness. After final disclosure, this claim was reiterated by one interested\nparty, arguing that installers have invested substantial resources in PV\nspecialisation, such a specific training, which would show that their main\nfocus is on the PV sector and that they would not be able to switch easily to\nother activities. \n(807)\u00a0\u00a0 This argument was\ninsufficiently substantiated as it was not demonstrated what precise knowledge\nan installer would need to acquire and how difficult and expensive it is to obtain\nit. Irrespectively, the institutions acknowledge that installers have developed\nknow-how specific to the installation of PV modules. However, the development\nof this know-how is relatively recent and adds to the primary expertise of the\ninstallers being electrical and heating installations, plumbing etc. It also developed\nin response to an unfair practice namely with the massive inflow of subsidised imports\nfrom the PRC. Independently from the specialised skills of the employees of the\ninstallers, the argument has to be considered in parallel with the analysis\nmade in recitals (792) to (800) above on the employment situation in the\ndownstream sector which in the short term might be negatively impacted but\nwhich, thanks to sustainable trade, would lead to an increase in the employment\nof installers in the mid- to long term. Therefore, the argument was rejected.\n(808)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe ability of the downstream operators to absorb even partly the possible\nprice increase. This argument was insufficiently substantiated thus preventing\nfrom assessing to which extent this allegation was accurate. Profitability of\nthe downstream cooperating operators related directly to the product concerned was\nassessed at around 11 % on average which leaves to the operators in question\nthe possibility to absorb at least partially some price increase if any. In\nthis context, it is recalled that the overall trend of prices is downward. \n(809)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure some parties reiterated the claim of the serious risk of contraction\nof demand for solar products in the Union as a result of the measures, which\naccording to these parties speaks against the measures. One party argued that\nthe solar energy currently has a high price elasticity of demand and even a\nlimited increase in the price of solar products would result in a severe\ncontraction of demand. This party estimated that a countervailing duty in the\nrange of 30 % may further contract demand by 8 GW whereas a duty of 50 % would\ncontract demand by 10 GW. In the same tone, AFASE referred to a study made by a\nmarket analyst, which also foresees a contraction of demand of up to 2GW in\n2013 as a result of a duty of 50 %, thus a contraction of a much smaller\nmagnitude. \n(810)\u00a0\u00a0 Although different\ncontraction scenarios were submitted by parties during the investigation in\naddition to the ones referred to above, they did not contain comparable\nresults. While it cannot be excluded that the duties might result in a\ncontraction of demand for PV installations, the quantification of such effect\nis difficult to establish in view of the various elements that influence the\nattractiveness of the PV installations in the Union. In addition, even if such\ncontraction were to take place in the short-term, the mid- and long-term\nbenefits resulting from fair trade are expected to outweigh the short term\nnegative impact. Finally, AFASE itself recognised that the assessment of the\ndirect link between the demand and the duties would only be available once\nduties are in place. Therefore, this argument was rejected.\n(811)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (784)\nabove six questionnaire replies were received from service providers in the PV\nsector (logistics, transport, public relations, etc.) thus operators whose\nactivity is not directly related to the product under investigation. These\nreplies were found to provide indications on the relative importance of the PV\nrelated activity as compared to the total activity of the cooperating operators\nconcerned. Despite certain deficiencies in the replies, the data in the\nquestionnaires allowed to assess that the PV related activity of these\noperators is marginal as compared to their total activity. Indeed the PV\nrelated activity represented on average only around 5 % of their total turnover\nand around 8 % of total employment. As regards profitability, this was on\naverage around 7 %. However, it is noted that data concerning profitability\nwere not complete, as not all operators reported on this item. Therefore, it was concluded that any possible impact of the\nmeasures on the economic situation of the service providers in the PV sector is\nunlikely to be significant.\n(812)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it was\nconcluded that the impact of measures on the downstream operators would be to a\nlimited extent negative in the short term, in view of the higher contraction in\ninstallations than in a counterfactual scenario without duties forecasted by\nmajor research centres and to the extent the duty cannot be absorbed by the\ndownstream operators. Despite the possible reduction in demand for PV\ninstallations, installers should be able to carry out other activities, whether\nrelated to other green energy sources or the installers\u2019 primary business\nactivity, as referred to above. It was concluded that, in the light of the data\nprovided, any possible impact of the measures on the economic situation of the\nservice providers in the PV sector is unlikely to be significant. \n6.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of end-users\n(consumers)\n(813)\u00a0\u00a0 No parties directly\nrepresenting the interests of end-users such as associations of consumers made\nany representations. In this case reference is made to two types of end-users:\nconsumers (households) and other end-users (e.g. institutions, other investors).\nThe investigation revealed that only about a quarter of existing PV installations\nin the Union (so called roof-top, smaller installations) was ordered by\nconsumers. The other installations (ground mounted, industrial and commercial\nof a much bigger scale) were ordered by other end-users.\n(814)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties claimed that\nif measures are imposed, consumers would suffer from a price increase of PV\nmodules. While as a result of duties the prices of PV modules in the Union\nmarket could be expected to rise somewhat, it is likely that the consumers and\nother end-users would be affected only to a limited extent because the\ninvestigation revealed that the price of a module represents up to 50 % of the\ntotal costs of a PV installation. In view of the profit margins earned by the\nproject developers and installers, it is reasonable to assume that the eventual\nprice increase of modules for the consumer may be at least partly absorbed and\ntherefore mitigated. On the basis of the available evidence it is concluded\nthat measures at the proposed duty level will be at least partly taken in by\nthe supply chain and, therefore, not necessarily result in higher prices for\nconsumers at the retail level.\n(815)\u00a0\u00a0 It is further noted that\nshould duties not be imposed, the likely disappearance of the Union Industry\ncould leave the consumers with only one source of supply of modules in the\nfuture. In this scenario the Chinese exporting producers would be in a position\nto further increase their very strong position on the market and this could\nalso result in increased prices in the short to medium term to the detriment of\nthe consumers/end- users. In any case, as mentioned above, the increase in\nprices would be likely to happen in any event in view of the fact that the PRC\nproduction is loss-making.\n(816)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\nduties would increase the price of the product under investigation.\nConsequently there would be a decline in demand for PV installations as they\nwould be too expensive for consumers and not attractive enough for the other\ninvestors. \n(817)\u00a0\u00a0 As already mentioned in\nrecital (752) even if a temporary increase of prices may happen as a result of\nthe imposition of measures, the overall trend of prices is downward as\nconfirmed by several public sources. The argument is therefore dismissed. While\nit is difficult to quantify the exact possible price increase resulting from\nthe measures and a consequent possible contraction of the demand, several\nelements are recalled. Firstly, the product under investigation constitutes up\nto 50% of the total cost of a PV installation and therefore the duty may be at\nleast partly absorbed. Secondly, the competition of the Union industry with the\nthird countries' producers, already present on the Union market, is likely to\nkeep the prices down. At the same time the Union industry should be able to\nachieve better financial results thanks to the economies of scales resulting\nfrom a better utilisation of the production plants and reduced cost of\nproduction. Thirdly, the demand for PV installations is correlated not only\nwith the price levels of the product under investigation but also with the\nlevel of FITs. At present low levels of demand, as compared to those achieved\nin 2011 and the IP, it is expected that the FITs should not decrease as quickly\nas in the period considered, allowing for continuous investment in PV projects.\nThe argument was therefore dismissed\n(818)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure one party contested the above reasoning. It claimed that the\ndownward price trend cannot be maintained after the imposition of the measures.\nThe party recalled that the measures represent a very significant cost increase\nthat cannot be fully offset by cost decreases and or imports from the third\ncountries. In addition, it was reiterated that the Union industry will not be\nable to undertake new investments in plants and machinery and the downstream\noperators can absorb a little if their profit is 11 %. Finally there is no\nevidence that suggests that FITs might compensate the price increase.\n(819)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that contrary\nto this claim it is not expected that the price increase resulting from the\nmeasures may be fully offset but rather that a temporary increase in prices following\nthe measures is possible (see recital (247) to the provisional anti-dumping Regulation).\nIndeed, such price increase may result from the difference in price levels\nbetween the Chinese subsidised prices and the non-Chinese products. Yet, the\ninformation gathered during the investigation allows claiming that the eventual\nprice increase may be partly absorbed by a number of factors in view of the\nprofits in the downstream sector at the level of 11 % on average. Finally,\nregarding the claim that there is no evidence that suggests that FITs might\ncompensate the price increase, it is reasonable to assume that FITs will be\nadjusted over time in line with the development of prices for projects\n(820)\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that since\nMarch 2013 modules prices increased by 20 % in the Union and that there is a\nsevere lack of stock since 2013. The argument was not substantiated and to the\ncontrary, the public information sources confirm a relative stability of prices\nin the second quarter of 2013. Even if that information was correct, it would\nonly reflect the fact that following registration of imports, the risk of a\npossible countervailing duty has been priced in. The argument was therefore\nrejected. \n(821)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe PV projects would not generate a return for an investor if the fall in FITs\nis not correlated with falling project costs, including the price of modules,\nas they represent a significant part of the costs in a given project. To this\nend, it was claimed that the duties would put in question the viability of many\nPV projects as they increase the price. \n(822)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (752)\nabove, the overall trend of prices of the product under investigation appear to\nbe downward. Furthermore, the importance of FIT with regard to the market is\ndecreasing as grid parity is likely to be achieved in several regions. On these\ngrounds the argument that the price of PV modules could have a negative impact\non PV projects including the question of their viability was rejected. \n(823)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nprovided an internal modelling to prove that the viability of many PV projects\nwas endangered if duties were applied. \n(824)\u00a0\u00a0 This modelling did not allow\nfor a proper quantification as to what extent the attractiveness of the\ninvestment in the PV installations (e.g. return on investment) could decline in\nthe event of increased prices of the product under investigation. Nevertheless,\nthe assumption that any duty would be entirely passed on to end-users or\nconsumers, used in the said modelling, is unlikely in view of the existing\nprofit margins of downstream operators. Moreover, an investment decision is not\nonly based on the price of modules but also depends on many other factors\nincluding inter alia the existence of a general favourable framework for PV\ninstallations in a given country, the level of support respectively the\nelectricity price (for grid parity) Therefore this argument had to be rejected.\n(825)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nit was concluded that the imposition of measures would have overall a limited\nimpact on consumers and other end-users. This is irrespective of the role of\nthe national support schemes in stimulating the demand for PV. If national\nsupport schemes are adapted to higher prices for solar panels (by means of\nhigher FITs), the impact on consumers may be inexistent.\n6.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(826)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties argued that the\nUnion industry is not capable of supplying the Union market in the quantities\nrequired and thus if countervailing duties are imposed there is a serious risk\nof shortage in the Union, which may lead to a further increase of prices of the\nproduct concerned.\n(827)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has found\nthis argument to be unjustified. The Union industry has been underutilising\ntheir production capacities since 2009. In the IP, the utilisation rate of the\nUnion production capacity of modules was 41 % with additional spare capacity of\nabout 5,7 GW; the utilisation rate of the Union production capacity of cells\nwas 63 %, with additional spare capacity of about 1,2 GW. Therefore,\nthanks to the spare capacity, the Union industry would be able to compete for\nan additional part of the market in short term. Also in the medium-term, it is\nreasonable to assume that the Union industry will expand its production\ncapacity to be able to achieve better economies of scale and allow for further\nprice reductions. Furthermore, there are also other sources of supply in the\nworld, which are present on the Union market and which will be able to compete\non the Union market in case of decrease of imports of the Chinese products. The\ninvestigation revealed that the existing spare capacity of the non-Chinese\nproduction outside the Union was in the IP, 5,6 GW for modules and, 6 GW for\ncells. It is therefore concluded that the total spare capacity of the Union and\nthird producers outside the Union is sufficient to complement in the short term\nthe potential decrease in Chinese imports in light of the demand for PV\ninstallations in the EU as forecasted for 2013 (between 9,8 GW and 16,5 GW) and\n2014 (9 GW and 17,1 GW) by major research centres such as EPIA. \n(828)\u00a0\u00a0 Even if more conservative\nassumption on the Union production capacity was made (see recital (545) above),\nthe joint Union and third countries spare capacity would be sufficient to\ncomplement in the short-term the potential decrease of Chinese imports. Also in\nthe medium-term it is reasonable to assume that the Union industry will expand\nits production capacity to be able to achieve economies of scale, which in turn\nwould allow for further price reduction. Therefore, this argument was rejected.\n(829)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties also argued\nthat the imposition of duties on the product concerned will harm the development\nof the PV market in Europe and thus the goals of the EU Agenda 2020 concerning\nthe renewable sources of energy and a reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions\nwill not be achieved.\n(830)\u00a0\u00a0 To start with, the 2020\ngoals do not depend on the solar energy exclusively. Equally important are\nother green energies such as: wind, biomass, hydro etc. Since no particular\npercentage is attributed to the solar energy for the 2020 goals, a slightly\nlower number of PV installations is not expected to raise the overall cost of\nthe 2020 Agenda. Furthermore, the price of solar panels is only one of many\nfactors, which are vital for the development of the PV industry in the Union.\nEqually important are: a favourable legal and financial framework at Union and\nnational levels, improved access to financing of renewable energies projects\nand the investment in R & D. As regards the financing of solar investments,\nthe imposition of duties will enhance the situation of the Union industry and\nof the PV sector in total. As a result, it will also likely enhance access to\ncapital for both the Union industry and investors in the PV sector. Finally, it\nis recalled that the aim of the duty is not to eliminate the Chinese imports\nbut restore fair competition. Should the price of the product concerned rise\nthe evidence on the profits achieved in the downstream market allows the\nassumption that the price increase will be partly absorbed by the operators in\nthe downstream market. Therefore the price of modules should not rise\nsignificantly for the end-users/consumers and the demand for solar\ninstallations could be maintained in the forecasted range.\n(831)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nit is concluded that the imposition of measures would not, overall, have a\nsignificant adverse impact on other EU policies.\n6.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the Union\ninterest\n(832)\u00a0\u00a0 The overall positive effects\nfor the Union industry outweigh the likely negative impact on other operators\non the PV market including end-users (consumers). \n(833)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that based on the information available concerning the Union\ninterest, there are no compelling reasons against the imposition of definitive\nmeasures on imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE COUNTERVAILING\nMEASURES\n(834)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to subsidisation, injury, causation and Union interest,\ndefinitive countervailing measures should be imposed in order to prevent\nfurther injury being caused to the Union industry by the subsidised imports.\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(835)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\ndetermining the level of these measures, account was taken of the subsidy\nmargins found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury\nsustained by the Union producers, without exceeding the subsidy margins found.\n(836)\u00a0\u00a0 When calculating the amount\nof duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious subsidisation, it was\nconsidered that any measures should allow the Union industry to cover its costs\nof production and to obtain a profit before tax that could be reasonably\nachieved by this industry under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the\nabsence of subsidised imports, on sales of the like product in the Union. In\nline with the jurisprudence of the General Court, such profit is the one realised\nat the beginning of the period considered, i.e. before the increase in\nsubsidised imports. Therefore the target profit was fixed at 8 % on the basis\nof the weighted average profit realised by the EU industry in 2009 and 2010 for\nmodules and cells when profitable. \n(837)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the Union industry claimed that the profitability of the year 2010\nshould be used as the level of profitability that Union industry could\nreasonably achieve in the absence of subsidised imports rather than the average\nprofit margin of the years 2009 and 2010. In this respect, it was argued that,\nthe profitability in 2009 was insufficient and the circumstances in the two\nyears were clearly distinct given in particular the development in consumption\nin 2010 which alleviated the effects of subsidization in that year. In this\nregard, it should be noted that it is not relevant whether the average profit\nmargin realised by the Union industry was \u2018sufficient\u2019 when determining the\ninjury elimination level. The injury elimination level should be based on the\nprofit which can be reasonably achieved in the absence of subsidised imports.\nIt is the Investigating Authorities\u2019 practice to consider that this level had\nbeen reached at the beginning of the period considered. As in this case the\nUnion industry realised losses with regard to the sales of cells at the\nbeginning of the period considered in 2009, this methodology was unsuitable and\nit was deemed more reliable to base the determination of the injury elimination\nlevel on the average profit margin of the first and the second year of the\nperiod considered. In this regard it was also considered that it is irrelevant\nthat circumstances were different in these two years.\n(838)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party reiterated\nthat the different target profits should be established for modules and cells,\nas the profitability of these product types showed different trends during the\nperiod considered. While indicators were shown separately for each product\ntype, the conclusions reached for each indicator refer to the product under\ninvestigation as a whole. It is also recalled that modules and cells are one\nsingle product and therefore the subsidy margins and the injury elimination\nlevel were established on this basis.\n(839)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, a non-injurious\nprice was calculated for the Union industry for the like product. The\nnon-injurious price was obtained by adding the abovementioned profit margin of 8\n% to the cost of production during the IP of the sampled Union producers.\n(840)\u00a0\u00a0 The necessary price increase\nwas then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import\nprice of the sampled cooperating exporting producers in the PRC, as established\nfor the price undercutting calculations, duly adjusted for importation costs\nand customs duties with the weighted average non-injurious price of the like\nproduct sold by the sampled Union producers on the Union market during the IP.\nAny difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a\npercentage of the weighted average CIF import value.\n(841)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that sales\nof the sampled Union producers focused on the high-end market, such as the\nresidential/small commercial sector, which attracted higher FITs and suggested\nthat the Union industry\u2019s sales price should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\nIt should be noted that this claim should not be decisive for the calculation\nof the injury margin, since the investigation showed that Union producers were\nnot profitable.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(842)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the foregoing,\nand in accordance with Article 15 of the basic Regulation, a definitive\ncountervailing duty should be imposed on imports of crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic modules and key components (i.e. cells) originating in or\nconsigned from the PRC at the level of the lower of the subsidy or injury\nmargins found, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. In this case, the duty\nrate should accordingly be set at the level of the subsidy margins found. \n(843)\u00a0\u00a0 Given the high rate of\ncooperation of Chinese exporting producers, the \u2018all other companies\u2019 duty was\nset at the level of the highest duty to be imposed on the companies,\nrespectively, sampled or cooperating in the investigation. The \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019 duty will be applied to those companies which had not cooperated in\nthe investigation.\n(844)\u00a0\u00a0 For the cooperating\nnon-sampled Chinese companies listed in the Annex, the definitive duty rate is\nset at the weighted average of the rates of the sampled companies.\n(845)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above,\nthe rates at which such duties will be imposed are set as follows: \n Company Name || Subsidy margin || Injury margin || Countervailing duty \n Wuxi Suntech Power Co.

Therefore, they reflect the\nsituation found during that investigation with respect to these companies.\nThese duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating\nin the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific\nlegal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not\nspecifically mentioned in Article 1 with its name and address, including\nentities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these\nrates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019. \n(848)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of an individual company countervailing duty rate (e.g. following a\nchange in the name of the entity or following the setting-up of new production\nor sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[102] forthwith with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities. If\nappropriate, the Regulation will then be amended accordingly by updating the\nlist of companies benefiting from individual duty rates. \n(849)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure proper\nenforcement of the countervailing duty, the residual duty level should not only\napply to the non-cooperating exporting producers but also to those producers\nwhich did not have any exports to the Union during the IP.\n(850)\u00a0\u00a0 Measures are imposed to\nallow the producers in the Union to recover from the injurious effect of\nsubsidy. To the extent that there would be any initial imbalance between the\npotential benefit for producers in the Union and the cost for other economic\noperators in the Union, this imbalance could be offset by an increase and/or\nrestart of the production in the Union. However, the\nenvisaged scenario of increased production in the Union may not be in line with\nthe market development in this volatile market. Union consumption of modules\nincreased by 264 % between 2009 and 2011, only to decrease by 43 percentage\npoints during the 6 month period between 2011 and the IP. The volatility is\neven more impressive when looking at the period of 2006-2011, where the Union\nconsumption of modules increased from less than 1 GW to almost 20 GW or an\nincrease of around 2000% in just five years. This volatility is expected to\ncontinue, and forecasts published by business associations show differences of\n100% and more between the different scenarios even for the medium term period of\n2014-2015.\n(851)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthese reasons, it is considered appropriate, in such exceptional circumstances,\nto limit the duration of measures to a period of two years only.\n(852)\u00a0\u00a0 This\nperiod should be enough for the producers in the Union to increase and/or restart\ntheir production, while at the same time not significantly endanger the\nsituation of other economic operators in the Union. It is considered that the period of two years will be the most\nappropriate to analyse whether the imposition of measures had indeed the effect\nof increasing Union production and thereby balancing the negative effects on\nother economic operators in the Union.\n(853)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, one Union producer raised the argument that the limited\nduration of 2 years is too short to recover from the injury suffered. In\naddition it was argued that a duration of 2 years would not allow Union\nproducers to file business plans for the current and the coming business year.\nIn this respect, it is noted that the duration of the measures until December\n2015, which should be sufficient for Union producers to file business plans\nuntil 2015.\n(854)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nthe Union producer did not contest the reasons for which the duration was\nlimited to two years, notably the volatility of the market. The producer even\nexplicitly appreciated a review in case the measures need to be changed due to\nchanged market situation. Since the likelihood of a change in market\ncircumstances within two years is indeed high in this volatile market, it is\nconsidered appropriate to limit the measures to two years from the outset.\n(855)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, the complainant argued that two years are insufficient to\ninvest in production, referring to recital (852). However, due to the\nsubstantial spare capacity of the Union industry, an increase in production can\nbe done through a better utilisation of the existing production capacities,\nwhich should be feasible without significant additional investments.\n(856)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant\nfurther argued that an imposition of definitive countervailing duties for a\nperiod of two years is insufficient for the Union Industry to recover from the\ninjurious effects of past subsidisation. However, the imposition of countervailing\nduties cannot only look at the interests of the Union Industry alone, but needs\nto balance the potential benefit for producers in the Union and the cost for\nother economic operators in the Union. On this basis, the decision to limit\nmeasures to two years is maintained.\n(857)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\nrecommend the imposition of a definitive countervailing duty on imports of\ncrystalline silicon PV modules or panels and cells of the type used in\ncrystalline silicon PV modules or panels, originating in or consigned from the\nPRC (final disclosure). All parties were granted a period within which they\ncould make comments on the final disclosure.\n(858)\u00a0\u00a0 The oral and written\ncomments submitted by the interested parties were considered and taken into\naccount where appropriate. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Registration and\nretroactivity\n(859)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in above\nrecital (7), the Commission adopted on 1 March 2013 Regulation No 182/2013\nmaking imports of crystalline silicon PV modules and key components (i.e. cells\nand wafers) originating in or consigned from the People\u2019s Republic of China\nsubject to registration as of 6 March 2013.\n(860)\u00a0\u00a0 As of 6 June 2013,\nregistration of imports for the purpose of protection against dumped imports\nwas terminated through the provisional anti-dumping Regulation. As far as the\ncurrent anti-subsidy investigation is concerned and in view of the above\nfindings, the registration of imports for the purpose of the anti-subsidy\ninvestigation in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation should\nalso be discontinued.\n(861)\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns a possible\nretroactive application of countervailing measures, the criteria set out in\nArticle 16(4) of the basic Regulation have to be evaluated. Pursuant to this article,\na definitive countervailing duty may be levied on products which were entered\nfor consumption no more than 90 days prior to the date of application of\nprovisional measures but not prior to the initiation of the investigation. \n(862)\u00a0\u00a0 In this case, no provisional\ncountervailing measures were applied. As a consequence, it is decided that the\ndefinitive countervailing duty shall not be levied retroactively.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FORM OF THE MEASURES\n(863)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures in the\nparallel anti-dumping investigation[103], a\ngroup of cooperating exporting producers, including their related companies in\nthe PRC and in the European Union, and together with the China Chamber of\nCommerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (\u2018CCCME\u2019)\noffered a joint price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic\nanti-dumping Regulation[104].\nThe undertaking offer was also supported by the Chinese authorities. The Commission examined the offer, and by\nDecision 2013/423/EU[105]\naccepted this undertaking offer. \n(864)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nto Decision 2013/423/EU, the exporting producers together with CCCME submitted\na notification to amend their initial undertaking offer.
