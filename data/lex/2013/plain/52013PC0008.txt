The Directive specifies which products are taxable, the uses\nthat make them taxable and the minimum rates at which they must be taxed\ndepending on whether they are used as motor fuel, for certain industrial or\ncommercial purposes or for heating.\nPursuant to Article 19(1) of the Directive,\nthe Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may\nauthorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions from or reductions\nin the rate of excise duties for specific policy considerations.\nThe objective of this proposal is to permit\nFrance to continue to apply a reduction in the rate of taxation on unleaded\npetrol used as motor fuel and consumed in the Corsican departments with a view\nto partially offsetting the additional costs induced by geographical remoteness\nand difficulties of supply.\nThe\nrequest and its general context\nCouncil Decision 2007/880/EC of 20 December\n2007 authorised France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty to unleaded\npetrol used as motor fuel and consumed in the Corsican departments on the\ncondition that the reduction does not go beyond the additional cost of\ntransport, storage and distribution compared with mainland France. The objective of this Decision is to permit France to partially\noffset the additional costs induced by geographical remoteness and difficulties\nof supply. In application of this Decision, France applied a reduction of EUR 1\nper hectolitre of unleaded petrol.\nBy letter dated 12 March 2012, the French\nauthorities requested an authorisation to continue to apply a reduction of EUR\n1 per hectolitre for a period of six years, from 1 January 2013 to\n31 December 2018. By letters dated 25 June 2012 and 5 October 2012 France\nhas submitted additional information concerning the justification of the\nrequest for derogation. \nAs in the previous requests, the French\nauthorities argued that the reduction in the rate of excise duty is required to\noffset part of the higher price of unleaded petrol ([1])\nresulting from the insular nature of Corsica. The higher price is caused by the\nadditional costs of selling fuel in this region, which is estimated at 7\neurocent per litre. According to the French authorities, several reasons\nexplain this additional cost:\n(1)                   \nGiven that there is no\nrefinery in Corsica, transport and distribution costs are higher for delivery\nof fuel there because of the additional costs associated with maritime and road\nfreight (longer distance and journey time). The\ndistance from the nearest refinery in Fos-sur-Mer to the two storage warehouses\non Corsica in Luciano and Ajaccio is respectively 358 km (of which 182 km\nby sea) and 315 km (of which 170 km by sea). Transport to these\nwarehouses exclusively takes place by boat, whereas all warehouses situated on\nmainland France are all directly linked to a refinery through a network of\npipelines, which considerably reduces transport costs. As an example, costs of\ntransport to Corsica are four to five times higher than costs for a transport\nby pipeline between Le Havre and the region of Paris.\n(2)                   \nThe much smaller capacity of the two warehouses\nin Corsica (respectively 16 000 m3 and 19 000 m3)\nrequires more frequent supplies to them. Investment in the maintenance,\ncompliance of facilities and staff costs are not related to business volume of\nthe depots. The total volume of fuel entered in these depots is less than\n400 000 m3 per year, which is half of the average volume\nfor a depot on the mainland. Hence, the storage cost per m3 is\nhigher in Corsica.\n(3)                   \nThe fixed costs borne by distributors must be\nabsorbed by a lower sales volume because of the low population ([2]), the very mountainous terrain (90 % mountains) and the small volumes of fuel sold by\neach service station. The areas of distribution are therefore isolated and far\napart from each other. The number of inhabitants per\nservice station is 2 485 compared to an average of 5 768 on the\nFrench territory and the sales volume per service\nstation amounts to 2 278 m3 for Corsica as compared to\n4 149 m3 in mainland France.\nAs illustrated in the table below, the\ninternational petrol price quotations for Corsica and for mainland France are\nthe same amounting to EUR 64.82 per 100 litres. The difference in the gross\ntransport costs is very high between mainland France and Corsica, respectively EUR\n7.77 per 100 litres and EUR 23.28 per 100 litres. In spite of the lower tax\nrates (both energy tax and VAT) the final price for unleaded petrol is higher\nin Corsica than in mainland France.\n\u00a0The table below shows the price structure of petrol\nand diesel on 10 August 2012\n Average price of a fuel in EUR per 100 litres || Mainland France petrol || Corsica petrol || South Corsica petrol \n Price including taxes || 160.07 || 165.00 || 163.51 \n VAT || 26.23 || 18.98 || 18.81 \n Energy tax || 61.25 || 57.92 || 57.92 \n Gross transport and distribution margin || 7.77 || 23.28 || 21.96 \n International quotations (Hypothese Corse) || 64.82 || 64.82 || 64.82 \nSource: www.prix- carburants.gouv.fr\nFrance also pointed out that the measure\ncomes under the specific government policy in favour of development in Corsica,\njustified by the handicap of insularity. According to available statistics,\nCorsica as a whole has a gross domestic product per capita of EUR 23 800\nin 2009, which is considerably lower than the national average of EUR 29 574\nin that year.\nProvisions in the field covered by the\nproposal\nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October\n2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products\nand electricity. \nCouncil Decision 2011/38/EU of 18 January\n2011 authorising France to apply differentiated levels of taxation to motor\nfuels in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC. The\nregionalisation of the rates of domestic consumption tax on petroleum products\n(TIPP) concerns both diesel and unleaded petrol used as motor fuel. It forms\npart of the policy of decentralisation planned by the French authorities\ninasmuch as it allows the French regions, including Corsica, to adjust the\nrates of excise duty applicable to motor fuels. This decentralisation is part\nof an approach designed to increase administrative effectiveness by improving\nthe quality and reducing the cost of public services. It is also part of a\npolicy of subsidiarity, allowing for decisions to be adopted in many areas at\nthe appropriate level (see the second recital to Decision 2011/38/EU) and\ntherefore pursues objectives other than those sought by the tax reduction\nrequested. The authorisation expires at the end of 2012, but France has\nrequested its extension.\nAssessment\nof the measure under Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nSpecific\npolicy considerations\nArticle 19(1), first subparagraph, of the\nDirective reads as follows: \n'In addition to the provisions set out in the\nprevious Articles, in particular in Articles 5, 15 and 17, the Council, acting\nunanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State\nto introduce further exemptions or reductions for specific policy\nconsiderations.'\nThe tax differentiation places unleaded\npetrol consumers in Corsica on a more equal footing with similar consumers on\nthe mainland by partially offsetting the additional cost borne by consumers in\nCorsica. The proposed measure therefore meets certain regional and cohesion\npolicy objectives. \nThe tax reduction does not go beyond the\nadditional costs of transport and distribution borne by consumers in Corsica.\nThe EUR 10/1 000 l reduction in the cost of unleaded petrol is much\nsmaller than the difference between the respective final prices. \nThe reduced\nrate of taxation on the consumption of unleaded petrol currently applied in\nCorsica (EUR 579.2/1 000 l) ([3])\nis still appreciably higher than the minimum EU level set by Directive\n2003/96/EC (EUR 359/1 000 l). \nConsistency\nwith the other policies and objectives of the Union\nWhen the Commission examines a request, it\ntakes into account the proper functioning of the internal market, the need to\nensure fair competition and the implementation of the EU\u2019s health, environment,\nenergy and transport policies. \nThe measure is acceptable from the point of\nview of the proper functioning of the internal market and of the need to ensure\nfair competition. It merely seeks to partially offset the additional costs\nassociated with Corsica\u2019s island status. In view of the remote and insular\nnature of the departments to which it applies and the moderateness of the\nreduction in the rate - which is, moreover, very high compared with the EU\nminimum - the measure is not expected to lead to changes in fuel consumption,\nthrough the attraction of consumers from outside these areas.\nAs the effect of the tax relief on\ntransport is expected to be insignificant, and compensatory policies could be\nfound for any marginal effects which might occur, the measure is not\nincompatible with the health, environment, energy and transport policies of the\nunion.\nPeriod of application of the measure and\ndevelopment of the EU framework on Energy Taxation\nArticle 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC lays\ndown, for this type of measure, a maximum period of six years, with the\npossibility of renewal. The Commission suggests that the period of application\nis set to the maximum allowed by Directive 2003/96/EC, i.e. six years, taking\ninto account the absence of any negative impact of the current arrangement on\nintra-EU trade and on the general level of taxation of fuels in France, in\norder to ensure legal certainty for the region, the Commission suggests at this\nstage to grant the authorisation for six years, i.e. from 1 January 2013 until\n31 December 2018.\nHowever, in order not to undermine future\ngeneral developments of the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to\nprovide that, should the Council, acting on the basis of Article 113 of the\nTreaty, introduce a modified general system for the taxation of energy products\nto which the present authorisation would not be adapted, this Decision shall\nexpire on the day on which those modified rules become applicable.\nShould the Council adopt such a new system\nand should the Commission consider that the authorisation proposed herewith is\nstill warranted, it would examine, positively and in a timely manner, any\nrequest from France for a similar authorisation adapted to that new system, so\nas to provide for the continuity of the present proposal.\nState aid\nrules\nThe measure may constitute State aid in\naccordance with Article 107(1) of the TFEU. Since the reduced rates are above\nthe EU minima, the measure would be covered by Article 25 of Regulation\n800/2008/EC ([4])\n(the General Block Exemption Regulation) and would thus be considered compatible\nwith the internal market. However, as the period of validity of the General\nBlock Exemption Regulation ends on 31 December 2013 any aid inherent in the\nmeasure would need to be notified to the Commission under State aid rules, in\ncase the Commission would not have adopted a new Regulation comparable to the\nGeneral Block Exemption Regulation or in case such new Regulation would not\ncontain a rule equivalent to the one present in Article 25. \nThe decision is without prejudice to the\napplicable State aid rules during the period covered by the derogation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nThe proposal consists of a tax reduction\nwhich concerns only France.\nObtaining and using expertise\nNo external expertise has been used.\nImpact assessment\nNo impact assessment has been carried.\nSummary of the measure proposed\nThe Commission proposes to authorise the\ntax reduction of EUR 10 per 1 000 l until 31 December 2018, thereby\npermitting France to apply a reduced rate of taxation to unleaded petrol used\nas motor fuel and consumed in the Corsican departments.\nLegal basis \nArticle 19 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC.\nPrinciple of subsidiarity \nThe field of indirect taxation covered by\nArticle 113 of the TFEU is not in itself within the exclusive competence of the\nEU within the meaning of Article 3 of the Treaty.\nHowever, the exercise by Member States of\ntheir concurrent competences in this field is strictly circumscribed and\nlimited by the measures harmonising national laws already adopted by the\nCouncil.\nAs it happens, pursuant to Article 19 of\nDirective 2003/96/EC, only the Council is empowered to authorise a Member State\nto introduce further exemptions or reductions within the meaning of that\nprovision. Member States cannot substitute themselves for the Council.\nThe proposal therefore respects the\nprinciple of subsidiarity.\nPrinciple of proportionality\nThe proposal respects the principle of\nproportionality. The EUR 0.01/l reduction in the cost of unleaded petrol is\nwell below the additional cost borne (EUR 0.10 per litre).\nChoice of instruments\nInstrument proposed: Council decision.\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96 makes\nprovision for this type of measure only.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe measure does not impose any financial\nand administrative burden on the Union, The proposal therefore has no impact on\nthe Union budget.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nNone.\n2013/0006 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising France to apply a reduced rate\nof taxation to unleaded petrol used as motor fuel and consumed in Corsican\ndepartments in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Directive\n2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the\ntaxation of energy products and electricity ([5]), and in particular Article\n19(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Decision\n2007/880/EC ([6])\nFrance was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to unleaded petrol\nused as motor fuel and consumed in Corsican departments in accordance with\nArticle 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter dated 12 March\n2012, France requested authorisation to apply a reduced rate of energy tax to\nunleaded petrol used as motor fuel by way of extension of a practice followed\nunder Decision 2007/880/EC. The reduction amounts to 1 EUR per hectolitre. The\nauthorisation is being requested for the period from 1 January 2013 to 31\nDecember 2018. In Corsica the cost of supplying unleaded petrol to the\nforecourt is appreciably higher than in mainland France, final prices being 0,10\nEUR per litre higher than on the mainland.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By reducing the tax on\nunleaded petrol borne by consumers in Corsica, the consumers concerned will be\nplaced on a more equal footing with those on the mainland. The measure\ntherefore meets regional and cohesion policy objectives.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tax reduction is no\nlarger than what is necessary to allow for the additional transport and\ndistribution costs borne by consumers in Corsica.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final level of\ntaxation complies with the minimum rates laid down in Directive 2003/96/EC -\ncurrently 359 EUR /1 000 l (or 35,90 EUR /hl). This holds true even\nallowing for an authorisation analogous to the one granted by Council Implementing\nDecision 2011/38/EU of 18 January 2011 authorising France to apply\ndifferentiated levels of taxation to motor fuels in accordance with Article 19\nof Directive 2003/96/EC ([7]),\nfor the period as from 1 January 2013, in case the effects of such decision are\ncombined with those of this Decision.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the remote and\ninsular nature of the departments to which it applies and the moderateness of\nthe reduction in the rate - which is, moreover, very high compared with the\nminimum level prescribed by Directive 2003/96/EC - the measure requested will\nnot give rise to any movement specifically linked to the supplying of fuel.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, the measure\nis acceptable from the point of view of the proper functioning of the internal\nmarket and of the need to ensure fair competition and it is not incompatible\nwith the health, environment, energy and transport policies of the Union.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 France should therefore be\nauthorised, pursuant to Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC, to apply a\nreduced rate of taxation to unleaded petrol used as motor fuel and consumed in\nCorsica, and this until 31 December 2018.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from Article\n19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that\nArticle must be strictly limited in time.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide the\nregions concerned with a sufficient degree of certainty, the authorisation should\nbe granted for a period of six years. However, in order not to undermine future\ngeneral developments of the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to\nprovide that, should the Council, acting on the basis of Article 113 of the\nTreaty, introduce a modified general system for the taxation of energy products\nto which this authorisation would not be adapted, this Decision expires on the\nday on which the rules on that modified system become applicable.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be ensured that France\ncan apply the specific reduction to which this Decision relates seamlessly\nfollowing on from the situation existing before 1 January 2013, under Decision\n2007/880/EC. The authorisation requested should therefore be granted with\neffect from 1 January 2013.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Decision is without\nprejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nFrance is authorised to apply a reduction\nin the rate of taxation not exceeding 1 EUR per hectolitre to unleaded petrol\nused as motor fuel and consumed in the Corsican departments\nIn order to avoid any over-compensation,\nthe reduction shall not go beyond the additional costs of transport, storage\nand distribution compared with mainland France.\nThe reduced rate shall comply with the obligations\nin Directive 2003/96/EC, in particular the minimum rates referred to in Article\n7 thereof.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January\n2013 and shall expire on 31 December 2018.\nHowever, should the Council, acting on the\nbasis of Article 113 of the Treaty, introduce a modified general system for the\ntaxation of energy products to which the authorisation granted in Article 1 of\nthis Decision would not be adapted, this Decision shall expire on the day on\nwhich the rules on that modified system become applicable. \nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the French\nRepublic.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPresident\n([1])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\npump price of unleaded petrol (SSP 95) in Corsica on 22 May 2012 was EUR 1.66\nper litre compared to an average price of EUR 1.56 per litre on the French\nterritory.\n([2])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nnumber of inhabitants is 35/km2 in Corsica compared to 94/km2\nin mainland France.\n([3])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nrate takes into account the reduction applied by Corsica in application of\nCouncil Decision 2011/38/EU of 17 January 2011.\n([4])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission\nRegulation (EC) No 800/2008/EC of 6 August 2008 declaring certain categories of\naid compatible with the common market in application of Articles 87 and 88 of\nthe Treaty, OJ L 214, 9.8.2008,\np. 3.\n([5])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\nL 283, 31.10.2003, p. 51.\n([6])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 346, 29.12.2007, p. 15.\n([7])\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ\nL 19, 22.1.2011, p. 13.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
