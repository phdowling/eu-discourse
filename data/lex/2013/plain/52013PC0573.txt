However, as two of the importers\r\nchosen for the sample did not return questionnaire replies, sampling for\r\nimporters could no longer be pursued. All available information pertaining to\r\ncooperating importers was used to reach definitive findings, in particular as\r\nfar the Union interest is concerned. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seven Indian exporting\r\nproducers outside the sample requested individual examination. Two of them\r\nreplied to the questionnaires. Five did not reply to the questionnaire. Out of\r\nthe two which replied to the questionnaire, one withdrew its individual\r\nexamination request. As a result, the Commission has examined the request of\r\none Indian exporting producer outside the sample:\n\u2013 KEI Industries Limited, New Delhi (KEI).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the above,\r\nrecitals (5) to (8), (10) to (12) and (14) of the provisional Regulation are\r\nconfirmed. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period and\r\nthe period considered \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (20)\r\nto the provisional Regulation, the investigation of subsidisation and injury\r\ncovered the period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 ('investigation period\u2019\r\nor 'IP'). The examination of the trends relevant for the assessment of injury\r\ncovered the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 March 2012 ('period considered').\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent procedure\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the disclosure\r\nof the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was decided\r\nto impose provisional countervailing measures ('provisional disclosure'),\r\nseveral interested parties, namely 2 exporting producers, the complainant, and\r\n11 users submitted comments. The parties who so requested were granted a\r\nhearing. The Commission continued to seek information it deemed necessary for\r\nthe definitive findings. All comments received were considered and taken into\r\naccount, where appropriate. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission informed\r\nthe interested parties of the essential facts and considerations on the basis\r\nof which it intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive countervailing\r\nduty on imports of certain stainless steel wires originating in India and the\r\ndefinitive collection of the amounts secured by way of the provisional duty\r\n(\u2018final disclosure\u2019). The parties were also granted a period within which they\r\ncould comment on the final disclosure. All comments received were considered\r\nand taken into account, where appropriate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and like\r\nproduct\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\r\nstated in recital (21) to the provisional Regulation, the product concerned is\r\ndefined as stainless steel wires containing by weight:\n\u2013                        \r\n- 2,5% or more of nickel, other than wire\r\ncontaining by weight 28% or more but not more than 31% of nickel and 20% or\r\nmore but not more than 22% of chromium, \n\u2013                        \r\n- less than 2,5% of nickel, other than wire\r\ncontaining by weight 13% or more but not more than 25% of chromium and 3,5% or\r\nmore but not more than 6% of aluminium, \ncurrently falling within CN codes 7223 00\r\n19 and 7223 00 99, originating in India.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some users expressed\r\nconcerns about the apparent lack of distinction between the various types of\r\nthe product concerned and the like product because a wide product mix exists\r\namong all the product types. There was a particular concern as to how a fair\r\ncomparison among all types could be ensured in the investigation. As is the\r\ncase in most investigations, the definition of the product concerned covers a\r\nwide variety of product types which share the same or similar basic physical\r\ntechnical and chemical characteristics. The fact that\r\nthese characteristics can vary from product type to product type may indeed\r\nlead to cover a wide range of types. This is the case in the current\r\ninvestigation. The Commission took account of the differences among the product\r\ntypes and ensured a fair comparison. A unique product control number (PCN) was\r\nallocated to each product type, produced and sold by the Indian exporting\r\nproducers and to each one produced and sold by the Union industry. The number\r\ndepended on the main characteristics of the product, in this case, the steel\r\ngrade, the tensile strength, the coating, the surface, diameter, and the shape.\r\nTherefore, the types of wires exported to the Union were compared on a PCN\r\nbasis with the products produced and sold by the Union industry that have the\r\nsame or similar characteristics. All these types fell within the definition of\r\nthe product concerned and the like product in the notice of initiation[4] and in the provisional Regulation.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty reiterated its claim that the so called \u201chighly technical\u201d product types\r\nare different and not interchangeable with other types of the product\r\nconcerned. Hence, they should be excluded from the product definition.\r\nAccording to the case-law, when determining whether products are alike so that\r\nthey form part of the same product, it needs to be assessed whether they share\r\nthe same technical and physical characteristics, have the same basic end-uses and the same price-quality ratio. In that regard, the\r\ninterchangeability of, and competition between, those products should also be\r\nassessed.[5] The investigation found that the \u201chighly technical\u201d product types\r\nreferred to by the party have the basic physical, chemical, and technical\r\ncharacteristics as the other products subject to the investigation. They are\r\nmade from stainless steel and they are wires. They constitute a semi-finished\r\nsteel product (which in the majority of cases is then subject to further transformation\r\nin view of producing a broad variety of finished goods), and the production\r\nprocess is similar, using similar machines, such that producers can switch\r\nbetween different variants of the product, according to demand. Therefore,\r\nalthough different types of wires are not directly interchangeable and do not\r\ndirectly compete, producers are competing for contracts covering a broad range\r\nof stainless steel wires. Moreover, these product types are produced and sold\r\nby both the Union industry and the Indian exporting producers using a similar\r\nproduction method. Therefore, the claim cannot be accepted.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to definitive\r\ndisclosure one party claimed that the analysis carried out by the Commission in\r\nterms of establishing whether the so-called highly technical product types\r\nshould be included in the investigation was insufficient. This argument is\r\nrejected. The investigation established that the highly technical product type\r\nfall within the product definition as stated in recital (12) above. The party\r\nwrongly assumes that all the criteria referred to in the case-law have to be\r\nmet at the same time; this is incorrect. According to the case-law, the\r\nCommission enjoys a wide discretion when defining the product scope[6], and has to base this\r\nassessment on the set of criteria developed by the Court. Often, as in the\r\npresent case, some criteria may point in one and some in the other direction; in\r\nsuch a situation, the Commission needs to carry out a global assessment, as it\r\nhas done in the present case. It is therefore wrongly assumed by this\r\ninterested party that product types need to share all characteristics in order\r\nto fall the same product definition. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\nusers claimed that the so-called stainless steel wires \u201cseries 200\u201d should be\r\nexcluded from the product scope. In particular, they alleged this type was\r\nhardly produced by the Union industry. However, this claim is unfounded. First,\r\nthe fact that a certain product type is not produced in by the Union industry\r\nis not a sufficient reason to exclude it from the scope of the investigation,\r\nwhere the production process is such that the Union producers could start\r\nproducing the product type in question. Second, as for highly technical wires\r\n(see above recital (12)), it was found that these types of the product\r\nconcerned have basic physical, chemical, and technical characteristics\r\nidentical or similar to other types of the like product produced and sold by\r\nthe Union industry. Therefore, the claim cannot be accepted.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alternatively,\r\nthey claimed that wire rod should be included in the definition of the product\r\nconcerned. However, wire rod is the raw material used for the production of the\r\nproduct concerned but can also be used for the production of different products\r\nsuch as fasteners and nails. Therefore, contrary to the product under\r\ninvestigation, it does not constitute a finished steel product. Through cold\r\nforming production process the wire rod amongst other product can be\r\ntransformed into the product concerned or the like product. On that basis, wire\r\nrod cannot be included in the product scope within the meaning of the basic\r\nRegulation.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above, the definition of the product concerned and the\r\nlike product in recitals (21) to (24) to the provisional Regulation are hereby\r\nconfirmed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDISATION\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recital (25) to the provisional Regulation,\r\nreference was made to the following schemes, which allegedly involve the\r\ngranting of countervailable subsidies:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme\r\n(\u2018DEPBS\u2019);\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Drawback Scheme (\u2018DDS\u2019);\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advance Authorisation Scheme (\u2018AAS\u2019);\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme\r\n(\u2018EPCGS\u2019);\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Credit Scheme (\u2018ECS\u2019); \n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Focus Market Scheme (\u2018FMS\u2019);\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Special Economic Zones/Export Oriented\r\nUnits (\u2018SEZ/EOU\u2019).\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry alleged\r\nthat the Commission failed to take into account a number of subsidy schemes,\r\nespecially regional ones, and as a result believed that the subsidies found to be received by Indian\r\nproducers were underestimated. The allegation is unfounded. The Commission\r\ninvestigated all of the national and local subsidy schemes contained in the\r\ncomplaint. However, the Commission found that during the IP the sampled\r\nexporting producers had received subsidies only with regard to the schemes listed\r\nin recital (14) above. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry also\r\nargued that since in the parallel anti-dumping investigation the data submitted\r\nby the sampled Indian producers were found unreliable and Article 18 of Council\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not\r\nmembers of the European Community[7]was\r\napplied, the corresponding Article 28 of the basic Regulation should have\r\nequally been applied in the current investigation. However, Article 28 of the\r\nbasic Regulation applies only if its conditions are met, which has not been the\r\ncase with regards to the information provided by the sampled Indian producers.\r\nTherefore, the claim cannot be accepted.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown that the DEPBS, the DDS and the AAS all\r\nform part of one subsidy mechanism, that is a duty drawback mechanism. India has used various types of this mechanism over a long time, modifying the individual\r\nsub-mechanisms frequently. The investigation has shown that it is appropriate\r\nto analyse these sub-mechanisms together, as exporters typically have to choose\r\nbetween them (they are mutually exclusive), and in the event one of the\r\nsub-mechanisms is discontinued, switch to another one.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (25) to (28) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Entitlement Passbook\r\nScheme (\u2018DEPBS\u2019)\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the sampled Indian\r\nexporting producers argued that the DEPBS should not be considered as a\r\ncountervailable subsidy, since the purpose of the scheme is to offset customs\r\nduties on imports. It was furthermore alleged that for the product under\r\ninvestigation, there is no domestic production of inputs, so that it is a\r\nreasonable assumption that all imports have been taxed at 5%, and that the cap\r\nestablished by GOI ensures that there is no over-compensation. As explained in\r\nrecital (38) to the provisional Regulation this scheme cannot be considered a\r\npermissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the\r\nmeaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation since it does not\r\nconform to the rules laid down in Annex I item (i), Annex II (definition and\r\nrules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for substitution\r\ndrawback) of the basic Regulation. In particular, an exporter benefiting from\r\nDEPBS is under no obligation to actually consume the goods imported free of\r\nduty in its production process and the amount of credit is not calculated in\r\nrelation to the actual value of the inputs used. Lastly, an exporter is\r\neligible for the DEPBS benefits regardless of whether it imports any inputs at\r\nall. In order to obtain the benefit, it is sufficient for an exporter to simply\r\nexport goods without demonstrating that any input material was imported. The\r\nGOI failed to establish a system which links the amount of duty exempted on the\r\nimported inputs with their consumption in the exported products. From their\r\nside, the companies benefitting from this scheme also did not have a mechanism\r\nin place to demonstrate that they did not receive any excess remission. In\r\naddition, regarding the non-existing of over-compensation in this specific\r\ncase, the company failed to demonstrate that this was the case, it could for\r\nexample have benefitted from compensation for other imported goods or it could\r\nhave benefitted from compensation for imported inputs without having consumed\r\nit for the production of the product concerned. It also has to be noted that\r\nthe statement that there is no domestic production of inputs is incorrect since\r\nat least one of the companies investigated produced this domestically while the\r\nother two investigated companies were purchasing from a\r\ndomestic producer, and not from a domestic importing trader. Therefore, these arguments cannot be accepted.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that in\r\ncase of the sale of the DEPBS licence, the actual selling price was below the\r\nlicence value and therefore the countervailable benefit was lower than the one\r\nprovisionally established. However, the benefit under this scheme was\r\ncalculated on the basis of the amount of credit granted in the licence\r\nregardless of whether the license was used to offset customs duties on imports\r\nor whether the license was actually sold. Any sale of a licence at a price less\r\nthan its face value is a pure commercial decision which does not alter the\r\namount of benefit received under this scheme. Therefore, this argument cannot\r\nbe accepted.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government of India (\u2018GOI\u2019) argued that the DEPBS has been withdrawn during the IP and therefore should\r\nnot be countervailed. They furthermore argued that since the duty drawback is\r\nnot a successor program of DEPB, DEPB may not be countervailed. Indeed the\r\nDEPBS ceased to exist on 30 September 2011, during the IP. However, the\r\nsubsidisation continued to exist. As an alternative to the DEPBS the exporters\r\nwere found to receive benefits under AAS and especially DDS. As described in\r\nrecitals (42) to (44) to the provisional Regulation AAS and DDS were adjusted\r\nto organise a smooth transition from the DEPBS. In addition, the nature of the\r\nbenefits under the three schemes, i.e. revenue foregone in the form of\r\nexemption from customs duties, is exactly the same. Companies have thus a\r\nchoice which scheme to use for the offsetting of customs duties. Therefore,\r\ndespite the fact that the DEPBS ceased to exist halfway the IP, the subsidies\r\ngranted by the GOI during the IP should be countervailed because the\r\noverarching system of benefits continued as, for the\r\nreasons set out above in recital (20), all duty drawback schemes form one\r\nsubsidy mechanisms with different, often changing sub-mechanisms. This argument can thus not be accepted.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its response to the\r\ndefinitive disclosure, the GOI reiterated its arguments concerning the\r\nwithdrawal of the DEPBS after definitive disclosure. However, since no new arguments\r\nwere presented which would lead to a change of the conclusion with regard to the\r\nreplacement of the subsidization under the ceased DEPBS by the adjusted DDS,\r\nthis argument cannot be accepted. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (29) to (47) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it was found\r\nthat the Indian exporting producer KEI was using the DEPBS in the IP. The\r\nsubsidy rate amounted to 0.50%. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duty Drawback Scheme\r\n(\u2018DDS\u2019)\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOI argued that the DDS\r\nshould not be considered as a countervailable subsidy, since the purpose of the\r\nscheme is to offset import duties and excises taxes paid on inputs. As\r\nexplained in recitals (58) to (60) to the provisional Regulation this scheme\r\ncannot be considered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution\r\ndrawback system within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic\r\nRegulation since it does not conform to the rules laid down in Annex I item\r\n(i), Annex II (definition and rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and\r\nrules for substitution drawback) of the basic Regulation. In particular, there\r\nis no system or procedure in place to confirm which inputs are consumed in the\r\nproduction process of the exported product or whether an excess payment of\r\nimport duties occurred within the meaning of point (i) of Annex I and Annexes\r\nII and III of the basic Regulation. Furthermore, an exporter is eligible for\r\nthe DDS benefits regardless of whether it imports any input materials at all.\r\nTo obtain the benefit, it is sufficient for an exporter to simply export goods\r\nwithout demonstrating that any input material was imported. The above was\r\nconfirmed by the findings made at the visited companies and by the\r\ncorresponding legislation, namely GOI\u2019s circular No 24/2001 as explained in\r\nrecital (60) to the provisional Regulation. In addition, in its submission, the\r\nGOI admitted itself in paragraph 32 that DDS may result in excess remission.\r\nTherefore, this argument cannot be accepted.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GOI\r\nfurther argued that, although the verification system for the consumption of\r\ninputs was not complete, in particular due to the high number of beneficiaries\r\nand the administrative burden involved in controlling all of them, the\r\nverification mechanism in place based on sampling should be accepted. This\r\nargument however cannot be accepted as it is not foreseen in Article 3(1)(a)(ii), Annex I item (i), Annex II (definition and\r\nrules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and rules for substitution\r\ndrawback) of the basic Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (48) to (64) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it was found\r\nthat the Indian exporting producer, KEI Industries, was using the DDS in the\r\nIP. The subsidy rate amounted to 0.29%. \n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advance Authorisation\r\nScheme ('AAS')\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the sampled Indian\r\nexporting producers argued that the AAS should be considered as a duty drawback\r\nsystem, because the imported materials are used to produce exported goods. As\r\nexplained in recital (76) to the provisional Regulation the sub-scheme used in\r\nthe present case is not a permissible duty drawback system or substitution\r\ndrawback system within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic\r\nRegulation. It does not conform to the rules laid down in Annex I item (i),\r\nAnnex II (definition and rules for drawback) and Annex III (definition and\r\nrules for substitution drawback) of the basic Regulation. The GOI did not\r\neffectively apply a verification system or a procedure to confirm whether and\r\nin what amounts inputs were consumed in the production of the exported product\r\n(Annex II(II)(4) of the basic Regulation and, in the case of substitution\r\ndrawback schemes, Annex III(II)(2) of the basic Regulation). Moreover, the\r\nStandard Input Output Norms (\u2018SIONs\u2019) for the product concerned were not\r\nsufficiently precise and they cannot constitute a verification system of actual\r\nconsumption. The design of those standard norms does not enable the GOI to\r\nverify with sufficient precision what amounts of inputs were consumed in the production\r\nof the exported products. In addition, the GOI did not carry out any further\r\nexamination based on actual inputs involved as explained in recital (73) to the\r\nprovisional Regulation, although this would normally need to be carried out in\r\nthe absence of an effectively applied verification system (Annex II(II)(5) and\r\nAnnex III(II)(3) to the basic Regulation). The sub-scheme is therefore\r\ncountervailable, and the argument is rejected.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\r\ncomments, recitals (65) to (80) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Indian exporting\r\nproducer, KEI Industries, was found not to use AAS in the IP. \n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Promotion Capital\r\nGoods Scheme (\u2018EPCGS\u2019) \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the definitive\r\ndisclosure, one of the Indian exporting producers provided comments on a calculation\r\nerror. This comment was partially warranted and was acknowledged in the\r\ncalculation of the subsidy amount. Since the overall subsidy margin for this\r\ncompany was below de minimis level already before this correction, the\r\nadjustment neither changes the final level of the countervailing duty of this\r\ncompany nor does it affect the average subsidy margin calculated for the\r\ncooperating not sampled companies or the country-wide subsidy margin. \n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the above,\r\nrecitals (81) to (91) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Indian exporting\r\nproducer, KEI Industries, was found not to benefit from the EPCGS in the IP\r\nwith regard to the product concerned. \n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Credit Scheme\r\n(\u2018ECS\u2019)\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nGOI argued that in recital (92) to the provisional Regulation the Commission\r\nincorrectly cited the legal basis of the ECS. The GOI indicated that the Master\r\nCircular DBOD No. DIR(Exp.) BC 01/04.02.02/2007-2008 (\u2018MC 07-08\u2019) and Master\r\nCircular DBOD No. DIR(Exp.) BC 09/04.02.02/2008-09 (\u2018MC 08-09\u2019) were updated\r\nand these were Master Circular DBOD No. DIR(Exp.) BC 06/04.02.002/2010-11 (\u2018MC\r\n10-11\u2019) and Master Circular DBOD No. DIR.(Exp.) BC 04/04.02.002/2011-2012 (\u2018MC\r\n11-12) which constituted the legal basis for the ECS in the IP. Indeed the\r\nobservation of the GOI is correct in this regard. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nGOI further argued that had the proper updated legal basis been taken into\r\naccount the Commission would have to take a note of the fact that the maximum\r\nceiling interest rate applicable\r\nto export credits, previously made mandatory by the Reserve Bank of India\r\n(\u2018RBI\u2019) for the commercial banks, ceased to exist before the IP with regard to\r\nexport credits in rupees. Therefore, this scheme as far as credits in rupees\r\nare concerned can no longer be considered a subsidy. The investigation\r\ndemonstrated that two sampled companies benefited in practice from export\r\ncredits from privately owned banks with rates below the reference rate set by\r\nthe Bank of India. The investigation has not revealed a commercial rational as\r\nto why these privately owned banks provide credits at discounted and apparently\r\nloss-making rates. These lending practices of the banks could suggest that\r\nthere is still government involvement. However, the investigation did not\r\nproduce evidence of the level required under WTO rules to show continuing\r\nentrustment or direction of the commercial banks. Therefore, the Commission has\r\ndecided not to count the benefit of the discounted rates as a subsidy under\r\nthis sub-scheme, in the absence of sufficient evidence of direction and/or a\r\nfinancial contribution by the GOI.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Last, the GOI argued that\r\nthe latest update of Master Circular - DBOD No. DIR(Exp.) BC.\r\n06/04.02.002/2012-13 (\u2018MC 12-13\u2019), which had entered into force two months after\r\nthe end of the IP, had erased the maximum ceilings on interest rates of the\r\nexport credits also with regard to credits in the foreign currency. Invoking\r\nArticle 15(1) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation the GOI argues that in such\r\na case also this element of the export credit scheme should not be\r\ncountervailed, because government direction of the banks has been removed.\r\nAlthough in the submitted MC 12-13 there is a provision which makes it free for\r\nthe commercial banks to determine the interest rates on export credits in\r\nforeign currency with effect from May 2012 as claimed by the GOI, such a change\r\nof instruction of RBI to the private banks during the investigation would by\r\nitself be insufficient to exclude this scheme, since government direction may continue\r\nin an informal manner which would have to be the subject of further\r\ninvestigation. However, in view of the above conclusion on the sub-scheme\r\nconcerning export credits in rupees, the Commission has decided not to\r\ncountervail this sub-scheme concerning credits in foreign currency at this\r\nstage.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nlight of the above, the duty rates will be adjusted where applicable.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Focus Market Scheme (\u2018FMS\u2019)\r\n\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the definitive\r\ndisclosure, the GOI submitted comments on FMS. The GOI argued that the scheme\r\nis geographically related to countries not part of the EU and can thus not be\r\ncountervailed by the EU. Nevertheless, the GOI was not able to dispute neither\r\nthe practical implementations of the scheme nor that the FMS benefit can be\r\nused for the product concerned, namely the fact that duty credits under FMS are\r\nfreely transferable and that they can be used for payment of custom duties on\r\nsubsequent imports of any inputs or goods including capital goods. Therefore,\r\nthis claim had to be rejected as the investigation has shown that the product\r\nconcerned can and does benefit from this scheme when exported to the EU. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\r\ncomments, recitals (101) to (111) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Indian exporting producer,\r\nKEI Industries, was found not to use FMS in the IP.\n3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export Oriented Units\r\nScheme (\u2018EOUS\u2019)\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the definitive\r\ndisclosure the sole exporting producer investigated using EOUS submitted\r\ncomments on this scheme. The company claimed that the Commission should use a different\r\nmethod to calculate the benefit received under the EOUS. The company argued\r\nthat certain benefits under EOUS should be treated as a permissible duty\r\ndrawback scheme within the meaning of Annex II and III of the basic Regulation\r\nand that they therefore should not be countervailable. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was however found that regardless\r\nof which method of calculation used, the subsidy rate for this scheme would not\r\nexceed 0.95%, meaning that the overall subsidy margin for this company would\r\nremain below de minimis level. Therefore it was not deemed necessary to\r\nanalyze this claim further in the context of this investigation.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\r\ncomments, recital (112) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Indian exporting\r\nproducer, KEI Industries, was found not to benefit of the EOUS in the IP.\n3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amount of countervailable\r\nsubsidies\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nthe decision not to count the benefits under the ESC as a subsidy as described\r\nin recitals (38) to (41) and correction of EPCGS benefit calculation for one of\r\nthe companies as described in recital (35), the duty rates have been adjusted\r\nwhere applicable.

However, even if 2009 was excluded from the analysis,\r\nthere would still be a growing trend for consumption (+5%) which is an\r\nindication of an improving market. Moreover, the negative effects of the\r\nfinancial crises are recognised in recital (120) to the provisional Regulation,\r\nbut was concluded that the market situation improved. In absence of other\r\ncomments, recital (120) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed. \n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union from the country concerned \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The subsidy margin\r\nestablished for KEI Industries is below de minimis threshold foreseen in\r\nArticle 14(5) of the basic Regulation (see recital (49) above). Therefore, it\r\nis deemed that this exporting producer has not benefited from subsidy schemes\r\nin the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation\r\nduring the investigation period. As a result, its import volumes were excluded\r\nfrom the volume of subsidised imports from India. One exporting producer,\r\nnamely the Venus group submitted that certain transactions were mistakenly\r\ndouble counted. The Commission agreed with the exporting producer, therefore\r\nthese transactions were removed from the total volume of subsidised imports\r\nfrom India. Accordingly, the volume, market share and the average price of the\r\nsubsidised imports were revised. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share of\r\nthe subsidised imports:\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume (MT) || 11 620 || 20 038 || 25 326 || 24 415 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 172 || 218 || 210 \n Market share || 8.8% || 10.7% || 12.9% || 12.4% \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 121 || 146 || 140 \n Source : Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KEI Industries exported\r\nlimited quantities of the product concerned during the IP and the transactions\r\nof the Venus group mentioned above also constituted limited quantities,\r\ntherefore the deduction of these import volumes from the total volume of\r\nsubsidised imports from India does not result in changes concerning in the\r\ntrends as described in recitals (123) and (124) to the provisional Regulation.\r\nThus these recitals to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average price of the\r\nsubsidised imports: \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Average price (euro/MT) || 2 419 || 2 856 || 3 311 || 3 259 \n Index (2009=100) || 100 || 118 || 137 || 135 \n Source : Eurostat and questionnaire replies \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As explained above, K.E.I\r\nIndustries exported limited quantities during the IP and the removal of certain\r\ntransactions of the Venus group affected only limited quantities. The exclusion\r\nof KEI Industries import volumes and the above mentioned transactions of the\r\nVenus group from the total volume of subsidised imports from India does\r\ntherefore not result in any significant change in the average price of the\r\nsubsidised Indian imports or in the undercutting calculations. The recalculated\r\nundercutting margin is 11.7%. For the rest, the conclusions drawn from the\r\nfindings described in recitals (128) to (130) to the provisional Regulation are\r\nconfirmed. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to the final\r\ndisclosure the GOI argued that the Commission had applied the pro rata\r\nreduction of subsidized imports only on the import volumes of cooperating\r\nexporting producers in order to take account of the de minimis findings KEI and\r\nthe removal of certain mistakenly double counted transactions of the Venus\r\ngroup. This claim is based on a misunderstanding. The Commission has applied\r\nthe pro rata reduction to the entire import volume, including non-cooperating\r\nimporters. It therefore has to be rejected.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic Situation of the\r\nUnion industry\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\nparties claimed that the results obtained by the Union industry should be\r\nconsidered as reasonably positive in the context of the global economic crisis\r\nand that with the exception of one injury indicator namely, market share, all\r\nother indicators did not point toward the existence of injury. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One\r\nparty claimed that the average selling prices of the Union industry increased\r\nby around 34% far more than its cost of production which increased by 13% over\r\nthe same period. In this respect it needs to be noted that at the beginning of\r\nthe period considered, namely in 2009, the Union industry was selling below\r\ncost of production, and only managed to sell above cost of production from 2011\r\nonwards. \n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\r\nthat although some injury indicators such as production volumes and capacity\r\nutilisation followed a positive trend, or remained stable such as employment, a\r\nnumber of other indicators relating to the financial situation of the Union industry,\r\nnamely profitability, cash flow, investment and return on investment did not\r\nfollow a satisfactory trend during the period considered. While the indicator\r\nrelating to investments improved in 2010, it dropped below 2009 figures in 2011\r\nand the IP. Although it is true that return on investments improved from 2009\r\nuntil 2011 reaching 6.7%, it dropped again to 0.8% in the IP. Similarly\r\nindicators relating to profitability and cash flow improved until 2011 they\r\nstarted again to deteriorate in the IP. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\r\nUnion industry started to improve after 2009, but its recovery was slowed down\r\nby the subsidised imports from India subsequently. \n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a request by an\r\ninterested party it is confirmed that the stock levels established in recital\r\n(153) to the provisional Regulation concerned the activity of the sampled Union\r\ncompanies.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union industry argued\r\nthat the target profit margin of 5% set at the provisional stage was too low.\r\nThe party did not substantiate its claim sufficiently. Recital (148) to the\r\nprovisional Regulation explains the reasons behind the choice of this profit\r\nmargin and the investigation did not reveal any other reasons to change it.\r\nTherefore, the target profit of 5% is maintained for the purpose of the\r\ndefinitive findings.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nargued that the Union industry\u2019s difficulties are largely due to structural\r\nproblems. Therefore, the target profit margin of 5% was also unrealistic. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that\r\naccording to the case law[8],\r\nthe Institutions need to establish the profit margin which the Community\r\nindustry could reasonably count on under normal conditions of competition, in\r\nthe absence of the subsidized imports. In the present case, it has proven\r\nimpossible to carry out this analysis for the Union industry of the product\r\nconcerned for the following reasons. Sufficient information to calculate profit\r\nmargins for the product concerned is only available as of the year 2007. In\r\n2007, the profit margin was 3.7%; as of 2008, due to the financial and economic\r\ncrisis, it became negative. The complaint argued, and the investigation\r\nestablished, that subsidised imports started to arrive on the Union market as\r\nof 2007, when the volume of imports increased from 17727 tons in 2006 to\r\n24811.3 tons. Therefore, the Institutions have established the target profit\r\nmargins on the basis of the real profits observed in other parts of the steel\r\nindustry, which have not suffered from dumped and subsidized imports.[9]\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury \n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission therefore\r\nconcludes that the Union industry has suffered material injury during the IP.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Causation\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of subsidised\r\nimports \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One exporting producer\r\nclaimed that the provisional Regulation ignored that the Union industry was\r\nable to benefit from the increase in consumption since 2009 and that the\r\nCommission cannot assume that the Union industry will be able to maintain its\r\nmarket share indefinitely. \n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to these\r\narguments it needs to be noted that the investigation revealed the market share\r\nof the subsidised Indian import grew with a higher pace than the consumption in\r\nthe Union market. The volume of Indian subsidised imports increased by 110%\r\nwhile the consumption increased by 50% over the same period. Furthermore the investigation\r\nalso showed that the average Indian price was constantly below the average\r\nprice of the Union industry during the same period and undercut the Union\r\nindustry average price by 11.7% during the IP. As a result, while the Union\r\nindustry indeed benefited from the increased consumption to a certain extent\r\nand it also could increase its sales volumes by 40%, it could not maintain its\r\nmarket share as it could be expected under improving market conditions and\r\ngiven the Union industry\u2019s free production capacity. \n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors\n6.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-subsidized imports\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some\r\ninterested parties claimed that the effect of the non-subsidized import needed\r\nto be reassessed in light of the fact that KEI Industries received a de-minimis\r\nsubsidy margin and the fact that due to double counting errors certain\r\ntransactions of the Venus group were removed from the analysis. They also\r\nargued that the prices of the non-subsidized imports were lower than the prices\r\nof the subsidized imports.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ntable below shows the development of the non-subsidised export volume and\r\nprices during the period considered. Their volume represented around a third of\r\nIndian exports during the IP and followed the same trend as the subsidized\r\nimports.\n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume (MT) || 5227 || 9015 || 11 394 || 10 938 \n Volume (Index) || 100 || 172 || 218 || 210 \n Average price || 2268 || 2678 || 3105 || 3056 \n Average price (Index) || 100 || 118 || 137 || 135 \n Source: Questionnaire replies and Eurostat \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore correct\r\nthat prices of non-subsidized imports were lower than prices of subsidized\r\nimports. However, the volume of non-subsidized imports is only a third of the\r\nvolume of subsidized imports. Therefore, the injury caused by non-subsidized\r\nimports does not break the causal link between the\r\nsubsidised imports, from India and the material injury suffered by the Union\r\nindustry during the IP. \n6.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from third countries\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One Indian exporting\r\nproducer and GOI reiterated the claim that People\u2019s Republic of China should have been included in the investigation and that the impact the imports from the\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China had on the Union market and the Union industry was\r\nunderestimated. \n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\r\n(170) to the provisional Regulation, neither at initiation stage nor at\r\ndefinitive stage there is any evidence of subsidisation that may have justified\r\nthe initiation of an anti- subsidy investigation on imports originating in People\u2019s Republic of China. The claim that People\u2019s\r\nRepublic of China should have been included in the scope of the investigation\r\nis therefore not founded and is rejected. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the imports from\r\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China showed an increasing trend during the period\r\nconsidered and reached a market share of 8.3% in the IP as stated in recital\r\n(168) to the provisional Regulation. In addition, the Chinese import prices\r\nwere lower than the prices of the Union industry and those of the Indian\r\nexporting producers in the Union market. It was, therefore, further\r\ninvestigated whether the imports from People\u2019s Republic of China could have contributed to the injury suffered by the Union industry and broken the\r\ncausal link between that injury and the Indian subsidized imports. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The information available\r\nat provisional stage suggested that the product mix represented by the Chinese\r\nimports was different and that the ranges where the Chinese products were\r\npresent were different compared to the products sold by the Union industry or\r\neven those of Indian origin products sold in the Union market.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After publication of the\r\nprovisional measure the Commission received several claims pointing to the\r\npossibility that Chinese low-priced imports during the IP would break the\r\ncausal link between dumped Indian imports and material injury suffered by the\r\nUnion industry.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis made on the basis\r\nof the import statistics concerning the two CN codes under investigation showed\r\nthat 29% of Chinese imports were made on the lower end of the market (under CN\r\ncode 7223 00 99). This partly explains why Chinese prices on average are lower\r\nthan those of the Union industry and the Indian exporting producers\u2019. The\r\nstatistics for CN code 7223 00 99 also showed that the customers of the Chinese\r\nproducers were concentrated in the United Kingdom where the Union industry was\r\nbasically not present. \n Volume (MT) || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n 7223 00 19 || 2 974 || 3 286 || 3 436 || 2 995 \n 7223 00 99 || 765 || 1 458 || 1 472 || 1 320 \n Source : Eurostat \n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concern CN code 7223 00\r\n19 the analyses carried out on PCN basis showed that both the Union industry\r\nand Indian producers were mainly competing in the higher end of the market\r\nwhere prices could be up to four times higher than prices in the lower end\r\nwithin the same CN.[10]\r\nThe investigation also showed that in general price variations are linked to\r\nthe product type and the nickel content. Furthermore the investigation showed\r\nthat Chinese exporters are predominantly selling the lower quality product\r\ntypes falling within the above mentioned CN code in the Union market. Therefore,\r\nthe product mix becomes a predominant factor in evaluating the Chinese imports.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As concerns the price level\r\nof imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China, it needs to be pointed out that\r\nfrom 2009 until the IP the average price of Chinese imports remained above of\r\nthe price of the subsidized Indian exporting producers\u2019 prices, as can be seen\r\nfrom the following table showing the average price of subsidized Indian exports\r\nfalling under CN code 7223 00 19. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average price (euro/MT) || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2009 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2010 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2011 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IP+1 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7332 00 19 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2974 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3286 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3436 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2995 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3093 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Source: Eurostat \n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the IP for the first\r\ntime the average Chinese import price dropped below that of the Indian import\r\nprice for subsidized imports. However, this observation was found to be of a\r\ntemporary nature since the Chinese price level in the year after the IP\r\nincreased and was again higher than the Indian prices. \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the comparison\r\nbetween the import volumes from India and People\u2019s Republic of China showed that at any point during the period considered and particularly in the IP, imports from\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China were at much lower levels than the imports from India. The import volumes for People\u2019s Republic of China amounted to basically less than\r\nhalf of the total imports from India. \n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above\r\nit is confirmed that significant proportion of the Chinese imports during the\r\nIP are different from the Union industry product mix and that any direct\r\ncompetition with the products produced and sold by the Union industry is\r\nlimited. \n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the imports from\r\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China could not have affected the situation of the\r\nUnion industry to the extent to break the causal link between the subsidised\r\nimports from India and the injury suffered by the Union industry. Therefore,\r\nrecital (168) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n6.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competition from other\r\nproducers in the Union\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\r\nUnion producers\u2019 poor financial performance might have been caused by\r\ncompetition from other Union producers which were not complainants or did not\r\nexpress their support to the investigation at the initiation of the case. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The market share of other\r\nproducers in the Union developed as follows: \n   || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || IP \n Volume (MT) || 34 926 || 55 740 || 55 124 || 55 124 \n Index (2009= 100) || 100 || 160 || 158 || 158 \n Market share of other producers in the Union || 26.6% || 29.8% || 28.1% || 27.9% \n Source: Complaint \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union producers which\r\nwere not complainants and which did not specifically express support to the\r\ninvestigation accounted for 44% of total Union sales reported in Recital (139)\r\nof the provisional Regulation. Their sales volume increased by 58% from an\r\nestimated 34926 tons in 2009 to 55124 tons during the period considered.\r\nHowever, such growth is relatively modest if compared to the growth of the\r\nsubsidised imports from India in the same period (+110%). Furthermore, the\r\nmarket share of those Union producers remained relatively stable during the\r\nperiod considered and no indication was found that their prices were lower than\r\nthose of the sampled Union producers. It is therefore concluded that their\r\nsales on the Union market did not contribute to the injury suffered by the\r\nUnion industry. \n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation \n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (176) to (179) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union interest\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations \n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecital (180) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\r\nindustry\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (181) to (188) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of users \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\r\nthe provisional measures, seven users and one users\u2019 association contacted the\r\nCommission and showed interest to cooperate in the investigation. Following\r\ntheir request, questionnaires were sent to them out in April 2013. However,\r\nonly two users submitted a full questionnaire reply and overall the cooperating\r\nusers represented 12% of total imports from India during the IP and 2.5% of the\r\ntotal Union consumption. The economic impact of the measures on users was\r\nreassessed on the basis of the new data available in the questionnaire replies\r\nand two users were visited to verify the information provided. \n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Users claimed that the\r\nlevel of profitability of 9%, stated in recital (191) to the provisional\r\nRegulation was too high and was not representative for the users\u2019 industry.\r\nFollowing the receipt of the additional questionnaire replies the average\r\nprofitability of all cooperating users was recalculated and established at 2% on\r\nturnover. \n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was also found that on\r\naverage concerning the cooperating users, purchases from India constituted 44% of the total purchases of the product concerned, and that India represented the exclusive source of supply for two cooperating users. During the IP,\r\nthe turnover of the product incorporating the product concerned represented on\r\naverage 14% of total turnover of the cooperating users. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assuming the worst case\r\nscenario for the Union market, i.e. that no potential price increase could be\r\npassed on to the distribution chain and that the users would continue\r\npurchasing from India in previous volumes, the impact of the duty on the users\u2019\r\nprofitability achieved from activities using or incorporating the product\r\nconcerned would mean on average a decrease by 0.25 percentage points to 1.75%.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission acknowledges that\r\nthe impact will be more important, on an individual level, for those users\r\nwhich source their entire imports from India. However, these are relatively few\r\nin numbers (two of the cooperating users). Furthermore, they have the\r\npossibility, provided that their Indian producer cooperates, to request the\r\nrefund of the duties pursuant to Article 21 of the Basic Regulation, if all\r\nconditions for such a refund are met.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some users reiterated the\r\nconcern that measures would hit certain type of wires not produced in Europe, namely types included in the so-called series 200 as described in recital (194) of\r\nthe provisional Regulation. According to the users, the absence of production\r\nin the Union is due to the limited demand and to the specificity of the\r\nproduction process. \n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the investigation\r\nshowed that such type of stainless steel wires are produced by the Union\r\nindustry and that they represent a limited share of the Union market. There are\r\nalso alternative source of supply available for users from countries not\r\nsubject to anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures. In addition, two Indian\r\nexporting producers received 0% countervailing duty rate, therefore the\r\nimposition of the measures will have no have significant effects on supplies\r\nfrom them. Furthermore, other product types of stainless steel wires can be\r\nused for the same purposes. Therefore, the imposition of the measures cannot\r\nhave a significant impact on the Union market and on these users. This claim is\r\ntherefore rejected.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 Some users pointed out the\r\nlonger delivery time for the like product by the Union producers compared to\r\nthe delivery time of the product concerned from India. However, the possibility\r\nof merchants and traders of stocking the products and of having them swiftly\r\navailable does not undermine the factual evidence of the negative effects of\r\nthe subsidised imports. Therefore, this argument has to be rejected. \n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the above into\r\nconsideration, even if some users are likely to be negatively affected by the\r\nmeasures on imports from India more than others, it is considered that in\r\nbalance the Union market will benefit from the imposition of the measures. In\r\nparticular, it is considered that restoring fair trade conditions on the Union\r\nmarket would allow the Union industry to align its prices with cost of\r\nproduction; to keep production and employment; to regain the market share\r\npreviously lost and to benefit from increased economies of scale. This should\r\nallow the industry to reach reasonable profit margins that will permit it to\r\noperate efficiently in the medium and long term. In parallel the industry will\r\nimprove its overall financial situation. In addition, the investigation\r\nestablished that the measures will have an overall limited impact on the users\r\nand on unrelated importers. Therefore it is concluded that the overall benefit\r\nof the measures appears to outweigh the impact on the users of the product\r\nconcerned in the Union market. \n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\r\nimporters\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of comments,\r\nrecitals (197) to (199) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\r\ninterest\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\r\nassessment in recitals (200) and (201) to the provisional Regulation is\r\nconfirmed. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive countervailing\r\nmeasures\n8.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any comments,\r\nrecitals (203) to (206) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on injury\r\nelimination level\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 No individual injury margin\r\nwas calculated for KEI Industries since this company\u2019s definitive subsidy\r\nmargin was at de minimis level as stated in recital (49) above.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 The methodology used in the\r\nprovisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. \n8.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above\r\nand in accordance with Article 15(1) of the basic Regulation, a definitive\r\ncountervailing duty should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the\r\ninjury caused by the subsidised imports without exceeding the subsidy margin\r\nfound.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the countervailing duty rates were established by comparing the\r\ninjury margins and the subsidy margins.

These\r\nduty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to 'all other\r\ncompanies') are exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in India and produced by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by\r\nany other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this\r\nworking document, including entities related to those specifically mentioned,\r\ncannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate\r\napplicable to 'all other companies'.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\r\napplication of an individual company countervailing duty rates (e.g. following\r\na change in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new\r\nproduction or sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission[11] forthwith with all relevant\r\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked\r\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that\r\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities.
