They will be implemented by means of the technical adjustments of\r\nthe MFF as provided for in the draft MFF Regulation and mobilised in the\r\nframework of the budgetary procedure pursuant to Article 314 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, no further modifications of\r\nthe FR are required for those flexibilities.\nConcerning the European Development Fund (EDF)\r\nand as noted by the European Council of 8 February 2013, the Commission intends\r\nto propose the budgetisation of the EDF as of 2021.\nNo further agreement was reached in the\r\ncontext of the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020\r\nconcerning the treatment of funds resulting from the agreements on the fight\r\nagainst the illegal traffic in tobacco products. Therefore, the Commission will\r\ncontinue implementing the agreements and propose, as it has done in its\r\nproposal for the Hercule III programme, appropriate financial means necessary\r\nto fight cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting by the EU, in addition to\r\nefforts undertaken by the Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs the present proposal merely implements\r\nthe outcome of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for the\r\nyears 2014-2020 and has a very limited scope, no public consultation was\r\ncarried out.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nArticle 9(2) of the draft MFF Regulation\r\nforesees that the annual amount of the Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR) is fixed at\r\nEUR 280 million (2011 prices) and may be used up to year n+1 in accordance with\r\nthe Financial Regulation. The Reserve shall be entered in the general budget of\r\nthe Union as a provision. The portion of the annual amount stemming from the\r\nprevious year shall be drawn on first. That portion of the annual amount from\r\nyear n which is not used in year n+1 shall lapse.\nThis requires two modifications in Article\r\n13 of the Financial Regulation (FR): the addition of the EAR in Article 13(2)\r\nFR and as an exception in Article 13(6) FR as the corresponding appropriations\r\nare entered in the budget in Title 40 (reserves) as a provision.\nAs regards the carry-over rule for projects\r\nfinanced under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the Commission proposed\r\nalready to modify the Financial Regulation in the explanatory memorandum to the\r\nproposal for a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial\r\nframework for the years 2014-2020 the carry-over of commitment appropriations\r\nto the year n+1[1].\r\nDue to their nature those infrastructure projects will in many cases require\r\ncomplex contracting procedures. Under those circumstances, even limited delays\r\nmay result in a loss of annual commitment appropriations and undermine the\r\nviability of those projects and thus of the Union's political determination to\r\nmodernise its transport, energy and telecommunications networks and\r\ninfrastructure. \nThe agreed compromise text for the CEF\r\nprovides in its Article 19 that: \n\"Appropriations which have not been\r\nused at the end of the financial year for which they were entered shall be\r\ncarried-over in accordance with Regulation (EU) No XXXX/2012 [New Financial\r\nRegulation].\"\nThe current wording of the FR would not\r\nallow the carry-over of commitment appropriations to n+1, consequently a\r\nmodification of the FR is necessary as it constitutes a derogation from the\r\nprinciple of annuality. Accordingly, Article 13(2) of the Financial Regulation needs\r\nalso to be amended to allow for automatic carry-over to the following financial\r\nyear of commitment appropriations not used at the end of a financial year for\r\nprojects financed under the CEF.\n2013/0313 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No\r\n966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 322 thereof, in\r\nconjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,\r\nand in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court\r\nof Auditors[2],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure[3],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU, EURATOM)\r\nNo 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4] was adopted on 25 October 2012\r\nand was accompanied by a joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council\r\nand the Commission agreeing to revise the Financial Regulation in order to take\r\ninto account the outcome of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework\r\nfor the years 2014-2020. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the political agreement\r\non the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 and on the establishment\r\nof the Connecting Europe Facility, and in line with the joint statement, it is\r\nnecessary to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 to include the\r\ncarry-over rules for the Emergency Aid Reserve and for projects financed under\r\nthe Connecting Europe Facility.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the Emergency\r\nAid Reserve, the corresponding appropriations are entered in the reserve Title\r\nof the budget. Therefore, Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 needs to be amended\r\nin order to provide for the carry-over to year n+1 of the appropriations placed\r\nin reserve and not used in year n. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to their nature\r\nprojects financed under the Connecting Europe Facility will in many cases\r\nrequire complex contracting procedures. Under those circumstances, even limited\r\ndelays may result in a loss of annual commitment appropriations and undermine\r\nthe viability of those projects and thus of the Union's political determination\r\nto modernise its transport, energy and telecommunications networks and\r\ninfrastructure. To prevent this, Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 should\r\nallow for automatic carry-over to the following financial year of commitment\r\nappropriations not used at the end of a financial year for projects financed\r\nunder the Connecting Europe Facility,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012\nArticle 13 of Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012\r\nis amended as follows:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In paragraph 2, the\r\nfollowing points (c) and (d) are added:\n\"(c) amounts corresponding to commitment\r\nappropriations for the Emergency Aid Reserve.\n\"(d) amounts corresponding to commitment\r\nappropriations for projects financed under the Connecting Europe Facility\".\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In paragraph 2, the\r\nfollowing second subparagraph is added:\n\"The amounts referred to in points (c) and\r\n(d) of the first subparagraph may be carried over to the next financial year\r\nonly.\"\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph 6 is replaced by\r\nthe following:\n\"6. Without prejudice to point (c) of Article\r\n13(2) and Article 14, appropriations placed in reserve and appropriations for\r\nstaff expenditure shall not be carried over.
