These resulted in April 2007 in agreed commitments concerning human\r\nrights, democratic principles and the rule of law. On 1 October 2007 the\r\nCouncil, in its Decision 2007/641/EC decided on appropriate measures for Fiji to establish a degree of parallelism between Fiji\u2019s respect for the agreed commitments and\r\ndevelopment cooperation. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 10 April 2009, Fiji\u2019s President abrogated the Constitution, removed all judges and declared that elections\r\nwould take place at the latest in September 2014. In doing so, Fiji unilaterally broke key commitments it had given to the EU in April 2007. This happened\r\nthe day after the Appeals Court had ruled the appointment of the military-led\r\ngovernment following the coup in 2006 to be illegal. Fiji was also placed under\r\na state of emergency and freedom of expression substantially curtailed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following these negative\r\ndevelopments, the Council decided, on 24 September 2009, in its Decision\r\n2009/735/EC, to extend until 31 March 2010 the validity of the appropriate measures\r\nlaid down in Decision 2007/641/EC, which was due to expire on 1 October 2009.\r\nDue to further delays in implementing the commitments agreed with the EU the\r\nCouncil decided, on 29 March 2010 in its Decision 2010/208/EU, to extend until\r\n1 October 2010, the validity of the appropriate measures for Fiji\r\nestablished in Decision 2007/641/EC, and then again on 27 September 2010 in its\r\nDecision 2010/589/EU until 31 March 2011, on 31 March 2011 in its Decision\r\n2011/219/EU until 30 September 2011, and on 26 September 2011 in its Decision\r\n2011/637/EU until 30 September 2012.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nsome positive developments in early 2012, i.e. the lifting of the Public\r\nEmergency Regulations on 7 January 2012 and the launch on 9 March 2012 of a\r\npolitical process with a view to having a new Constitution by March 2013 and\r\nthe re-establishment of a constitutional democracy in the wake of new parliamentary\r\nelections by September 2014, the Council decided on 24 September 2012 in its\r\nDecision No 2012/523/EU to open prospective reengagement toward the programming\r\nof future development assistance whilst extending the validity of the\r\nappropriate measures until 30 September 2013.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main source of funding\r\nfor Fiji is the Accompanying Measures for Former Sugar Protocol Countries\r\n(AMSP). Assistance is channelled through non-governmental bodies (regional\r\norganisations and NGOs) to cushion the economic and social impacts of the sugar\r\nsector restructuring by supporting a diversified market-driven agriculture,\r\npromoting alternative livelihoods and income generating activities for the worst\r\naffected populations and alleviating risks to natural disasters. Of the total\r\nallocation of EUR 60 million under MIP 2008-10 of the 10th EDF, only\r\nEUR 8 million were committed for the Social Mitigation programme (AAP 2010).\r\nEUR 52 million have been lost due to the lack of progress in Fiji's return to democratic rule. Another allocation of EUR 49 million was approved under\r\nthe 10th EDF for MIP 2011-13, EUR 17 million were committed in 2011\r\nand 2012 for the Key Services to Agriculture and Alternative Livelihood\r\nprogrammes and EUR 31 million are to be committed before the end of 2013 for\r\nSupport for the Sugar Industry.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Constitution Commission\r\nwas established in June 2012. After extensive public consultations, it\r\nfinalised a draft Constitution in December 2012. The police then confiscated\r\nthe draft Constitution and the Prime Minister tasked the government's legal\r\nteam with drafting a new Constitution to be reviewed and completed by a ConstituentAassembly\r\nby end March 2013. In mid-January 2013 a new controversial ecree on (re-) registration\r\nof political parties was published introducing a number of restrictions many of\r\nwhich are not in line with customary international law. The decree was amended\r\nin mid-February to introduce even further restrictions. On 21 March in an\r\naddress to the nation, the Prime Minister presented the new draft Consitution\r\nto the people, and informed the country that the Constituent Assembly would not\r\nbe formed, due to the lack of registration of political parties under the new decree.\r\nInstead the people were invited to convey directly, by diferent means, their\r\ncomments on the draft Constitution. Currently the government is finalising the\r\ndraft after having received some 1100 comments. It is still not clear to what\r\nextent the public comments will be taken on board in the new Constitution. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fiji is embarking on a\r\nhistorical process of new democratisation. The forthcoming steps should lead to\r\na transparent, credible and participatory electoral process and to democratic\r\nelections. The milestones towards achieving this have been shifting, which is\r\nwhy the Commission proposes to the Council to extend the current policy and\r\nappropriate measures by 18 months with a possibility at any stage to review the\r\nappropriate measures by way of a new Council decision. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a view to encouraging Fiji to continue on its path towards the restoration\r\nof democracy, rule of law and full respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, and with the final aim of normalising the situation with Fiji, the EU\r\nshould step up political engagement with Fiji, and resume political dialogue\r\nwith the aim to revise and update the commitments agreed with the Republic of\r\nFiji in 2007 in order to delete obsolete items and ensure commitment\r\nrequirements are in line with the new Constitution. An important part of this\r\ndialogue would be conducted during the crucial period in Fiji's democratisation process as the country moves towards the elections to be held at the\r\nlatest in September 2014. \n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is proposed to notify\r\nthis Decision to the interim Government of Fiji, on the basis of the attached\r\ndraft letter to President Nailatikau, and to inform him \n\u00b7                        \r\na) that the EU looks forward to the next steps\r\nleading to a transparent, participatory and credible electoral process,to free\r\nand fair elections, and to Fiji returning to democratic rule; \n\u00b7                        \r\nb) that the progress made towards a return to\r\nconstitutional rule will continue to guide the EU in its upcoming decisions on\r\ndevelopment cooperation, and that in this spirit the EU is willing to continue\r\nto engage in preparation for the 11th EDF programming process, and\r\nto notify in due course an indicative national financial allocation, while\r\nfinalisation, signature and implementation of 11th EDF programming\r\ndocuments will be envisaged with the democratically elected government and\r\n\n\u00b7                        \r\nc) that the EU proposes to enhance political\r\ndialogue, with a view to reviewing the agreed commitments of 2007 and to adapting\r\nthe appropriate measures accordingly, with the ultimate goal of normalising\r\nrelationships with Fiji.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The changes to the\r\nappropriate measures will be a consequence of the revision and updating of the\r\n2007 agreed commitments by way of the political dialogue and will reflect the\r\npresent political and legal context of Fiji. The programming discussions for\r\nthe 11th EDF can continue in line with the Council Decision of 2012\r\nand the notification of Fiji's indicative financing allocation, once the\r\nnecessary decisions on the establishment of the next EDF so allow.\nConclusion\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Council\r\nis requested to adopt the attached draft proposal for a Council Decision\r\namending and extending the period of application of the appropriate measures for\r\nthe Republic of Fiji.\n2013/0289 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nAmending Council Decision 2007/641/EC,\r\nconcerning the republic of Fiji Islands and extending the period of application\r\nthereof\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement\r\nbetween the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of\r\nthe one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other\r\npart, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000[1],\r\nas revised at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on 22 June 2010[2] (hereinafter referred to as the\r\nCotonou Agreement), and in particular Article 96 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement\r\nbetween the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting\r\nwithin the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for\r\nthe implementation of the Cotonou Agreement[3],\r\nand in particular Article 3 thereof,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No\r\n1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006\r\nestablishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (the\r\nDevelopment Cooperation Instrument)[4],\r\nand in particular Article 37 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2007/641/EC[5]\r\nwas adopted to take appropriate measures following the violation of the\r\nessential elements referred to in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, and the\r\nvalues referred to in Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those measures have been\r\nextended by Council Decision 2009/735/EC[6],\r\nand subsequently by Council Decisions 2010/208/EU[7], 2010/589/EU[8], 2011/219/EU[9], 2011/637/EU[10], and 2012/523/EU[11], since not only has the\r\nRepublic of Fiji yet to implement important commitments it made in\r\nconsultations held in April 2007 concerning essential elements of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement, but there had also been important regressive developments concerning\r\na number of these commitments.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There have been\r\nconsiderable developments since April 2007 and the commitments agreed with the\r\nRepublic of Fiji Islands will need to be revised accordingly. Political\r\ndialogue will be the context for reviewing the commitments with the light of\r\nthe current legal situation.

Ratu Epeli NAILATIKAU\nPresident of the Republic of   Fiji \nSuva\nRepublic of Fiji \r\nYour Excellency,\nThe European Union (EU)\r\nattaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EU\r\npartnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and\r\nthe rule of law, which form the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement,\r\nand are the basis of our relations.\nSix years have elapsed\r\nsince the EU took a decision on the appropriate measures following the military\r\ncoup of 2006, and since a set of commitments were agreed with Fiji.\nThe EU notes that that\r\nsince 2007 some of the agreed commitments have become outdated and some are in\r\nneed of revision in the light of Fiji\u2019s new legal framework. In order to have\r\nan appropriate basis for assessing Fiji's reform progress, we need to revise\r\nthese commitments together, taking into account the current situation and the\r\nlegal framework. \nThe EU has therefore\r\ndecided to include in its new decision on appropriate measures a requirement that\r\nthe EU engage with Fiji in an enhanced political dialogue under Article 8 of\r\nthe Cotonou Agreement. This will be with a view to revise together the agreed\r\ncommitments of 2007 and to adapt the appropriate measures (annexed to this\r\nletter) accordingly as necessary steps towards ensuring respect for human\r\nrights, the restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law, until\r\nboth parties conclude that the enhanced nature of the dialogue has served its\r\npurpose. \nAs some restrictions on\r\ncertain human rights and fundamental freedoms remain in Fiji and in light of the necessary revision of the agreed commitments, the EU has decided\r\nto extend the appropriate measures by 18 months, until 31 March 2015. This will\r\nprovide for the necessary flexibility and will give both the EU and Fiji the time they need to agree on the commitments, to adapt the appropriate measures\r\naccordingly, and for the government to hold its elections planned for September\r\n2014. \nThe EU will monitor the\r\nprogress made towards a return to constitutional rule and this will continue to\r\nguide our upcoming decisions on development cooperation. In this spirit the EU confirms\r\nits willingness to engage in preparations for the 11th EDF programming process,\r\nand to notify in due course an indicative national financing allocation in this\r\nprocess. The finalisation, signature and implementation of 11th EDF programming\r\ndocuments will be envisaged with the democratically elected government.\nOnce Fiji has held free and fair elections and met the revised agreed commitments, an Article 96 review\r\nmission, in line with the Cotonou Agreement, will be conducted in Fiji. Based on an agreement on the recommendations of this assessment, the article 96\r\nappropriate measures can then be concluded for Fiji. \nIn order to advance cooperation\r\nunder the Cotonou Agreement and the Development Cooperation Instrument, the EU\r\ninvites the Interim Government to engage in an enhanced political dialogue with\r\nthe EU, starting as soon as possible.\nThe EU also welcomes\r\nthe engagement with the Pacific Island's Forum Ministerial Contact Group set up\r\nto monitor the progress of Fiji's preparations for the elections and its return\r\nto democracy and looks forward to the next steps for a transparent,\r\nparticipatory and credible electoral process, leading to free and fair\r\nelections and Fiji's return to democratic rule.\n\r\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\n For the Council || For the Commission \n C. ASHTON || A.PIEBALGS \n President || Commissioner \nAnnex 1 to the Annex\nThe appropriate measures,\r\nwhich will be adapted following the revision of the agreed commitments under\r\nthe enhanced political dialogue, are as follows:\n\u00b7       \r\nhumanitarian aid and direct support to civil\r\nsociety and vulnerable populations may continue;\n\u00b7       \r\nthe cooperation activities under way, in\r\nparticular under the 8th and 9th EDFs, was allowed to\r\ncontinue; \n\u00b7       \r\ncooperation activities that would help the\r\nreturn to democracy and improve governance may be pursued, save under very\r\nexceptional circumstances;\n\u00b7       \r\nimplementation of the sugar reform accompanying\r\nmeasures for 2006 was allowed to proceed. The Financing Agreement was signed at\r\nthe technical level by Fiji on 19 June 2007. It is noted that the Financing\r\nAgreement includes a suspension clause;\n\u00b7       \r\nthe 2007 sugar allocation is zero;\n\u00b7       \r\navailability of the 2008 sugar allocation was\r\nsubject to evidence of credible and timely preparation of elections in\r\naccordance with the agreed commitments, notably regarding a census, the\r\nredrafting of boundaries and electoral reform in accordance with the Constitution,\r\nand measures taken to ensure the functioning of the Elections Office, including\r\nthe appointment of a Supervisor of Elections by 30 September 2007 in accordance\r\nwith the Constitution. This 2008 sugar allocation was lost on 31 December 2009;\n\u00b7       \r\nthe 2009 sugar allocation was cancelled in May\r\n2009 because the Interim Government decided to delay general elections until\r\nSeptember 2014;\n\u00b7       \r\nthe 2010 allocation was cancelled before 1 May\r\n2010 as no progress was made in the continuation of the democratic process;\r\nhowever, given the critical situation of the sugar sector part of the\r\nallocation was set aside for direct assistance to the population directly\r\ndependent on sugar production in order to mitigate adverse social consequences.\r\nThese funds are centrally managed by the EU's Delegation in Suva and not\r\nchannelled through the Government;\n\u00b7       \r\nthe preparation of programming for the 11th\r\nEDF may be launched, so that Fiji could expect to be notified of an indicative\r\nallocation in due course. \n\u00b7       \r\nspecific support for the preparation and\r\nimplementation of key commitments, in particular in support of the preparation\r\nand/or holding of elections, could be considered;\n\u00b7       \r\nregional cooperation, and Fiji\u2019s participation in it, is unaffected;\n\u00b7       \r\nmonitoring of the commitments will be in\r\naccordance with the terms in the Annex to this letter concerning regular\r\ndialogue, and effective cooperation with assessment and monitoring missions and\r\nreporting.\nAnnex 2 to the Annex\r\n\n\r\nCOMMITMENTS AGREED WITH THE\r\nREPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS IN 2007\r\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Respect for Democratic\r\nPrinciples\nCommitment No 1\nThat free and fair\r\nparliamentary elections take place within 24 months from 1 March 2007, subject\r\nto the findings of an assessment to be carried out by the independent auditors\r\nappointed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.
