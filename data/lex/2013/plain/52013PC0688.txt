The conclusion of the agreements signed with the different affected\r\nWTO Members is underway (awaiting ratification in five Member States).\nFollowing the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nand Romania to the EU, their GATS schedules have to be consolidated with that\r\nof the EU-25 and the process of consolidation of the certified EU-25 GATS\r\nschedule and of schedules of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania has been\r\nlaunched (EU-27).\nWith\r\na Communication pursuant to Article V of the GATS (circulated as document\r\nS/SECRET/11, dated 30 October 2007, and

adjustment\r\nresulting from the modification of GATS trade commitments as a consequence of\r\nthe accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union. \nFollowing\r\nthe submission of that Communication, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Federative Republic of Brazil, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of India, the Hong Kong Special Administrative\r\nRegion of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan and the United Mexican States[2] submitted respective claims of\r\ninterest.\nPursuant to paragraph 4 of the procedures\r\nfor the implementation of Article XXI of the GATS (S/L/80), the modifying\r\nMember and any Member considering itself affected shall negotiate with a view\r\nto reaching an agreement within three months following the last date on which a\r\nclaim of interest may be made. \nNegotiations with the Commonwealth of Australia, the Federative Republic of Brazil, Canada, the\r\nRepublic of India, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s\r\nRepublic of China and Japan resulted in the draft Agreements in the form of an\r\nExchange of Letters that were initialled by the EU side on XXXX [date to be\r\nadded later] and by the Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia, the Federative Republic of Brazil, Canada, the Republic of India,\r\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
