Such a\nsystem entails essentially the electronic register of the dates and places of entry\nand exit of each\nthird-country national admitted for a short stay.\nThis proposal was endorsed in the Stockholm\nProgramme[2]\nagreed by the European Council in December 2009.\nFollowing the\nEuropean Council of 23 and 24 June 2011 asking the smart borders package to be\npushed forward rapidly, i.e. work on legislative proposals for an entry/exit\nsystem (EES) and a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP)[3], the Commission published a\nCommunication on 25 October 2011,[4]\non the implementation options for the EES and the RTP. \nThis proposal is presented together with a\nproposal to establish a Registered Traveller Programme and a proposal to amend\nthe Community Code on the rules governing checks at external border crossing\npoints and surveillance at the external border (Schengen Borders Code)[5] for the purpose of the functioning of the\ntwo new systems. Impact assessments are presented for each system.\n\u00b7      General context\nAccording to the Schengen Borders Code, EU\ncitizens and other persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law (e.g.\nfamily members of EU citizens) crossing the external border shall be subject to\na minimum check, both at entry and exit, consisting of the verification of the\ntravel document in order to establish the identity of the person. All other\nthird country nationals however must be subject, at entry, to a thorough check,\nwhich implies a check of their purpose of stay, possession of sufficient means\nof subsistence, as well as a search in the Schengen Information System (SIS)\nand in national databases. \nThere are no provisions in the Schengen\nBorders Code on the recording of travellers' cross border movements. Currently,\nstamping the travel document is the sole method to indicate the dates of entry\nand exit which can be used by border guards and immigration authorities to\ncalculate the duration of the stay of a third-country national in the Schengen\narea, which shall not exceed 90 days within a period of 180 days. Other\nmeasures and tools available at border crossing points, such as databases (SIS\nand the Visa Information System \u2013 VIS), the consultation of which is compulsory\nat entry, but not at exit, are not intended for the purpose of recording border\ncrossings and do not provide for this functionality. The main purpose of the\nVIS is to permit the verification of the visa application history and, at entry,\nto verify whether the person presenting the visa at the border is the same\nperson to whom the visa has been issued.\nThere are currently no electronic means to\ncheck if, where and when a third-country national has entered or left the\nSchengen area. Difficulties in monitoring the authorised stay of third country\nnationals are also caused by the use and quality of the stamps (e.g.\nreadability, lengthy process of calculating the stay, forgery and\ncounterfeiting).\nFor these reasons, there is no consistent EU-wide record of\nentries and exits of travellers to and from the Schengen area and thus no reliable\nmeans for Member States to determine if a third-country national has exceeded\nhis/her right to stay. Thirteen Member States[6]\nrun their own national entry/exit systems collecting alphanumeric data of\ntravellers. All 13 Member States give access for border management as well as law\nenforcement purposes. To the extent that a person lawfully exits the same\nMember State through which he or she entered, an overstay would be detected by\nthese systems. Beyond that, the possibilities for using such systems to detect\noverstayers are none, as entry and exit records cannot be matched when persons\nleave the Schengen area through another Member State than the one from which\nthey entered and in which their entry was recorded. \nReliable data on the number of irregular\nimmigrants currently staying in the EU does not exist either. Conservative\nestimates of the number of irregular immigrants within the EU vary between 1.9\nand 3.8 million. It is generally agreed that a clear majority of irregular\nimmigrants are so-called overstayers, i.e. persons who have entered legally for\na short stay, with a valid visa when required, and then remained in the EU when\ntheir authorised stay has expired. In terms of apprehensions of irregular\nimmigrants[7]\nin the EU the total for 2010 (EU 27) was 505 220, which shows in comparison to\nthe above estimate that only a small proportion of overstayers is apprehended. \nIn case third country nationals destroy\ntheir documentation once they have entered the Schengen area it is very\nimportant for the authorities to have access to reliable information to establish the\nidentity of such persons. \nThe legislative financial statement annexed\nto this proposal is based on the study on the costs of an EES and an RTP\ncarried out by an external contractor.\nThe objectives of the present proposal for\na Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council are: \n\u2013     \nto create an EES and establish a legal basis for\nthe development and implementation of the technical system; \n\u2013     \nto define the purpose, the functionalities and\nresponsibilities for use of the EES; and \n\u2013     \nto confer on the Agency for the operational\nmanagement of large-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security\nand justice[8]\n(the Agency), the development and operational management of the central system.\n\nThis Regulation shall constitute the core\ninstrument for the legal framework for the EES. To complement this legal\nframework, a proposal for amending the Schengen Borders\nCode as regards the use of the\nsystem as part of the border management process, is presented in parallel with\nthis proposal.\nThe purpose of the EES will be to improve the\nmanagement of the external border and the fight against irregular migration, by\nproviding a system that will\n\u00b7      Calculate the authorised stay of each traveller; this includes at\nentry, in case of a traveller having visited the Schengen area frequently, to\nquickly and precisely calculate how many days there are left of the maximum of\n90 days within 180 days; at exit, to verify that the traveller has respected\nthe authorised stay; and within the territory, in relation to carrying out\nchecks on third-country nationals to verify the legality of their stay;\n\u00b7      Assist in the identification of any person who may not, or may no\nlonger, fulfil the conditions for entry to, or stay on the territory of the\nMember States; this concerns notably persons who are found during checks within\nthe territory not in possession of their travel documents or any other means of\nidentification;\n\u00b7      To support the analysis of the entries and exits of third-country\nnationals; this includes notably getting a precise picture of travel flows at\nthe external borders and the number of overstayers eg by nationality of\ntravellers.\nThe expected impact of the system is further\nassessed and detailed in the impact assessment and can be summarised as\nfollows:\n\u00b7      Providing precise information in a rapid way to border guards during\nborder checks, by replacing the current slow and unreliable system of manual\nstamping of passports; this will allow for both a better monitoring of the\nauthorised stay as well as more efficient border checks;\n\u00b7      Providing precise information to travellers on the maximum length of\ntheir authorised stay;\n\u00b7      Providing precise information on who is overstaying their authorised\nstay, which will support controls within the territory and to apprehend\nirregular migrants; \n\u00b7      Support the identification of irregular migrants; by storing biometrics\nin the EES on all persons not subject to the visa requirement, and taking into\naccount that the biometrics of visa holders are stored in the VIS, Member\nStates' authorities will be able to identify any undocumented irregular migrant\nfound within the territory that crossed the external border legally; this will\nin turn facilitate the return process;\n\u00b7      The analysis generated by the system will allow for an evidence-based\napproach to e.g. visa policy, as the EES will provide precise data on whether\nthere is problem with overstayers of a given nationality or not, which would be\nan important element when deciding whether to impose or lift, as the case may\nbe, the visa obligation on the third country in question; \n\u00b7      By abolishing the manual element of stamping of passports from the\nborder check it becomes possible to provide for fully automated border controls\nfor certain third-country nationals, under the conditions laid down in the\nproposal for a Registered Traveller Programme presented in parallel with this\nproposal.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 562/2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules\ngoverning the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code).\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 1931/2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at\nthe external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of\nthe Schengen Convention.\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 767/2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS)\nand the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS\nRegulation).\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas.\nRegulation of the European Parliament and\nof the Council (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the\noperational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom,\nsecurity and justice.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT\nASSESSMENT\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nThis is described in the accompanying\nimpact assessment.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe first impact assessment[9] was carried out in 2008 when\npreparing the Commission Communication on this subject and the second one was\nfinalised in 2012[10].\nThe former analysed the policy options and their most likely impacts and\nconcluded that an EES should be established. \nFollowing a consultations and pre-screening\nprocess the latter impact assessment analysed key implementation options.\nAnalysis of the different options and\nsub-options showed that the preferred solution for an EES should be the\nfollowing:\nThe EES will be designed as a centralised system\ncontaining both alphanumeric and biometric data. The data retention period would\nbe for ordinary cases six months and in case of overstay five years.\nThe use of biometrics would be subject to a\ntransitional period of three years to allow for Member States' adapting\nprocesses at the border crossing points.\nAfter a period of two years, the EES should\nbe evaluated and, in this context the Commission would evaluate in particular the\npossible access to the system for law enforcement purposes as well as the\nretention period, also taking into account the experience of access for such\npurposes to the VIS. The evaluation would be accompanied, as appropriate, by a\nCommission proposal to amend the Regulation to define the conditions for such\naccess. Those conditions would need to be strictly defined in order to provide\nan accurate data protection regime and could be modelled on those foreseen by\nthe VIS legal basis. \nThe Impact Assessment Board (IAB) reviewed\nthe draft impact assessment and delivered its opinion on 14 March 2012 and (on\na revised version) on 8 June 2012. The recommendations for improvement were\naccommodated in the revised version of the report. In particular, the following\nchanges were made: further information is provided on the consultation of\ninterested parties; the overall logic has been reviewed and streamlined; the\nproblem definition has been further developed and made more detailed, both in\nrelation to the overall problem of irregular migration and in relation to\nspecific implementation problems; the baseline scenario has been extended to\nbetter describe how it would evolve without further EU action; the options have\nbeen restructured and simplified; the assessment of the options have been\nrefined and done in a more logical manner showing which options are linked and\nwhich are not; the explanation of the method used for calculating the costs was\nexpanded; the analysis and description of the preferred option have been\nrevised and linked more directly to data that will become available in the\nfuture.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed actions\nThe purpose, functionalities and\nresponsibilities for the EES must be defined. Furthermore, a mandate needs to\nbe given to the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems\nin the area of freedom, security and justice to develop and operationally\nmanage the system. A detailed explanation of the proposal by article can be\nfound in a separate Commission Staff Working Paper.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nArticles 74 and 77(2)(b)\nand (d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is the legal\nbasis for this Regulation. Article 77(2)(b) and (d) is the appropriate legal\nbasis for further specifying the measures on the crossing of the external\nborders of the Member States and developing standards and procedures to be\nfollowed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at such borders. Article\n74 provides the appropriate legal basis for setting-up and maintaining the EES\nand for procedures for the exchange of information between Member States,\nensuring cooperation between the relevant authorities of the Member States\u2019 as\nwell as between those authorities and the Commission in the areas covered by\nTitle V of the Treaty.\n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nUnder Article 77(2)(b) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, the Union has the power to adopt measures\nrelating to the checks on persons and efficient monitoring of the crossing of\nexternal borders of the Member States. The current EU provisions on the\ncrossing of the external borders of the Member States need to be modified to\ntake into account that there are currently no reliable means to monitor the\ntravel movements of third-country nationals admitted for a short stay given the\ncomplexity and slowness of the current stamping obligation, which is\ninsufficient for allowing Members States' authorities to assess the authorised\nstay at the border check of the traveller or at checks within the territory and\nthe very limited value of national systems for such purposes in an area without\ninternal border control.\nThe information on who is on EU territory\nand who complies with the maximum allowed short stay of 90 days within 180 days,\non nationalities and groups (visa exempt/required) of travellers overstaying\nand to support random checks within the territory to detect irregularly staying\npersons should be available to increase the efficiency of migration\nmanagement.\nA common regime is needed in order to establish\nharmonised rules on the records of cross border\nmovements and monitoring of authorised stays for the Schengen area as a whole.\nTherefore, the objective of the proposal\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. \n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on the European\nUnion states that action by the Union shall not go beyond what is necessary to\nachieve the objectives of the Treaty. The form chosen for this EU action must\nenable the proposal to achieve its objective and be implemented as effectively\nas possible. The proposed initiative constitutes a further development of the\nSchengen acquis in order to ensure that common rules at external borders are\napplied in the same way in all the Schengen Member States. It creates an\ninstrument providing to the European Union information on how many third\ncountry nationals enter and leave the territory of the EU, which is\nindispensible for sustainable and evidence based policy making in the field of\nmigration and visa. Furthermore, it is proportionate in\nterms of the right to protection of personal data in that it does not require\nthe collection and storage of more data for a longer period than is absolutely\nnecessary to allow the system to function and meet its objectives. It is also\nproportionate in terms of costs, taking into account the benefits the system\nwill provide to all Member States in managing the common external border and\nprogressing towards a common EU migration policy.\nThe proposal therefore complies with the\nproportionality principle.\n\u00b7      Choice of instrument \nProposed instruments: Regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the following\nreason(s):\nThe present proposal will set up a\ncentralised system through which Member States cooperate with each other, something\nwhich requires a common architecture and operating rules. Moreover it will lay down rules on border checks at the\nexternal borders which are uniform for all Member States. As a consequence,\nonly a Regulation can be chosen as a legal instrument.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fundamental rights\nThe proposed regulation has an impact on\nfundamental rights, notably on the protection of personal data (Article 8 of\nthe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU), right to liberty and security\n(Article 6 of the Charter), respect for private and family life (Article 7 of\nthe Charter), right to asylum (Article 18 of the Charter) and protection in the\nevent of removal, expulsion or extradition (Article 19 of the Charter).\nThe proposal contains safeguards as regards\npersonal data, in particular access thereto, which should be strictly limited\nonly to the purpose of this Regulation and to the therein designated competent\nauthorities. Safeguards as regards personal data also include the right of\naccess to or the right of correction or deletion of data. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Commission's\nproposal for the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF) includes a\nproposal of 4,6 billion EUR for the internal security Fund (ISF) for the period\n2014-2020. In the proposal, 1,1 billion EUR is set aside as an indicative\namount for the development of an EES and an RTP assuming development costs\nwould start from 2015[11].\u00a0\n\nThis financial support would cover not only\nthe costs of central components for the entire MFF period (EU level, both\ndevelopment and operational cost) but also the development costs for the\nnational, Member States, components of these two systems, within the resources\navailable. Providing financial support for national development costs would\nensure that difficult economic circumstances at national level do not\njeopardise or delay the projects. This includes an amount on 146 million EUR\nfor costs at national level related to hosting the IT systems, the space for\nhosting the end-user equipment, and the space for operators' offices. It also\nincludes an amount of 341 million EUR for costs at national level related to\nmaintenance such as for hardware and software licenses.\nOnce the new\nsystems would be operational, future operational costs in the Member States\ncould be supported by their national programmes. It is proposed that Member\nStates may use 50% of the allocations under the national programmes to support\noperating costs of IT systems used for the management\nof migration flows across the external borders of the Union. These costs may\ninclude the cost for the management of VIS, SIS and new systems set up in the\nperiod, staff costs, service costs, rental of secure premises etc. Thus, the\nfuture instrument would ensure continuity of funding, where appropriate. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b7      Participation\nThis proposal builds upon the Schengen acquis\nin that it concerns the crossing of external borders. Therefore the following\nconsequences in relation to the various protocols and agreements with\nassociated countries have to be considered:\nDenmark: In\naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (no 22) on the position of\nDenmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), Denmark does not take part in the\nadoption by the Council of measures pursuant to Title V of part Three of the\nTFEU. \nGiven that this Regulation builds upon the\nSchengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that\nProtocol decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this\nRegulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland: In accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Protocol integrating the\nSchengen acquis into the framework of the European Union and Council Decision\n2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, and Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28\nFebruary 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the\nprovisions of the Schengen acquis, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take\npart in Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code). Therefore, the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of the this\nRegulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\nIceland and Norway: The procedures laid down in the Association Agreement concluded by\nthe Council and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning\nthe latter's association with the implementation, application and development\nof the Schengen acquis are applicable, since the present proposal builds on the\nSchengen acquis as defined in Annex A of this Agreement[12].\nSwitzerland: This\nRegulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the\nSwiss Confederation on the latter's association with the implementation,\napplication and development of the Schengen acquis[13].\nLiechtenstein: This Regulation constitutes a development\nof the provisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community,\nthe Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession\nof the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European\nUnion, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss\nConfederation's association with the implementation, application and\ndevelopment of the Schengen acquis[14].\nCyprus, Bulgaria and\nRomenia: This Regulation establishing the EES replaces the respective\nobligation to verify the length of the stay and to stamp the passport of third\ncountry nationals. These provisions were to be applied by the acceding Member\nStates upon accession to the European Union.\n2013/0057 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing an Entry/Exit System (EES) to\nregister entry and exit data of third country nationals crossing the external\nborders of the Member States of the European Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty of the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 74 and Article 77(2)(b)\nand (d) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\nCommission[15],\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[16],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[17],\nAfter consulting the European Data\nProtection Supervisor,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure, \nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nThe Communication of the Commission of 13\nFebruary 2008 entitled 'preparing the next steps in border management in the\nEuropean Union'[18]\noutlined the need, as part of the European integrated border management\nstrategy, to establish an Entry/Exit System which registers electronically the\ntime and place of entry and exit of third-country nationals admitted for a\nshort stay to the Schengen area and which calculates the duration of their\nauthorised stay.\n(2)                   \nThe European Council of 19 and 20 June 2008\nunderlined the importance of continuing to work on the development of the EU's\nintegrated border management strategy, including better use of modern\ntechnologies to improve the management of external borders.\n(3)                   \nThe Communication of the Commission of 10 June\n2009, entitled 'An area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizens',\nadvocates establishing an electronic system for recording entry to and exit\nfrom Member States' territory via the crossing of external borders to ensure more effective\nmanagement of access to this territory.\n(4)                   \nThe European Council of 23 and 24 of June 2011\ncalled for work on \"smart borders\" to be pushed forward rapidly. The Commission published a\nCommunication \"Smart borders \u2013 options and the way ahead\" on 25\nOctober 2011.\n(5)                   \nIt is necessary to specify the objectives of the\nEntry/Exit System (EES) and its technical architecture, to lay down rules\nconcerning its operation and use and to define responsibilities for the system,\nthe categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which\nthe data are to be entered, the criteria for their entry, the authorities\nauthorised to access the data, the interlinking of alerts and further rules on\ndata processing and the protection of personal data.\n(6)                   \nThe EES should not apply to third country\nnationals who are family members of Union citizens holding a residence card as provided\nfor in Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\nApril 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move\nand reside freely within the territory of the Member States[19], or to holders of residence\npermits referred to in the Schengen Borders Code as their stay is not limited\nto 90 days within 180 days.\n(7)                   \nThe EES should have the objective of enhancing border control, preventing illegal\nimmigration and facilitating the management of migration flows. The EES should in\nparticular contribute to the identification of any person who may not, or may\nno longer fulfil the conditions of duration of stay whithin the territory of\nthe Member States.\n(8)                   \nTo meet those objectives, the EES should process\nalphanumeric data and, after a transitional period, fingerprints. The impact on\nthe privacy of travellers which the fingerprinting constitutes is justified by\ntwo reasons. Fingerprints are a reliable method to identify persons who are\nfound within the territory of the Member States not in possession of their\ntravel documents or any other means of identification, a common modus operandi\nof irregular migrants. Fingerprints also provide for more reliable matching of\nentry and exit data of legal travellers. \n(9)                   \nTen fingerprints should be enrolled in the EES,\nif physically possible, to allow for accurate verification and identification\nand to guarantee that sufficient data is available in every circumstance.\n(10)               \nThe use of fingerprints should be subject to a\ntransitional period to allow Member States to adapt the border check process\nand handling of passenger flows to avoid increasing waiting time at the border.\n(11)               \nThe technical development of the system should\nprovide for the possibility of access to the system for law enforcement\npurposes should this Regulation be amended in the future to allow for such\naccess.\n(12)               \nThe Agency for the operational management of\nlarge-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice,\nestablished by Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 25 October 2011[20],\nshould be responsible for the development and operational management of a centralised EES. Such a system should consist of a Central Unit,\na Back-up Central Unit, the Uniform Interfaces in each Member State, and the\nCommunication Infrastructure between the Central EES and the Network Entry\nPoints. Member States should be responsible for the development and operational\nmanagement of their own national systems.\n(13)               \nTo allow synergies and cost-efficiency, the EES should,\nto the extent possible, be implemented in parallel with the Registered\nTraveller System established pursuant to Regulation COM(2013)97 final. \n(14)               \nThis Regulation should define the authorities of\nthe Member States which can be authorised to have access to the EES to enter,\namend, delete or consult data for the specific purposes of the EES and to the\nextent necessary for the performance of their tasks. \n(15)               \nAny processing of EES data should be\nproportionate to the objectives pursued and necessary for the performance of\ntasks of the competent authorities. When using the EES, the competent\nauthorities should ensure that the human dignity and integrity of the person,\nwhose data are requested, are respected and should not discriminate against\npersons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief,\ndisability, age or sexual orientation.\n(16)               \nThe personal data stored in the EES should be\nkept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the EES. It is\nappropriate to keep the data for six months since it is the minimum period\nrequired for the calculations of the duration of the stay. A longer period of\nmaximum five years would be necessary for persons who have not exited the\nterritory of the Member States within the authorised period of stay. The data should\nbe deleted after the period of five years, unless there are grounds to delete\nit earlier.\n(17)               \nPrecise rules should be laid down as regards the\nresponsibilities for the development and operation of the EES, the\nresponsibilities of the Member States for the national systems and the access\nto data by the national authorities.\n(18)               \nRules on the liability of the Member States in\nrespect to damage arising from any breach of this Regulation should be laid\ndown.

The conditions of\ngiving access to the data stored in the system for law enforcement purposes and\nto third countries, and of retaining the data for different periods should further\nbe evaluated in order to assess whether and, if so, how the system can\ncontribute most effectively in the fight against terrorist offences and other\nserious criminal offences. Given the high number of personal data contained in\nthe EES and the need to fully respect the private life of individuals whose\npersonal data are processed in the EES, this evaluation should take place two years\nafter the start of operations and take into\nconsideration the results of the implementation of the VIS.\n(24)               \nThe Member States should lay down rules on\npenalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and\nensure that they are implemented.\n(25)               \nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the\nimplementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on\nthe Commission.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, the Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\nachieve this objective.\n(27)               \nIn accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\nTreaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not\nbound by it or subject to its application.

Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(28)               \nThis Regulation constitutes\na development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the\nUnited Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\n2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the

The same detailed information will be\nprovided specifically on overstayers, which will provide a much stronger\nevidence base as to whether nationals of a given third country should be\nsubject to the visa obligation or not.\nIt will provide key data for the purposes of examining the\napplications of third-country nationals for the Registered Traveller Programme\n(RTP) (new and subsequent ones). In addition, it will give the competent\nauthorities the information needed to ensure that third-country nationals\nbenefitting from access to the RTP comply fully with all the necessary\nconditions, including the respect for the duration of the authorised\nstay. \nIt will permit the verification by the authorities that regular\ntravellers holding multiple-entry visas do not overstay in the Schengen area.\n\n1.4.4.          \nIndicators of results and impact \n\nSpecify the indicators\nfor monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\nDuring the development\nAfter the approval of the draft proposal and the adoption of the\ntechnical specifications the technical system will be developed by an external\ncontractor.

The vast majority are \"overstayers\", persons having legally\nentered the European Union but stayed after their entitlement to do so had\nexpired. EU law stipulates that third-country nationals have, as a general\nrule, the right to enter for a short-stay of up to three months per six months\nperiod.\nThe EES will be an instrument providing the European Union with\nbasic information on the third country nationals entering and leaving the\nterritory of the EU. This information is indispensable to shape sustainable and\nreasonable policies in the field of migration and visa. The current system of\nstamps in the passport poses a problem not only for enforcement but also in\nterms of informing persons of their rights, for example, the exact number of\ndays they are entitled to remain in the Schengen area, following a series of\nstays lasting a few days each. Moreover, as long as data are not recorded\nelsewhere than the passport, sharing of data between Member States is\nphysically impossible. It also means that such data would not be available in\ncase the stamped travel documents are replaced or lost.\nThe EES will allow to calculate the duration of the stay of third\ncountry nationals (TCN) and to verify if someone is overstaying, also when\ncarrying out checks within the Schengen area. Currently the stamping of the\ntravel document indicating the dates of entry and exit is the sole instrument\navailable to border guards and immigration authorities. The time a TCN has\nspent in the Schengen area is calculated based on the stamps, which are however\noften difficult to interpret; they may be illegible or the target of\ncounterfeiting. Exact calculation of time spent in the Schengen area on the\nbasis of stamps in the travel documents is thus both time-consuming and\ndifficult.\n\n1.5.2.          \nAdded value of EU involvement\n\nNo Member State is able to build up a common, interoperable\nentry/exit system alone. As all activities linked to the managemement of\nmigration flows and security threats it is an area where there is obvious added\nvalue in mobilising the EU budget. \nThe abolition of internal border controls must be accompanied by\ncommon measures for the effective control and surveillance of the Union's\nexternal borders. Some Member States bear a heavy burden due to their specific\ngeographic situation and the length of the external borders of the Union that\nthey have to manage. The entry conditions and border checks for third-country\nnationals are harmonised through EU law. As persons may enter the Schengen area\nat a border crossing point in a Member State where a national register of\nentries/exits is used, but exit through a border crossing point where no such\nsystem is used no action can be achieved by the Member States acting alone but\nonly at EU level.\n\n1.5.3.          \nLessons learned from similar experiences in the\npast\n\nThe experience with the development of the second generation\nSchengen Information System (SIS II) and of the Visa Information System (VIS)\nshowed the following lessons:\n1) As a possible safeguard against cost overruns and delays\nresulting from changing requirements, any new information system in the area of\nfreedom, security and justice, particularly if it involves a large-scale IT\nsystem, will not be developed before the underlying legal instruments setting\nout its purpose, scope, functions and technical details have been definitely\nadopted.\n2) It proved difficult to fund the national developments for Member\nStates that have not foreseen the respective activities in their multi-annual\nprogramming or lack precision in their programming in the framework of the\nExternal Border Fund (EBF). Therefore, it is now proposed to include these\ndevelopment costs in the proposal. \n\n1.5.4.          \nCoherence and possible synergy with other\nrelevant instruments\n\nThis proposal should be seen as part of the continuous development\nof the Integrated Border Management Strategy of the European Union, and in\nparticular the Smart Borders Communication[38],\nas well as in conjunction with the ISF borders proposal[39], as part of the MFF. The\nlegislative financial statement attached to the amended Commission proposal for\nthe Agency[40]\ncovers the costs for the existing IT systems EURODAC, SIS II, VIS but not for\nthe future border management systems that are not yet entrusted to the Agency\nvia a legal framework. Therefore, in the annex to the proposal for a Council\nRegulation laying down the multi-annual financial framework for the years\n2014-2020[41],\nunder heading 3 \"Security and Citizenship\" it is foreseen to cover\nthe existing IT systems in the rubrique 'IT systems' (822 mio \u20ac) and the future\nborder management systems in the rubrique 'Internal Security' (1.1 mio \u20ac out of\n4.648 mio \u20ac). Within the Commission DG HOME is the Directorate General\nresponsible for the establishment of an area of free\nmovement in which persons can cross internal borders without being submitted to\nborder checks and external borders are controlled and managed coherently at the\nEU level. The system has the following synergies with\nthe Visa Information System:\na) For visa holders, the Biometric Matching System will also be used\nfor the purpose of Entry/Exit;\nb) the Entry/Exit System will complement the VIS. The VIS contains\nonly visa applications and issued visas, whereas for visa holders the EES will\nstore also concrete entry and exit data related to the issued visas;\nc) There will also be synergies with the\nRTP, as the entry and exit of the registered travellers will be recorded in the\nEES, which will monitor the duration of their authorised stay within the\nSchengen area. Without the EES, fully automated border crossings could not be\nimplemented for the registered travellers.In addition,\nthere is no risk of an overlap with similar initiatives carried out in other\nDGs.\n\n1.6.                \nDuration and financial impact \n\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00a8 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \nx Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nPreparatory period from 2013 to 2015\n(establishment of the legal framework)\n\u2013     \nDevelopment period from 2015 to 2017,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n\n1.7.                \nManagement mode(s) envisaged[42]\n\nx Centralised direct management by the Commission\nx Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \nx bodies set up by the Communities[43]\n\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries \n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the\n\"Comments\" section.\nComments \nThe\nproposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council\nestablishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for\nfinancial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-2020 (COM(2011)750),\nforesees the financing of the development of the Entry/Exit System in its\nArticle 15. In accordance with Articles 58 1c) and 60 of the new Financial\nRegulation (centralised indirect management) the implementing tasks of the\nabovementioned financial programme will be delegated to the IT Agency.\nDuring the\n2015-2017 period, all development activities will be entrusted to the IT Agency\nthrough a delegation agreement. This will cover the development part of all\nstrands of the project, i.e. Central system, Member States systems, networks\nand infrastructure in Member States.\nIn 2017, at\nthe time of the mid term review, it is envisaged to transfer remaining credits\nfrom the 513.000 Mio \u20ac to the IT Agency line for operation and maintenance\ncosts of the central system and of the network and to national programmes for\noperation and maintenance costs of national systems including infrastructure\ncosts (see table below).

The Agency shall ensure that procedures are in place to monitor\nthe functioning of the EES against objectives relating to the technical output,\ncost-effectiveness, security and quality of service.\n2. For the purposes of technical maintenance, the Agency shall have\naccess to the necessary information relating to the data processing operations\nperformed in the EES.\n3. Two years after the start of operations of the EES and every two\nyears thereafter, the Agency shall submit to the European Parliament, the\nCouncil and the Commission a report on the technical functioning of EES,\nincluding the security thereof.\n4. Two years after the EES is brought into operation and every four\nyears thereafter, the Commission shall produce an overall evaluation of the\nEES. This overall evaluation shall include an examination of results achieved\nagainst objectives, an assessment of the continuing validity of the underlying\nrationale, the application of the Regulation, the security of the EES and any\nimplications on future operations. The Commission shall transmit the evaluation\nreport to the European Parliament and the Council.\n5. The first evaluation shall specifically examine the contribution the\nentry-exit system could make in the fight against terrorist offences and other\nserious criminal offences and will deal with the issue of access for law\nenforcement purposes to the information stored in the system, whether, and if\nso, under which conditions such access could be allowed, whether the data\nretention period shall be modified and whether access to authorities of third\ncountries shall be granted, taking into account the operation of the EES and\nthe results of the implementation of the VIS.\n6. Member States shall provide the Agency and the Commission with\nthe information necessary to draft the reports referred to in paragraphs 3 and\n4 according to the quantitative indicators predefined by the Commission and/or\nthe Agency.\n7. The Agency shall provide the Commission with the information\nnecessary to produce the overall evaluations referred to in paragraph 4.\n\n2.2.                \nManagement and control system \n2.2.1.          \nRisk(s) identified \n\n1) Difficulties with the technical development of the system\nMember States have technically different national IT systems.\nFurthermore, border control processes may differ according to the local\ncircumstances (available space at the border crossing point, travel flows,\netc.). The EES needs to be integrated into national IT architecture and the\nnational border control processes. Additionally, the development of the national\ncomponents of the system needs to be fully aligned with central requirements.\nThere are two main risks identified in this area:\na) The risk that technical and legal aspects of the EES may be\nimplemented in different ways by different Member States, due to insufficient\ncoordination between the central and national sides.\nb) The risk of inconsistency in how this future system is used\ndepending on how Member States implement the EES into the existing border\ncontrol processes.\n2) Difficulties with the timely development\nFrom the experience gained during the development of the VIS and the\nSIS II, it can be anticipated that a crucial factor for a successful\nimplementation of the EES will be the timely development of the system by an\nexternal contractor. As a center of excellence in the field of development and\nmanagement of large-scale IT systems, the IT Agency will also be responsible\nfor the award and management of contracts, in particular for sub-contracting\nthe development of the system. There are several risks related to the use of an\nexternal contractor for this development work:\na) in particular, the risk that the contractor fails to allocate\nsufficient resources to the project or that it designs and develops a system\nthat is not state-of-the-art;\nb) the risk that administrative techniques and methods to handle\nlarge-scale IT projects are not fully respected as a way of reducing costs by\nthe contractor;\nc) finally, in the current economic crisis, the risk of the\ncontractor facing financial difficulties for reasons external to this project\ncannot be entirely excluded.\n\n2.2.2.          \nControl method(s) envisaged \n\n1) The Agency is meant to become a center of excellence in the field\nof development and management of large-scale IT systems. It shall be entrusted\nwith the development and the operations of the central part of the system\nincluding uniform interfaces in the Member States. This will allow to avoid\nmost of the drawbacks that the Commission met when developing the SIS II and\nthe VIS.\nDuring the development phase (2015-2017), the Commission will keep\nthe overall responsibility, as the project will be developed via indirect\ncentral management. The Agency will be responsible for the technical and\nfinancial management, notably the award and management of contracts. The delegation\nagreement will cover the central part via procurements and the national part\nvia grants. According to Article 40 of the Implementing Rules, the Commission\nwill conclude an Agreement laying down the detailed arrangements for the\nmanagement and control of funds and the protection of the financial interests\nof the Commission. Such agreement will include the provisions set out in\nparagraph 2 of Article 40. It will thus enable the Commission to manage the\nrisks described in 2.2.1.\nIn the context of the mid-term review (foreseen in 2017 in the\nframework of the Internal Security Fund, Article 15 of the Horizontal\nRegulation) the management mode will be re-examined.\n2) In order to avoid delays at national level, an efficient\ngovernance between all stakeholders is foreseen. The Commission has proposed in\nthe draft Regulation that an Advisory Group composed of Member States national\nexperts shall provide the Agency with the expertise related to the EES/RTP.\nThis advisory group shall meet on a regular basis on the system implementation,\nshare gathered experience and provide advice to the Management Board of the\nAgency. Furthermore, the Commission intends to recommend to Member States to\nset up a national project infrastructure / project group for both the technical\nand the operational development including a reliable communication\ninfrastructure with single points of contact.\n\n2.3.                \nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nThe measures foreseen to combat fraud are laid down in Article 35 of\nRegulation (EU) 1077/2011 which provides as follows: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful\nactivities, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 shall apply.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Agency shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement\nconcerning internal investigations by the European Anti\u2011fraud Office\n(OLAF) and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate provisions applicable to\nall the employees of the Agency.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decisions concerning funding and the implementing agreements\nand instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court\nof Auditors and OLAF may carry out, if necessary, on\u2011the\u2011spot\nchecks among the recipients of the Agency's funding and the agents responsible\nfor allocating it.\nIn accordance with this provision, the decision of the Management\nBoard of the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT\nsystems in the area of freedom, security and justice concerning the terms and\nconditions for internal investigations in relation to the prevention of fraud,\ncorruption and any illegal activity detrimental to the Union's interests was\nadopted on 28 June 2012.\nMoreover, DG HOME is currently drafting its fraud prevention and\ndetection strategy.\n\n3.                      \nESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n3.1.                \nHeading(s) of the multiannual financial\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\nVia the delegation agreement the Agency will be\nentrusted with the task to set up the appropriate tools at the level of its\nlocal financial systems in order to guarantee an efficient monitoring,\nfollow-up and reporting of the costs linked to the implementation of the EES in\ncompliance with Article 60 of the new Financial Regulation.
