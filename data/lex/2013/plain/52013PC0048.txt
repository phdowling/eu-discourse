This means improving the security of the Internet and the\nprivate networks and information systems underpinning the functioning of our\nsocieties and economies. This will be achieved by requiring the Member States\nto increase their preparedness and improve their cooperation with each other,\nand by requiring operators of critical infrastructures, such as energy,\ntransport, and key providers of information society services (e-commerce\nplatforms, social networks, etc), as well as public administrations to adopt\nappropriate steps to manage security risks and report serious incidents to the\nnational competent authorities.\nThis proposal is presented in connection\nwith the joint Communication of the Commission and High Representative of the\nUnion for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on a European Cybersecurity\nStrategy. The objective of the Strategy is to ensure a secure and trustworthy\ndigital environment, while promoting and protecting fundamental rights and\nother EU core values. This proposal is the main action of the Strategy. Further\nactions under the Strategy in this area focus on raising awareness, developing\nan internal market for cybersecurity products and services, and fostering\nR&D investment. These actions will be complemented by others aimed at\nstepping up the fight against cybercrime and building an international\ncybersecurity policy for the EU.\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reasons for and objectives\nof the proposal\nNIS is increasingly important to our\neconomy and society. NIS is also an important\nprecondition to create a reliable environment for worldwide trade in services. However,\ninformation systems can be affected by security incidents, such as human mistakes, natural\nevents, technical failures or malicious attacks. These\nincidents are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more complex. The Commission\u2019s online public consultation on \u2018Improving network\nand information security in the EU[1]\u2019 found\nthat 57 % of respondents had experienced NIS incidents over the previous year that had a\nserious impact on their activities. Lack of NIS can compromise vital\nservices depending on the integrity of network and information systems. This\ncan stop businesses functioning, generate substantial financial losses for the\nEU economy and negatively affect societal welfare.\nMoreover, as\na borderless communication instrument, digital information systems, in\nparticular the internet, are interconnected across Member States and play an\nessential role in facilitating the cross-border movement of goods, services and\npeople. Substantial disruption of these systems in one Member State can affect\nother Member States and the EU as a whole. The resilience and stability of network\nand information systems is therefore essential to the completion of the Digital\nSingle Market and the smooth functioning of the Internal Market. The likelihood\nand frequency of incidents and the inability to ensure efficient protection also\nundermine public trust and confidence in network and information services: for\nexample, the 2012 Eurobarometer on Cybersecurity found that 38 % of EU internet\nusers are concerned about the safety of online payments and have changed their\nbehaviour because of concerns with security issues: 18 % are less likely\nto buy goods online and 15 % are less likely to use online banking[2].\nThe current situation in the EU, reflecting\nthe purely voluntary approach followed so far, does not provide sufficient\nprotection against NIS incidents and risks across the EU. Existing NIS\ncapabilities and mechanisms are simply insufficient to keep pace with the\nfast-changing landscape of threats and to ensure a common high level of\nprotection in all the Member States.\nDespite\nthe initiatives undertaken, the Member States have very different levels of\ncapabilities and preparedness, leading to fragmented approaches across the EU. Given\nthe fact that networks and systems are interconnected, the overall NIS of the\nEU is weakened by those Member States with an insufficient level of protection.\nThis situation also hinders the creation of trust among peers, which is a\nprerequisite for cooperation and information sharing. As a result, there is cooperation\nonly among a minority of Member States with a high level of capabilities.\nTherefore, there is currently no effective mechanism at EU level for effective cooperation and\ncollaboration and for trusted information sharing on\nNIS incidents and risks among the Member States. This may result in uncoordinated regulatory\ninterventions, incoherent strategies and divergent\nstandards, leading to insufficient protection against NIS across the EU. Internal Market barriers may also arise, generating compliance costs\nfor companies operating in more than one Member State.\nFinally, the\nplayers managing critical\ninfrastructure or providing services essential to the functioning of our\nsocieties are not under appropriate obligations to\nadopt risk management measures and exchange information with relevant\nauthorities. On the one hand, therefore, businesses lack effective incentives\nto conduct serious risk management, involving risk assessment and taking\nappropriate steps to ensure NIS. On the other hand, a\nlarge proportion of incidents does not reach the\ncompetent authorities and go unnoticed. However, information on incidents is essential for public authorities to react,\ntake appropriate mitigating measures, and set adequate strategic priorities for\nNIS.\nThe current\nregulatory framework requires only telecommunication companies to adopt risk\nmanagement steps and to report serious NIS incidents. However, many other\nsectors rely on ICT as an enabler and should therefore be concerned about NIS\nas well. A number of specific infrastructure and\nservice providers are particularly vulnerable, due to their high dependence on\ncorrectly functioning network and information systems. These sectors play an\nessential role in providing key support services for our economy and society,\nand the security of their systems is of particular importance to the\nfunctioning of the Internal Market. These sectors\ninclude banking, stock exchanges, energy generation, transmission and\ndistribution, transport (air, rail, maritime), health, internet services and\npublic administrations.\nA\nstep-change is therefore needed in the way NIS is dealt with in the EU.\nRegulatory obligations are required to create a level playing field and close\nexisting legislative loopholes. To address these problems and increase the\nlevel of NIS within the European Union, the objectives of the proposed\nDirective are as follows.\nFirst, the proposal requires all the Member\nStates to ensure that they have in place a minimum level of national\ncapabilities by establishing competent authorities for NIS, setting up Computer\nEmergency Response Teams (CERTs), and adopting national NIS strategies and\nnational NIS cooperation plans.\nSecondly, the national competent\nauthorities should cooperate within a network enabling secure and effective\ncoordination, including coordinated information exchange as well as detection\nand response at EU level. Through this network, Member States should exchange\ninformation and cooperate to counter NIS threats and incidents on the basis of\nthe European NIS cooperation plan.\nThirdly, based on the model of the\nFramework Directive for electronic communications, the proposal aims to ensure\nthat a culture of risk management develops and that information is shared between\nthe private and public sectors. Companies in the specific critical sectors\noutlined above and public administrations will be required to assess the risks\nthey face and adopt appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure NIS. These\nentities will be required to report to the competent authorities any incidents\nseriously compromising their networks and information systems and significantly\naffecting the continuity of critical services and supply of goods.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General context\nAlready in 2001, in its Communication\nNetwork and Information Security: Proposal for A European Policy Approach\u2019, the\nCommission outlined the increasing importance of NIS[3]. This was followed by the\nadoption in 2006 of a Strategy for a Secure Information Society[4], aiming to develop a culture of NIS in Europe. Its main elements\nwere endorsed in a Council Resolution[5].\nThe Commission\nfurther adopted, on 30 March 2009, a Communication on Critical Information\nInfrastructure protection (CIIP)[6] focusing on the protection of Europe from cyber disruptions by\nenhancing security. The Communication launched an action plan to support Member\nStates\u2019 efforts to ensure prevention and response. The Action Plan was endorsed\nin the Presidency Conclusions of the Ministerial Conference on CIIP in Tallinn\nin 2009. On 18 December 2009 the Council adopted a Resolution on \u2018A\ncollaborative European approach to network and information security\u2019[7].\nThe Digital\nAgenda for Europe[8]\n(DAE), adopted in May 2010, and the related Council Conclusions[9] highlighted the shared\nunderstanding that trust and security are fundamental pre-conditions for the\nwide uptake of ICT and thus for achieving the objectives of the \u2018smart growth\u2019\ndimension of the Europe 2020 Strategy[10].\nUnder its Trust and Security chapter, the DAE emphasised the need for all\nstakeholders to join forces in a holistic effort to ensure the security and\nresilience of ICT infrastructure, by focusing on prevention, preparedness and\nawareness, as well as to develop effective and coordinated security mechanisms.\nIn particular, key action 6 of the Digital Agenda for Europe calls for measures\naimed at a reinforced and high-level NIS policy.\nIn its\nCommunication on CIIP of March 2011 on \u2018Achievements and next steps: towards\nglobal cyber-security\u2019[11], the Commission took stock of the results achieved since the\nadoption of the CIIP action plan in 2009, concluding that the implementation of\nthe plan showed that purely national approaches to tackling the security and\nresilience challenges are not sufficient, and that Europe should continue its\nefforts to build a coherent and cooperative approach across the EU. The 2011\nCIIP Communication announced a number of actions, with the Commission calling\nupon the Member States to set up NIS capabilities and cross-border cooperation.\nMost of these actions should have been completed by 2012, but have not yet been\nimplemented.\nIn its Conclusions of 27 May 2011 on CIIP,\nthe Council of the European Union stressed the\npressing need to make ICT systems and networks resilient and secure against all\npossible disruptions, whether accidental or intentional, to develop across the EU\na high level of preparedness, security and resilience capabilities, to upgrade\ntechnical competences to allow Europe to meet the challenge of network and\ninformation infrastructure protection, and to foster cooperation between the\nMember States by developing incident cooperation mechanisms between the Member\nStates.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing European Union\nand international provisions in this area\nUnder Regulation (EC) No 460/2004, the\nEuropean Community established in 2004 the European Network and Information\nSecurity Agency (ENISA)[12], with the aim of contributing to ensuring a high level and\ndeveloping a culture of NIS within the EU.A proposal to modernise the mandate\nof ENISA was adopted on 30 September 2010[13]\nand is under discussion in the Council and the European Parliament. The revised\nregulatory framework for electronic communications[14], in\nforce since November 2009, imposes security obligations on electronic\ncommunication providers[15].\nThese obligations had to be transposed at national level by May 2011.\nAll players that are data controllers (for\nexample banks or hospitals) are obliged by the data protection regulatory\nframework[16]\nto put in place security measures to protect personal data. Also, under the\n2012 Commission proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation[17], data controllers would have to\nreport breaches of personal data to the national supervisory authorities. This\nmeans that, for example, a NIS security breach affecting the provision of a\nservice without compromising personal data (e.g. an ICT outage at a power\ncompany resulting in a blackout) would not have to be notified.\nUnder Directive 2008/114 on the\nidentification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the\nassessment of the need to improve their protection, the \u2018European Programme for\nCritical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP)\u2019[18] sets out the overall \u2018umbrella\u2019\napproach to the protection of critical infrastructures in the EU. The\nobjectives of EPCIP are fully consistent with this proposal and the Directive\nshould apply without prejudice to Directive 2008/114. EPCIP does not oblige\noperators to report significant breaches of security and does not set up\nmechanisms for the Member States to cooperate and respond to incidents.\nThe co-legislators are currently discussing\nthe Commission proposal for a Directive on attacks against information systems[19], which aims to harmonise the\ncriminalisation of specific types of conduct. It covers only the\ncriminalisation of specific types of conduct and does not address the\nprevention of NIS risks and incidents, the response to NIS incidents and the\nmitigation of their impact. The present Directive should apply without\nprejudice to the Directive on attacks against information systems.\nOn 28 March 2012, the Commission adopted a\nCommunication on the establishment of a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)[20]. This Centre, established on\n11 January 2013, is part of the European Police Office (EUROPOL) and act as the\nfocal point in the fight against cybercrime in the EU. EC3 is intended to pool\nEuropean cybercrime expertise to support the Member States in capacity\nbuilding, provide support to Member States\u2019 cybercrime investigations and, in\nclose cooperation with Eurojust, become the collective voice of European\ncybercrime investigators across law enforcement and the judiciary.\nThe European Institutions, agencies and\nbodies have set up their own Computer Emergency Response Team, called CERT-EU.\nAt international level, the EU works on\ncybersecurity at both bilateral and multilateral level. The 2010 EU-US Summit[21] saw the establishment of the\nEU-US Working Group on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime. The EU is also active in other\nrelevant multilateral fora, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD), the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Organisation for Security and\nCo-operation in Europe (OSCE), the World Summit on the Information Society\n(WSIS) and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation with\ninterested parties and use of expertise\nAn online public consultation on \u2018Improving NIS in the EU\u2019 ran\nbetween 23 July and 15 October 2012. In total, the Commission received 160\nresponses to the online questionnaire.\nThe key outcome was that stakeholders showed general\nsupport for the need to improve NIS across the EU. In\nparticular: 82.8 % of respondents expressed the view that governments in\nthe EU should do more to ensure a high level of NIS; 82.8 % were of the\nopinion that users of information and systems were unaware of existing NIS\nthreats and incidents; 66.3 % would in principle be in favour of introducing\na regulatory requirement to manage NIS risks; and 84.8 % said that such\nrequirements should be set at EU level. A high number of respondents thought\nthat it would be important to adopt NIS requirements in the following sectors\nin particular: banking and finance (91.1 %), energy (89.4 %),\ntransport (81.7 %), health (89.4 %), internet services (89.1 %),\nand public administrations (87.5 %). Respondents also considered that if a requirement to report NIS security breaches to\nthe national competent authority were introduced, it should be set at EU level\n(65.1 %) and affirmed that public administrations should also be subject\nto it (93.5 %). Finally, respondents affirmed that a requirement to implement\nNIS risk management in line with the state of the art would entail for them no\nsignificant additional costs (63.4 %), and that a requirement to report\nsecurity breaches would cause no significant additional costs (72.3 %).\nMember States were consulted in a number of relevant\nCouncil configurations, in the context of the European Forum for Member\nStates (EFMS), at the Conference on Cybersecurity\norganised by the Commission and the European External Action Service on 6 July\n2012, and in dedicated bilateral meetings convened at the request of individual\nMember States.\nDiscussions with the private sector were also held\nwithin the European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience[22] and through bilateral meetings. As for the public sector, the Commission held discussions with\nENISA and the CERT for the EU institutions.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact\nassessment\nThe\nCommission has carried out an impact assessment of three policy options:\nOption 1: Business as usual (baseline\nscenario): maintaining the current approach;\nOption 2: Regulatory approach, consisting\nof a legislative proposal establishing a common EU legal framework for NIS\nregarding Member State capabilities, mechanisms for EU-level cooperation, and\nrequirements for key private players and public administrations;\nOption 3:\nMixed approach, combining voluntary initiatives for Member State NIS\ncapabilities and mechanisms for EU-level cooperation with regulatory\nrequirements for key private players and public administrations.\nThe Commission concluded that Option 2\nwould have the strongest positive impacts, as it would considerably improve the\nprotection of EU consumers, business and governments against NIS incidents. In\nparticular, the obligations placed on the Member States\nwould ensure adequate preparedness at national level\nand would contribute to a climate of mutual trust, which is a\nprecondition for effective cooperation at EU level. The setting up of\nmechanisms for cooperation at EU level via the network would deliver coherent\nand coordinated prevention and response to cross-border NIS incidents and\nrisks. The introduction of requirements to implement\nNIS risk management for public administrations and key private players would\ncreate a strong incentive to manage security risks effectively. The obligation\nto report NIS incidents with a significant impact would enhance the ability to\nrespond to incidents and foster transparency. Moreover,\nby putting its own house in order, the EU would be able to extend its\ninternational reach and become an even more credible partner for cooperation at\nbilateral and multilateral level. The EU would hence also be better placed to\npromote fundamental rights and EU core values abroad.\nThe quantitative assessment showed that\nOption 2 would not impose a disproportionate burden on Member States. The costs\nfor the private sector would also be limited since many of the entities concerned\nare already supposed to comply with existing security requirements (namely the\nobligation for data controllers to take technical and organisational measures\nto secure personal data, including NIS measures). Existing spending on security\nin the private sector has also been taken into account.\nThis proposal observes the principles\nrecognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union notably, the\nright to respect for private life and communications. the protection for\npersonal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the\nright to an effective remedy before a court and the right to be heard. This\nDirective must be implemented according to these rights and principles.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\nbasis\nThe European Union is\nempowered to adopt measures with the aim of establishing or ensuring the\nfunctioning of the Internal Market, in accordance with the relevant provisions\nof the Treaties (Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion \u2014 TFEU). Under Article 114 TFEU, the EU can\nadopt \u2018measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law,\nregulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their\nobject the establishment and functioning of the internal market\u2019.\nAs indicated above, network and information\nsystems play an essential role in facilitating the cross-border movement of\ngoods, services and people. They are often interconnected, and the internet is\nglobal in nature. Given this intrinsic transnational dimension, a disruption in\none Member State can also affect other Member States and the EU as a whole. The\nresilience and stability of network and information systems is therefore\nessential to the smooth functioning of the Internal Market.\nThe EU legislator has already recognised\nthe need to harmonise NIS rules to ensure the development of the Internal Market.\nIn particular, this was the case for Regulation\n460/2004 establishing ENISA[23],\nwhich is based on Article 114 TFEU.\nThe disparities resulting from uneven NIS\nnational capabilities, policies and level of protection across the Member\nStates lead to barriers to the Internal Market and justify EU action.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity\nEuropean\nintervention in the area of NIS is justified by the subsidiarity principle.\nFirstly,\nconsidering the cross-border nature of NIS, non-intervention at EU level would\nlead to a situation where each Member State would act alone, disregarding the\ninterdependencies among EU network and information systems. An appropriate\ndegree of coordination among the Member States would ensure that NIS risks could\nbe well managed in the cross-border context in which they arise. Divergences in\nNIS regulations represent a barrier to companies wanting to operate in several\ncountries and to the achievement of global economies of scale.\nSecondly, regulatory\nobligations at EU level are needed to create a level playing field and close\nlegislative loopholes. A purely voluntary approach has resulted in cooperation\nonly among a minority of Member States with a high level of capabilities. In\norder to involve all the Member States, it is necessary to ensure that they all\nhave the required minimum level of capability. NIS measures adopted by\ngovernments need to be consistent with one other and be coordinated to contain\nand minimise the consequences of NIS incidents. Within\nthe network, through exchange of best practices and continuous involvement of\nENISA, the competent authorities and the Commission will cooperate to\nfacilitate a convergent implementation of the Directive across the EU. In\naddition, concerted NIS policy actions can have a strong positive impact for\nthe effective protection of fundamental rights, and specifically the right to\nthe protection of personal data and privacy. Action at EU level would therefore\nimprove the effectiveness of existing national policies and facilitate their\ndevelopment.\nThe\nproposed measures are also justified on grounds of proportionality. The\nrequirements for the Member States are set at the minimum level\nnecessary to achieve adequate preparedness and to enable cooperation based on\ntrust. This also enables Member States to take due account of national\nspecificities and ensures that the common EU principles are applied in a\nproportionate manner. The wide scope of application will allow the Member\nStates to implement the Directive in light of the actual risks faced at\nnational level as identified in the national NIS strategy. The requirements to\nimplement risk management target only critical entities and impose measures\nthat are proportionate to the risks. The public consultation underlined the\nimportance of ensuring the security of these critical entities. The reporting\nrequirements would concern only incidents with a significant impact. As\nindicated above, the measures would not impose disproportionate costs, as many\nof these entities as data controllers are already required by the current data protection\nrules to secure the protection of personal data.\nTo\navoid imposing a disproportionate burden on small operators, in particular on\nSMEs, the requirements are proportionate to the risk presented by the network or\ninformation system concerned and should not apply to micro enterprises. The\nrisks will have to be identified in the first place by the entities subject to\nthese obligations, which will have to decide on the measures to be adopted to\nmitigate such risks.\nThe stated objectives can be better achieved\nat EU level, rather than by the Member States alone, in view of the\ncross-border aspects of NIS incidents and risks. Therefore, the EU may adopt\nmeasures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\n5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, the proposed Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in\norder to achieve those objectives.\nTo\nachieve the objectives, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union, in order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements\nof the basic act. The Commission's proposal also strives to support a process\nof proportionality in the implementation of the obligations placed upon private\nand public operators.\nIn\norder to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the basic act, the\nCommission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with\nArticle 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nConsidering\nin particular the broad scope of the proposed Directive, the fact that it\ntackles heavily regulated domains, and the legal obligations deriving from its\nChapter IV, Explanatory Documents should accompany the notification of\ntransposition measures. In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of\nMember States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28 September 2011,\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification\nof their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the\nrelationship between the components of a Directive and the corresponding parts\nof national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the\nlegislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nCooperation and exchange of information\nbetween Member States should be supported by a secure infrastructure. The\nproposal will have EU budgetary implications only if Member States choose to\nadapt an existing infrastructure (e.g. sTESTA) and task the Commission to\nimplement this under the MFF 2014-2020. The one-off cost is estimated to be EUR 1 250 000\nand would be borne by the EU budget, budget line 09.03.02 (to promote the\ninterconnection and interoperability of national public services online as well\nas access to such networks \u2014 Chapter 09.03, Connecting Europe Facility \u2014\ntelecommunications networks) on condition that sufficient funds are available\nunder CEF. Alternatively, Member States can either share the one-off cost of\nadapting an existing infrastructure or decide to set up a new infrastructure\nand bear the costs, which are estimated to be approximately EUR 10 million\nper year.\n2013/0027 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nconcerning measures to ensure a high\ncommon level of network and information security across the Union\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard\nto the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\n114 thereof,\nHaving regard\nto the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter\ntransmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments, \nHaving regard\nto the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[24],\nAfter\nconsulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,\nActing in\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Network\nand information systems and services play a vital role in the society. Their\nreliability and security are essential to economic activities and social\nwelfare, and in particular to the functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nmagnitude and frequency of deliberate or accidental security incidents is\nincreasing and represents a major threat to the functioning of networks and\ninformation systems. Such incidents can impede the pursuit of economic\nactivities, generate substantial financial losses, undermine user confidence\nand cause major damage to the economy of the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a\ncommunication instrument without frontiers, digital information systems, and\nprimarily the Internet play an essential role in facilitating the cross-border\nmovement of goods, services and people. Due to that transnational nature,\nsubstantial disruption of those systems in one Member State can also affect\nother Member States and the Union as a whole. The resilience and stability of\nnetwork and information systems is therefore essential to the smooth\nfunctioning of the internal market.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A cooperation mechanism\nshould be established at Union level to allow for\ninformation exchange and coordinated detection and response regarding network and information security (\"NIS\"). For that mechanism to be effective and inclusive, it is essential\nthat all Member States have minimum capabilities and a strategy ensuring a high\nlevel of NIS in their territory. Minimum security requirements should also\napply to public administrations and operators of\ncritical information infrastructure to promote a culture of risk management and\nensure that the most serious incidents are reported.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To cover\nall relevant incidents and risks, this Directive should apply to all network\nand information systems. The obligations on public administrations and market operators\nshould however not apply to undertakings providing\npublic communication networks or publicly available electronic communication\nservices within the meaning of Directive 2002/21/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory\nframework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework\nDirective)[25],\nwhich are subject to the specific security and integrity requirements laid down\nin Article 13a of that Directive nor should they apply to\ntrust service providers.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existing capabilities\nare not sufficient enough to ensure a high level of NIS within the Union.\nMember States have very different levels of preparedness leading to fragmented\napproaches across the Union. This leads to an unequal level of protection of\nconsumers and businesses, and undermines the overall level of NIS within the\nUnion. Lack of common minimum requirements on public administrations and market\noperators in turn makes it impossible to set up a global and effective\nmechanism for cooperation at Union level. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Responding effectively to\nthe challlenges of the security of network and information systems therefore\nrequires a global approach at Union level covering common minimum capacity\nbuilding and planning requirements, exchange of information and coordination of\nactions, and common minimum security requirements for all market operators\nconcerned and public administrations.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\nDirective should be without prejudice to the possibility for each Member State\nto take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of its essential\nsecurity interests, to safeguard public policy and public security, and to\npermit the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences. In\naccordance with Article 346 TFEU, no Member State is to be obliged to supply\ninformation the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential\ninterests of its security.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To achieve and maintain a\ncommon high level of security of network and information systems, each Member\nState should have a national NIS strategy defining the strategic objectives and\nconcrete policy actions to be implemented. NIS cooperation plans complying with\nessential requirements need to be developed at national level in order to reach\ncapacity response levels allowing for effective and efficient cooperation at\nnational and Union level in case of incidents.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To allow for the effective\nimplementation of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, a body\nresponsible for coordinating NIS issues and acting as a focal point for\ncross-border cooperation at Union level should be established or identified in\neach Member State. These bodies should be given the adequate technical,\nfinancial and human resources to ensure that they can carry out in an effective\nand efficient manner the tasks assigned to them and thus achieve the objectives\nof this Directive.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Member States should be\nadequately equipped, both in terms of technical and organisational\ncapabilities, to prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate network and\ninformation systems' incidents and risks. Well-functioning Computer Emergency Response Teams complying with\nessential requirements should therefore be\nestablished in all Member States to guarantee effective and compatible\ncapabilities to deal with incidents and risks and ensure efficient cooperation\nat Union level.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Building upon the\nsignificant progress within the European Forum of Member States (\"EFMS\")\nin fostering discussions and exchanges on good policy practices including the development\nof principles for European cyber crisis cooperation, the Member States and the\nCommission should form a network to bring them into permanent communication and\nsupport their cooperation. This secure and effective cooperation mechanism\nshould enable structured and coordinated information exchange, detection and\nresponse at Union level. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Network and\nInformation Security Agency (\"ENISA\") should assist the Member States\nand the Commission by providing its expertise and advice and by facilitating\nexchange of best practices. In particular, in the application of this\nDirective, the Commission should consult ENISA. To ensure effective and timely\ninformation to the Member States and the Commission, early warnings on\nincidents and risks should be notified within the cooperation network. To build\ncapacity and knowledge among Member States, the cooperation network should also\nserve as an instrument for the exchange of best practices, assisting its\nmembers in building capacity, steering the organisation of peer reviews and NIS\nexercises.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A secure\ninformation-sharing infrastructure should be put in place to allow for the exchange of sensitive and confidential information within the cooperation network. Without prejudice to their obligation to notify incidents and risks of\nUnion dimension to the cooperation network, access to\nconfidential information from other Member States should only be granted to\nMembers States upon demonstration that their technical, financial and human\nresources and processes, as well as their communication infrastructure, guarantee\ntheir effective, efficient and secure participation in the network.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As most network and\ninformation systems are privately operated, cooperation between the public and\nprivate sector is essential. Market operators should be encouraged to pursue\ntheir own informal cooperation mechanisms to ensure NIS. They should also\ncooperate with the public sector and share information and best practices in\nexchange of operational support in case of incidents.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure transparency and\nproperly inform EU citizens and market operators, the competent authorities should set up a common website to publish non confidential information\non the incidents and risks.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where information is\nconsidered confidential in accordance with Union and national rules on business\nconfidentiality, such confidentiality shall be ensured when carrying out the\nactivities and fulfilling the objectives set by this Directive.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis in particular\nof national crisis management experiences and in cooperation with ENISA, the\nCommission and the Member States should develop a Union NIS cooperation plan\ndefining cooperation mechanisms to counter risks and incidents. That plan\nshould be duly taken into account in the operation of early warnings within the\ncooperation network.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notification of an early\nwarning within the network should be required only where the scale and severity\nof the incident or risk concerned are or may become so significant that\ninformation or coordination of the response at Union level is necessary. Early\nwarnings should therefore be limited to actual or potential incidents or risks\nthat grow rapidly, exceed national response capacity or affect more than one\nMember State. To allow for a proper evaluation, all information relevant for\nthe assessment of the risk or incident should be communicated to the\ncooperation network.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon receipt of an early\nwarning and its assessment, the competent authorities should agree on a\ncoordinated response under the Union NIS cooperation plan. Competent\nauthorities as well as the Commission should be informed about the measures\nadopted at national level as a result of the coordinated response.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the global nature of\nNIS problems, there is a need for closer international cooperation to improve\nsecurity standards and information exchange, and promote a common global\napproach to NIS issues.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Responsibilities in\nensuring NIS lie to a great extent on public administrations and market\noperators. A culture of risk management, involving risk assessment and the\nimplementation of security measures appropriate to the risks faced should be\npromoted and developed through appropriate regulatory requirements and\nvoluntary industry practices. Establishing a level playing field is also\nessential to the effective functioning of the cooperation network to ensure\neffective cooperation from all Member States.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2002/21/EC\nrequires that undertakings providing public electronic communications networks\nor publicly available electronic communications services take appropriate\nmeasures to safeguard their integrity and security and introduces security\nbreach and integrity loss notification requirements. Directive 2002/58/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the\nprocessing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic\ncommunications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)[26] requires a provider of a\npublicly available electronic communications service to take appropriate\ntechnical and organisational measures to safeguard the security of its\nservices.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those obligations should be\nextended beyond the electronic communications sector to key providers of\ninformation society services, as defined in Directive 98/34/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the\nprovision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations\nand of rules on Information Society services[27],\nwhich underpin downstream information society services or on-line activities,\nsuch as e-commerce platforms, Internet payment gateways, social networks,\nsearch engines, cloud computing services, application stores. Disruption of\nthese enabling information society services prevents the provision of other\ninformation society services which rely on them as key inputs. Software\ndevelopers and hardware manufacturers are not providers of information society\nservices and are therefore excluded. Those obligations should also be extended to\npublic administrations, and operators of critical infrastructure which rely\nheavily on information and communications technology and are essential to the\nmaintenance of vital economical or societal functions such as electricity and\ngas, transport, credit institutions, stock exchange and health. Disruption of\nthose network and information systems would affect the internal market.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical and\norganisational measures imposed to public administrations and market operators\nshould not require that a particular commercial information and communications\ntechnology product be designed, developed or manufactured in a particular\nmanner.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The public administrations\nand market operators should ensure security of the networks and systems which\nare under their control. These would be primarily private networks and systems\nmanaged either by their internal IT staff or the security of which has been\noutsourced. The security and notification obligations should apply to the\nrelevant market operators and public administrations regardless of whether they\nperform the maintenance of their network and information systems internally or\noutsource it.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid imposing a\ndisproportionate financial and administrative burden on small operators and\nusers, the requirements should be proportionate to the risk presented by the network\nor information system concerned, taking into account the state of the art of\nsuch measures. These requirements should not apply to micro enterprises.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent authorities\nshould pay due attention to preserving informal and trusted channels of\ninformation-sharing between market operators and between the public and the\nprivate sectors. Publicity of incidents reported to the competent authorities\nshould duly balance the interest of the public in being informed about threats\nwith possible reputational and commercial damages for the public\nadministrations and market operators reporting incidents. In the implementation\nof the notification obligations, competent authorities should pay particular\nattention to the need to maintain information about product vulnerabilities\nstrictly confidential prior to the release of appropriate security fixes.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent authorities\nshould have the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers to\nobtain sufficient information from market operators and public administrations in\norder to assess the level of security of network and information systems as\nwell as reliable and comprehensive data about actual incidents that have had an\nimpact on the operation of network and information systems.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criminal activities are in\nmany cases underlying an incident. The criminal nature of incidents can be\nsuspected even if the evidence to support it may not be sufficiently clear from\nthe start. In this context, appropriate co-operation between competent\nauthorities and law enforcement authorities should form part of an effective\nand comprehensive response to the threat of security incidents. In particular,\npromoting a safe, secure and more resilient environment requires a systematic\nreporting of incidents of a suspected serious criminal nature to law\nenforcement authorities. The serious criminal nature of incidents should be\nassessed in the light of EU laws on cybercrime. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Personal data are in many\ncases compromised as a result of incidents. In this context, competent\nauthorities and data protection authorities should cooperate and exchange\ninformation on all relevant matters to tackle the personal data breaches\nresulting from incidents. Member states shall implement the obligation to\nnotify security incidents in a way that minimises the administrative burden in\ncase the security incident is also a personal data breach in line with the Regulation\nof the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals\nwith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such\ndata[28].\nLiaising with the competent authorities and the data protection authorities,\nENISA could assist by developing information exchange mechanisms and templates avoiding\nthe need for two notification templates. This single notification template\nwould facilitate the reporting of incidents compromising personal data thereby\neasing the administrative burden on businesses and public administrations.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Standardisation of security\nrequirements is a market-driven process. To ensure a convergent application of\nsecurity standards, Member States should encourage compliance or conformity\nwith specified standards to ensure a high level of security at Union level. To\nthis end, it might be necessary to draft harmonised standards, which should be\ndone in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending\nCouncil Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC,\n95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and\n2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council\nDecision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and\nof the Council[29].\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\nperiodically review this Directive, in particular with a view to determining\nthe need for modification in the light of changing technological or market\nconditions.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow for the\nproper functioning of the cooperation network, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the definition of the\ncriteria to be fulfilled for a Member State to be authorized to participate to\nthe secure information-sharing system, of the further specification of the\ntriggering events for early warning, and of the definition of the circumstances\nin which market operators and public administrations are required to notify incidents.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular importance\nthat the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory\nwork, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission\nof relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should\nbe conferred on the Commission as regards the cooperation between competent\nauthorities and the Commission within the cooperation network, the access to\nthe secure information-sharing infrastructure, the Union NIS cooperation plan, the\nformats and procedures applicable to informing the public about incidents, and the\nstandards and/or technical specifications relevant to NIS. Those powers should\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation\n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February\n2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for\ncontrol by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[30].\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the application of this\nDirective, the Commission should liaise as appropriate with relevant sectoral\ncommittees and relevant bodies set up at EU level in particular in the field of\nenergy, transport and health.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information that is\nconsidered confidential by a competent authority, in accordance with Union and\nnational rules on business confidentiality, should be exchanged with the\nCommission and other competent authorities only where such exchange is strictly\nnecessary for the application of this Directive. The information exchanged\nshould be limited to that which is relevant and proportionate to the purpose of\nsuch exchange.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sharing of information\non risks and incidents within the cooperation network and compliance with the\nrequirements to notify incidents to the national competent authorities may\nrequire the processing of personal data. Such a processing of personal data is\nnecessary to meet the objectives of public interest pursued by this Directive\nand is thus legitimate under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC. It does not\nconstitute, in relation to these legitimate aims, a disproportionate and\nintolerable interference impairing the very substance of the right to the\nprotection of personal data guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter of\nfundamental rights. In the application of this Directive, Regulation (EC) No\n1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding\npublic access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[31] should apply as appropriate. When\ndata are processed by Union institutions and bodies, such processing for the\npurpose of implementing this Directive should comply with Regulation (EC) No\n45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by\nthe Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since\nthe objectives of this Directive,\nnamely to ensure a high level of NIS in the Union, cannot be sufficiently\nachieved by the Member States alone and can therefore, by reason of the effects of the action, be better achieved\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle\nof subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\naccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,\nthis Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects the\nfundamental rights, and observes the principles, recognised by the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union notably, the right to respect for\nprivate life and communications, the protection for personal data, the freedom\nto conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy\nbefore a court and the right to be heard. This Directive must be implemented\naccording to these rights and principles\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL\nPROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive lays down\nmeasures to ensure a high common level of network and information security\n(hereinafter referred to as \"NIS\") within the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To that end, this\nDirective:\n(a)                   \nlays down obligations for all Member States\nconcerning the prevention, the handling of and the response to risks and\nincidents affecting networks and information systems;\n(b)                   \ncreates a cooperation mechanism between Member\nStates in order to ensure a uniform application of this Directive within the\nUnion and, where necessary, a coordinated and efficient handling of and\nresponse to risks and incidents affecting network and information systems;\n(c)                   \nestablishes security requirements for market\noperators and public administrations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The security requirements provided\nfor in Article 14 shall apply neither to undertakings providing public\ncommunication networks or publicly available electronic communication services within\nthe meaning of Directive 2002/21/EC, which shall comply with the specific\nsecurity and integrity requirements laid down in Articles 13a and 13b of that\nDirective, nor to trust service providers. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall be\nwithout prejudice to EU laws on cybercrime and Council Directive 2008/114/EC of\n8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical\ninfrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection[32] \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall also\nbe without prejudice to Directive 95/46/CE of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[33], and to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of\npersonal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications\nsector and to the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data\nand on the free movement of such data[34].\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sharing of information\nwithin the cooperation network under Chapter III and the notifications of NIS\nincidents under Article 14 may require the processing of personal data. Such\nprocessing, which is necessary to meet the objectives of public interest\npursued by this Directive, shall be authorised by the Member State pursuant to\nArticle 7 of Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC, as implemented in\nnational law.\nArticle 2\nMinimum\nharmonisation\nMember States\nshall not be prevented from adopting or maintaining provisions ensuring a\nhigher level of security, without prejudice to their obligations under Union\nlaw.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Directive, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply: \n(1)                   \n\"network and information system\" means:\n(a)         \nan electronic communications network within the\nmeaning of Directive 2002/21/EC, and \n(b)         \nany device or group of inter-connected or\nrelated devices, one or more of which, pursuant to a program, perform automatic\nprocessing of computer data, as well as \n(c)         \ncomputer data stored, processed, retrieved or\ntransmitted by elements covered under point (a) and (b) for the purposes of\ntheir operation, use, protection and maintenance.\n(2)                   \n\"security\" means the ability of a network\nand information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accident or\nmalicious action that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and\nconfidentiality of stored or transmitted data or the related services offered\nby or accessible via that network and information system;\n(3)                   \n\"risk\" means any circumstance or event\nhaving a potential adverse effect on security;\n(4)                   \n\"incident\" means any circumstance or\nevent having an actual adverse effect on security;\n(5)                   \n\"information society service\" mean\nservice within the meaning of point (2) of Article 1 of Directive 98/34/EC;\n(6)                   \n\"NIS cooperation plan\" means a plan\nestablishing the framework for organisational roles, responsibilities and\nprocedures to maintain or restore the operation of networks and information\nsystems, in the event of a risk or an incident affecting them;\n(7)                   \n\"incident handling\" means all\nprocedures supporting the analysis, containment and response to an incident;\n(8)                   \n\"market operator\" means:\n(a)         \nprovider of information society services which\nenable the provision of other information society services, a non exhaustive\nlist of which is set out in Annex II;\n(b)         \noperator of critical infrastructure that are\nessential for the maintenance of vital economic and societal activities in the\nfields of energy, transport, banking, stock exchanges and health, a non\nexhaustive list of which is set out in Annex II.\n(9)                   \n\"standard\" means a standard referred\nto in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;\n(10)               \n\"specification\" means a specification\nreferred to in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;\n(11)               \n\"Trust service provider\" means a natural\nor legal person who provides any electronic service consisting\nin the creation, verification, validation, handling and preservation of\nelectronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic\ndocuments, electronic delivery services, website authentication, and electronic\ncertificates, including certificates for electronic signature and for\nelectronic seals.\nCHAPTER\nII\nNATIONAL\nFRAMEWORKS ON NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY\nArticle 4\nPrinciple\nMember States shall ensure a high level of\nsecurity of the network and information systems in their territories in\naccordance with this Directive.\nArticle 5\nNational\nNIS strategy and national NIS cooperation plan\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each\nMember State shall adopt a national NIS strategy defining the strategic objectives\nand concrete policy and regulatory measures to achieve and maintain a high\nlevel of network and information security.

Lack of\nintervention at EU level would lead to a situation where each Member State\nwould act alone disregarding the interdependences amongst network and information\nsystems. \nThe stated objectives can hence be better achieved via EU level\naction, rather than by the Member States alone.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe proposal stems from the analysis that regulatory obligations are\nneeded to create a level playing field and close some legislative loopholes. In\nthis field, a purely voluntarily approach has resulted in cooperation taking\nplace only amongst a minority of Member States with a high level of\ncapabilities. \n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe proposal is fully consistent with the Digital Agenda for Europe\nand therefore with the EU2020 Strategy. It is also consistent with and\ncomplements the EU electronic communications regulatory framework, the EU\nDirective on European Critical Infrastructure and the EU data protection\nDirective.\nThe proposal accompanies and is an essential part of the\nCommunication of the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for\nForeign Affairs and Security Policy on the European Cybersecurity Strategy.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact \n\u2013     \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited duration \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited duration\n\u2013     \nTransposition period will start immediately\nafter adoption (esimated in 2015) and run for 18 months.

This amount is slightly higher than the one mentioned in the\nImpact Assessment (\"about 1 million EUR\") as it is based on a more\nprecise estimate of the necessary building blocks for such an infrastructure. The\nnecessary building blocks and their related costs are based on an estimation of\nthe JRC, based on its experience in developing similar systems for other areas\nlike public health, and would comprise the following: a Rapid Alerting and\nNotification System for NIS (275 000 EUR); an Information Exchange Platform (400\n000 EUR); an Early Warning and Response System (275 000 EUR); a Situation Room\n(300 000 EUR) for a total of 1 250 000 EUR.
