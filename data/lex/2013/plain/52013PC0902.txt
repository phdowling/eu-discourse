It\r\nis based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of\r\nstrengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable\r\ngrowth underpinned by financial stability, thereby supporting the achievement\r\nof the Union's objectives for sustainable growth and jobs. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EU) No\r\n473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on common\r\nprovisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the\r\ncorrection of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area sets out\r\nprovisions for enhanced monitoring of budgetary policies in the euro area and\r\nfor ensuring that national budgets are consistent with the economic policy\r\nguidance issued in the context of the SGP and the European Semester. Since\r\npurely budgetary measures might be insufficient to ensure a lasting correction\r\nof the excessive deficit, additional policy measures and structural reforms may\r\nbe required.\u00a0 \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 9 of Regulation\r\n(EU) No 473/2013 sets out the modalities for Economic Partnership Programmes,\r\nto be submitted by euro area Member States under an Excessive Deficit\r\nProcedure. Setting out a roadmap of measures to contribute to an effective and\r\ndurable correction of the excessive deficit, the Economic\r\nPartnership Programme should detail in particular the\r\nmain fiscal-structural reforms, notably those referring to taxation, pension\r\nand health systems and budgetary frameworks, which will be instrumental to\r\ncorrect the excessive deficit in a lasting manner. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 27 April 2009, the\r\nCouncil adopted a decision according to Article 104(6) of the Treaty, whereby Spain is placed in an excessive deficit procedure. On 21 June 2013 the Council adopted a\r\nrevised recommendation under Article 126(7) in the context of an excessive\r\ndeficit which was opened before the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 473/2013.\r\n\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1 October 2013, and\r\nthereby within the time frame established by Article 9(3), and 17(2) of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013, Spain presented to the Commission and to the\r\nCouncil an Economic Partnership Programme, setting out in\r\nparticular fiscal-structural reforms that aim at ensuring an effective\r\nand lasting correction of the excessive deficit. The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme includes measures aimed at implementing the Country Specific\r\nRecommendations (CSRs) addressed to Spain by the Council on 9 July. These are\r\ngrouped under the following objectives: i) differentiated and growth-enhancing\r\nfiscal repair (CSR#1 and 2); ii) restoring lending to the economy (CSR #3);\r\niii) fight against unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis (CSR\r\n# 4, 5 and 6); iv) fostering competitiveness and growth (CSR # 7 and 8) and v)\r\nmodernising public administration (CSR # 9).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fiscal structural\r\nmeasures that Spain plans to implement are the following: i) strict monitoring\r\nof budgetary developments at regional and local levels; ii) the creation of an\r\nindependent fiscal institution; iii) the reduction in healthcare and public\r\nadministration spending; iv) the elimination of commercial arrears in the\r\npublic sector; v) the reduction of price inertia in public expenditures and\r\nrevenues; vi) pension sustainability; vii) the simplification and strengthening\r\nof the efficiency of Spain's tax system; viii) the fight against the informal\r\neconomy and ix) the increase in the efficiency of public administration. If\r\neffectively implemented, these measures can be expected to contribute to the\r\nlasting correction of Spain's excessive deficit situation. \n(7) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spain's Economic\r\nPartnership Programme also takes stock of the progress made in improving the\r\nmonitoring of regional finances in accordance with the Budgetary Stability Organic\r\nLaw (BSOL), the Region's Liquidity Fund and the Suppliers' Payment Scheme.\r\nHowever, it does not consider additional steps to strengthen the strict and\r\ntransparent enforcement of the preventive and corrective measures provided for\r\nin the BSOL, including e.g. through timely publication of the quarterly\r\nassessment reports of region's economic and financial plans (EFP) and the reasons\r\nfor the activation or not of sanctions to non-compliant entities.\n(8) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The creation of an\r\nindependent fiscal institution in accordance with the requirements of\r\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013 should contribute to an enhanced monitoring of Spain's public finances and to an early detection of deviations from budgetary targets. The\r\nindependent fiscal institution will also advice on the activation of the\r\npreventive, corrective and enforcement measures provided for in the BSOL as\r\nwell as on the definition of regions' fiscal targets. However, some\r\ninstitutional provisions to secure the functional and operational independence\r\nof the council should be made stronger in the existing draft, notably as\r\nregards the relatively short term of office of the president.\n(9) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even though the Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme stops short of presenting plans for a comprehensive systematic review\r\nof major spending items, as recommended in the CSRs by March 2014, measures to\r\nrationalise spending on health, employment policy (see also recital 14 on\r\nfighting tax fraud) and on public administration give information on some key\r\nexpenditure items. Regarding health expenditure, the revision of the basket of\r\nbenefits and of reference prices of pharmaceutical products and the\r\nintroduction of a centralised purchasing platform for health supplies, could\r\nresult in a more efficient use of public resources. Regarding public\r\nadministration, reforms are expected to generate savings over a three-year\r\nperiod from increasing overall efficiency, notably by eliminating duplicated\r\nadministrative structures, streamlining overheads, rationalising the so-called\r\n\"institutional\" administration, as well as reforming local entities.\r\nStrict monitoring and enforcement of all these measures will be required to\r\nrealise expected savings. Regional ownership of the public administration\r\nreform is also critical to securing efficiency gains over the medium term. \n(10) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The on-going revision of\r\nthe BSOL aims at strengthening the Ministry of Finance's monitoring powers over\r\nthe cash and arrears situation of the various general government levels. The\r\ngoal is to eliminate public sector arrears in commercial debt, and to avoid the\r\naccumulation of commercial debt from creating risks to the financial\r\nsustainability of any given public administration. As such, the draft law\r\nstrengthens fiscal discipline on all general government sub-sectors.\u00a0\u00a0 \n(11) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dis-indexation draft\r\nlaw aims at discontinuing indexation schemes in administered prices and fees.\r\nExisting mechanisms on collective bargaining, financial sector instruments and\r\non pensions are excluded from its scope, schemes on pensions being the object\r\nof a separate reform (see below). Following its entry into force, the law is\r\nlikely to generate some fiscal savings, while at the same time, contribute to reducing\r\nsecond round effects on prices while supporting purchasing power and\r\ncompetitiveness.\u00a0 \n(12) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recent and planned changes\r\nin the pension system are significant. The proposed regulation of the\r\nsustainability factor and the new pension indexation formula \u2013 together with\r\nthe early retirement reform adopted in March \u2013 are important steps to improve\r\nthe sustainability of public finances and to rein in fast-rising pension\r\nexpenditure. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the systematic\r\nreview of the tax system (CSR 2), the Economic Partnership Programme refers to\r\nthe conclusions of a group of experts to be presented in February 2014, which\r\nwill be evaluated by the government at a later stage. The document also\r\npresents measures (such as the new tax on fluoride gas) in response to the\r\nrecommendation to take additional steps on environmental taxation.\u00a0 \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme also refers to measures to fight tax fraud and undeclared work,\r\nincluding among others, an annual plan on tax and customs controls to be\r\nadopted at the beginning of 2014, as well as the continued implementation of\r\nthe plan against fraud in employment and in social security). These efforts are\r\nexpected to yield additional revenues, thus contributing to the fiscal consolidation\r\neffort.\u00a0\u00a0 \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Significant attention is\r\ndevoted in the Economic Partnership Programme to labour market issues,\r\nincluding the evaluation of the 2012 labour market reform, the on-going reform\r\nof active labour market policies, the implementation of the Youth\r\nEntrepreneurship and Employment Strategy and the introduction of public-private\r\npartnerships in placement services. However, there are no concrete plans for\r\nthe further modernisation of public employment services, beyond the\r\nco-operation with private employment agencies. Moreover, following the\r\nevaluation of the 2012 labour market reform, the Economic Partnership Programme\r\ndoes not foresee measures for a further strengthening of the reform. That said,\r\nthe reform seems to have fostered firms' internal flexibility and wage\r\nmoderation, hence limiting, ceteris paribus, employment losses. \n(16) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reforms on product and\r\nservices markets are also going in the right direction. The Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme gives information on measures such as the draft law on the guarantee\r\nof market unity, the draft professional services law and the entrepreneurship\r\nlaw. In addition, the Economic Partnership Programme underlines the measures to\r\nreduce the electricity tariff deficit. The reform, which is still to be\r\ncompleted, could help contain the accumulation of an electricity tariff debt\r\nand the associated contingent liability for public finances,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION: \nThe Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme of Spain presented to the Commission and to the Council on 1 October\r\n2013 includes a broadly adequate set of fiscal-structural reforms, which would\r\nbe supportive of an effective and lasting correction of the excessive deficit. The Economic\r\nPartnership Programme confirms the reform agenda and timetable for fiscal and other\r\nstructural reforms included in the 2013 National Reform Programme and the\r\nStability Programme and gives in some cases more detail on the content of\r\nmeasures and their expected timeline. Some recommendations by the Council,\r\nhowever, are so far only partly backed by concrete measures. This is the case,\r\nfor example, of the systematic review of major spending items with a view to\r\nimproving the efficiency of public expenditure (under CSR 1). Moreover,\r\nregarding the review of the tax system (CSR 2), the Economic Partnership\r\nProgramme mainly refers to the conclusions of a group of tax experts scheduled\r\nfor February 2014. In most cases, the reforms still remain to be adopted and /\r\nor fully implemented, swift and full implementation being key for the success\r\nof the Economic Partnership Programme. The Commission and the\r\nCouncil will monitor the execution of the reforms in the context of the\r\nEuropean Semester. \nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 140, 27.5.2013 p. 11.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
