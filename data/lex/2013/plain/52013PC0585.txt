In accordance with Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the\r\nCommission informed the other Member States by letter dated 17 June 2013 of the\r\nrequest made by Romania. By letter dated 18 June 2013, the Commission notified Romania that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\nGeneral context\nAs a general rule, Article 193 of the VAT\r\nDirective stipulates that the taxable person supplying goods or services is\r\nnormally liable to pay value added tax (VAT). \nIn 2009, the Romanian Government requested\r\na derogation pursuant to Article 395 of the VAT Directive to apply a reverse\r\ncharge procedure, whereby the taxable person, to whom the supplies of goods or\r\nservices are made, becomes liable for the payment of the VAT in the following\r\nsituations:\n- supplies of goods and provision of\r\nservices by taxable persons while under an insolvency procedure, excluding\r\nretailers.\n- supplies of wood products by taxable\r\npersons \u2013 specifically, standing timber, round or cleft working wood, fuel\r\nwood, timber products, as well as square-edged or chipped wood and wood in the\r\nrough, processed or semi-manufactured wood.\nThe request was approved by Council and Romania was authorised to apply the reverse charge to the abovementioned supplies until 31\r\nDecember 2013. Romania has now asked for an extension of the derogation\r\nregarding the application of reverse charge to supplies of wood products. Romania has however not requested any extension of the derogation as far as insolvent\r\nbusinesses are concerned.\nThe forestry sector in Romania consists of a large number of small resellers and intermediaries which have proved\r\nto be very difficult to control for the tax authorities. The supplies are often\r\nmade to larger, well established businesses, which are therefore easier to\r\ncontrol. This type of sector is therefore very similar to the ones covered in Article\r\n199 of the VAT Directive and for which the reverse charge has proved to be an\r\neffective instrument without any adverse impact on fraud at the retail sector\r\nor fraud in other Member States or sectors.\nFrom the information provided by the\r\nRomanian Government, a prolongation of the derogation seems justifiable. \nAn extension should be limited in time in\r\norder to assess whether the conditions on which it is based would still be\r\nvalid. It is therefore proposed that the request will be granted until 31 December\r\n2016 and that the Romanian Government shall present a report which includes a\r\nreview of the efficiency of the measure and an evaluation of the risk of fraud\r\nin the wood sector if a new extension request would be envisaged beyond that\r\nend date.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultations of interested parties\nNot relevant.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThe proposal implies continuing a measure which\r\naims to prevent VAT evasion or avoidance and has therefore a potential positive\r\neconomic impact.\nThe derogation has a specific and narrow\r\nscope and will therefore only have limited impact.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nAuthorisation for Romania to continue to apply a derogating measure from Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the\r\napplication of a reverse charge mechanism to supplies of wood products.\nLegal basis\nArticle 395 of the VAT Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reason(s):\nThis Decision concerns an authorisation\r\ngranted to one Member State upon their own request and does not constitute any\r\nobligation.\nGiven the limited scope of the derogation,\r\nthe special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: other.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\r\nfollowing reason(s):\nUnder Article 395 of the Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax,\r\nderogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the\r\nCouncil acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission. A Council\r\nDecision is the only suitable instrument since it can be addressed to an\r\nindividual member state.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the\r\nbudget of the Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause.\n2013/0284 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nauthorising the Republic of Romania to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Directive\r\n2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax , and\r\nin particular Article 395 (1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By letter registered within\r\nthe Commission on 13 March 2013, Romania requested authorisation for extension\r\nof a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC in\r\nrelation to supplies of wood products.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nsecond subparagraph of article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission\r\ninformed the other Member States by letter dated 17 June 2013 of the request\r\nmade by Romania. By letter dated 18 June 2013 the Commission notified Romania that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the\r\nrequest.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 193 of Directive\r\n2006/112/EC provides that the taxable person supplying the goods or services\r\nis, as a general rule, liable for the payment of the value added tax (VAT) to\r\nthe tax authorities.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2010/583/EU of 27 September 2010 authorised Romania to apply a derogating\r\nmeasure pursuant to Article 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to designate\r\nthe recipient as the person liable for the payment of the VAT on supplies of\r\nwood products.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the former\r\nauthorisation to apply reverse charge to the supplies of wood, Romania had encountered problems in the timber market because of the nature of the market\r\nand the businesses involved. There are a large number of small enterprises in\r\nthis sector which the Romanian authorities have found difficult to control.\r\nDesignating the recipient as the person liable for payment of VAT has,\r\naccording to the Romanian authorities, had the effect of preventing tax evasion\r\nand avoidance in this sector and remains justified.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measure is\r\nproportionate to the objectives pursued since it is not intended to apply\r\ngenerally, but only to very specific operations in a sector which poses\r\nconsiderable problems of tax evasion or avoidance.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measure should not, in\r\nthe Commission's view, have any adverse impact on fraud at the retail level or\r\nin other sectors or Member States.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorisation should\r\nbe limited in time until 31 December 2016.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Romania requires a further extension beyond 2016, a report shall be submitted to the Commission\r\ntogether with the extension request no later than 1 April 2016. In light of the\r\nexperience gained up to that date an assessment shall be made on whether or not\r\nthe derogation remains justified.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The derogation has no\r\nadverse impact on the Union's own resources accruing from value added tax,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 193 of\r\nDirective 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Romania is hereby authorised until 31\r\nDecember 2016 to designate the taxable person to whom the supplies of goods or\r\nservices referred to in Article 2 of this Decision are made as the person\r\nliable for the payment of the tax.\nArticle 2\nThe derogation provided for in Article 1\r\nshall apply to supplies of wood products by taxable persons including standing\r\ntimber, round or cleft working wood, fuel wood, timber products, as well as\r\nsquare edged or chipped wood and wood in the rough, processed or\r\nsemi-manufactured wood.\nArticle 3\nAny request for the extension of the\r\nmeasure provided for in this Decision shall be submitted to the Commission no\r\nlater than 1 April 2016, and shall be accompanied by a report which includes an\r\nassessment of the efficiency of the measure and an evaluation of the risk of\r\nfraud in the wood sector.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of   Romania.\nDone at Brussels, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
