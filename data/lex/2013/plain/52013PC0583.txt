In addition,\r\nthe Commission will make sure, in carrying out the research activities, that\r\nthe financial interests of the Union are protected by effective checks and,\r\nwhere irregularities are detected, by deterrent and proportionate measures and\r\npenalties.\nIn\r\norder to achieve this aim, rules on checks, measures and penalties, with\r\nreference to Regulations No 2988/95, No 2185/96 and No 1073/99 will be\r\nincorporated in all contracts used in the implementation of the Framework\r\nprogramme.\nIn\r\nparticular, the following points will have to be provided for in the contracts:\n- the\r\nintroduction of specific contractual clauses to protect the financial interests\r\nof the EU in carrying out checks and controls in relation to the work\r\nperformed;\n-\r\nthe carrying out of administrative checks as part of anti-fraud measures, in\r\naccordance with Regulations No 2185/96, No 1073/1999 and No 1074/1999;\n-\r\nthe application of administrative penalties for all intentional or negligent\r\nirregularities in the implementation of the contracts, in accordance with the\r\nFramework Regulation No 2988/95, including a blacklisting mechanism;\n-\r\nthe fact that any recovery orders in the event of irregularities and fraud must\r\nbe enforceable according to Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\r\nEuropean Union. \nIn\r\naddition and as a routine measure, a control programme in respect of scientific\r\nand budgetary aspects will be carried out by the responsible staff in the DG\r\nfor Research and Innovation; an internal audit will be carried out by the\r\nInternal Audit unit of DG Research and Innovation; and local inspections will\r\nbe undertaken by the European Court of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
