Europol\nfacilitates the exchange of information between Member States\u2019 law enforcement\nauthorities and provides criminal analysis to help national police forces carry\nout cross border investigations. \nArticle 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union stipulates that Europol shall be governed by a regulation\nto be adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure. It also requires the\nco-legislators to establish procedures for the scrutiny of Europol\u2019s activities\nby the European Parliament, together with national Parliaments. \nThe European Police College (CEPOL) was\nestablished as an EU agency in 2005, in charge of activities related to the\ntraining of law enforcement officers. It aims to facilitate cooperation between\nnational police forces by organising courses with a European policing\ndimension. It defines common curricula on specific topics, disseminates\nrelevant research and best practice, coordinates an exchange programme for\nsenior police officers and trainers, and may act as a partner in EU grants for\nspecific projects. \nThe European Council, in \u201cthe Stockholm\nProgramme \u2013 An Open and Secure Europe Serving and Protecting Citizens\u201d[1], called on Europol to evolve\nand \u201cbecome a hub for information exchange between the law enforcement\nauthorities of the Member States, a service provider and a platform for law\nenforcement services\u201d, and called for the establishment of European training\nschemes and exchange programmes for all relevant law enforcement professionals\nat national and EU level, with\nCEPOL playing a key role in ensuring the European dimension. \nIn its Communication \u2018The EU Internal Security Strategy in Action:\nFive steps towards a more secure Europe\u2019[2], the\nCommission identified key challenges, principles and guidelines for dealing\nwith security issues within the EU, and suggested a number of actions involving\nEuropol and CEPOL to address the risks that serious crime and terrorism pose to\nsecurity.\nOver the last decade, the EU has seen an\nincrease in serious and organised crime as well as more\ndiverse patterns in crime.[3]\nEuropol\u2019s EU Serious and organised crime threat assessment 2013 (SOCTA 2013)\nfound that \u201cserious and organised crime is an\nincreasingly dynamic and complex phenomenon, and remains a significant threat\nto the safety and prosperity of the EU.\u201d[4] The\nstudy also notes that \u201cthe effects of globalisation in society and business\nhave also facilitated the emergence of significant new variations in criminal\nactivity, in which criminal networks exploit legislative loopholes, the\ninternet, and conditions associated with the economic crisis to generate\nillicit profits at low risk.\u201d[5] The internet is used to organise and\nexecute criminal activities, serving as a communication tool, a marketplace,\nrecruiting ground and financial service. It also facilitates new forms of\ncybercrime, payment card fraud as well as the distribution of child sexual\nabuse material.[6]\n\nSerious crime offences therefore cause\nincreasingly severe harm to victims, inflict economic damage on a large scale\nand undermine the sense of security without which persons cannot exercise their\nfreedom and individual rights effectively. Crimes like trafficking in human\nbeings,[7]\nin illicit drugs,[8] and in firearms,[9]\nfinancial crimes like corruption,[10] fraud[11] and money laundering,[12] and\ncybercrime[13]\nnot only pose a threat to personal and economic safety of people living in\nEurope, they also generate vast criminal profits which strengthen the power of\ncriminal networks and deprive public authorities of much needed revenues. Terrorism remains a major threat to the EU\u2019s security, as societies\nin Europe are still vulnerable to terrorist attacks.[14] \nCrime is one of the five main concerns of\nEU citizens.[15]\nAsked what issues the EU institutions should focus on, the fight against crime\nwas mentioned in fourth place.[16]\nIn a recent survey most EU internet users expressed high levels of concern\nabout cyber security and cybercrime.[17]\nIn this context, EU agencies are needed to\neffectively and efficiently support law enforcement cooperation, information\nsharing and training. \nThe Common Approach on EU decentralised\nagencies endorsed by the European Parliament, Council and Commission in July\n2012[18]\nsets out principles for the governance arrangements of agencies such as Europol\nand CEPOL. The Common Approach also notes that \u201cmerging agencies should be\nconsidered in cases where their respective tasks are overlapping, where\nsynergies can be contemplated or when agencies would be more efficient if\ninserted in a bigger structure\u201d.\nMerging Europol and CEPOL into a single\nagency, situated at the current headquarters of Europol in The Hague would\ncreate important synergies and efficiency gains. Combining the operational\npolice cooperation know-how of Europol with the training and education\nexpertise of CEPOL would strengthen the links and create synergies between the\ntwo fields. Contacts between the operational and the training staff working\nwithin a single agency would help identify training needs, thus increasing the\nrelevance and focus of EU training, to the benefit of EU police cooperation\noverall. Duplication of support functions in the two agencies would be avoided,\nand resulting savings could be redeployed and invested in core operational and\ntraining functions. This is particularly important in an economic context,\nwhere national and EU resources are scarce and where resources to strengthen EU\nlaw enforcement training might not otherwise be available.\nThis proposal for a regulation therefore\nprovides for a legal framework for a new Europol which succeeds and replaces\nEuropol as established by the Council Decision 2009/371/JHA of 6 April 2009\nestablishing the European Police Office (Europol), and CEPOL as established by\nCouncil Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL).\n\nThe proposal is in line with the\nrequirements of the Lisbon Treaty, the expectations of the Stockholm Programme,\nthe priorities set out in the Internal Security Strategy in Action, and the\nCommon Approach to EU decentralised agencies.\n\n2.                      \nRESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES\nAND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\nDialogues on the preparation of the reform\nof Europol, CEPOL and of EU law enforcement training took place in 2010 and\n2011 between the Commission and representatives of the European Parliament, the\nCouncil of the European Union and the Management Board of Europol and Governing\nBody of CEPOL, as well as with representatives of national Parliaments.\nIn line with its \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d\npolicy, the Commission conducted two impact assessments of policy alternatives\nconcerning Europol and CEPOL.[19]\n\nThe impact assessment on Europol was based\non the two policy objectives of increasing provision of information to Europol\nby Member States and of setting a data processing environment that allows\nEuropol to fully assist Member States in preventing and combating serious crime\nand terrorism. As regards the former objective, two policy options were\nassessed: (i) clarifying a legal obligation of Member States to provide data to\nEuropol, providing for incentives and a reporting mechanism on the performance\nof individual Member States, and (ii) granting Europol access to relevant\nnational law enforcement databases on a hit-/no hit basis. As regards the\npolicy objective on a data processing environment, two policy options were\nassessed: (i) merging the two existing Analyses Work Files into one and (ii)\nnew processing environment setting up procedural safeguards to implement data\nprotection principles with particular emphasis on \u2018privacy by design\u2019.\nThe impact assessment on CEPOL was based on\nthe two policy objectives of (i) ensuring better quality, more joined-up and\nmore consistent training for a wider range of law enforcement officers in\ncross-border crime issues and (ii) establishing a framework to achieve this in\nline with the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. In the context of\nthe Commission presenting a Law Enforcement Training Scheme, for the\nimplementation of which additional resources will be needed, the Commission\nexamined different options including strengthening and streamlining CEPOL as a\nseparate agency and merging, partially or fully, the functions of CEPOL and\nEuropol into a new Europol agency.\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s established\nmethodology, each policy option was assessed, with the help of an inter-service\nsteering group, against its impact on security, on the costs (including on the\nbudget of the EU institutions) and impact on fundamental rights. \nThe analysis of the overall impact led to\nthe development of the preferred policy option which is incorporated in the\npresent proposal. According to the assessment, its implementation will lead to\nfurther effectiveness of Europol as an agency providing comprehensive support\nfor law enforcement officers in the European Union.\n\n3.                      \nLEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n\nArticle 88 and Article 87(2)(b) of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union are the legal bases for the\nproposal.\nObjective and content of the legislative\nproposal\nThis proposal aims to:\n\u00b7                        \nAlign Europol with the requirements of the\nTreaty of Lisbon by setting up the legislative framework of Europol in the\nregulation and by introducing a mechanism for control of Europol\u2019s activities\nby the European Parliament, together with national Parliaments. In this way\ndemocratic legitimacy and accountability of Europol to the European citizen\nwould be enhanced. \n\u00b7                        \nMeet the goals of the Stockholm Programme by\nmaking Europol \u201ca hub for information exchange between\nthe law enforcement authorities of the Member States\u201d and establishing European\ntraining schemes and exchange programmes for all relevant law enforcement\nprofessionals at national and EU level.\n\u00b7                        \nGrant Europol new responsibilities so that it\nmay provide a more comprehensive support for law enforcement authorities in the\nMember States. This includes Europol taking over the current tasks of CEPOL in\nthe area of training of law enforcement officers and developing a Law\nEnforcement Training Scheme. This also involves a possibility for Europol to\ndevelop the EU centres of specialized expertise for combating certain types of\ncrime falling under Europol\u2019s objectives, in particular the European Cybercrime\nCentre.\n\u00b7                        \nEnsure a robust data protection regime for\nEuropol, in particular to guarantee that the data protection supervisor of\nEuropol has full independence, can act effectively and has sufficient powers of\nintervention. \n\u00b7                        \nTo improve the governance of Europol by seeking\nincreased efficiency and aligning it with the principles laid down in the\nCommon Approach on EU decentralised agencies.\nThe proposal achieves these aims in the\nfollowing way:\n1. Aligning Europol with the\nrequirements of the Treaty of Lisbon, increasing its accountability\nThe regulation ensures that Europol\u2019s\nactivities are subject to scrutiny by the democratically elected\nrepresentatives of the EU citizens. The proposed rules are in line with the\nCommission\u2019s 2010 Communication on the procedures for the scrutiny of Europol\u2019s\nactivities by the European Parliament, together with national Parliaments.[20]\nIn particular, the European Parliament and\nnational Parliaments:\n\u00b7                        \nreceive information through annual activity\nreports and final accounts each year;\n\u00b7                        \nreceive for information threat assessments,\nstrategic analyses and general situation reports relating to Europol\u2019s\nobjective as well as the results of studies and evaluations commissioned by\nEuropol, and working arrangements agreed with authorities of third countries to\nimplement international agreements concluded by the European Union with this\nthird country;\n\u00b7                        \nreceive for information the multi-annual and\nannual work programme as adopted;\n\u00b7                        \nreceive reports on quantity and quality of\ninformation provided to Europol by each Member State and on the performance of\nits National Unit;\n\u00b7                        \nmay discuss with the Executive Director and the\nChairperson of the Management Board matters relating to Europol- taking into\naccount the obligations of discretion and confidentiality.\nIn addition, the European Parliament:\n\u00b7                        \nfulfils its functions of the budgetary\nauthority, in particular: receives the statement of estimates, receives the\nreport on the budgetary and financial management for that financial year, may\nask for any information required for the discharge procedure and gives a\ndischarge to the Executive Director in respect of the implementation of the\nbudget;\n\u00b7                        \nis consulted on the multi-annual work programme\nof Europol;\n\u00b7                        \nreceives for information the annual work\nprogramme of Europol; \n\u00b7                        \nmay invite the candidate for the Executive\nDirector of Europol or a Deputy Executive Director selected by the Management\nBoard for a hearing before the competent parliamentary committee;\n\u00b7                        \nmay invite the Executive Director to reply to\nits questions on his/her performance.\nIn order to allow the European Parliament\nto exercise the scrutiny but at the same time to guarantee confidentiality of\noperational information, Europol and the European Parliament need to conclude\nworking arrangement on the access to European Union Classified Information and\nsensitive non-classified information processed by or through Europol.\n2. Europol as a hub for information\nexchange between law enforcement authorities in the Member States\nIn order to improve Europol\u2019s intelligence\npicture, so that it can better support Member States and better inform EU\npolicy setting, the proposal seeks to enhance the supply of information by\nMember States to Europol. This is done by strengthening the obligation for\nMember States to provide Europol with relevant data. An incentive is offered by\nextending the possibility for law enforcement services to receive financial\nsupport to cross border investigations in areas other than euro counterfeiting.\nA reporting mechanism to monitor Member States\u2019 contribution of data to Europol\nis introduced.\nTo enable Europol to better establish links\nbetween data already in its possession and subsequently analysing them, the\nagency\u2019s processing architecture is re-designed. It no longer pre-defines data\nbases or systems but instead adopts a \u2018privacy by design\u2019 approach and full\ntransparency towards the Data Protection Officer at Europol and the European\nData Protection Supervisor, the EDPS. High data protection and data security\nstandards are achieved by means of procedural safeguards that apply to any\nspecific type of information. The regulation sets out in detail the purposes of\ndata processing activities (cross-checking, strategic analyses or other general\nnature, operational analyses in specific cases), the sources of information and\nwho may access data. It also lists categories of personal data and data\nsubjects whose data may be collected for each specific information processing\nactivity. This would enable Europol to adapt its IT architecture to future\nchallenges and the needs of the law enforcement authorities in the EU. Once in\nplace, it would allow Europol to link and make analyses of relevant data,\nreduce delays in identifying trends and patterns and reduce multiple storage of\ndata. At the same time, high data protection standards would be guaranteed.\nObservance of those standards will be supervised by the European Data\nProtection Supervisor. \nIn this way Europol analysts would gain a\nbroader picture on serious criminality and terrorism in the EU. They would be\nable to quickly identify trends and patterns across all criminal areas and\nbuild more comprehensive and relevant intelligence reports to support Member\nStates\u2019 law enforcement authorities.\n3. New responsibilities: training and\ndeveloping EU centres to fight specific crimes\nTo ensure synergies in EU support for\npolicing, and to allow full implementation of the EU Law Enforcement Training\nScheme proposed in parallel with this regulation,[21] Europol will take over and\nbuild on the tasks formerly carried out by CEPOL. Closer links between training\nand operational work will lead to more targeted and relevant training for law\nenforcement officers. \nEuropol, through a new department known as\nthe Europol Academy will assume responsibility for supporting, developing,\ndelivering and coordinating training for law enforcement officers at the\nstrategic level, and not only (as is the case under the current CEPOL Decision)\nsenior police officers. These activities will address needs for awareness and\nknowledge of international and Union instruments, encouragement of cross-border\ncooperation, specialized knowledge in specific criminal or policing thematic\nareas and preparation for participation in EU civilian police missions in third\ncountries. It will be responsible for developing and evaluating educational\ntools, linked to requirements identified in regular training needs assessments.\nIt will contribute to research and seek to establish partnerships with Union\nbodies and private academic institutions as appropriate.\nThe composition, functions and procedures\nof the Management Board reflect Europol\u2019s new responsibilities for law\nenforcement training, as well as the best practice set out in the Common\nApproach on EU decentralised agencies. \nA Scientific Committee for Training will\nadvise the Management Board in order to guarantee and guide the scientific\nquality of Europol\u2019s training activities.\nTo enhance the EU\u2019s capacity to confront\nspecific crime phenomena, which particularly call for a common effort, Europol\nis given a possibility to develop centres to fight specific forms of crime, for\nexample the European Cybercrime Centre. \nSuch EU centres integrating various\napproaches towards fighting the specific form of crime would add value to the\nMember States actions. They could, for instance, be information focal points,\npool expertise to support Member States in capacity building, support Member\nStates\u2019 investigations or become the collective voice of the European\ninvestigators across law enforcement in the specific area.\n4. Robust data protection regime\nThe proposal reinforces the data protection\nregime applicable to Europol\u2019s activities. In particular, the following\nmeasures are taken:\n\u00b7                        \nThe existing autonomous Europol data protection\nregime is further strengthened by drawing to a large extent on the principles\nunderpinning Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 on the protection of individual with\nregard to processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies\nand on the free movement of such data.[22]\nAs Declaration 21 attached to the Treaty recognizes the specificity of personal\ndata processing in the law enforcement context, the data protection rules of\nEuropol have however been aligned with other data protection instruments applicable\nin the area of police and judicial cooperation. These are in particular the\nConvention No. 108[23]\nand Recommendation No R (87) of the Council of Europe[24] and Council Framework Decision\n2008/977 on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of\npolice and judicial cooperation.[25]\nThis will ensure a high level of protection of individuals with regard to\nprocessing of personal data, while taking into due account the specificity of\nlaw enforcement. \n\u00b7                        \nAccess by Member States to personal data held by\nEuropol and relating to operational analyses, is made indirect based on a\nhit/no hit system: an automated comparison produces an anonymous \u2018hit\u2019 if the\ndata held by the requesting Member State match data held by Europol. The\nrelated personal or case data are only provided in response to a separate\nfollow-up request.\n\u00b7                        \nThe processing of personal data on victims,\nwitnesses, persons different from suspects, and minors is prohibited unless\nstrictly necessary. This limitation also applies to data revealing racial or\nethnic origin, political opinions, religions or beliefs, trade-union membership\nand of data concerning health or sex life (sensitive personal data).\nFurthermore, sensitive personal data can only be processed where they\nsupplement other personal data already processed by Europol. Europol is obliged\nto provide every six months an overview of all sensitive personal data to the\nEDPS. Finally, no decision which produces legal effects concerning a data\nsubject can be taken solely on the basis of automated processing of sensitive\npersonal data, unless it is authorised by EU or national law or by the EDPS.\n\u00b7                        \nTo increase transparency, individuals\u2019 right of\naccess to personal data held by Europol is reinforced. The information that\nEuropol must provide to an individual requesting access to his/her data is\nlisted in the Regulation.\n\u00b7                        \nThe proposal sets clear rules on the division of\nresponsibility in data protection matters, in particular it makes Europol\nresponsible for reviewing the continued need to store personal data at regular\nintervals.\n\u00b7                        \nThe obligation of logging and documentation is\nextended from covering access to a wider range of data processing activities:\ncollection, alteration, access, disclosure, combination and erasure. To ensure\nbetter control over the use of data and clarity on who has been processing it,\nthe regulation prohibits modification of the logs.\n\u00b7                        \nAny individual can turn to Europol for\ncompensation for unlawful data processing or an action incompatible with the\nprovisions of this Regulation. In such a case Europol and a Member State in\nwhich damage has occurred are jointly and severally liable (Europol on the\nbasis of Article 340 of the Treaty and the Member State on the basis of its\nnational law).\n\u00b7                        \nThe role of Europol\u2019s external data protection\nsupervisory authority is strengthened. The European Data Protection Supervisor\nwill be competent for the supervision of processing of personal data by\nEuropol. This ensures full compliance with the criteria of independence\nestablished in the case-law of the Court of Justice and, due to the EDPS\u2019\nenforcement powers, effectiveness of data protection supervision. \n\u00b7                        \nThe national data protection authorities remain\nhowever competent for supervision of input, the retrieval and any communication\nto Europol of personal data by the Member State concerned. They also remain\nresponsible for examining whether such input, retrieval or communication\nviolates the rights of the data subject.\n\u00b7                        \nThe Regulation introduces elements of \u201cjoint\nsupervision\u201d on data transferred to and processed at Europol. In specific\nissues requiring national involvement and in order to ensure coherent\napplication of this regulation throughout the European Union, the European Data\nProtection Supervisor and national supervisory authorities, each acting within\nits competences, should co-operate with each other.\n5. Improved governance\nThe proposal improves the governance of\nEuropol by seeking efficiency gains, streamlining procedures, notably with\nrespect to the Management Board and the Executive Director, and by aligning\nEuropol with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU\ndecentralised agencies.\nThe Commission and the Member States are\nrepresented on the Management Board of Europol in order to effectively control\nits workings. In order to reflect the dual mandate of the new Agency \u2013\noperational support and training for law enforcement \u2013 the full members of the\nManagement Board are appointed on the basis of their knowledge of law\nenforcement cooperation, whereas alternate members are appointed on the basis\nof their knowledge of training for law enforcement officers. The alternate\nmembers will act as full members whenever training is discussed or decided. The\nManagement Board will be advised by a scientific committee on technical\ntraining issues (Scientific Committee for Training). \nThe Management Board is given the necessary\npowers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the\nappropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent\nworking procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of Europol,\nadopt the annual activity report, and appoint an Executive Director.\nTo streamline the decision making process,\nthe Management Board may also decide to establish an Executive Board. Such a\nsmall-sized Executive Board, with the presence of a Commission representative,\ncould be more closely involved in the monitoring of Europol\u2019s activities with a\nview to reinforcing supervision of administrative and budgetary management, in\nparticular on audit matters. \nIn order to ensure efficient day-to-day\nfunctioning of Europol, the Executive Director is its legal representative and\nmanager. The Executive Director is completely independent in the performance of\nhis/her tasks and ensures that Europol carries out the tasks foreseen in this\nRegulation. In particular, the Executive Director is responsible for preparing\nbudgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management\nBoard, implementing the annual and multiannual work programmes of Europol and\nother planning documents.\n\n4.                      \nBUDGETARY IMPLICATION \n\nThe full merger of\nCEPOL and EUROPOL will lead to synergies and efficiency gains. The savings\nachieved are assessed at the level of \u20ac17.2 million over the period 2015-2020 and\n14 full time staff equivalent (FTE).\nAlthough this proposal\nwill take advantage of these savings and build on existing resources, additional\nresources will be required for Europol to implement the new tasks related to\ntraining of law enforcement officials, and to process and analyse the expected\nincrease in information flows, including through the European Cybercrime\nCentre. The operation and further development of the European Cybercrime Centre\nhas by far the most significant impact on resources. In parallel to these needs\nfor new resources, CEPOL and Europol also participate in the current 5%\nreduction in staff numbers across all EU agencies, as well as contributing\nstaff posts to a pool for redeployment in EU agencies in favour of new tasks\nand start-up phase agencies.\nAn additional 12 FTE\nwill be needed to implement the new tasks related to training of law\nenforcement officials, i.e. the activities needed to implement the European Law\nEnforcement Training Scheme proposed in parallel with this Regulation. The\nhuman resources for the new training activities will be obtained as a result of\nthe merger of CEPOL into Europol, which will result in savings amounting to 14\nposts, representing \u20ac10.1m over the period 2015-2020. By discontinuing 14\nposts, CEPOL should comply with the request to cut staff by 5% and to\ncontribute to the redeployment pool. In addition, an estimated \u20ac7.1m will be\nsaved as a result of lower costs of building, equipment and management board\nexpenses over the same period. The relocation of around 40 staff from CEPOL\u2019s\ncurrent site in Bramshill, UK, to the Europol site in The Hague, the\nNetherlands, is expected to result in limited one-off costs, estimated at \u20ac30\n000. However, the UK has announced its intention to close the Bramshill site,\nCEPOL will therefore in any event have to be relocated.\nAn additional 3 FTE\nwill be needed for increased information processing requirements that will\nresult from the expected rise in the quantity of information supplied to\nEuropol as a result of this proposal (which combines a strengthened obligation\nupon Member States to provide relevant data to Europol, financial support to\nindividual investigations and monitoring reports). These will be gradually\nrecruited between 2015 and 2017 resulting in an estimated \u20ac1.8m in staffing\ncosts over the period 2015-2020. However, approximately two thirds of these\ncosts will be offset by the savings resulting from the merger of CEPOL: two (2)\nFTE will be secured from the remaining 2 posts out of the 14 saved as a result\nof the CEPOL merger.\nFor the European\nCybercrime Centre, an additional 41 FTE will be recruited over the period\n2015-2020. The tasks for which that staff is needed are identified in an\naccompanying Commission Staff Working Document. The non\u2013staff costs for the\nEuropean Cybercrime Centre have been estimated at \u20ac16.6m over the same period.\nIn 2013, 44 FTE had already been assigned to the European Cybercrime Centre\nthrough internal redeployment within Europol and an additional 17 FTE were\nrequested by Europol as a part of the Draft Budget 2014.\nIn order to comply with\nthe request to cut staff by 5% and to contribute to the redeployment pool, 34\nFTE should be discontinued within Europol between 2015 and 2018 on top of the\n12 FTE to be discontinued already in 2014.\nFinally, this proposal\nwill require additional resources for the European Data Protection Supervisor\nestimated at the equivalent of 1 FTE. The change in data protection supervision\narrangements will create savings of \u20ac3m for Europol between 2015 and 2020, no\nlonger needing to provide support to the current Joint Supervisory Body, and\nadditional costs of \u20ac1.5m for EDPS over the same period.\nIn total, therefore,\nthe budgetary impact of the legislative proposal amounts to \u20ac623m for the\nmerged agency over the period 2015-2020, as well as the \u20ac1.5m needed for the\nEDPS.[26]\n2013/0091 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement\nCooperation and Training (Europol) and repealing Decisions 2009/371/JHA and\n2005/681/JHA\nTHE\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 88\nand Article 87(2)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to\nthe proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission\nof the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nAfter having\nconsulted the European Data Protection Supervisor,\nActing in\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \nEuropol was set up by Decision 2009/371/JHA[27] as an entity of the Union\nfunded from the general budget of the Union to support and strengthen action by\ncompetent authorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in\npreventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious\ncrime affecting two or more Member States. Decision 2009/371/JHA replaced the\nConvention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the\nestablishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention).[28]\n(2)              \nArticle 88 of the Treaty provides for Europol to\nbe governed by a regulation to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure. It also requires the establishment of procedures for the\nscrutiny of Europol\u2019s activities by the European Parliament, together with\nnational Parliaments. Therefore, it is necessary to replace the Decision\n2009/371/JHA by a regulation laying down rules on parliamentary scrutiny.\n(3)              \nThe European Police College (\u2018CEPOL\u2019) was\nestablished by Decision 2005/681/JHA[29]\nto facilitate cooperation between national police forces by organising and\ncoordinating training activities with a European policing dimension. \n(4)              \nThe \u2018Stockholm Programme \u2013 An open and secure\nEurope serving and protecting citizens\u2019[30]\ncalls for Europol to evolve and become a \u201chub for information exchange between\nthe law enforcement authorities of the Member States, a service provider and a\nplatform for law enforcement services.\u201d On the basis of an assessment of\nEuropol\u2019s functioning, further enhancement of its operational effectiveness is\nneeded to meet this objective. The Stockholm Programme also sets the aim of\ncreating a genuine European law enforcement culture by setting up European\ntraining schemes and exchange programmes for all relevant law enforcement\nprofessionals at national and Union level.\n(5)              \nLarge-scale criminal and terrorist networks pose\na significant threat to the internal security of the Union and to the safety\nand livelihood of its citizens. Available threat assessments show that criminal\ngroups are becoming increasingly poly-criminal and cross-border in their\nactivities. National law enforcement authorities therefore need to cooperate\nmore closely with their counterparts in other Member States. In this context,\nit is necessary to equip Europol to support Member States more in Union-wide\ncrime prevention, analyses and investigations. This has also been confirmed in\nthe evaluations of Decisions 2009/371/JHA and 2005/681/JHA. \n(6)              \nGiven the links between the tasks of Europol and\nCEPOL, integrating and rationalising the functions of the two agencies would enhance\nthe effectiveness of operational activity, the relevance of training and the\nefficiency of Union police cooperation.\n(7)              \nDecisions 2009/371/JHA and 2005/681/JHA should\ntherefore be repealed and replaced by this regulation, which draws on the\nlessons learnt from the implementation of both Decisions. Europol as\nestablished by this regulation should replace and assume the functions of\nEuropol and CEPOL as established by the two repealed Decisions. \n(8)              \nAs crime often occurs across internal borders,\nEuropol should support and strengthen Member State actions and their\ncooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more\nMember States. As terrorism is one of the most important threats for the\nsecurity of the Union, Europol should assist Member States in facing common\nchallenges in this regard. As the EU law enforcement agency, Europol should\nalso support and strengthen actions and cooperation on tackling forms of crime\nthat affect the interests of the EU. It should also offer support in preventing\nand combating related criminal offences which are committed in order to procure\nthe means, to facilitate, to carry out or to ensure the impunity of acts in\nrespect of which Europol is competent.\n(9)              \nEuropol should ensure better quality, coherent\nand consistent training for law enforcement officers of all ranks within a\nclear framework in accordance with identified training needs.\n(10)          \nEuropol should be able to request Member States to\ninitiate, conduct or coordinate criminal investigations in specific cases where\ncross-border cooperation would add value. Europol should inform Eurojust of\nsuch requests. \n(11)          \nTo increase the effectiveness of Europol as a\nhub for information exchange in the Union, clear obligations for Member States\nto provide Europol with the data necessary for it to fulfil its objectives\nshould be laid down. While implementing such obligations, Member States should\npay particular attention to providing data relevant for the fight against crimes\nconsidered to be strategic and operational priorities within relevant policy\ninstruments of the Union. Member States should also provide Europol with a copy\nof bilateral and multilateral exchanges of information with other Member States\non crime falling under Europol\u2019s objectives. At the same time, Europol should\nincrease the level of its support to Member States, so as to enhance mutual\ncooperation and sharing of information. Europol should submit an annual report\nto all Union institutions and to national Parliaments on the extent to which individual\nMember States provide it with information.\n(12)          \nTo ensure effective cooperation between Europol\nand Member States, a national unit should be set up in each Member State. It\nshould be the principal liaison between national law enforcement authorities\nand training institutes and Europol. To ensure continuous, effective exchange\nof information between Europol and national units and to facilitate their\ncooperation, each national unit should second at least one liaison officer to\nEuropol.\n(13)          \nTaking into account the decentralised structure\nof some Member States and the need to ensure in certain cases rapid exchanges\nof information, Europol should be allowed to cooperate directly with law\nenforcement authorities in Member States in individual investigations, while\nkeeping Europol national units informed. \n(14)          \nTo ensure that Union-level law enforcement\ntraining is of high quality, coherent and consistent, Europol should act in\nline with Union law enforcement training policy. Union-level training should be\navailable to law enforcement officers of all ranks. Europol should ensure that\ntraining is evaluated and that conclusions from training needs assessments are\npart of planning to reduce duplication. Europol should promote the recognition\nin Member States of training provided at Union level. \n(15)          \nIt is also necessary to improve the governance\nof Europol, by seeking efficiency gains and streamlining procedures.\n(16)          \nThe Commission and the Member States should be\nrepresented on the Management Board of Europol to effectively supervise its\nwork. To reflect the dual mandate of the new agency, operational support and\ntraining for law enforcement, the full members of the Management Board should\nbe appointed on the basis of their knowledge of law enforcement cooperation,\nwhereas alternate members should be appointed on the basis of their knowledge\nof training for law enforcement officers. Alternate members should act as full\nmembers in the absence of the full member and in any case when training is\ndiscussed or decided. The Management Board should be advised by a scientific\ncommittee on technical training issues.\n(17)          \nThe Management Board should be given the\nnecessary powers, in particular to set the budget, verify its execution, adopt\nthe appropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent\nworking procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of Europol,\nand adopt the annual activity report. It should exercise the powers of\nappointing authority towards staff of the agency including the Executive\nDirector. To streamline the decision making process, and to reinforce\nsupervision of administrative and budgetary management, the Management Board\nshould be also entitled to establish an Executive Board. \n(18)          \nTo ensure the efficient day-to-day functioning\nof Europol, the Executive Director should be its legal representative and\nmanager, acting in complete independence in the performance of all tasks and\nensuring that Europol carries out the tasks provided for by this Regulation. In\nparticular, the Executive Director should be responsible for preparing\nbudgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management\nBoard, implementing the annual and multiannual work programmes of Europol and\nother planning documents.\n(19)          \nFor the purposes of preventing and combating\ncrime falling under its objectives, it is necessary for Europol to have the\nfullest and most up-to-date information possible. Therefore, Europol should be\nable to process data provided to it by Member States, third countries,\ninternational organisations and Union bodies as well as coming from publicly\navailable sources to develop an understanding of criminal phenomena and trends,\nto gather information about criminal networks, and to detect links between\ndifferent offences. \n(20)          \nTo improve Europol\u2019s effectiveness in providing\naccurate crime analyses to the Member States\u2019 law enforcement authorities, it\nshould use new technologies to process data. Europol should be able to swiftly\ndetect links between investigations and common modi operandi\nacross different criminal groups, to check cross-matches of data and to have a\nclear overview of trends, while maintaining high level of protection of\npersonal data for individuals. Therefore, Europol databases should not be\npre-defined, allowing Europol to choose the most efficient IT structure. To\nensure a high level of data protection, the purpose of processing operations\nand access rights as well as specific additional safeguards should be laid down.\n\n(21)          \nTo respect ownership of data and protection of\ninformation, Member States and authorities in third countries and international\norganisations should be able to determine the purpose for which Europol may\nprocess the data they provide and to restrict access rights. \n(22)          \nTo ensure that data are accessed only by those\nfor whom access is necessary to perform their tasks, this Regulation should lay\ndown detailed rules on different degrees of right of access to data processed\nby Europol. Such rules should be without prejudice to restrictions on access\nimposed by data providers, as the principle of ownership of data should be\nrespected. In order to increase efficiency of preventing and combating crime\nfalling under Europol\u2019s objectives, Europol should notify Member States of\ninformation which concerns them.\n(23)          \nTo enhance operational cooperation between the\nagencies, and particularly to establish links between data already in\npossession of the different agencies, Europol should enable Eurojust and the\nEuropean Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to have access to and be able to search\nagainst data available at Europol. \n(24)          \nEuropol should maintain cooperative relations\nwith other Union bodies, law enforcement authorities and law enforcement\ntraining institutes of third countries, international organisations, and\nprivate parties to the extent required for the accomplishment of its tasks.\n(25)          \nTo ensure operational effectiveness, Europol\nshould be able to exchange all information, with the exception of personal\ndata, with other Union bodies, law enforcement authorities and law enforcement\ntraining institutes of third countries, and international organisations to the\nextent necessary for the performance of its tasks. Since companies, firms, business associations, non-governmental\norganisations and other private parties hold expertise and data of direct\nrelevance to the prevention and combating of serious crime and terrorism,\nEuropol should also be able to exchange such data with\nprivate parties. To prevent and combat cybercrime, as related to network and\ninformation security incidents, Europol should, pursuant to Directive [name of\nadopted Directive] of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning\nmeasures to ensure a high common level of network and information security\nacross the Union,[31]\ncooperate and exchange information, with the exception of personal data, with\nnational\u00a0 authorities competent for the security of network and information\nsystems.\n(26)          \nEuropol should be able to exchange personal data\nwith other Union bodies to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of its\ntasks.\n(27)          \nSerious crime and terrorism often have links\nbeyond the territory of the EU. Europol should therefore be able to exchange\npersonal data with law enforcement authorities of third countries and with\ninternational organisations such as Interpol to the extent necessary for the\naccomplishment of its tasks. \n(28)          \nEuropol should be able to transfer personal data\nto an authority of a third country or an international organisation on the\nbasis of a Commission decision finding that the country or international\norganisation in question ensures an adequate level of data protection, or, in the absence of an adequacy decision, an international agreement concluded by the Union pursuant to\nArticle 218 of the Treaty, or a cooperation agreement\nconcluded between Europol and this third country prior to the entry into force\nof this Regulation. In view of Article 9 of Protocol 36 on transitional\nprovisions attached to the Treaty, legal effects of such agreements should be\npreserved until those agreements are repealed, annulled or amended in the\nimplementation of the Treaty.\n(29)          \nWhere a transfer of personal data cannot be\nbased on an adequacy decision taken by the Commission,\nor, an international agreement concluded by the Union, or an existing cooperation agreement, the Management Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor\nshould be allowed to authorise a transfer or a set of transfers , provided\nadequate safeguards are ensured. Where none of the above applies, the Executive\nDirector should be allowed to authorise the transfer of data in exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis, if it is necessary to\nsafeguard the essential interests of a Member State, to prevent an imminent\ndanger associated with crime or terrorism, if the transfer is otherwise\nnecessary or legally required on important public grounds, if the data subject\nhas consented, or if vital interests of the data subject are at stake. \n(30)          \nEuropol should be able to process personal data\noriginating from private parties and private persons only if transferred to\nEuropol by a Europol national unit of a Member State in accordance with its\nnational law or, by a contact point in a third country with which there is\nestablished cooperation through a cooperation agreement concluded in accordance\nwith Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA prior to the entry into force of this\nRegulation or an authority of a third country or an international organisation\nwith which the Union has concluded and international agreement pursuant to\nArticle 218 of the Treaty. \n(31)          \nAny information which has clearly been obtained\nby a third country or international organisation in violation of human rights\nshall not be processed.\n(32)          \nData protection rules at Europol should be\nstrengthened and draw on the principles underpinning Regulation (EC) No 45/2001[32] to ensure a high level of\nprotection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data. As\nDeclaration 21 attached to the Treaty recognizes the specificity of personal\ndata processing in the law enforcement context, the data protection rules of\nEuropol should be autonomous and aligned with other relevant data protection\ninstruments applicable in the area of police cooperation in the Union, in particular Convention No. 108[33]\nand Recommendation No R(87) of the Council of Europe[34] and Council Framework Decision\n2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of\npolice and judicial cooperation in criminal matters[35] [to be replaced by the\nrelevant Directive in force at the moment of adoption]. \n(33)          \nAs far as possible personal data should be\ndistinguished according to the degree of their accuracy and reliability. Facts should be distinguished from\npersonal assessments, in order\nto ensure both the protection of individuals and the quality and reliability of the information processed by\nEuropol.\n(34)          \nPersonal data relating to different categories\nof data subjects are processed in the area of police co-operation. Europol\nshould make distinctions between personal data of different categories of data\nsubjects as clear as possible. Personal data of persons such as victims,\nwitnesses, persons possessing relevant information as well as personal data of\nminors should in particular be protected. Therefore, Europol should not process\nthem unless it is strictly necessary for preventing and combating crime within\nits objectives, and if those data supplement other\npersonal data already processed by Europol.\n(35)          \nIn the light of fundamental rights to protection\nof personal data, Europol should not store personal data longer than necessary\nfor the performance of its tasks.\n(36)          \nTo guarantee the security of personal data,\nEuropol should implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.\n(37)          \nAny person should have a right of access to\npersonal data concerning them, to have inaccurate data concerning them\nrectified and to erase or block data concerning them, if the data is no longer\nrequired. The rights of the data subject and the exercise thereof should not\naffect the obligations placed on Europol and should be subject to the\nrestrictions laid down in this Regulation.\n(38)          \nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of\ndata subjects requires a clear attribution of the responsibilities under this\nRegulation. In particular, Member States should be responsible for accuracy and\nkeeping up to date the data they have transferred to Europol and for the\nlegality of such transfer. Europol should be responsible for accuracy and for\nkeeping the data provided by other data suppliers up to date. Europol should\nalso ensure that data are processed fairly and lawfully, are collected and\nprocessed for a specific purpose, that they are adequate, relevant, not\nexcessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, and stored\nno longer than is necessary for that purpose.\n(39)          \nEuropol should keep records of collection, alteration,\naccess, disclosure, combination or erasure of personal data for the purposes of\nverification of the lawfulness of the data processing, self-monitoring and\nensuring proper data integrity and security. Europol\nshould be obliged to co-operate\nwith the European Data Protection Supervisor and make the logs or documentation available upon request, so that they can be\nused for monitoring processing operations. \n(40)          \nEuropol should designate a data protection\nofficer to assist it in monitoring compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. The data protection\nofficer should be in a position to perform his/her duties and tasks\nindependently and effectively.\n(41)          \nNational competent authorities for the\nsupervision of the processing of personal data should monitor the lawfulness of\nthe processing of personal data by Member States. The European Data Protection\nSupervisor should monitor the lawfulness of data processing by Europol\nexercising its functions with complete independence.\n(42)          \nThe European Data Protection Supervisor and\nnational supervisory authorities should co-operate with each other on specific\nissues requiring national involvement and to ensure coherent application of\nthis Regulation throughout the Union.\n(43)          \nAs Europol is processing also non-operational\npersonal data, not related to any criminal investigations, processing of such\ndata should be subject to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n(44)          \nThe European Data Protection Supervisor should\nhear and investigate complaints lodged by data subjects. The investigation\nfollowing a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is\nappropriate in the specific case.\nThe supervisory authority should inform the data subject of progress and the outcome of the complaint within a\nreasonable period. \n(45)          \nAny individual should have the right to a\njudicial remedy against decisions of the European Data Protection Supervisor\nconcerning him/her. \n(46)          \nEuropol should be subject to general rules on\ncontractual and non-contractual liability applicable to Union institutions, agencies\nand bodies, with the exception of liability for unlawful data processing.\n(47)          \nIt may be unclear for the individual concerned\nwhether damage suffered as a result of unlawful data processing is a\nconsequence of action by Europol or by a Member State. Europol and the Member\nState in which the event that gave rise to the damage occurred should therefore be jointly and severally liable.\n(48)          \nTo ensure that Europol is a fully accountable\nand transparent internal organisation, it is necessary, in the light of Article\n88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to lay down\nprocedures for scrutiny of Europol activities by the European Parliament\ntogether with national Parliaments, taking into due account the need to\nsafeguard confidentiality of operational information.\n(49)          \nThe Staff Regulations of Officials of the\nEuropean Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the\nEuropean Communities laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68[36] should apply to Europol staff.\nEuropol should be able to employ staff engaged from the competent authorities\nof the Member States as temporary agents whose period of service should be\nlimited in order to maintain the principle of rotation, as the subsequent\nreintegration of staff members into the service of their competent authority\nfacilitates close cooperation between Europol and the competent authorities of\nthe Member States. Member States should take any measure necessary to ensure\nthat staff engaged at Europol as temporary agents may, at the end of this\nservice at Europol, return to the national civil service to which they belong.\n(50)          \nGiven the nature of the duties of Europol and\nthe role of the Executive Director, the Executive Director may be invited to\nmake a statement to and to answer questions from the competent committee of the\nEuropean Parliament before his appointment, as well as before any extension of\nhis term of office. The Executive Director should also present the annual\nreport to the European Parliament and to the Council. Furthermore, the European\nParliament\u00a0 should be able to invite the Executive Director to report on the\nperformance of his duties. \u00a0\n(51)          \nTo guarantee the full autonomy and independence\nof Europol, it should be granted an autonomous budget, with revenue coming\nessentially from a contribution from the budget of the Union. The Union\nbudgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Union contribution and\nany other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the Union are\nconcerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of\nAuditors.\n(52)          \nRegulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 on the\nfinancial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing\nCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (the Financial Regulation)[37] should apply to Europol.\n(53)          \nRegulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations\nconducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[38] should apply to Europol.\n(54)          \nEuropol processes data that require particular\nprotection as they include EU classified information and sensitive\nnon-classified information. Europol should therefore draw up rules on\nconfidentiality and processing of such information, taking into account the\nbasic principles and minimum standards laid down in Decision 2011/292/EU on the\nsecurity rules for protecting EU classified information.[39]\n(55)          \nIt is appropriate to evaluate the application of\nthis Regulation regularly.\n(56)          \nThe necessary provisions regarding accommodation\nfor Europol in the Member State in which it has its headquarters, in the\nNetherlands, and the specific rules applicable to all Europol\u2019s staff and\nmembers of their families should be laid down in a headquarters agreement.\nFurthermore, the host Member State should provide the best possible conditions\nto ensure the proper functioning of Europol, including schools for children and\ntransport, so as to attract high-quality human resources from as wide a\ngeographical area as possible.\n(57)          \nEuropol, as set up by this Regulation replaces\nand succeeds Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA and CEPOL as\nestablished by Decision 2005/681/JHA. It should therefore be a\nlegal successor of all their contracts, including employment contracts,\nliabilities and properties acquired. International agreements concluded by\nEuropol as established on the basis of Decision 2009/371/JHA and CEPOL as\nestablished on the basis of Decision 2005/681/JHA should remain\nin force, with the exception of the headquarters agreement concluded by CEPOL.\n(58)          \nTo enable Europol to continue to fulfil the tasks\nof Europol as established on the basis of Decision 2009/371/JHA and CEPOL as\nestablished by Decision 2005/681/JHA to the best of its\nabilities, transitional measures should be laid down, in particular with regard\nto the Management Board, the Executive Director and ring-fencing part of\nEuropol\u2019s budget for training for three years following the entry into force of\nthis Regulation.\n(59)          \nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely\nthe establishment of an entity responsible for law-enforcement cooperation and\ntraining at Union level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States\nand can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better\nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that\nArticle, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that\nobjective.\n(60)          \n[In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol\n(No 21) on the position of United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of\nFreedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member States have\nnotified their wish to participate in the adoption and application of this Regulation]\nOR [Without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of\nthe United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and\nJustice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, those Member States will not participate in\nthe adoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by or be subject to its\napplication]. \n(61)          \nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the\nProtocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European\nUnion and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not\ntaking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or\nsubject to its application.\n(62)          \nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights\nand observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the\nprotection of personal data and the right to privacy as protected by Articles 8\nand 7 of the Charter, as well as by Article 16 of the Treaty. \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nChapter\nI\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND\nOBJECTIVES OF EUROPOL\nArticle 1\nEstablishment of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation\nand Training \n1.                      \nA European Union Agency for Law Enforcement\nCooperation and Training (Europol) is hereby established to improve mutual\ncooperation among law enforcement authorities in the European Union, to\nstrengthen and support their actions as well as to deliver a coherent European\ntraining policy.\n2.                      \nEuropol, as established by this Regulation,\nshall replace and succeed Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA, and CEPOL\nas established by Decision 2005/681/JHA.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation: \n(a)                   \n\u2018the competent authorities of the Member States\u2019\nmeans all police authorities and other law enforcement services existing in the\nMember States which are responsible under national law for preventing and\ncombating criminal offences;\n(b)                   \n\u2018analysis\u2019 means the assembly, processing or use\nof data with the aim of assisting criminal investigations;\n(c)                   \n\u2018Union bodies\u2019 means institutions, entities,\nmissions, offices and agencies set up by, or on the basis of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;

action \n\u00a8 The\nproposal/initiative relates to a new action following a pilot\nproject/preparatory action[47]\n\n\u00a8 The proposal/initiative relates to the\nextension of an existing action \n\u00a8 The\nproposal/initiative relates to an action redirected towards a new action \n\n1.4.                \nObjective(s)\n1.4.1.          \nThe Commission\u2019s multiannual strategic\nobjective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\nThe European\nPolice Office (Europol) started as an intergovernmental body regulated by a Convention\nconcluded between the Member States that entered into force in 1999. As from 1\nJanuary 2010 Europol was transformed by Council Decision 2009/371/JHA into a\ndecentralised EU agency to support and strengthen action by the competent\nMember States\u2019 law enforcement authorities against serious and organised crime\nand terrorism. The Council Decision also defined in details Europol\u2019s\nobjectives and tasks.\nThe Treaty of\nLisbon has abolished the pillar structure of the European Union and aligned the\narea of police cooperation with the acquis communautaire. Article 88 of\nthe TFEU stipulates that Europol shall be governed by a regulation to be\nadopted by co-decision. It requires the establishment of procedures and a\nmechanism for the scrutiny of Europol\u2019s activities by the European Parliament\nand national parliaments. Furthermore, the Stockholm Programme[48], which lays down an EU\nmultiannual strategy on justice and security, calls on Europol to evolve and\nbecome \u201ca hub for information exchange between the law enforcement authorities\nof the Member States, a service provider and a platform for law enforcement\nservices.\u201d \nArticle\n87(2)(b) of the TFEU provides for measures concerning support for the training\nof staff and cooperation on the exchange of staff. The Stockholm Programme\nstates that it is essential to step up training on Union-related issues in\norder to foster a genuine European judicial and law enforcement culture, and\nthat the objective of systematic European Training Schemes should be pursued.\nThe Commission is accordingly proposing, alongside this proposal, a European\nLaw Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) which would build on the activities\ncurrently carried out by CEPOL. The current proposal would merge the two\nagencies and give the new (merged) agency the task of implementing the training\nscheme.\n\n1.4.2.          \nSpecific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies)\nconcerned \n\nABB Activity 18 05: Security and safeguarding liberties\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVE 3\nTo enhance law enforcement cooperation between Member States, in\nparticular through facilitation of the exchange of information between the law\nenforcement authorities, enabling access to relevant data while ensuring the\nrespect of data protection principles, and strengthening the role of Europol\nand Cepol as Member States partners in tackling serious crime and training\npolice officers\nMain policy outputs in 2013 - Regulation merging EUROPOL and CEPOL\nEuropol regulation:\nSpecific objective No.1:\nTo function as the principle support centre for law enforcement\noperations and for law enforcement expertise \nSpecific objective No.2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTo function as the EU criminal information hub \nSpecific objective No. 3:\nTo coordinate the implementation of EU policy on training for law\nenforcement officers and to deliver relevant EU-level training and exchanges\nSpecific objective No. 4:\nTo strengthen EU capacity to tackle cybercrime to avoid harm to EU\ncitizens. businesses and losses to the EU economy \nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nActivity 18 05: Security and Safeguarding liberties\n\n1.4.3.          \nExpected result(s) and impact\n\nSpecify the effects\nwhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\nEuropol\u2019s role is to provide support to national law enforcement\nservices in their mutual cooperation in the prevention of and fight against serious\ncrime and terrorism. The proposal, i.e. the regulation on Europol, provides for\na new legal framework for Europol. The introduction of the new legal basis will\nincrease the security of the EU by improving the effectiveness and efficiency\nof Europol in supporting the prevention and fight against serious cross-border\ncrime and terrorism as well as conferring on Europol new tasks in relation to\nlaw enforcement training at EU level, and in relation to the hosting of EU law\nenforcement centres on specific crime phenomena such as cybercrime.\nThe proposal aims to improve Europol\u2019s intelligence picture, so that\nit can better serve Member States and better inform the EU policy setting. It\nwill better align Europol and its activities with the requirements of the\nTreaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme. The proposal will further\nreinforce Europol\u2019s accountability and strengthen its data protection regime.\nEuropol will be able to provide all necessary and up-to-date services and\nproducts to Member States in order to facilitate and support them in the fight\nagainst serious criminality affecting the EU citizens. The increased flow of\ninformation from Member States including on cybercrime and the improved data\nprocessing arrangements balanced by a robust data protection regime and\nincreased training capabilities would further strengthen Europol\u2019s role in\nsupporting the Member States. \nData originating from private parties could be submitted to Europol\nby any Member State (Europol National Unit) which would diminish the risk of\ndelays or non-transmission. Exchanges of data with third countries will become\nmore streamlined which would have a positive impact on the cooperation and on\ninternal security in the EU and in the third countries. This would in turn\nenable a more coordinated global response to crime phenomena.\nThe proposal introduces a new task for Europol, incorporating and\nbroadening to some extent the tasks related to training of law enforcement\nofficials currently executed by CEPOL. Integrating and rationalising\noperational and training functions in one agency is expected to create a\nmutually-reinforcing dynamic. Resources saved through the elimination of\nduplication in support functions can be redeployed to training functions\nnotably to implement the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS). The\nhigher level of training thereby provided will raise the standard of policing\nacross the EU, enhance trust between law enforcement agencies, contribute to a\ncommon law enforcement culture and thereby make more effective the EU\u2019s\nresponse to common security challenges.\nFurthermore, the proposal will strengthen Europol\u2019s accountability\nand align Europol\u2019s governance with the other European regulatory agencies.\nThe proposal introduces a further new task for Europol, namely\nhosting the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) established at the beginning of\n2013. The EC3 will bolster significantly the EU\u2019s capacity to confront the\ngrowing threat posed by cybercrime, with a view to supporting and complementing\nMember States\u2019 efforts. Member States will benefit significantly from having a\nfocal point equipped with state-of-the-art technology and a highly-qualified\nand specialised workforce offering a wide spectrum of services and products.\nFurthermore, a forward-thinking centre that anticipates trends, analyses\nthreats and provides strategic guidance towards tackling cybercrime will be of\nsignificant added value to the Member States. EU agencies and bodies would also\nhave a bolstered capacity to address the challenges raised by cybercrime. \n\n1.4.4.          \nIndicators of results and impact \n\nSpecify the\nindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.\n\u2013              \nUser satisfaction regarding operational support\nprovided to operations or investigations;\n\u2013              \nPercentage of all SIENA messages sent by Member\nStates shared with Europol;\n\u2013              \nVolume and quality of information sent by each\nMember State in relation to overall volume and quality of information sent by\nMember States;\n\u2013              \nNumber of investigations supported by Europol;\n\u2013              \nNumber of cross-match reports delivered;\n\u2013              \nNumber of operational analysis reports\ndelivered;\n\u2013              \nNumber of joint investigations, in specific the\nJITs supported by Europol;\n\u2013              \nNumber of SIENA requests and for information\nmessages sent by Europol to external partners;\n\u2013              \nNumber of SIENA requests and for information\nmessages sent by external partners to Europol;\n\u2013              \nNumber of SIENA cases initiated;\n\u2013              \nNumber of suspects identified, arrested and\nprosecuted in the Member States;\n\u2013              \nNumber of support given on technical and/or\nforensic issues (incl. on-the-spot);\n\u2013              \nNumber of staff trained;\n\u2013              \nQuality of strategic products (detail, scope,\nanalytical method).\nIn relation to training:\n\u2013              \nNumber of needs analyses;\n\u2013              \nNumber of quality assurance products;\n\u2013              \nNumber of common curricula;\n\u2013              \nNumber of training (and e-training) modules;\n\u2013              \nNumber of course delivered;\n\u2013              \nNumber of exchanges organised;\n\u2013              \nUser satisfaction.\nFinally, the following main indicators can be used for evaluating\nthe impact of the activities of EC3:\n\u2013              \nThe extent of the EC3\u2019s contribution to\ndismantling cybercrime networks through successful cross-border operations\ncoordinated and/or supported by the EC3 (on the basis of the number of suspects\nidentified, arrested and prosecuted and number of victims identified)\n\u2013              \nThe strategic and/or operational impact at EU\nand Member State level of the EC3\u2019s threat and risk assessments/trend\nforecasts;\n\u2013              \nIncrease in the amount of personnel (law\nenforcement or otherwise) who receive specialised cybercrime training; \n\u2013              \nExtent to which new technological tools\ninitiated, coordinated or developed by the EC3 are used during EC3 operations\nand/or by the Member States;\n\u2013              \nExtent to which public private partnership\ninitiatives facilitated EC3 work;\n\u2013              \nOverall satisfaction rate of Member States\nregarding all of EC3\u2019s products and services.\n\n1.5.                \nGrounds for the proposal/initiative \n1.5.1.          \nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or long\nterm \n\nThe reform of Europol subscribes to a wider process of achieving an\nOpen and Secure Europe Serving and Protecting Citizens, as set forth by the\nStockholm Programme. Among other means to fulfil this objective, the Stockholm\nProgramme calls for Europol to \u201cbecome a hub for information exchange between\nthe law enforcement authorities of the Member States, a service provider and a\nplatform for law enforcement services\u201d. The role of Europol in the support for\nthe law enforcement authorities within Member States, and its overall future\ndirection, is therefore subject to a strong inter-institutional consensus. \nAt the same time, following the Treaty of Lisbon and the Joint\nStatement on the Regulatory Agencies, Europol\u2019s activities will need to be\nsubject to a regular scrutiny by the European Parliament and the national\nparliaments and its governance will need to be aligned with the standards for\nall EU regulatory agencies.\nFurthermore, as regards data protection, Europol\u2019s data protection\nregime standards need to be further aligned with those of other data protection\ninstruments and the right of access of individuals to personal data pertaining\nto them needs to be reinforced by providing for an alternative procedure for\nchecking the lawfulness of the processing of personal data.\nThe higher level of law enforcement training that will be brought\nabout by this proposal will raise the standard of policing across the EU,\ncontribute to enhance trust between law enforcement agencies, contribute to a\ncommon law enforcement culture, and thereby make more effective the EU\u2019s\nresponse to common security challenges.\nWhereas the phenomenon of cybercrime is growing and is increasingly\ncomplex, prior to the establishment of the EC3, the EU has not had an adequate\ncapacity to tackle cybercrime due to the fact that cybercrime is extremely\ncomplex, evolves very rapidly and requires a high-level technical expertise to\nunderstand its characteristics and modus operandi, but also due to insufficient\nflow of information. High-skilled expertise gained at national and the EU level\nneeds to be exchanged among all Member States so that the EU can improve its\nresponse to cybercrime, a phenomenon which is inherently of a cross-border\nnature and therefore requiring cooperation. \n\n1.5.2.          \nAdded value of EU involvement\n\nLaw enforcement cooperation within the EU cannot exist without an\neffective exchange of information and intelligence on crime between national\nlaw enforcement authorities and other relevant entities within and outside the\nEU. The access to, sharing and analysis of relevant and up-to-date criminal\ninformation is critical for the effective fight against crime. Europol is\nideally placed to support the cooperation in this area and guarantee coordination\nat the EU level. \nEffective prevention and the fight against cross-border crime cannot\nbe successfully conducted by national police forces alone. It requires a\ncoordinated and collaborative approach together with public and private\nstakeholders across the EU. Europol is the only EU agency supporting law\nenforcement agencies in the Member States in this endeavour. It provides them\nwith a unique set of operational services to fight serious cross-border crime\n(i.a.: criminal analyses, forensic and operational support to cross-border\ninvestigations). However, the current legislative set-up prevents Europol from\nbeing fully effective and equipping Member States with the necessary, complete\nand up-to-date tools. Such legislative set-up can be amended only through a\nlegislative reform at the EU level. It cannot be carried out at a national,\nregional or local level or addressed by Europol itself through internal action.\nIn addition, the Treaty of Lisbon calls for establishing a mechanism\nof the parliamentary scrutiny over Europol\u2019s activities and the Joint Statement\non Regulatory Agencies requires aligning Europol\u2019s governance with the one of\nother EU agencies. This requires an EU legislative intervention.\nThe added value of EU involvement in law enforcement training is to\nensure a coordinated approach developing and implementing such training. Much\nis already done in this field, whether nationally by Member States or at\nEU-level by CEPOL. However, as explained in the accompanying Communication on a\nEuropean Law Enforcement Training Scheme, more needs to be done e.g. to ensure\nthat training responds to needs relating to crime topics prioritised at EU\nlevel and to ensure a coherent approach to deliver training at EU level\naccording to the highest quality standards.\nThe EC3 is established in order to overcome the many obstacles for\nthe effective investigation of cybercrime and prosecution of offenders at the\nEU level. It is a key step taken in the EU\u2019s overall strategy to improve\ncyber-security and to render cyberspace an area of justice where human rights\nand fundamental freedoms are guaranteed through the cooperative efforts of all\nstakeholders.\n\n1.5.3.          \nLessons learned from similar experiences in the\npast\n\nThe external evaluation of the Europol Council Decision has provided\nfood for thought on improving the effectiveness of Europol. It has confirmed\nthat Europol is a well-functioning agency which is operationally relevant and\nadds value to the security of the European citizens. Nevertheless, the\nevaluation identified a number of areas where improvements are needed. The\nconsultations with the external stakeholders on the reform of Europol and a\nnumber of annual and specific reports by Europol contributed to a clear\nunderstanding of what shall be changed in Europol. The recurring issues were:\ninsufficient provision of information by Member States, legal restrictions on\ndirect cooperation with the private sector and a rigid legal regime on the\ncooperation with the third countries (which, nota bene, will need to be\nchanged as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon). \nIn a wider context, the access to and the sharing of relevant and\nup-to-date criminal information among law enforcement agencies has proven to be\ncritical for successfully tackling cross-border crime. This has been confirmed\nby the implementation of a number of the EU measures like, e.g. the \u201cPr\u00fcm\nFramework Decision\u201d, and the \u201cSwedish Initiative\u201d Framework Decision.\nAs regards training, the accompanying Communication on a European\nLaw Enforcement Training Scheme draws on a mapping exercise undertaken by CEPOL\nin 2012 as well as extensive consultations with experts from Member States and\nfrom JHA agencies. The results indicated a need for a more coordinated\napproach, including a strong role for an EU agency as driving force and\ncoordinator for implementing the Scheme, in close cooperation with other\nagencies and national training academies. CEPOL has been the subject of a\nfive-year evaluation completed in 2011 and an external study commissioned by\nthe Commission to support preparation of an impact assessment. The results\nindicated needs for increasing training on EU dimensions of policing, for\nbetter coordination between CEPOL, Member States and other agencies, and for\nimprovements in CEPOL\u2019s current governance and structure.\nMoreover, the technical sophistication required to tackle cybercrime\ncomprehensively means that traditional ways of investigating this kind of crime\nare not sufficient. Without a high-level of IT training of the law enforcement\nservices to understand the intricacies of the technology involved, the new\nlandscape of digital forensics and the ability to keep up with rapidly changing\ntechnology and modus operandi of cybercriminals, the EU\u2019s capacity to tackle\ncybercrime adequately will continue to lag behind. Fast-changing technology has\nto be matched with fast-developing technological tools to employ in the fight\nagainst cybercrime as well as with personnel capable of adapting and building\nupon previous knowledge and expertise.\n\n1.5.4.          \nCompatibility and possible synergy with other\nappropriate instruments\n\nThe regulation on Europol, making it the criminal intelligence hub\nof Europe, will contribute to achieving an Open and Secure EU Serving and\nProtecting Citizens, as set forth by the Stockholm Programme. Bringing together\noperational and training functions in a single agency will create a\nmutually-reinforcing dynamic that will enhance the effectiveness of operational\nactivity and the relevance and focus of EU training.\nIn addition, an effective Europol will be in a better position to\nassist in reaching the goals of the Commission\u2019s Communication on The Internal\nSecurity Strategy In Action and to reinforce in general police cooperation in\nthe EU.\nGovernance of Europol as proposed contributes to the overall\ncoherence of the governance model of the EU agencies envisaged in the Joint\nStatement on the EU Regulatory Agencies. The establishment of the parliamentary\nscrutiny of Europol\u2019s activities and new means of cooperation with third\ncountries align Europol with the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon (which\nmake the Commission, rather than Europol, competent to negotiate international\ninformation sharing agreements).\nThe proposal seeks also to define clearly the limits of the\ncompetence of Europol, to avoid duplications with the other JHA agencies and to\nstreamline their cooperation with Europol. To reinforce this process, the\nsolutions proposed in the regulation (e.g. on requests to member States to\ninitiate criminal investigations, keeping Eurojust informed) would need to be\nmirrored in the legal bases of other agencies (e.g. of Eurojust) over time.\n\n1.6.                \nDuration and financial impact \n\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY\n\u00fe Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from 2013\nfor the EC3 and from 2015 for the reform of Europol and integration of training\nactivities,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n\n1.7.                \nManagement mode(s) envisaged[49] \n\n\u00fe Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies \n\u2013     \n\u00fe\u00a0 bodies set up by the European Union[50] \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission \n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u201cComments\u201d section.\nComments \nThe figures\non financial and human resources combine the foreseen total amount for Europol\nas it is planned for the period until 2020 with the additional financial needs\nwhich are necessary to implement the proposed wider mandate for Europol,\nincluding training, as described in the present form.\n\n2.                      \nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.                \nMonitoring and reporting rules \n\nSpecify frequency\nand conditions.\nMonitoring and evaluating the implementation of the activities of\nthe Agency will be important to ensure the effectiveness of Europol. In\naccordance with the Joint Statement on the EU regulatory agencies, Europol will\naccompany its activities included in its working programme by key performance\nindicators. The activities of Europol will be then measured against these\nindicators in the Annual Activity Report. \nIn addition to the horizontal governance rules applicable to\nagencies, Europol will in particular elaborate an annual report and there will\nbe provision for a periodic overall evaluation to be commissioned by the\nCommission every 5 years. \nTo regularly monitor the provision of information by the Member\nStates, Europol will report annually to the European Parliament and the Council\non the performance of each individual Member State. Such reports will contain\nspecific quantitative and qualitative indicators and demonstrate trends. \nThe proposal lays down also the rules on the scrutiny of Europol\u2019s\nactivities by the European Parliament and national parliaments, i.e. ultimately\non the implementation of Europol\u2019s work programme and the execution of the\nbudget. \nThe Management Board of Europol will be responsible for supervision\nof the administrative operational and budgetary efficient management of the\nAgency. \n\n2.2.                \nManagement and control system \n2.2.1.          \nRisk(s) identified \n\nActivities of criminals are currently more complex, diverse and\ninternational than ever before. Large scale criminal and terrorist networks\npose a significant threat to the internal security of the EU and its citizens.\nCriminal activities have become more and more multi-commodity, poly-criminal\nand cross-border of nature. The national law enforcement forces cannot longer\nwork in isolation but need to cooperate with each other and with Europol,\ndesigned to be the criminal intelligence hub of the EU. Reinforcement of\nEuropol\u2019s staff is necessary to comply with the new tasks and requirements laid\ndown in the new regulation. Redeployment opportunities within the existing\nstaff have been fully exploited. Lack of provision of the requested new posts\nwill result in permanent infringement of the applicable Union law and a\ncompromised level of internal security in the EU.\n\n2.2.2.          \nControl method(s) envisaged \n\nEuropol will be subject to the following controls: budgetary\ncontrol, internal audit, annual reports by the European Court of Auditors, the\nannual discharge for the execution of the EU budget and possible investigations\nconducted by OLAF to ensure, in particular, that the resources allocated to\nagencies are put to proper use. The activities of Europol will also be subject\nto the supervision of the Ombudsman in accordance with Article 228 of the\nTreaty. These administrative controls provide a number of procedural safeguards\nto ensure that account is taken of the interests of the stakeholders. \n\n2.3.                \nMeasures to prevent fraud and irregularities \n\nSpecify existing or\nenvisaged prevention and protection measures.\nIn order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities,\nthe provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 shall apply without restriction\nto the Agency, as stipulated in Article 21 of the Regulation.\n\n3.                      \nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n3.1.                \nHeading(s) of the multiannual financial\nframework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\n\u00b7      Existing budget lines \nIn order of\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Heading\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.

It is recognised by the Commission\u2019s and RAND\u2019s analysis\nas fundamental to the success of the EC3. \nIn its Communication to the Council and European Parliament, the\nCommission stated:\n\u201cAn information fusion function would ensure information collection\non cybercrime from the widest array of public, private and open sources,\nenriching available police data\u201d and the Council\nnotes in its Conclusions that it should be \u201cthe focal point in the fight\nagainst cybercrime in the Union, contributing to faster reactions in the case\nof cyber attacks\u201d. \nServices\nThe set of services provided by Data Fusion can be clustered as\nfollows. For each one of them, it is indicated if it is a new task for Europol\nor the improvement of an existing one:\n1.                      \nNEW TASK - Bridge\nthe current gaps in the information available from the communities responsible\nfor cyber-security and for tacking cybercrime. One of the action will be to\nimprove the requirements to report cybercrime offences to national law\nenforcement authorities;\n2.                      \nNEW TASK -\nProvide an oversight for Member States on significant cases and investigations\nin the EU, in order to enable preventive or investigative coordination to\nmaximise the outcome and minimise the investment of resources;\n3.                      \nNEW TASK \u2013 Pro\nactively scan the environment, identifying new threats as they emerge, updating\nstakeholders accordingly;\n4.                      \nNEW TASK -\nProvide a 24/7 Cybercrime Help Desk for MS\u2019 law enforcement units;\n5.                      \nNEW TASK \u2013\nCoordinate the EUROPOL-CERT activities in order to enhance the information\nexchange with the CERT community;\nResources\nEuropol does not have the very specific profile in house to perform\ndata fusion function. That is why this part of the EC3 has to be prioritized\nfor in 2014 and 2015. In 2013, and until the full\nallocation of staff, work-a-rounds are introduced to build a very basic data\nfusion service. This will not form a long term solution and optimum service\nexpected of the EC3 by the Commission, Council and MS and other stakeholders.\n2014 (+ 1 AD5) = 4 TA \nIn 2014, data fusion staff will focus on tasks 1, 4 and 5 above.\nTask 2 and 3 will be started but await 2015 to be at full potential.\n2015 (+ 7 AD5) = 11 TA\nThe additional staff requested for 2015 is the minimum necessary to\nbring this crucial service to an acceptable level. The additional staff\nrequested in 2015 will bring Data Fusion to cruise speed. It will help to\nensure the fulfillment of the minimum requirements expressed by the Commission\nand the Council. As Data Fusion should function on a 24/7 basis, 8 FTEs + 1\nteam leader is the minimum staffing level required to man a 24/7 service. The\nremaining 2 FTEs will focus on tasks 1, 2 and 3.\n2016 \u2013 2019 (+ 1 AD5) = 12 TA\nThe aim is to reach a staffing level of 12 TA in 2019, ensuring a\nproper support across all tasks, and already capitalizing on the upward trends\nin the volume and number of cyber information.\n\n2.                      \nOPERATIONS\n\nDefinition\nOperations coordinate high profile cross\nborder operations (or investigations), provide operational analysis and\nsupport, technical and digital forensic examinations in the Lab and\non-the-spot. \nIt delivers high-level technical,\nanalytical and forensic expertise in joint investigations of cybercrime cases\nand strives to support the best possible outcome and facilitate liaison with\nLaw Enforcement outside the EU. \nIn close cooperation with EUROJUST and\nINTERPOL, it supports and coordinates complex transnational cases in order to\navoid the overlapping and duplication of efforts among the cybercrime units in\nthe Member States and partner countries. \nServices\nThe set of services provided by Operations can be clustered as\nfollows. For each one of them, it is indicated if it is a new task for Europol\nor the improvement of an existing one:\n1.                      \nIMPROVEMENT \u2013\nAnalysis of EC3 information in order to support MS operations and to facilitate\nthe delivery of operational intelligence. This supports high profile\ninvestigations/ operations, complex transnational cases and Joint Investigation\nTeams;\n2.                      \nIMPROVEMENT -\nTechnical support delivered on the spot or from Europol headquarters to MS.\nThis can be done through the use of a mobile toolkit, allowing analysts and/or\nspecialists to provide direct forensic support to ongoing investigations. It\ncan also be done through the use of the Cyber Forensic Lab at Europol HQ;\n3.                      \nIMPROVEMENT - Coordination\nof operations by organising operational meetings, supporting Joint\nInvestigation Teams, and assistance in the delivery of EMPACT priorities on\ncybercrime, online child sexual exploitation and payment card fraud.\nResources\n2014 (+ 7 AD5) = 28 TA \n2015 (+ 10 AD5) = 38 TA\n2016-2019 (+10 AD5) = 48 TA\nThe resource\nallocation for Operations is closely based on the RAND Europe feasibility study\nwhich provided the basis for the Commission\u2019s Communication on the\nestablishment of EC3. Essentially, RAND\u2019s resource allocation at the end of\n2014 is contingent upon the scale of cybercrime and the number of cases\nsupported.\nCognizant that\nthe information flow coming in through Europol\u2019s Secure Information Exchange\nNetwork Application (SIENA) system has significantly increased over the course\nof the last two years, data trends on the use of SIENA\nclearly indicates that there has been a mild increase\nin the number of requests sent and received (14%) by Europol and a significant\nincrease in the number of high-profile operations (HPO) supported by Europol\nthrough TWINS, TERMINAL and CYBORG (62%). There is indeed a growing need for\ncapacity to ensure that the specialised units have sufficient human capital to\ncontinue providing the necessary high-quality criminal intelligence analysis\nfor cybercrime matters. \nIn 2012, 17 TA\nwere supporting 44 high profile operations and 2593 operational requests. This\ngave a ratio of less than 1 TA dealing with 2 high profile operations and 153\noperational requests. This is partially addressed with\nan addition of 4 TA in 2013, but as the number of cases continues to increase\nand as high profile operations require continuous\nsupport for duration of 6 to 24 months, Operations\nremains understaffed. \nThe below table\nshows a projection of the support level provided by Operations until 2019,\nproviding that the number of requests continues to grow at the same rate and\nthat the number of high profile operations will stabilise around 100 from 2014\nonwards.\n   || 2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 || 2019 \n Nr of TA || 17 || 21 || 28 || 38 || 40 || 43 || 46 || 48 \n Nr of request || 2593 || 2956 || 3369 || 3841 || 4379 || 4992 || 5691 || 6488 \n Ratio request/ TA || 153 || 141 || 120 || 101 || 109 || 116 || 124 || 135 \n Nr of HPO || 44 || 71 || 100 || 100 || 100 || 100 || 100 || 100 \n Ratio TA/ high profile operation || 0.39 || 0.29 || 0.28 || 0.38 || 0.40 || 0.43 || 0.46 || 0.48 \nThis tables\nshows that the increase of staffing will not significantly improve the\noperational support. It will mainly keep it on a reasonable level. As a high profile operation (HPO) requires continuous support for\nduration of 6 to 24 months, prioritisation in all\nmandated areas will continue when a case is submitted. This will still\nlead to the delivery of a basic service to cases that would normally necessitate fully fledged support. \nIt is\nworthwhile to note that capitalising on this upward trend of cybercrime-related\nworkload the benchmark for full-time equivalent posts (FTEs) would be more\nthan 70 TA in Operations in 2014 based on the approach employed in the RAND\nFeasibility Study. \nIn that regard,\nwith a request of 48 TA augmented by 2 to 6 SNEs in 2019 (depending on\nthe MS capabilities), Europol\u2019s approach is more than reasonable when trying to\nmeet the EU citizen expectation in a time of budget austerity.\nThe requested\nposts are specialists and analysts spread across the EC3 mandated\nareas.\nNon-operational areas of EC3\nAlthough the\ncore EC3 activity will be operational, the Commission and the Council have\nunderlined the need to establish wider partnerships in tackling cybercrime not\nonly with the competent services but also with other public and private bodies.\nThe Council in\nits conclusions,\n\u201cEMPHASISES\nthe importance of ensuring that the European Cybercrime Centre cooperates\nclosely with other relevant agencies and actors such as Eurojust, CEPOL,\nInterpol, ENISA, the wider computer emergency response team (CERT) community\nand not least the private sector, to broaden in practice the information\npicture and exchange of best practices on cybercrime in Europe;\nEMPHASISES\nthe need to ensure that the European Cybercrime Centre cooperates closely with\nthe existing Union\u2019s fora dealing with cybercrime, and that the Centre supports\nthe activities and makes use of the expertise within these fora;\u201d\n\n3.                      \nR&D, FORENSIC and TRAINING\n\nDefinition \nR&D-Forensic-Training\nis devoted to research on technical threat analysis and vulnerability scanning,\nstatic forensics, best practice and training, and tool development. It\ncoordinates a cost effective approach to take advantage of synergies with other\nplayers like the EU\u2019s JRC.\nIt develops\nhigh-level digital forensic and related capabilities for the purposes of\ndeployment in support of Member States\u2019 investigations. \nIt designs and\nmanages the delivery of cyber related training in close cooperation with CEPOL\nand ECTEG as well as with private companies and research bodies. \nServices\nThe set of services provided by R&D-Forensic-Training can be\nclustered as follows. For each one of them, it is indicated if it is a new task\nfor Europol or the improvement of an existing one:\n1.                      \nNEW - A central\ngathering of MS requirements for forensic tools, in order to make best use of\nEU funds (e.g. FP7 programme) to develop these much needed tools and distribute\nthem to MS competent authorities.\n2.                      \nIMPROVEMENT - An\naccredited forensic capability providing state-of-the-art solutions such as a\nhigh-end decryption, recovery and analysis of operational information extracted\nfrom computers, digital devices or digitally-stored media.

All competent services have forensic laboratories but\nfor some most complex analysis Europol\nexperience is often requested but the majority\nof cases are seeking external support from\nspecialised laboratories outside law enforcement. With adequate resourcing the\nEC3 can provide these services. On top of this, MS laboratories face an\nexplosion in digital evidence analysis up to the point where some labs have\nmore then 2 years of backlog. Through centralisation the EC3 laboratory will\ndeliver techniques and reports in advance forensics, in-house and on-the spot\nthat would support the MS digital evidence collection in a fast manner. This\nteam will use advanced techniques found by European R&D to provide more\nefficient tools to investigators. To staff the laboratory envisaged for the EC3,\n3 Senior Specialists are required in 2014 to cover the basic areas of\nexpertise, digital forensics, mobile forensics, network forensics and Malware\nreserve engineering. \nTraining: +\n1 specialist AD5\nIn its\ncommunication, the Council confirms that \u201cthe European\nCybercrime Centre should serve as the European cybercrime information focal\npoint, that it should pool cybercrime expertise to support Member States in\ncapacity building and that it should provide support to cybercrime\ninvestigations in Member States\u201d\nAlthough\ntraining and capacity building will be carried out in cooperation with CEPOL\nand other partners, 1 specialist training coordinator will be needed to carry\nout these activities. It is the minimum staffing level\nto ensure coordinated development and delivery of training and\nawareness-raising initiatives of Law Enforcement, judicial authorities and the\nprivate sector. This staff will also be responsible to propose harmonisation of\nprocedures in cyber law enforcement, to make sure that all collected evidence\nin a MS is recognised in another MS and accepted by all courts. \n2015 (+ 1 AD5 and 1 AD7) = 9 TA\nR&D: + 1\nspecialist AD5\nThe number of\npotential EU projects will continue to grow. This will trigger the need for one\nadditional specialist to identify initiatives of interest for EC3 and\nthe MS. The coordination of demand for research\nand development activities in the EU regarding cyber crime in liaison with\nENLETS will be essential for law enforcement to benefit from research in a\nsound, cost effective and fast tools and knowledge to fight the ever growing\ndemand. EC3 will then be able to propose sound and useful project to the\nHorizon 2020 program. The growing demand to participate in R&D consortia as\nadvisory will be fulfilled by this staff. \nForensic: +\n1 senior specialist AD7\nThe recruitment\nof a highly skilled staff member will allow for the growing of the quality of\nforensic analysis. By 2015 it will be necessary to ensure that all forensic\nactivities conducted in the lab would continue. It will ensure the delivery of\naccredited high level forensic solutions as soon as possible in 2015 (setting\nup a decryption platform, ISO 17020 accreditation for the Cyber lab). This\nperson will coordinate forensic activities and be digital forensic crime scene\ncoordinator for important cyber operations where decisions have to be made\nencompassing different forensic work streams.\n2016-2019: (+1AD6 +2AD5) = 12 TA\nThe additional staff will ensure proper coordination of new training\nactivities, in depth forensic activities and larger scope for support of EU\nR&D projects.\n\n4.                      \nSTRATEGY-PREVENTION-OUTREACH\n\nDefinition \nStrategy-Prevention-Outreach conducts trend\nanalysis, early warning and horizon scanning, crime\nprevention and policy work, strategic planning and stakeholder management. \nAs the vast majority of relevant\ninformation is held outside of the Law Enforcement\u2019s remit, it engages in\nbuilding trust and confidence between the private sector and Law Enforcement\nauthorities, benefiting from key partnerships with the CERTs and ENISA,\nmilitary and security services, civil society organisations and other\nstakeholders in the areas of cybercrime, online child sexual exploitation and\nonline fraud.\nIt acts as a gathering point for European\ncybercrime investigators, providing them with a collective voice when\nconversing with private partners, academia and citizens.\nStrategy-Prevention-Outreach will give EC3\na privileged position between public and private\nsectors, which will enable it to have a better measurement of the cybercrime\nlandscape in real time as well as in a strategic and forward-looking scenario\ndesign. \nServices\nThe set of services provided by Strategy-Prevention-Outreach can be clustered as follows. For each one of them, it is indicated if\nit is a new task for Europol or the improvement of an existing one:\n1.                      \nIMPROVEMENT:\nPerform strategic analysis through production of the EU\u2019s threat assessment on\ncybercrime, online child sexual exploitation, payment card fraud and related\nonline threats; specialised thematic assessments on emerging trends, criminal\nmethods and facilitators; future-oriented scanning of technological and other\nexternal developments, with a view to identifying potential risks,\nvulnerabilities and key issues for policy makers and legislators.\n2.                      \nIMPROVEMENT: Ensure\ncybercrime prevention in cooperation with relevant parties, to promote\nexisting,\u00ad\u00ad and contribute to developing, prevention and awareness raising\ninitiatives in the field of cybercrime, online child sexual exploitation,\npayment card fraud and other online threats; scanning for vulnerabilities and\nprocedural gaps, in order to inform policy and product development which is\nsafer by design.\n3.                      \nIMPROVEMENT:\nEstablish and maintain trusted relationships within the LE community (EMPACT,\nCIRCAMP, EUCTF, VGT); manage operational links between the EC3 and the ELO\nnetwork, ensuring proper communication and engagement; establish of\nmulti-sector trust networks involving LE, industry, academia and civil society\norganisations, with the aim of improving operational and strategic responses to\ncybercrime.\n4.                      \nNEW: Become the\ncollective voice of cybercrime investigators in the EU: communicate EU views,\npositions and results in the area of cybercrime; become the EU Central Office\nfor Cybercrime; coordinate EU Member States and EU agencies\u2019 inputs to Internet\ngovernance and promote standardisation of approaches and adoption of good\npractice in the field of cybercrime.\n5.                      \nNEW: Manage and\ndevelop an online collaboration platform (SPACE), which allows an easier exchange and\nsharing of strategic and technical knowledge and expertise between LE and the\nprivate sector in the areas of cybercrime, online child\nsexual exploitation, and online fraud.\n6.                      \nNEW: Deliver\ntailored newsfeeds on emerging\ncriminal trends, technological developments and other relevant information as\nit develops.

Varying significantly from the traditional strategic analysis post\nat Europol which uses mainly Law Enforcement information, cybercrime information is very often derived from active partnership with\nbodies such as Academia, scientific researchers and\ninsurance companies, and is used to predict trends and threats of Cybercrime\nand guide the strategy in this field. For this reason, this post requires a\nvery different set of competencies to the ones traditionally requested for Europol analysts. The capacity to\nproduce accurate threat assessments and orient the strategy in Cybercrime is a\nkey factor of success for EC3\u2019s activities. Senior level is required to provide\nguidance within the team to ensure the delivery of coherent and targeted\nanalysis products of an adequate quality level.\nOutreach: + 2 specialists AD5\nThe Council\nConclusions also justify the need for staff to implement the necessary outreach\nand communication activities for EC3. Most of the information on cybercrime\ncomes from sources outside Law Enforcement. If the EC3 has the ambition to be a\nreference point in this field and provide added value to the operational\nactivities, it is necessary to build strong relations and cooperation with\nother partners with an interest in cybercrime. To support this activity 1\noutreach specialist is required in 2014. \nIn addition, to facilitate the communication between cybercrime\nspecialists, the Secure Platform for Accredited Cybercrime Experts (SPACE) will\nhave to realise its full\npotential. 1 specialist is needed in 2014 to manage the content and\nmoderate the platform. Furthermore, this specialist will be involved in the\norganisation of cybercrime related events, including the annual\nInterpol/Europol Cybercrime Conference.\n2015 (+ 1 AD5 and 1 AD6) = 10 TA\nStrategy: + 1\nsenior specialist AD6\nGiven the\ncomplexity and diversity of the cybercrime domain an additional resource is\nneeded to monitor the strategic spectrum and to deliver high-quality, forward\nlooking assessments. A strong focus of this work will be put on prevention with\na multi-disciplinary approach that includes all relevant partners, both at\npolicy and operational level. To cover this area 1 senior specialist AD7 is\nrequired.\nOutreach: + 1 specialist AD5\nAn additional\nspecialist will be hired to augment the scope of the EC3 outreach activities\nwhilst the centre will be at cruising speed. The work of this specialist will\nnot only include the relationship management with private and public partners,\nbut also the pro-active provision of information as input for the communication\nto internal and various external audiences based on the work done and\nexperience gained in EC3.\n2016-2019: (+ 2 AD5) = 12 TA\nThe additional staff will improve the quality and the delivery rate\nof strategic analysis products. They will also support the improvement of the\noutreach activities of the centre.\n\n5.                      \nManagement\n\nThere will be only two additional TAs between 2014 and 2019. One\npost is the replacement of an AD12 position provided by Europol to manage the\ncentre. \nThe other one corresponds of a set of new task linked to the\nstrategic activities of the EC3: \n\u2013                        \nNEW: chairing and\ncoordinating the EC3 programme board activities\n\u2013                        \nNEW: managing the\nadvisory groups created in the framework of the EC3 programme board\n\u2013                        \nNEW: providing\ncoordination and secretariat to CIRCAMP, VGT, EUCTF, EFC, ECTEG\nOn top of the management of these tasks, this position will ensure\nproper operational and administrative coordination between all EC3\ncapabilities.
