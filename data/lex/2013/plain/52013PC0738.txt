The EEA EFTA Member States would like\nto be associated as closely as possible with the work of the European Chemicals\nAgency in this regard and the EEA EFTA Member States will not only comply with\nthe Regulation, but would also like to contribute actively to the work foreseen\nunder Regulation 528/2012. The draft EEA Joint Committee Decision (annexed to\nthe proposed Council Decision) has been drafted with this in mind.\nThe Commission wishes to stress certain\nfeatures of the draft EEA Joint Committee Decision.\nThe entry into force of this Joint\nCommittee Decision in Liechtenstein will come later than the date of entry into\nforce in the other EFTA states. \nLiechtenstein has\nan agreement with Switzerland on biocidal products. Based on this Agreement, Switzerland processes the Liechtenstein applications and Liechtenstein authorises (or prohibits) the\nbiocidal product in question. \nSwitzerland will\nalign in the near future its legislation in this field to the new developments\nin the EU (Regulation 528/2012) and in the light of this, the Agreement between\n Liechtenstein and Switzerland laying down the cooperation in the field of\nauthorisation procedures for biocidal products will be updated. \nThis solution ensures a high level of\nprotection of both human and animal health and the environment, while\nguaranteeing the proper functioning of the internal market, explicitly\nmentioned as one of the objectives of the Regulation.\nIn this context, it has to be emphasised\nthat the suggested solution does not prohibit the placing on the market of\nbiocidal products and does not infringe any of the freedoms guaranteed by the\nEEA Agreement, in particular not the free movement of goods. This also does not\nresult in any distortion of competition within the EEA.\nMoreover, the EFTA side proposes\nadaptations in particular in relation to the participation of the EFTA states\nin the work of the coordination group under Article 35 of Regulation 528/2012\nand the process of granting Union authorisations and corresponding decisions in\nthe EFTA states.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the\nmaking available on the market and use of biocidal products is to be\nincorporated into the EEA Agreement. \nThe Commission submits the Draft Decision\nof the EEA Joint Committee for adoption by the Council of the corresponding Union\u2019s position. The Commission would hope to be able to present it in the EEA Joint\nCommittee at the earliest possible opportunity.\n2013/0354 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\non the position to be adopted,
