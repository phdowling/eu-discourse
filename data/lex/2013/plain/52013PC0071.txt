The financial sector has played a major role in causing the economic\ncrisis whilst governments and European citizens at large have borne the cost.\nThere is a strong consensus within Europe and internationally that the\nfinancial sector should contribute more fairly given the costs of dealing with\nthe crisis and the current under-taxation of the sector. Several EU Member\nStates have already taken divergent action in the area of financial sector\ntaxation. \nTherefore, on 28 September 2011 the\nCommission tabled a proposal for a Council Directive on a common system of\nfinancial transaction tax (FTT) and amending Directive 2008/7/EC[1]. The legal basis for the\nproposed Council Directive was Article 113 TFEU, as the proposed provisions aim\nat the harmonisation of legislation concerning the taxation of financial\ntransactions to the extent necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the\ninternal market for transactions in financial instruments and to avoid\ndistortion of competition. This legal basis prescribes Council unanimity in\naccordance with a special legislative procedure, after consulting the European\nParliament and the Economic and Social Committee. \nThe main objectives of this proposal were: \n\u2013                        \nharmonising legislation concerning indirect\ntaxation on financial transactions, which is needed to ensure the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market for transactions in financial instruments\nand to avoid distortion of competition between financial instruments, actors\nand market places across the European Union, and at the same time\n\u2013                        \nensuring that financial institutions make a fair\nand substantial contribution to covering the costs of the recent crisis and\ncreating a level playing field with other sectors from a taxation point of view[2], and \n\u2013                        \ncreating appropriate disincentives for\ntransactions that do not enhance the efficiency of financial markets thereby\ncomplementing regulatory measures to avoid future crises.\nGiven the extremely high mobility of most\nof the transactions to be potentially taxed, it was and still is important to\navoid distortions caused by tax rules conceived by Member States acting\nunilaterally. Indeed, a fragmentation of financial markets across activities\nand across borders, and among products and actors can only be avoided and equal\ntreatment of financial institutions in the EU and thus ultimately, the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market, can only be ensured through action at EU\nlevel. The development of a common system of financial transaction tax in the\nEU reduces the risk of distortion of markets through a taxation-induced\ngeographical delocalisation of activities. Furthermore, such common system can\nalso ensure tax neutrality through harmonisation with a broad scope, notably to\nalso cover very mobile products such as derivatives, mobile actors and market\nplaces, thus also contributing to less double-taxation or double-non-taxation. \nThe proposal therefore provided for\nharmonisation of Member States\u2019 taxes on financial transactions to ensure the\nsmooth functioning of the single market and thus set out the essential features\nof a common system for a broad based FTT in the EU.\nSince around the time of the initial\nCommission proposal the case for harmonisation has been further illustrated by\ndevelopments in practice: France has introduced a national tax on certain\nfinancial transactions since 1 August 2012 and Spain, Italy and Portugal have\nrecently made announcements of introducing such national taxes as well \u2013 all\nwith different scope, rates and technical design features.\nThe European Parliament delivered its\nfavourable opinion on 23 May 2012[3]\nand the Economic and Social Committee on 29 March 2012[4] on the Commission\u2019s initial\nproposal. Also the Committee of Regions adopted a favourable opinion on 15\nFebruary 2012[5].\nThe proposal and variants thereof were\nextensively discussed in the meetings of the Council which started under the\nPolish Presidency[6] and continued at an accelerated pace under the Danish Presidency,\nbut failed to get the required unanimous support because of fundamental and\nun-bridgeable differences amongst Member States. \nAt the Council meetings of 22 June and 10\nJuly 2012, it was ascertained that essential differences in opinion persist as\nregards the need to establish a common system of FTT at EU level and that the\nprinciple of harmonised tax on financial transactions will not receive\nunanimous support within the Council in the foreseeable future. \nIt follows from the above that the\nobjectives of a common system of FTT, as discussed in the Council upon the\nCommission's initial proposal, cannot be attained within a reasonable period by\nthe Union as a whole.\nOn the basis of the request of eleven\nMember States (Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia) the Commission submitted a proposal[7] to the Council for authorising\nenhanced cooperation in the area of financial transaction tax. \nAll Member States specified in their\nrequests that the scope and objectives of the Commission's legislative proposal\nimplementing enhanced cooperation should be based on the Commission's initial\nFTT proposal. Furthermore, they specified that evasive actions, distortions and\ntransfers to other jurisdictions are to be avoided.\nThe present proposal for a Directive\nconcerns the implementation of the enhanced cooperation in the area of FTT, in\naccordance with the authorisation of the Council of 22 January 2013, issued\nfollowing the European Parliament's consent given on 12 December 2012.\nIn the light of this new context of\nenhanced cooperation, the 2011 Commission proposal mentioned above becomes\nwithout object and the Commission therefore intends to withdraw it. \nThe Commission Proposal\nfor a Council Decision on the system of own resources of the European Union of\n29 June 2011[8],\nas amended on 9 November 2011[9], set out that part of receipts generated by the FTT shall\nconstitute an own resource for the EU budget. This would imply that the\nGNI-based resource drawn from the participating Member States would be reduced\naccordingly. \n1.2. Objectives of the proposal\nThe general objectives of this proposal are\nthose of the Commission's original proposal of 2011. The recent and ongoing\nglobal economic and financial crisis had a serious impact on the economies and\npublic finances in the EU. The financial sector has played a major role in\ncausing the economic crisis whilst governments and European citizens at large\nhave born the costs. Even though it is made of a wide variety of market actors,\nthe financial sector at large has experienced high profitability over the last\ntwo decades which could be partially the result of an (implicit or explicit)\nsafety net provided by governments, combined with financial sector regulation\nand VAT exemption.\nUnder these circumstances, some Member\nStates started to implement additional forms of financial sector taxation,\nwhilst other Member States already had in place specific tax regimes for\nfinancial transactions. The current situation leads to the following\nundesirable effects:\n\u2013              \na fragmentation of the tax treatment in the\ninternal market for financial services - bearing in mind the increasing number\nof uncoordinated national tax measures being put in place- with the consequent\npossibilities of distortions of competition between financial instruments,\nactors and market places across the European Union and double taxation or\ndouble non-taxation;\n\u2013              \nthe financial institutions do not make a fair\nand substantial contribution to covering the cost of the recent crisis and a\nlevel playing field with other sectors from a taxation point of view is not\nensured;\n\u2013              \ntaxation policy neither contributes to providing\ndisincentives for transactions which do not enhance the efficiency of financial\nmarkets but which might only divert rents from the non-financial sector of the\neconomy to financial institutions and, thus, trigger over-investment in\nactivities that are not welfare enhancing, nor does it contribute alongside ongoing\nregulatory and supervisory measures to avoid future crises in the financial\nservices sector.\nThe implementation of a common system of\nfinancial transaction tax amongst a sufficient number of Member States would\nentail immediate tangible advantages on all three points listed above, in\nregard to financial transactions covered by enhanced cooperation. In connection\nwith these points, the position of the participating Member States in terms of\nrelocation risks, tax revenues and efficiency of the financial market and\navoidance of double taxation or non-taxation would be improved. \nThe decision authorising enhanced cooperation\nfound that all the requirements of the Treaties in regard to such cooperation\nare fulfilled, and in particular that the competences, rights and obligations\nof non-participating Member States are respected. The present proposal sets out\nthe necessary substance for the cooperation thus authorised, in line with the\nTreaty provisions. \n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General approach and\nrelationship with the Commission's initial proposal\nThis proposal is based on the Commission's\noriginal proposal of 2011 in that it respects all the essential principles\nthereof. However, some adaptations were made: \n\u2013                        \nto take account of the new context of enhanced\ncooperation; this means in particular that the 'FTT jurisdiction' is limited to\nparticipating Member States, that transactions carried out within a\nparticipating Member State which would have been taxed under the original\nproposal remain taxable, and that it is ensured that Council Directive\n2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of\ncapital[10],\nwhose modification had been proposed in the initial proposal, remains\nunaffected;\n\u2013                        \nto some of the proposed provisions for the sake\nof clarity and \n\u2013                        \nto further strengthen anti-avoidance of\ntaxation; this is achieved through rules whereby taxation follows the\n\"issuance principle\" as a last resort, which compounds the\n\"principle of establishment\", which is maintained as the main principle.\nThis addition reflects notably the requests of the interested Member States\nwhich referred to the need to avoid evasive actions, distortions and transfers\nto other jurisdictions. Indeed, by complementing the residence principle with elements\nof the issuance principle, it will be less advantageous to relocate activities\nand establishments outside the FTT jurisdictions, since trading in the\nfinancial instruments subject to taxation under the latter principle and issued\nin the FTT jurisdictions will be taxable anyway. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 External consultation and\nexpertise\nThe original proposal has been formulated\nagainst the background of a wide range of external contributions. These contributions\ntook the form of feedback received in the course of a public consultation on\nfinancial sector taxation, targeted consultations with the Member States, experts and the financial sector stakeholders, as well as three different\nexternal studies commissioned for the purpose of the impact assessment\naccompanying the original proposal. The results of the consultation process and\nthe external input are reflected in this impact assessment.\nThe present proposal does not differ\nmarkedly from the Commission's September 2011 proposal and retains the same\nsolutions of principle for a common system of FTT under enhanced cooperation\n(e.g. as regards the scope of the tax, the establishment of a financial\ninstitution involved in a transaction as the connecting factor, the taxable\namount and rates and the person liable to pay the tax to the tax authorities)\nand thus no new specific consultations were initiated by the Commission.\nHowever, the Commission also benefited from\nthe consultation of all interested parties over the last year, such as Member\nStates, the European and national parliaments, representatives of the financial\nindustry from within and from outside the European Union, the academic world,\nnon-governmental organisations, and the results of ad hoc external studies that\nhad been published in the aftermath of the tabling of the Commission's initial\nproposal on a common system of FTT for the entire European Union.\nCommission representatives participated in\nnumerous public events across and outside Europe on the establishment of a\ncommon system of financial transaction tax. Also, the Commission actively\nparticipated in a dialogue with those national parliaments and their relevant\ncommittees that so wished discussing the original Commission proposal.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThe Commission services carried out an\nimpact assessment which accompanies its original proposal adopted on 28\nSeptember 2011. Further additional technical analysis of this proposal has been\npresented on the Commission's website[11].\nAs requested by the Member States that have sought the authorisation for\nenhanced cooperation, the scope and objectives of this proposal are based on\nthe Commission\u2019s initial proposal. Therefore, the fundamental building blocks\nof the latter proposal are not changed, so that a new impact assessment\ncovering the same subject area has not been considered appropriate. \nHowever, Member States had weighed\ndifferent alternative policy options within the framework of the initial\nCommission proposal. Also, this new proposal is intended to implement enhanced\ncooperation, as opposed to the initial proposal for a directive to be applied\nby all Member States, and Member States have specifically shown interest in\nlearning more on the specific mechanisms that might be at work in this context\nand their main effects. Therefore, the Commission services have undertaken an\nadditional analysis of these policy options and impacts that complements and\nreviews, where appropriate, the findings of the impact assessment accompanying\nthe initial proposal of 2011. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nCouncil Decision 2013/52/EU of 22 January\n2013 authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of financial transaction tax[12] authorised the Member States\nlisted in its Article 1 to establish enhanced cooperation in the area of FTT.\nThe pertinent legal basis for the proposed\nDirective is Article 113 TFEU. The proposal aims at harmonising legislation\nconcerning indirect taxation on financial transactions, which is needed to\nensure the proper functioning of the internal market and to avoid distortion of\ncompetition. Non-participating States\u2019financial institutions will benefit from\nthe enhanced cooperation, as they will be confronted with only one common\nsystem of FTT applicable in the participating Member States instead of a\nmultitude of systems.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\nproportionality\nThe harmonisation of legislation concerning\nthe taxation of financial transactions necessary for the proper functioning of\nthe internal market and to avoid distortions of competition, be it only among\nthe participating Member States, can only be achieved through a Union act, i.e.\nby way of a uniform definition of the essential features of an FTT. The common\nrules are necessary to avoid undue relocations of transactions and market\nparticipants and substitution of financial instruments. \nBy the same token, a uniform definition\ncould play a crucial role in reducing the existing fragmentation of the\ninternal market, including for the different products of the financial sector\nthat often serve as close substitutes. Non\nharmonisation of FTT leads to tax arbitrage and potential double or\nnon-taxation. This not only prevents financial transactions to be carried out\non a level playing field, but also affects revenues of Member States.\nFurthermore, it imposes extra compliance costs on the financial sector arising\nfrom too different tax regimes. These findings remain valid in a context of\nenhanced cooperation, even though such cooperation implies a more reduced\ngeographical reach than a similar scheme adopted at the level of all 27 Member\nStates.\nThe present proposal thus concentrates on\nsetting a common structure of the tax and common provisions on chargeability.\nThe proposal thus leaves a sufficient margin of manoeuvre for the participating\nMember States when it comes to the actual setting of the tax rates above the\nminimum. On the other hand, it is proposed to confer delegated powers to the\nCommission as regards the specification of registration, accounting, reporting\nand other obligations intended to ensure that FTT due to the tax authorities is\neffectively paid to them As regards uniform methods of collection of the FTT\ndue, implementing powers conferred to the Commission are proposed.\nA common framework for an FTT therefore respects\nthe subsidiarity and proportionality principle as set in Article 5 TEU. The objective of this\nproposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can\ntherefore, by reason of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market,\nbe better achieved at Union level, if necessary through enhanced cooperation.\nThe harmonisation proposed, in the form of\na Directive rather than a Regulation, does not go beyond what is necessary in\norder to achieve the objectives pursued, first and foremost for the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market. It thus complies with the principle of\nproportionality.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed explanation of\nthe proposal\n3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter I (Subject matter\nand definitions)\nThis chapter defines the subject matter of\nthis proposed Directive containing the proposal for implementation of the\nenhanced cooperation in the area of FTT. Furthermore, this chapter provides for\ndefinitions of the main terms used in this proposal.\n3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter II (Scope of the\ncommon system of FTT)\nThis chapter defines the essential\nframework of the proposed common system of FTT under enhanced cooperation. This\nFTT aims at taxing gross transactions before any netting off.\nThe scope of the tax is wide, because it\naims at covering transactions relating to all types of financial instruments as\nthey are often close substitutes for each other. Thus, the scope covers\ninstruments which are negotiable on the capital market, money-market\ninstruments (with the exception of instruments of payment), units or shares in\ncollective investment undertakings - which include undertakings for collective\ninvestment in transferable securities (UCITS) and alternative investment funds\n(AIF)[13]\nand derivatives contracts. Furthermore, the scope of the tax is not limited to\ntrade in organised markets, such as regulated markets, multilateral trading\nfacilities or systematic internalisers, but also covers other types of trades\nincluding over-the-counter trade. It is also not limited to the transfer of\nownership but rather represents the obligation entered into, mirroring whether\nor not the party concerned assumes the risk implied by a given financial\ninstrument (\"purchase and sale\"). \nFurthermore, where financial instruments\nwhose purchase and sale is taxable form the object of a transfer between separate\nentities of a group, this transfer shall be taxable even though it might not be\na purchase or sale.\nExchanges of financial instruments and\nrepurchase and reverse repurchase and securities lending and borrowing\nagreements are explicitly included into the scope of the tax. For reasons of\navoiding tax circumvention exchanges of financial instruments are considered to\ngive rise to two financial transactions. On the other hand, by way of\nrepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and\nborrowing agreements, a financial instrument is put at the disposal of a given\nperson for a defined period of time. All such agreements should therefore be\nconsidered as giving rise to one financial transaction only. \nAdditionally, in order to prevent tax\navoidance, each material modification of a taxable financial transaction should\nbe considered a new taxable financial transaction of the same type as the\noriginal transaction. It is proposed to add a non-limitative list of what can\nbe considered a material modification.\nAlso, where a derivatives contract results\nin a supply of financial instruments, in addition to the taxable derivatives\ncontract, the supply of these financial instruments is also subject to tax,\nprovided that all other conditions for taxation are fulfilled. \nFor the financial instruments which may\nform the object of a taxable financial transaction, the relevant regulatory\nframework at EU level provides a clear, comprehensive and accepted set of\ndefinitions[14].\nIt emerges from the definitions used that spot currency transactions are not\ntaxable financial transactions, while currency derivative contracts are.\nDerivative contracts relating to commodities are also covered, while physical\ncommodity transactions are not.\nStructured products, meaning tradable securities or other financial instruments offered by way of\na securitisation can also form the object of taxable financial transactions. Such products are comparable to any other financial instrument and\nthus need to be covered by the term financial instrument as used in this\nproposal. Excluding them from the scope of FTT would open avoidance\nopportunities. This category of products notably includes certain notes,\nwarrants and certificates as well as banking securitisations which usually transfer\na large part of the credit risk associated with assets such as mortgages or\nloans into the market, as well as insurance\nsecuritisations, which involve the transfers of other types of risk, for\nexample the underwriting risk. \nHowever, the scope of the tax is focused on\nfinancial transactions carried out by financial institutions acting as party to\na financial transaction, either for their own account or for the account of\nother persons, or acting in the name of a party to the transaction. This approach\nensures that FTT is comprehensively applied. In practical terms the presence of\nfinancial transactions is usually evident via respective entries in the books. The\nimposition of FTT should not negatively affect the refinancing possibilities of\nfinancial institutions and States, nor monetary policies in general or public\ndebt management. Therefore, transactions with the European Central Bank, the\nEuropean Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism, the European\nUnion where it exercises the function of management of its assets, of balance\nof payment loans and of similar activities, and the central banks of Member\nStates should be excluded from the scope of the Directive. \nThe provisions of Council Directive\n2008/7/EC continue to be fully applicable. Article 5 (1)(e) and (2) of that\nDirective is relevant to the area covered by the present Directive and\nprohibits the imposition of any tax whatsoever on the transactions referred to\nin its terms, subject to Article 6(1)(a) of the same Directive. To the extent\nDirective 2008/7/EC thus prohibits or could prohibit the imposition of taxes on\ncertain transactions, in particular financial transactions as part of\nrestructuring operations or of the issue of securities as defined in this\nDirective, they should not be subject to FTT. The aim is to avoid any possible\nconflict with Directive 2008/7/EC, without it being necessary to ascertain the\nprecise limits of the obligations imposed by that Directive. Moreover,\nindependently from the extent to which Directive 2008/7/EC prohibits taxation\nof the issuance of shares and units of collective investment undertakings\nconsiderations of tax neutrality require the single treatment of issuances by\nall these undertakings. The redemption of shares and units thus issued are\nhowever not in the nature of a primary market transaction and should thus be\ntaxable.\nFurther to the exclusion of primary markets\nexplained above most day-to-day financial activities relevant for citizens and\nbusinesses remain outside the scope of the FTT. This is the case for the\nconclusion of insurance contracts, mortgage lending, consumer credits, enterprise\nloans, payment services etc. (though the subsequent trading of these via\nstructured products is included). Also, currency transactions on spot markets\nare outside the scope of the FTT, which preserves the free movement of capital.\nHowever, derivatives contracts based on currency transactions are covered by\nthe FTT since they are not as such currency transactions.\nThe definition of financial institutions is\nbroad and essentially includes investment firms, organised markets, credit\ninstitutions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, collective investment\nundertakings and their managers, pension funds and their managers, holding\ncompanies, financial leasing companies, special purpose entities, and where\npossible refers to the definitions provided by the relevant EU legislation\nadopted for regulatory purposes. Additionally, other undertakings,\ninstitutions, bodies or persons carrying out certain financial activities with\na significant annual average value of financial transactions should be\nconsidered as financial institutions. The present proposal sets the threshold\nat 50% of its overall average net annual turnover of the entity concerned.\nThe proposed Directive provides for further\ntechnical details of the calculation of the value of the financial transactions\nand the average of values referred to in respect of entities that may be\nregarded as financial institutions only on account of the value of the financial\ntransactions they carry out, and makes provision for situations where such\nentities no longer qualify as financial institutions.. \nCentral Counterparties (CCPs), Central Securities Depositories\n(CSDs), International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs) and Member States and public bodies entrusted with the function of managing public debt, when\nexercising that function are not considered financial institutions to the\nextent they are not engaged in trading activity in itself. They are also key\nfor a more efficient and more transparent functioning of financial markets and\nfor a proper management of public debt. However, because of their central role\ncertain obligations relating to ensuring the payment of the tax to the tax\nauthorities and to the verification of the payment should continue to apply. \nThe territorial application of the proposed\nFTT and the participating Member States\u2019 taxing rights are defined on the basis\nof the rules laid down in Article 4. This provision refers to the notion of \u201cestablishment\u201d.\nIn essence, it is based on the \"residence principle\" supplemented by\nelements of the issuance principle with a view mainly to strengthen anti-relocation\n(details regarding this latter aspect are set out further below).\nIn order for a financial transaction to be\ntaxable in the participating Member States, one of the parties to the\ntransaction needs to be established in the territory of a participating Member State according to the criteria of Article 4. Taxation will take place in the participating\n  Member State in the territory of which the establishment of a financial\ninstitution is located, on condition that this institution is party to the\ntransaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another\nperson, or is acting in the name of a party to the transaction. \nIn case the different financial\ninstitutions, as parties to the transaction or acting in the name of such\nparties, are established in the territory of different participating Member\nStates, according to the criteria of Article 4, each of these different Member\nStates will be competent to subject the transaction to tax at the rates it has\nset in accordance with this proposal. Where the establishments concerned are\nlocated in the territory of a State which is not a participating Member State\nthe transaction is not subject to FTT in a participating Member State, unless\none of the parties to the transaction is established in a participating Member\nState in which case the financial institution that is not established in a participating\nMember State will also be deemed to be established in that participating Member\nState and the transaction becomes taxable there. \nOne particular change due to the new\ncontext of enhanced cooperation concerns what was Article 3(1)(a) of the initial\nproposal. Within that proposal, the reference to a financial institution\n\u201cauthorised\u201d by a Member State covered headquarter authorisations and\nauthorisations provided by the Member State concerned in regard to transactions\noperated by third-country financial institutions without a physical presence in\nthe territory of that Member State. In the former configuration, transactions\nmay be covered, according to the case, by a \u201cpassport\u201d foreseen in EU\nlegislation. The only \u201cauthorisation\u201d is then the one granted to the\nheadquarters of the financial institution. In a context of enhanced cooperation,\na new configuration may raise, namely of institutions with headquarters in a\nnon-participating Member State that operate on the basis of a \u201cpassport\u201d in the\nFTT jurisdiction (cf. e.g. Article 31 of Directive 2004/39/EC). The latter\nsituation should be assimilated to the situation of third country institutions\noperating on the basis of a specific authorisation provided by the Member State concerned by the transaction.\nThe residence principle is supplemented\nalso by elements of the \"issuance\nprinciple\" as a last resort, in order to improve the resilience of the\nsystem against relocation. Indeed, by complementing the residence principle\nwith the issuance principle, it will be less advantageous to relocate\nactivities and establishments outside the FTT jurisdictions, since trading in\nthe financial instruments subject to taxation under the latter principle and\nissued in the FTT jurisdictions will be taxable anyway. This applies where none\nof the parties to the transaction would have been \u201cestablished\u201d in a\nparticipating Member State, on the basis of the criteria set out in the\nCommission\u2019s initial proposal but where such parties are trading in financial\ninstruments issued in that Member State. This concerns essentially shares,\nbonds and equivalent securities, money-market instruments, structured products,\nunits and shares in collective investment undertakings and derivatives traded\non organised trade venues or platforms. In the context of the issuance\nprinciple, which also underlies certain existing national financial sector\ntaxes, the transaction is linked to the participating Member State in which the issuer is located. The persons involved in such transaction will be deemed\nto be established in that Member State because of this link, and the financial\ninstitution(s) concerned will have to pay FTT in that State. \nAll the above mentioned criteria are subject\nto a general rule, regarding the case where the person liable to pay the tax\nproves that there is no link between the economic substance of the transaction\nand the territory of any participating Member State. In that case, the\nfinancial institution or other person shall not be considered established\nwithin a participating Member State. \nAll in all, through the connecting factors\nchosen in combination with the above mentioned general rule, it is ensured that\ntaxation can only take place in the presence of a sufficient link between the\ntransaction and the territory of the FTT jurisdiction. As in existing EU\nlegislation in the area of indirect taxes, territoriality principles are fully\nrespected.\n3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter III (chargeability,\ntaxable amount and rates)\nThe moment of chargeability is defined as\nthe moment when the financial transaction occurs. Subsequent cancellation\ncannot be considered as a reason to exclude chargeability of the tax, except in\ncases of errors. \nAs transactions in derivatives and in\nfinancial instruments other than derivatives have a different nature and characteristics,\nthey have to be associated to different taxable amounts. \nFor the purchase and sale of financial\ninstruments (other than derivatives), usually a price or any other form of\nconsideration will be determined. Logically, this is to be defined as the\ntaxable amount. However, to avoid market distortions special rules are\nnecessary where the consideration is lower than the market price or for transactions taking place between entities of a group and which are\nnot covered by the notions of \"purchase\" and \"sale\". In these cases the taxable amount is to be the market price\ndetermined at arm's length at the time FTT becomes chargeable. Such\ntransactions between entities of a group are likely to involve transfers\nwithout consideration, while transfers for consideration correspond to the\nnotions of \"purchase\" and \"sale\".\nFor the purchase/sale, transfer, exchange, conclusion\nof derivative contracts, and material modifications thereof, the taxable amount\nof the FTT shall be the notional amount referred to in the derivatives contract\nat the time it is purchased/sold, transferred, exchanged, concluded or when the\noperation concerned is materially modified. This approach would allow for a\nstraightforward and easy application of FTT on derivative contracts while ensuring\nlow compliance and administrative costs. Also, this approach makes it more\ndifficult to artificially reduce the tax burden through creative contract\ndesign for the derivative contract as there would be no tax incentive for\nexample to enter into a contract on differences in prices or values only.\nFurthermore it implies the taxation at the moment of the purchase/sale,\ntransfer, exchange, conclusion of the contract or material modification of the\noperation concerned, as compared to taxing cash-flows at different moments in\ntime during the life cycle of the contract. The rate to be used in this case\nwill need to be rather low in order to define an adequate tax burden.\nSpecial provisions might be necessary in\nthe participating Member States in order to prevent fraud and evasion and a\ngeneral anti-abuse rule is proposed (see also section 3.3.4). This rule could for\nexample be applied in cases where the notional amount is artificially divided: the notional amount of a swap could for instance be divided by an\narbitrarily large factor and all payments could be multiplied by the same\nfactor. This would leave the cash flows of the instrument unchanged but\narbitrarily shrink the size of the tax base.\nSpecial provisions are necessary to\ndetermine the taxable amount in respect of transactions where the taxable\namount or parts thereof are expressed in another currency than that of the\nparticipating Member State of assessment.\nTransactions in derivatives and\ntransactions in other financial instruments are different in nature. Moreover,\nmarkets are likely to react differently to a financial transaction tax applied\nto each of these two categories. For these reasons, and in order to ensure a\nbroadly even taxation, the rates should be differentiated as between the two\ncategories.\nThe rates should also take into account\ndifferences in the applicable methods for the determination of the taxable\namounts. \nGenerally speaking, the minimum tax rates (above which there is room of manoeuvre for\nnational policies) are proposed to be set at a level sufficiently high for the\nharmonisation objective of this Directive to be achieved. At the same time, the\nproposed rates are situated low enough so that delocalisation risks are\nminimised. \n3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter IV (Payment of FTT,\nrelated obligations and prevention of evasion, avoidance and abuse)\nThis proposal defines the scope of FTT by\nreference to financial transactions to which a financial institution\nestablished in the territory of the participating Member State concerned is\nparty (acting either for its own account or for the account of another person)\nor transactions where the institution acts in the name of a party. In fact,\nfinancial institutions execute the bulk of transactions on financial markets,\nand the FTT should concentrate on the financial sector as such rather than on\ncitizens. Therefore, these institutions should be liable to pay the tax to the\ntax authorities of the participating Member States in the territories of which\nthese financial institutions are deemed to be established. However, in order to\navoid a certain cascade of the tax, when a financial institution acts in the\nname or for the account of another financial institution, only that other\nfinancial institution should pay the tax.\nIt is also proposed to ensure as far as possible\nthat FTT is effectively paid. According to the terms of this proposal,\ntherefore, in case the FTT due on account of a transaction has not been timely\npaid each party to that transaction should be held jointly and severally liable\nfor the payment of the tax. Moreover, participating Member States should have\nthe possibility to hold other persons jointly and severally liable for payment\nof the tax, including in cases where a party to a transaction has its\nheadquarters located outside the territory of the participating Member States. \nThis proposal also provides for time limits\nfor the payment of FTT to the accounts determined by the participating Member\nStates. Most financial transactions are carried out by electronic means. In\nthese cases, FTT should be paid immediately at the moment of chargeability. In\nother cases, the tax should be paid within a period which, while being\nsufficiently long so as to allow for the manual processing of the payment,\navoids that unjustifiable cash-flow advantages accrue to the financial\ninstitution concerned. A period of three working days from the moment of\nchargeability can be considered appropriate in this sense.\nThe participating Member States should be\nobliged to take appropriate measures for registration, accounting, reporting\nand other obligations for the FTT to be levied accurately and timely and\neffectively paid to the tax authorities. In this regard, it is proposed to\nempower the Commission to provide for further details. This is necessary in\norder to ensure harmonised measures reducing compliance costs for operators and\nto enable speedy technical adaptations whenever they are necessary. In this\ncontext, the participating Member States should take advantage of existing and\nforthcoming EU legislation on financial markets that includes reporting and\ndata maintenance obligations with respect to financial transactions.\nThe proposed Directive would also oblige\nMember States to take measures in order to prevent fraud and evasion. \nFurthermore, in order to address the risk\nof abuse which could undermine the proper operation of the common system, it is\nproposed to set out a number of details in the directive. Thus, the proposal\ncontains a general anti-abuse rule, based on the similar clause included in the\nCommission Recommendation of 6 December 2012 on aggressive tax planning[15], as well as a provision based\non the same principles but addressing the particular problems linked to\ndepositary receipts and similar securities.\nIn order to avoid complications in the\ncollection of the tax through differing collection methods, and ensuing\nunnecessary compliance costs, the methods applied by the participating Member\nStates for the collection of the FTT due should be uniform, to the extent\nnecessary for those purposes. Such uniform methods would also contribute to\nequal treatment of all taxpayers. Therefore, the proposed Directive provides\nfor an empowerment of the Commission to adopt implementing measures to this\neffect. \nIn order to ease the administration of the\ntax, the participating Member States could introduce national (publicly\naccessible) registries for the FTT entities. In practice, they could make use\nof existing codification, for instance the Business Identification Codes\n(BIC/ISO 9362) for both financial and non-financial institutions, the\nClassification of Financial Instruments (CFI/ISO 10962) for financial\ninstruments and the Market Identifier Code (MIC/ISO 10383) for the different\nmarkets.\nIn addition to discussions on the\ndefinition of uniform collection methods in the relevant Committee, the\nCommission might organise regular expert meetings with a view to discuss with\nthe participating Member States the operation of the Directive once adopted, in\nparticular ways of ensuring the proper payment of the tax and the verification of\npayment, as well as matters pertaining to the prevention of tax evasion,\navoidance and abuse.\nThe draft Directive does not address issues\nof administrative cooperation which are covered in existing instruments\nrelating to the assessment and recovery of taxes, in particular Directive\n2011/16/EU of the Council of 15 February on administrative cooperation in the\nfield of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC[16] (applicable as of 1 January\n2013), Directive 2010/24/EU of the Council of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual\nassistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other\nmeasures[17]\n(applicable as of 1 January 2012). The directive proposed here neither adds to\nthose instruments, nor does it diminish their scope. They continue to apply to\nall taxes of any kind levied by or on behalf a Member State[18], and this encompasses FTT as\nit does any other tax thus levied. These instruments apply to all Member States\nwho should provide assistance within the limits and conditions thereof. Other\ninstruments which are relevant in this context include the OECD - Council of\nEurope Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax\nMatters[19].\nTogether with the conceptual approach\nunderlying the FTT (broad scope, broadly defined residence principle, no\nexemptions), the rules outlined above allow to minimise tax evasion, avoidance\nand abuse. \n3.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapter V (Final\nprovisions)\nIt follows from the harmonisation objective\nof this proposal that the participating Member States should not be allowed to\nmaintain or introduce taxes on financial transactions as defined in this\nproposal other than the FTT object of the proposed Directive or VAT. Indeed, as\nfar as VAT is concerned, the right of option to tax as provided for in Article\n137(1)(a) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common\nsystem of value added tax[20]\ncontinues to apply. Other taxes like those on insurance premiums etc. have of\ncourse a different nature, as have registration fees on financial transactions,\nin case they represent a genuine re-imbursement of costs or consideration for a\nservice rendered. Such taxes and fees are thus not affected by this proposal.\nIt is proposed for the participating Member\nStates to communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions transposing\nthe proposed Directive into national legal provisions. No provision of\nexplanatory documents is proposed in this respect, given the limited number of\narticles in the proposal and ensuing obligations on Member States. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nPreliminary estimates indicate that,\ndepending on market reactions, the revenues of the tax could have been between EUR\n30 and 35 billion on a yearly basis in the whole of participating Member States\nin case the original proposal for EU27 had been applied to EU11. However, when\ntaking account of the net effects of the adjustments made as compared to the\noriginal proposal, notably (i) the issue of units and shares of UCITS and AIF\nis no longer considered not to be a primary market transaction, and (ii) the\nanti-relocation provisions of the residence principle as initially defined have\nbeen strengthened by complementing them with elements of the issuance\nprinciple, preliminary estimates indicate that the revenues of the tax could be\nin the order of magnitude of EUR 31 billion annually.\nThe Commission Proposal\nfor a Council Decision on the system of own resources of the European Union of\n29 June 2011[21],\nas amended on 9 November 2011[22], set out that part of receipts generated by the FTT shall\nconstitute an own resource for the EU Budget. The GNI-based resource drawn from\nthe participating Member States would be reduced accordingly. \nThe European Council of 7/8 February 2013\ninvited the participating Member States to examine if the FTT could become the\nbase for a new own resource for the EU Budget.\n2013/0045 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nimplementing enhanced cooperation in the\narea of financial transaction tax\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2013/52/EU\nof 22 January 2013 authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of financial\ntransaction tax[23],\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Parliament[24],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[25],\n\nActing in accordance with a special\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2011, the Commission\ntook note of a debate on-going at all levels on additional taxation of the\nfinancial sector. The debate originates from the desire to ensure that the\nfinancial sector fairly and substantially contributes to the costs of the\ncrisis and that it is taxed in a fair way vis-\u00e0-vis other sectors for the\nfuture, to dis-incentivise excessively risky activities by financial\ninstitutions, to complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises\nand to generate additional revenue for general budgets or specific policy\npurposes.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Decision 2013/52/EU the\nCouncil authorised enhanced cooperation between Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (hereinafter \"participating Member States\") in the area of financial transaction\ntax (FTT).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to prevent distortions through measures taken unilaterally by the\nparticipating Member States, bearing in mind the extremely high mobility of\nmost of the relevant financial transactions, and thus to improve the proper\nfunctioning of the internal market, it is important that the basic features of\na FTT in the participating Member States are harmonised at Union level.\nIncentives for tax arbitrage between the participating Member States and allocation distortions between financial markets in those States, as well as\npossibilities for double or non-taxation should thereby be avoided.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The improvement of the\noperation of the internal market, in particular the avoidance of distortions\nbetween the participating Member States requires that a FTT applies to a\nbroadly determined range of financial institutions and transactions, to trade\nin a wide range of financial instruments, including structured products, both\nin the organised markets and \"over-the-counter\", as well as to the\nconclusion of all derivative contracts and to material modifications of the operations\nconcerned. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In principle, each\ntransfer agreed upon, of one or more financial instruments, is linked to a\ngiven transaction which in turn should be subject to FTT on account of such\nagreed transfer. Since an exchange of financial instruments gives rise to two\nsuch transfers, each such exchange should be considered as giving rise to two\ntransactions, so as to avoid circumvention of the tax. By way of repurchase and\nreverse repurchase and securities lending and borrowing agreements, a financial\ninstrument is put at the disposal of a given person for a specified period of\ntime. All such agreements, as well as their material modification, should\ntherefore be considered as giving rise to one transaction only.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to preserve the\nefficient and transparent functioning of financial markets or the public debt\nmanagement, it is necessary to exclude certain entities from the scope of the FTT,\nin as much as these are exercising functions which are not considered to be\ntrading activity in itself but rather facilitating trade or protecting the management\nof public debt. However, entities excluded specifically because of their central\nrole for the functioning of financial markets or public debt management should\nbe made subject to the rules that ensure the proper payment of the tax to the\ntax authorities and the verification of the payment. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The imposition of FTT should\nnot negatively affect the refinancing possibilities of financial institutions\nand States, nor monetary policies in general. Therefore, transactions with the\nEuropean Central Bank, the European Financial Stability Facility, the European\nStability Mechanism, the European Union where it exercises the function of\nmanagement of its assets, of balance of payment loans and of similar activities,\nand the central banks of Member States should not be subject to FTT.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With\nthe exception of the conclusion or material modification of derivative\ncontracts, the trade on primary markets and transactions relevant for citizens\nand businesses such as conclusion of insurance contracts, mortgage lending,\nconsumer credits or payment services should be excluded from the scope of FTT, so as not to undermine the raising of capital by\ncompanies and governments and to avoid impact on households. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of Council\nDirective 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the\nraising of capital[26]\ncontinue to be fully applicable. Article 5(1)(e) and (2) of that Directive is\nrelevant to the area covered by this Directive and prohibits, subject to\nArticle 6(1)(a) of that Directive, the imposition of any tax whatsoever on the\ntransactions referred to in its provisions. Transactions in respect of which\nDirective 2008/7/EC prohibits or could prohibit the imposition of taxes should therefore\nnot be subject to FTT. Independently from the extent to which Directive\n2008/7/EC prohibits taxation of the issuance of shares and units collective\ninvestment undertakings, considerations of tax neutrality require a single\ntreatment of issuances by all these undertakings. The redemption of shares and\nunits thus issued are however not in the nature of a primary market transaction\nand should thus be taxable.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nchargeability and taxable amount should be harmonised so as to avoid\ndistortions in the internal market.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nmoment of chargeability should not be unduly delayed and should coincide with\nthe moment where the financial transaction occurs. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder to allow for the taxable amount to be determined as easily as possible so\nas to limit costs for businesses and for tax administrations, in the case of financial transactions other than those related to\nderivatives contracts reference should be made normally\nto the consideration granted in the context of the transaction. Where no\nconsideration is granted or where the consideration granted is lower than the\nmarket price, the market price should be referred to as a fair reflection of the\nvalue of the transaction. Equally for reasons of ease of calculation, where\nderivatives contracts are purchased/sold, transferred, exchanged, concluded or where\nthese operations are materially modified, the notional amount referred to in\nthe contract should be used. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe interest of equal treatment, a single tax rate should apply within each\ncategory of transactions, namely trade in financial instruments other than\nderivatives and material modification of the operations concerned, on the one\nhand, and the purchase/sale, transfer, exchange, conclusion of derivatives\ncontracts, and material modification of these operations on the other hand.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to concentrate the\ntaxation on the financial sector as such rather than on citizens and because\nfinancial institutions execute the vast majority of transactions on financial\nmarkets, the tax should apply to those institutions, whether they trade in\ntheir own name, in the name of other persons, for their own account or for the\naccount of other persons. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because\nof the high mobility of financial transactions and in order to help mitigating\npotential tax avoidance, the FTT should be applied on the basis of the\nresidence principle. To further minimise the risk of relocation of\ntransactions, while maintaining a single reference to \u201cestablishment\u201d for ease\nof application, this principle should be supplemented by elements of the\nissuance principle. Thus, for transactions in certain financial instruments,\nthe persons involved should be considered established in the participating Member State in which the instrument has been issued.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nminimum tax rates should be set at a level sufficiently high for the\nharmonisation objective of a common FTT to be achieved. At the same time, they\nhave to be low enough so that delocalisation risks are minimised.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be avoided that\nany side of a single transaction be taxed more than once. Therefore, where a\nfinancial institution acts in the name or for the account of another financial\ninstitution, only that other financial institution should pay the tax.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\norder for the FTT to be levied in an accurate and timely manner, the\nparticipating Member States should be obliged to take the necessary measures. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent tax fraud\nand evasion the participating Member States should be obliged to adopt\nappropriate measures.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent tax\navoidance and abuse through artificial schemes, it is necessary to provide for\na general anti-abuse rule. A specific rule based on the same principles should\nbe added with a view to address the particular problems linked to depositary receipts\nand similar securities.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow the\nadoption of more detailed rules in certain technical areas, regarding\nregistration, accounting, reporting obligations and other obligations intended\nto ensure that FTT due to the tax authorities is effectively paid to the tax\nauthorities, and their timely adaptation as appropriate, the power to adopt\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying\nthe measures necessary to this effect. It is of particular importance that the\nCommission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a timely and appropriate transmission of relevant\ndocuments to the Council.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Directive, as regards the collection\nof the tax in the participating Member States, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning\nmechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of\nimplementing powers.[27]\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since market operators will\nneed some time to adjust to the new rules, an appropriate period of time should\nbe provided for between the adoption of the national rules necessary to comply\nwith this Directive and the application of those rules.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\nDirective, namely to harmonise the essential features of a FTT within the\nparticipating Member States at Union level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by\nthese Member States and can therefore, by reason of improving the proper\nfunctioning of the Single Market, be better achieved at Union level, the Union\nmay adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\nin Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nChapter I \nSubject matter and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive implements\nthe enhanced cooperation authorised by Decision 2013/52/EU by laying down\nprovisions for a harmonised financial transaction tax (FTT).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participating Member\nStates shall charge FTT in accordance with this Directive.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this\nDirective, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)                   \n'Participating Member State' means a Member\nState which participates, at the time when FTT becomes chargeable pursuant to\nthis Directive, in enhanced cooperation in the area of FTT by virtue of\nDecision 2013/52/EU, or by virtue of a decision adopted in accordance with the\nsecond or third subparagraph of Article 331(1) of the TFEU;\n(2)                   \n'Financial transaction' means any of the\nfollowing:\n(a)         \nthe purchase and sale of a financial instrument\nbefore netting or settlement;

To ensure that financial institutions make a fair and substantial contribution to covering the costs of the recent crisis, and to ensure even taxation of the sector vis-\u00e0-vis other sectors.
