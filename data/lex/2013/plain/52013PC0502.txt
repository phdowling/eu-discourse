In\naccordance with Article 6(2) of this directive such criteria should be set for\nspecific materials by the Commission and be adopted in the regulatory procedure\nwith scrutiny referred to in Article 39(2) of the directive.\nAccordingly, the Commission submitted a\ndraft Regulation for vote in the Committee established under Article 39 of the\ndirective. The Committee did not give a favourable opinion on the draft\nRegulation in its meeting on 9 July 2012. The chief concern raised by some\nMember States was the inclusion of multi-layered material under the scope of\nthe Commission Regulation as this material containing up to 25% of non-paper\nmaterial would represent a hazard to the environment if treated improperly. The\nCommission took note of this; however it maintains and refers the same legal\nproposal to the Council since by virtue of Article 3(5) and Section 3 of Annex\nI the non-paper fraction is subject to an obligation to be recovered and a\ntraceability system, respectively. \nThus, in accordance with the procedure set\nout in Article 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC a Proposal for a Council Regulation\nis submitted to Council and forwarded to the European Parliament.\n2013/0235 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\non defining criteria determining when\nrecovered paper ceases to be waste pursuant to Article 6 (1) of Directive\n2008/98/EC on waste\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to\nDirective 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19\nNovember 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives[1] and\nin particular Article 6 (2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It results from an\nevaluation of several waste streams that recycling markets for paper would\nbenefit from the development of specific criteria determining when paper\nobtained from waste ceases to be waste. Those criteria should ensure a high\nlevel of environmental protection. They should be without prejudice to the\nclassification of recovered paper as waste by third countries.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reports of the Joint\nResearch Centre of the European Commission have shown that a market and demand\nexist for recovered paper to be used as feedstock in paper mills. Recovered\npaper should therefore be sufficiently pure and meet the relevant standards or\nspecifications required by the paper producing industry.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The criteria determining\nwhen recovered paper ceases to be waste should ensure that paper resulting from\na recovery operation meet the technical requirements of the paper producing\nindustry, comply with existing legislation and standards applicable to products\nand do not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts.\nReports of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission have shown that\nthe proposed criteria on the waste used as input in the recovery operation, on\nthe treatment processes and techniques, as well as on the paper resulting from\nthe recovery operation fulfil those objectives as they should result in the\ngeneration of paper devoid of hazardous properties and sufficiently free of\nnon-paper components.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\ncompliance with the criteria, it is appropriate that information on recovered\npaper which has ceased to be waste is issued and that a management system is\nimplemented.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to allow\noperators to adapt to the criteria determining when recovered paper ceases to\nbe waste, it is appropriate to provide for for a reasonable period to elapse\nbefore this Regulation applies.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific end-of-waste\ncriteria should be set up for multi-material paper with a high content of\nnon-paper material in order to ensure that effectively the paper is recycled\nand the non-paper materials are recovered.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The committee established\nby Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC has not delivered an opinion on the\nmeasures provided for in this Regulation, the Commission therefore submitted to\nthe Council a proposal relating to those measures and forwarded it to the European\nParliament.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject\nmatter\nThis Regulation establishes criteria\ndetermining when recovered paper destined for the use of paper fibres for paper\nmanufacturing ceases to be waste.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the\npurposes of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Directive 2008/98/EC\nshall apply.\nIn addition, the following definitions\nshall apply:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'recovered paper' means\npaper and cardboard generated from the recovery of waste;

Quality of paper resulting from the recovery operation \n 1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The paper resulting from the recovery operation shall be graded according to the European standard EN 643. || Qualified staff shall grade each consignment.   \n 1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-paper component content shall be less than or equal to 1.5 % of air dry weight. A non-paper component is any material different from paper, which is present in recovered paper, and can be separated using dry sorting techniques. Examples of non-paper components are metals, plastic, glass, textiles, earth, sand, ash, dust, wax, bitumen, ceramics, rubber, fabric, wood, and synthetic organic substances. Mineral fillers bound to paper fibres such as clay, calcium carbonate, and starch are considered as part of paper and do not count as non-paper components. Multi-material paper with a content of non-paper materials of more than 30% of air dry weight shall count in its totality as non-paper component.   || Qualified staff shall carry out visual inspection of each consignment. At appropriate intervals and subject to review if significant changes in the operating process are made, representative samples of each grade of recovered paper shall be analysed gravimetrically to measure the content of non-paper components. The non-paper components content shall be analysed by weighing after mechanical or manual (as appropriate) separation of materials under careful visual inspection. The appropriate frequencies of monitoring by sampling shall be established taking into account the following factors: the expected pattern of variability (for example as shown by historical results); the inherent risk of variability in the quality of the waste used as input for the recovery operation and any subsequent processing, for instance the higher average content of plastics or glass in sorted paper from multi-material collection systems; the inherent precision of the monitoring method; and the proximity of results of the non-paper components content to the maximum limitation of 1.5 % of air dry weight. The process of determining monitoring frequencies should be documented as part of the management system and should be available for auditing. \n 1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The recovered paper, including its constituents and in particular ink and dyes, shall not display any of the hazardous properties listed in Annex III to Directive 2008/98/EC. The recovered paper shall comply with the concentration limits laid down in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC[6], and not exceed the concentration limits laid down in Annex IV of Regulation 850/2004/EC[7] of the European Parliament and of the Council.   || Qualified staff shall carry out a visual inspection of each consignment. Where visual inspection reveals any indications for possible hazardous properties, further appropriate monitoring measures shall be taken, such as sampling and testing, where appropriate. The staff shall be trained on potential hazardous properties that may be associated with recovered paper and on material components or features that allow hazardous properties to be recognised. The procedure of recognising hazardous materials shall be documented under the management system. \n 1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recovered paper must not contain absorbed oil, solvents, paint, aqueous and/or fatty foodstuffs that can be detected by visual inspection.   || Qualified staff shall carry out a visual inspection of each consignment. Where visual inspection reveals signs of fluid absorption except water that may result in e.g. mould growth or odours, and these signs are non-negligible, the consignment shall remain waste. The staff shall be trained on potential types of contamination that may be associated with recovered paper and on material components or features that allow recognising the contaminants. The procedure of recognising contamination shall be documented under the management system. \n Section 2. Waste used as input for the recovery operation \n 2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hazardous waste, bio-waste, mixed municipal waste, health care waste, and used products of personal hygiene shall not be used as input.   || Acceptance control of all paper-containing waste received (by visual inspection) and of the accompanying documentation shall be carried out by qualified staff which is trained on how to recognise paper-containing input that does not fulfil the criteria set out in this Section. \n Section 3. Treatment processes and techniques \n 3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The waste paper shall have been segregated at source or while collecting, or the input wastes shall have been treated to separate the paper from the non-paper components. The paper resulting from these operations shall be kept separate from any other waste. 3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All treatments needed to prepare the paper for direct input to pulping in the manufacture of paper products, such as sorting, separating, cleaning, or grading, and except de-baling, shall have been completed. 3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-paper materials held in consignments that contain more than 1.5% of air dry weight of multi-material paper shall undergo a dedicated treatment process. The different materials in multi-material paper shall be effectively separated from each other. The separated paper fibres from the multi-material paper shall be used for paper manufacturing. The non-paper materials separated from the multi-material paper shall be recovered. ||               As regards multi-material paper consignments, the producer/importer shall identify the next holders of the consignment as well as the amounts transferred until the recovery of all the materials in the multi-material paper. Such identification can be undertaken by use of a traceability system. \nAnnex\nII\nStatement\nof Conformity with the end-of-waste criteria referred to in Article 4(1)\n 1. || Producer/importer of the recovered paper: Name: Address: Contact person: Telephone: Fax: E-mail:   \n 2. || a) Grade of waste paper in accordance with standard EN-643: b) Content of non-paper components, in percentage points of air dry weight: c) Origin of the material (tick where appropriate). c.1) multi-material origin, such as from comingled collection. c.2) mono-material origin, such as from source-separated collection. \n 3. || The consignment complies with the specifications of standard EN-643. \n 4. || Quantity of the consignment in kg. \n 5. || This consignment meets the criteria referred to in paragraphs (1) to (3) of Article 3 of (Regulation). \n 6. || The producer of the recovered paper applies a management system complying with the requirements of Regulation No\u2026 [will be inserted once the regulation adopted], and which has been verified by an accredited conformity assessment body or by an environmental verifier or, where paper which has ceased to be waste is imported into the customs territory of the Union, by an independent external verifier. \n 7. || The material in this consignment is intended exclusively for the use of paper-fibres for paper manufacturing, and where applicable, also for the recovery of the non-paper materials contained in multi-material paper. \n 8.     || Declaration of the producer/importer of the recovered paper: I certify that the above information is complete and correct and to my best knowledge: Name: Date: Signature:   \n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3.\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 393, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 330, 14.12.2011, p. 25.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 226, 6.9.2000, p. 3.\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 229, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
