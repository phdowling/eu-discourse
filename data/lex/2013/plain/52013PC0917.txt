This\nProtocol promotes a multi-pollutant approach to prevent or minimize exceedances\nof critical loads of acidification and nutrient nitrogen and critical levels of\nozone for human health and vegetation. To that effect, it sets national\nemission ceilings for each Party to be met by 2010 and thereafter for the\nfollowing four air pollutants: sulphur (mainly sulphur dioxide, SO2), nitrogen\noxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic compounds other\nthan methane (VOC). To support the achievement of the national emission\nceilings, the Annexes of the Protocol establish emission limit values to\ncontrol emissions of air pollutants generated at source from relevant\ncategories of stationary and mobile sources. \nThe accession of the Community to the\nProtocol was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2003/507/EC of 13 June 2003[2]. The Protocol,\nwhich entered into force on 17 May 2005, has been transposed into EU law mainly\nthrough Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n23 October 2001 on large combustion plants[3] and Directive\n2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on\nnational emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (NEC Directive)[4].\nIn accordance with Article 10(2) of the\nProtocol, the obligations have been reviewed in 2005 to 2007. The review\nconcluded that more efforts would be needed to meet the environmental and human\nhealth-related objectives of achieving critical loads and levels for long term\nprotection of human health and the environment. In 2007, the Parties opened\nnegotiations with a view to amending the Protocol. \nThe negotiation process led to the adoption\nby consensus of the Parties present at the 30th session of the\nExecutive Body for the LRTAP Convention (EB) of two Decisions (EB Decisions\n2012/1 and 2012/2), which amended the text of the Protocol and its Annexes and\nadded two new annexes (X and XI) [5].\nTwo other Decisions on the implementation of the Protocol provisions (provisional\napplication of adjustments to national emission reduction commitments[6] or to national emission\ninventories) were also adopted by consensus of the Parties.[7]\nEB Decision 2012/1, which updates the\ndefinitions of critical loads and critical levels, as set out in Annex I of the\nProtocol, does not call for ratification by the Parties. In accordance with\nArticle 13(4) of the Protocol, this amendment was communicated to all Parties\nto the Protocol on 7 March 2013[8]\nand entered into force on 5 June 2013.\nEB Decision (2012/2) amends the main text\nof the Protocol and all its Annexes (except for Annex I). In accordance with\nArticle 13(3) of the Protocol, this Decision has to be ratified by the Parties.\n\nThe amended Protocol sets out new national\nemission reduction commitments to be met by 2020 and beyond for the\nabove-mentioned four air pollutants as well as for fine particulate matter (PM2,5).\nIt also promotes emission reductions for black carbon (a component of\nparticulate matter a short-lived climate pollutant), updates the emission limit\nvalues set in the Protocol Annexes, establishes new standards on the content of\nnon-methane volatile organic compounds in products, and completes the reporting\nobligation of the Parties regarding the emissions of air pollutants as well as\nthe progress made in the fields of technology and research. \nThe amendment to the Protocol shall be\ntransposed into EU law through several legal instruments. To that purpose, the\nCommission has proposed a Directive of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil to amend[9]\nthe NEC Directive and a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council\non the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium\ncombustion plants[10].\nBoth those Directives shall apply alongside existing EU emission source control\nDirectives, including Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions[11]. \nIn view of the above, it is appropriate for\nthe European Union to accept the Amendment to the Protocol. \nThe Annex to this Decision includes the\namending text to the Protocol as laid down in Decision 2012/2 of the EB. \n2013/0448 (NLE)\nProposal
