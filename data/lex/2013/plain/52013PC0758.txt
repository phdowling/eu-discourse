EFSA was also asked to\r\nrecommend whether more precise risk management measures, notably monitoring\r\nplans, should be implemented. EFSA adopted the annex complementing its opinion\r\non non-target organisms on 7 November 2006 (published 21 November 2006).\r\nAfter the publication of the above annex, the Commission requested EFSA on 24\r\nJuly 2008 to review eleven scientific studies, published after the adoption of\r\nthe EFSA opinion of 19 January 2005, as well as any other relevant study, and to\r\nconfirm its risk assessment of 1507 maize.\nOn 29 October 2008 EFSA adopted its opinion\r\nwhich concluded that these publications do not provide new information that\r\nwould change previous risk assessments conducted on 1507 maize. Having also\r\nconsidered other recent scientific publications, EFSA reaffirmed its previous\r\nconclusions on the environmental safety of 1507 maize.\nAgainst this background, a draft Commission\r\nDecision to place the product on the market, in accordance with Article 18\r\nof Directive 2001/18/EC, was presented to the Regulatory Committee for vote on\r\n25 February 2009. The Committee delivered no opinion: 6 Member States (91\r\nvotes) voted in favour, 12 Member States (127 votes) voted against, 7 Member\r\nStates (95 votes) abstained and 2 Member States (32 votes) were not\r\nrepresented. \nFollowing a request of the Commission on 14\r\nJune 2010 to consider whether new scientific elements might require a revision\r\nof the conclusions of its scientific opinion adopted on 19 January 2005,\r\nEFSA adopted on 19 October 2011 a Scientific Opinion updating the evaluation of\r\nthe environmental risk assessment and risk management recommendations on insect\r\nresistant genetically modified maize 1507 for cultivation. The EFSA GMO Panel\r\nconcludes that, subject to appropriate management measures, maize 1507\r\ncultivation is unlikely to raise safety concerns for the environment. In\r\naddition, on 18 October 2012, EFSA adopted a Scientific Opinion supplementing\r\nthe 2011 opinion and providing with additional evidence and further clarifications.\r\n\nFollowing a further request of the\r\nCommission on 20 June 2012 for a consolidated opinion, EFSA adopted on 18\r\nOctober 2012 a Scientific Opinion updating the risk assessment conclusions and\r\nrisk management recommendations on the genetically modified insect resistant\r\nmaize 1507. The GMO EFSA Panel did not identify new scientific publications\r\nreporting new information that would invalidate its previous conclusions on the\r\nsafety of maize 1507.\nOn 26 September 2013, the General Court of\r\nthe European Union delivered its Judgement on the case T-164/10, Pioneer\r\nHi-Bred International v. European Commission, and declared that \"the\r\nEuropean Commission has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 18 of\r\nDirective 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March\r\n2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified\r\norganisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC by failing to submit to\r\nthe Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken pursuant to Article\r\n5(4) of Council Decision of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the\r\nexercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\".\nConsequently, pursuant to Article 30(2) of\r\nDirective 2001/18/EC and Article 5 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC, the Commission\r\nis required to submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be\r\ntaken, the Council having three months in which to act by a qualified majority,\r\nand inform the Parliament.\n2013/0368 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nconcerning the placing on the market for\r\ncultivation, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council, of a maize product (Zea mays L., line 1507)\r\ngenetically modified for resistance to certain lepidopteran pests\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the\r\ndeliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and\r\nrepealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC[1],\r\nand in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nCommission,\nAfter consulting the European Food Safety\r\nAuthority (hereinafter, EFSA),\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Directive\r\n2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of\r\na genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified\r\norganisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent\r\nauthority of the Member State that received the notification for the placing on\r\nthe market of that product, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that\r\nDirective.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A notification (Reference\r\nC/ES/01/01) concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified\r\nmaize product (Zea mays L., line 1507, hereinafter also \"1507\r\nmaize\") was submitted in 2001 by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and\r\nMycogen Seeds to the competent authority of Spain.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The notification covers the\r\nplacing on the market of seeds of varieties derived from the Zea mays L.,\r\nline 1507 for cultivation in the Union. The scope of the notification, as\r\nconfirmed by the consent-holder on 23 February 2007, does not cover the\r\ncommercial use of the product as a plant tolerant to glufosinate in the Union, since the pat gene for glufosinate tolerance was only to be used as a marker\r\ngene. In addition, the conditions of approval of the active substance\r\nglufosinate have been restricted to uses as herbicide for band or spot\r\napplication by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 365/2013[2] amending Implementing\r\nRegulation (EU) No 540/2011 as regards the conditions of approval of the active\r\nsubstance glufosinate. Therefore broadcast applications on maize fields cannot\r\nbe authorised.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\r\nprocedure under Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of\r\nSpain prepared an assessment report, which concluded that there is no\r\nscientific evidence to indicate that the placing on the market of the Zea\r\nmays L. line 1507 poses any risk to human and animal health or the\r\nenvironment for the requested uses.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assessment report was\r\nsubmitted in August 2003 to the Commission and the competent authorities of the\r\nother Member States, some of which raised and maintained objections to the\r\nplacing on the market of the product.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The opinion of EFSA,\r\nadopted on 19 January 2005[3],\r\nconcluded that Zea mays L. line 1507 is unlikely to have an adverse\r\neffect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its\r\nproposed use. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission convened a\r\ntechnical meeting with national competent authorities on 19 June 2006, to\r\naddress the remaining objections of Member States in view of the EFSA opinion;\r\ncertain Member States raised their concerns relating to the risk assessment of\r\nthe product and requested a better explanation of the potential effects of the\r\nBt toxin on non-target organisms and their monitoring. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission\r\nsubsequently requested EFSA to complement its opinion on Zea mays L.\r\nline 1507 by providing more specific information concerning the lepidopteran\r\nspecies referred to in the EFSA opinion of 19 January 2005; EFSA was also asked\r\nto recommend whether more precise risk management measures, notably monitoring\r\nplans, including specific scientific research studies on non-target organisms\r\nand taking account of geographical regions, should be implemented. EFSA adopted\r\nthe annex complementing its opinion on non-target organisms on 7 November 2006\r\n(published 21 November 2006). After the publication of the above annex,\r\neleven scientific studies, published after the adoption of the EFSA opinion of\r\n19 January 2005, came to the attention of the Commission. Therefore the\r\nCommission requested EFSA on 24 July 2008 to review these studies, as well\r\nas any other relevant study, and confirm its risk assessment of 1507 maize or\r\ncomment on whether these studies would lead EFSA to alter its conclusions or\r\nrefine them.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 29 October 2008 EFSA\r\nadopted its opinion which concluded that these publications do not provide new\r\ninformation that would change previous risk assessments conducted on maize\r\n1507. Having also considered other recent scientific publications, EFSA\r\nreaffirmed its previous conclusions on the environmental safety of maize 1507.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a request of the\r\nCommission to consider whether new scientific elements might require a revision\r\nof its scientific opinion of 19 January 2005, EFSA adopted on 19 October 2011[4] a Scientific Opinion updating\r\nthe evaluation of the environmental risk assessment and risk management\r\nrecommendations on insect resistant genetically modified maize 1507 for\r\ncultivation. The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that, subject to appropriate\r\nmanagement measures, maize 1507 cultivation is unlikely to raise safety concerns\r\nfor the environment. In addition, on 18 October 2012, EFSA adopted a Scientific\r\nOpinion[5]\r\nsupplementing the 2011 opinion and providing with additional evidence and\r\nfurther clarifications. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a further request\r\nof the Commission for a consolidated opinion, EFSA adopted on 18 October 2012[6] a Scientific Opinion updating\r\nthe risk assessment conclusions and risk management recommendations on the\r\ngenetically modified insect resistant maize 1507. The GMO EFSA Panel did not\r\nidentify new scientific publications reporting new information that would\r\ninvalidate its previous conclusions on the safety of maize 1507. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An examination of each of\r\nthe Member State objections in the light of (i) Directive 2001/18/EC, (ii) the\r\ninformation submitted in the notification and (iii) the opinions of EFSA,\r\ndiscloses no evidence to indicate that the placing on the market of Zea mays\r\nL. line 1507 is likely to cause adverse effects on human and animal health or\r\nthe environment in the context of its proposed use.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zea mays L., line\r\n1507 has been approved for feed use under Directive 2001/18/EC in accordance\r\nwith Commission Decision 2005/772/EC[7]\r\nand for food use under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 in accordance with\r\nCommission Decision 2006/197/EC[8].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A unique identifier has\r\nbeen assigned to the Zea mays L., line 1507 for the purposes of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\r\n22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically\r\nmodified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from\r\ngenetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC[9] and Commission Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and\r\nassignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms[10].\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the placing on the\r\nmarket of the Zea mays L., line 1507, the necessary measures to ensure\r\nits labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market,\r\nincluding verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should\r\nbe applied. A detection method for the Zea mays L., line 1507 has been\r\nvalidated by the European Union Reference Laboratory as referred to in the\r\nAnnex of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, in accordance with Commission Regulation\r\n(EC) No 641/2004 on detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No\r\n1829/2003[11].\r\n\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\r\nappropriate information for operators and consumers, and to facilitate better\r\nmanagement practices, the label, or an accompanying document, should also\r\nindicate that the product protects itself against the European corn borer (Ostrinia\r\nnubilalis), pink borers (Sesamia spp.), fall armyworms (Spodoptera\r\nfrugiperda), black cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon) and south-western corn\r\nborers (Diatraea grandiosella). \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As EFSA indicated in its\r\nopinion of 19 January 2005, \"the only adverse effect identified was the\r\npossibility that resistance to Bt toxin might evolve in corn borers exposed to\r\n1507 maize following cultivation for some years. The Panel accepts the\r\nmonitoring plan developed by the applicant to monitor specifically for\r\nresistance in corn borers and recommends that cultivation should be accompanied\r\nby appropriate risk management strategies to minimise exposure of both target\r\nand non-target insects to Bt toxins\". Therefore the consent holder should\r\ncarry out monitoring and provide instruction to farmers in order to ensure the\r\nimplementation by them of required measures, such as the planting of refuge\r\nmaize and monitoring, to minimise development of resistance in target pests and\r\nto assist farmers in cultivating Zea mays L., line 1507. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the EFSA\r\nOpinion of 19 January 2005, \"(..) management recommendations for the\r\ncultivation of 1507-maize, as given by the applicant to users of 1507 maize,\r\nconsiders measures to reduce exposure of non-target lepidoptera (as well as the\r\ntarget pest), such as the use of non-transgenic border rows as refugia for the\r\ntarget that would also reduce exposure of field margin weeds (and hence non-target\r\nlepidoptera) to pollen from Bt maize\". \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The refugia strategy should\r\ntake into account further recommendations of EFSA in its opinions of 19 October\r\n2011 and 18 October 2012. In particular, EFSA advises in its opinion of 2011\r\nthat \"In the case of a cluster of fields with an aggregate area greater\r\nthan 5 ha of Bt-maize, there shall be refugia equivalent to 20% of this\r\naggregate area, irrespective of individual field and farm size\". In its\r\nupdating opinion of 2012, EFSA recommends that \"in regions where maize\r\n1507 and Cry1Ab-expressing maize events would be cultivated together, refuge\r\nareas equivalent to 20% of the total Lepidoptera-active Bt-maize area are\r\nestablished due to the potential for cross-resistance between Cry1Ab and\r\nCry1F\". EFSA further recommends in its Supplementing opinion of 2012 that\r\n\"If a maize 1507 field has margins, then sown strips of non-Bt-maize,\r\nplaced between the edges of the Bt-maize crop and each margin, are considerably\r\nmore effective as a mitigation measure at reducing expected mortality than a\r\nsingle block of non-Bt-maize of comparable area, wherever the latter is\r\nplanted\". \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of best\r\npossible handling and use of the product, the consent holder should distribute\r\nwith each bag of seeds to the operators a leaflet detailing information about\r\nthe product and practices for its use.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring should be\r\nconducted in accordance with Article 20(1) of Directive 2001/18/EC, the\r\nmonitoring plan and revisions submitted by the notifier including commitments made\r\nin response to requests from competent authorities, and the opinions of EFSA. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nprovide for post-marketing surveillance measures to address unanticipated\r\neffects of maize lines expressing Bt proteins on non-target organisms in\r\nparticular.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in the\r\nnotification, the consent holder should undertake a monitoring study of\r\nunanticipated potential adverse effects on non-target organisms from\r\ncultivation of 1507 maize and report the outcome of this study to the rapporteur\r\ncompetent authority and the European Commission; the consent holder should also\r\nreport to the competent authorities of the other Member States.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Committee established\r\nunder Article 30(1) of Directive 2001/18/EC has not delivered an opinion within\r\nthe time-limit laid down by its Chairman;\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\r\nConsent\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to other Union\r\nlegislation, in particular Directive 2002/53/EC, written consent shall be\r\ngranted by the competent authority of Spain to the placing on the market for\r\ncultivation, in accordance with this Decision, of the product identified in\r\nArticle 2, as notified (Reference C/ES/01/01) by Pioneer Hi-Bred International,\r\nInc. and Mycogen Seeds.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consent shall, in accordance\r\nwith Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions\r\nto which the consent is subject, including any specific condition of use,\r\nhandling and packaging of the GMO(s) as or in products, and conditions for the\r\nprotection of particular ecosystems/environments and/or geographical areas,\r\nwhich are set out in Articles 3 (conditions for placing on the market) and 4\r\n(monitoring). \nArticle 2\r\nProduct\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The genetically modified\r\norganisms to be placed on the market as or in products, hereinafter \u2018the\r\nproduct\u2019, are seeds of maize (Zea mays L., line 1507), with resistance\r\nto the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and certain other\r\nlepidopteran pests and with tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium,\r\nderived from Zea mays L., line 1507, which has been transformed\r\nusing particle acceleration technology with the linear DNA fragment PHI8999A\r\ncontaining the following DNA in two expression cassettes:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cassette 1:\nA synthetic version of the truncated cry1F\r\ngene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai, which\r\nconfers resistance to the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and\r\ncertain other lepidopteran pests such as the pink borer (Sesamia spp.),\r\nfall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon)\r\nand south-western corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), under the\r\nregulation of the ubiquitin promoter ubiZM1(2) derived from Zea mays\r\nand the ORF25PolyA terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens pTi15995;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cassette 2:\nA synthetic version of the pat gene\r\nderived from Streptomyces viridochromogenes strain T\u00fc494, which confers\r\ntolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, under the regulation of the\r\nCaMV 35S promoter and terminator sequences.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consent shall cover seeds\r\nfrom genetically modified progeny derived from crosses of Zea mays L.,\r\nline 1507 with any traditionally bred maize as or in products. \nArticle 3\r\nConditions for placing on the market\nThe product\r\nmay be placed on the market subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with Article 15(4) of Directive 2001/18/EC, the period of validity\r\nof the consent shall be 10 years starting from the date at which the consent\r\nfor Zea mays L., line 1507 is issued;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the unique identifier of the\r\nproduct shall be DAS-\u00d815\u00d87-1;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 without prejudice to Article 25\r\nof Directive 2001/18/EC, the consent holder shall make available positive and\r\nnegative control samples of the product and its genetic materials to the\r\ncompetent authorities of Member States as well as to the National Reference Laboratories\r\nin charge of official controls on request;
