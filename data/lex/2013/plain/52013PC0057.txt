This structure is designed to\nfacilitate the transposition of the directives concerned by Member States into their\nrespective legal orders. The package of proposals for legal acts which the\nCommission has transmitted to the Council is composed of this series of\nproposals for Council directives on the one hand, as well as of a proposal for\na single Council regulation which covers the relevant European Parliament and\nCouncil regulations and decisions as well as the relevant Council regulations\nand decisions on the other hand. This is in line with the approach which was\ntaken in the past in view of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania[4].\nIt is foreseen that all the legal acts included\nin this package will be published in the Official Journal of the European\nUnion at the same date.\nThe present proposal and the other proposals\nincluded in this package will take into account technical adaptations to the acquis\nwhich were published in the Official Journal of the European Union until 1\nSeptember 2012. The reasons for this are to provide sufficient time for the\nlegislative processes involved on the one hand, and for the fulfilment of the ensuing\ntransposition and notification obligations by Member States as regards\ndirectives on the other hand. Adaptations which may be necessary to the acquis\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union after 1 September 2012\nwill be foreseen in the relevant acts themselves or done at a later stage\nthrough the appropriate procedure. In addition, the Commission intends to\ninformally provide a list of such legislation to Member States in early July\n2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nAs this proposal is of a purely technical\nnature and does not involve any political choices, consultations with\ninterested parties or impact assessments would not have made sense.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for this proposal is Article 50\nof the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia.\nThe principles of subsidiarity and\nproportionality are fully respected. The action of the Union is necessary under\nthe principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 (3) TEU) because it concerns technical\nadaptations to legal acts which were enacted by the Union. The proposal\nrespects the principle of proportionality (Article 5 (4) TEU) because it does\nnot go beyond what is necessary to reach the objective pursued.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no budgetary implications.\n2013/0036 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\nadapting certain directives in the field\nof transport policy, by reason of the accession of Croatia\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to the Treaty of Accession of\nthe Republic of Croatia, and in particular Article 3(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of\nthe Republic of Croatia, and in particular Article 50 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nCommission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Article 50 of\nthe Act of Accession, where acts of the institutions adopted prior to accession\nrequire adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary adaptations have\nnot been provided for in the Act of Accession or its Annexes, the Council,\nacting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall, to this\nend, adopt the necessary acts, if the original act was not adopted by the\nCommission.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Final Act of the\nConference which drew up the Treaty of Accession indicated that the High\nContracting Parties had reached political agreement on a set of adaptations to\nacts adopted by the institutions required by reason of accession and invited\nthe Council and the Commission to adopt these adaptations before accession,\ncompleted and updated where necessary to take account of the evolution of the\nlaw of the Union.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directives 91/440/EEC[5], 91/672/EEC[6], 92/106/EEC[7], 1999/37/EC[8], 1999/62/EC[9], 2003/59/EC[10], 2006/87/EC[11], and 2006/126/EC[12] should therefore be amended\naccordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirectives 91/440/EEC, 91/672/EEC,\n92/106/EEC, 1999/37/EC, 1999/62/EC, 2003/59/EC, 2006/87/EC, and 2006/126/EC shall be amended as set out in the Annex.\nArticle 2\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States shall adopt\nand publish, by the date of accession of the Republic of Croatia to the\nEuropean Union at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative\nprovisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
