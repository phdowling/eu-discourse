In its\npoint 2.4, the European Council invited the Commission to put forward proposals\nsetting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and\naccused persons by setting common minimum standards on fair trial rights. This\nmeasure forms also part of the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child to which\nthe European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social\nCommittee and the Council of Europe as well as key stakeholders such as UNICEF,\nthe Ombudspersons for Children in the Member States, and civil society have\ncontributed[2].\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures have\nalready been adopted: a Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal\nproceedings[3]\nin October 2010 and Directive 2012/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil on the right to information in criminal proceedings in May 2012[4] and Directive 2013/48/EU of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on the right of\naccess to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and in European arrest warrant\nproceedings, and on the right to have a third party informed upon deprivation\nof liberty and to communicate with third persons and with consular authorities\nwhile deprived of liberty[5].\nMeasures on the right to provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons\nwhile deprived of liberty are presented as a package with the present\ninitiative together with a Directive on the strengthening of certain aspects of\nthe presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial in criminal\nproceedings.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This proposal for a Directive\nsets out specific minimum rules concerning the rights of suspects or accused\nwho are children in criminal proceedings. In doing so, it promotes the application\nof the Charter, in particular Articles 4, 6, 7, 24, 47 and 48, relying on\nArticles 3, 5, 6 and 8 of the ECHR, as interpreted by the European Court of\nHuman Rights, which, in its case-law sets standards on special safeguards for\nvulnerable persons, in particular children. This case-law provides inter alia\nthat the fairness of proceedings and the right to a fair trial require a\nperson's ability to understand the minimum stakes of the procedure and have the\nability to participate and effectively exercise his rights and benefit from the\nprotection of privacy. Under these conditions, the strengthening of procedural\nsafeguards of children should be explicitly provided for in this Directive.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These measures should be\nimplemented taking into account the best interests of the child as set out in\nArticle 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suspects or accused who\nare children are recognised and treated with respect, dignity, professionalism,\nin a personal and non-discriminatory manner, whenever they are in contact with\nthe competent authority acting in the framework of criminal proceedings. This\nshould also facilitate the reintegration of children into society after they\nwere confronted with the criminal justice system. The rights set out in this\nDirective apply to children suspected or accused in a non-discriminatory\nmanner, including with regard to their residential status.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This measure is presented\ntogether with a Commission Recommendation on procedural safeguards for\nvulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings and vulnerable\npersons subject to European arrest warrant proceedings. \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposal is based on\nArticle 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to an effective\nremedy, to a fair trial and a right of defence are provided for in the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \"Charter\"), Articles\n47 and 48, and in Article 6 of the European Convention of Fundamental Rights (the\n\"ECHR\"). The ability to effectively exercise these rights largely\ndepends on the ability of the suspect or accused person to follow and fully\nparticipate in the procedure, which may be limited due to age, lack of maturity\nor disabilities. This means that for children and vulnerable adults special\nmeasures need to be taken to ensure that they can effectively participate in\nthe proceedings and benefit from their fair trial rights to the same extent as\nother suspects or accused persons.[6]\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the lack of a common\ndefinition of vulnerable adult persons and with a view to considerations linked\nto the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality the Commission has\nrefrained at this stage from extending the scope of this Directive to\nvulnerable adult persons. Instead, the Commission will adopt a Recommendation\ncalling upon Member States to put in place a number of safeguards for\nvulnerable persons.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 23 September\n2011, 26 April 2012 and 11 December 2012 three meetings with experts were held.\nRepresentatives of Member States as well as a panel of experts from the Council\nof Europe, International Association of Youth and Family Judges and\nMagistrates, the United Nations, medical and legal practitioners specialising\nin children cases discussed measures that could be taken at EU-level to\nincrease the protection of children and vulnerable adults in criminal\nproceedings.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission carried out\nan Impact Assessment to underpin its proposal. The report on the impact assessment\nis available at http://ec.europa.eu/governance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nArticle 1 \u2013 Subject matter\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The subject matter of the\nDirective is to lay down minimum rules concerning the rights of suspects or\naccused persons in criminal proceedings who are children and of children\nsubject to \"European arrest warrant proceedings.\"\nArticle 2 \u2013 Scope\n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Directive applies to\nchildren meaning persons under the age of 18 at the time when they are suspected\nor accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the\nproceedings. \n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National rules on the age\nof criminal responsibility for children will not be affected by this Directive.\nThis is the age when a child becomes criminally responsible for his or her\nactions.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain Member States\nchildren who have committed an act qualified as an offence are not subject to\ncriminal proceedings according to national law but other forms of proceedings\nwhich may lead to the imposition of certain restrictive measures (for instance\nprotection measures, education measures). Such proceedings do not fall within\nthe scope of this Directive.\nArticle 3 \u2013 Definition\n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\ninternational law instruments[7],\nany individual below the age of 18 will be considered as a child. \nArticle 4 \u2013 Right to information of\nchildren\n18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The child should be\ninformed promptly of the rights under this Directive, complementing the rights\nforeseen in Articles 3 to 7 of Directive 2012/13/EU with the exception of minor\noffences as provided for by Article 2(2) of Directive 2012/13/EU.\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the child is deprived of\nliberty, the Letter of Rights which shall be provided to the child in\naccordance with Article 6 of Directive 2012/13/EU shall contain also reference\nto the rights provided by this Directive.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should be\nimplemented in accordance with the standards set out in Directive 2010/64/EU on\nthe right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings.\nArticle 5 \u2013 Right to information of the\nholder of parental responsibility\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive provides\nfurther complementary safeguards with regard to the information of the holder\nof parental responsibility or an appropriate adult in order the take into\naccount the specific needs of children provided that this does not prejudice the\ndue course of the criminal proceedings against the person concerned and any\nother criminal proceedings.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \"holder of\nparental responsibility\" means any person or institution having parental\nresponsibility over a child as defined by Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 of\n27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of\njudgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The role of the holder of\nparental responsibility is important to ensure moral and psychological support\nand adequate guidance to the child. The holder of\nparental responsibility is well placed to enhance the protection of the rights\nof defence of the suspected child (e.g. to appoint a lawyer or to decide to\nappeal a decision). Moreover, the parents are also\nlegally responsible and can be held civilly liable for the behaviour of the\nchild. \n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This provision reflects\ninternational rules, such as the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of\nthe Council of Europe on child-friendly justice, the Beijing Rules and the 2007\nUN CRC General Comment N\u00b010 on Children's rights in juvenile justice. \n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the information of the\nholder of parental responsibility would be contrary to the best interests of\nthe child, this right should not be applied. This could be the case, for\nexample, if the holder of parental responsibility has been involved in the same\noffence as the child and there is a conflict of interest. In this case, another\nappropriate adult shall be informed and asked to be present. The term\n\"another appropriate adult\" refers to a relative or a person (other\nthan the holder of parental responsibility) with a social relationship with the\nchild who is likely to interact with the authorities and to enable the child to\nexercise his or her procedural rights.\nArticle 6 \u2013 Right to a lawyer\n26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article ensures\nmandatory access to a lawyer for children who are suspected or accused in\ncriminal proceedings.\n27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 6 (3) lit.c) ECHR\nand Articles 47 and 48 of the Charter guarantee the right of an individual to\nhave access to a lawyer. The Directive 2013/48/EU lays down general rules on\nsuch a right for all suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings.\nHowever, it allows suspects or accused persons to waive their right to be\nassisted by a lawyer. This Directive foresees as an additional safeguard that\nchildren may not waive this right. \n28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ECtHR has repeatedly\nunderlined the importance of assistance by a lawyer for children from the\noutset of the proceedings and during police questioning thereby suggesting that\na waiver can represent significant risks for them. The importance of access to\na lawyer for children is also recognised by all relevant international rules,\nsuch as the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe\non child-friendly justice[8],\nthe Beijing Rules[9]\nand the 2007 UN CRC 2007 General Comment N\u00b010 on Children's rights in juvenile\njustice[10].\n29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, with regard to certain\nminor offences, mandatory access to a lawyer would be disproportionate. This\nconcerns in particular minor traffic offences, minor offences in relation to\ngeneral municipal regulations and minor public order offences, which are\nconsidered to be criminal offences in some Member States. For such offences, the\ncompetent authorities other than a public prosecutor or a court having\njurisdiction in criminal matters do not need to ensure the right of mandatory\naccess to a lawyer granted under this Directive.\nArticle 7 \u2013 Right to an individual assessment\n30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article ensures that a\nchild has the right to an individual assessment. Such an individual assessment\nis needed in order to identify the child's specific needs in terms of\nprotection, education, training and re-integration into society, to determine\nif and to what extent he or she would need special measures during the criminal\nproceedings. The personal characteristics of a child, his or her maturity and\neconomic and social background may vary significantly.\n31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The individual assessment\nshould be carried out at an appropriate stage of the proceedings and at the\nlatest before the indictment. It should be recorded in accordance with national\nlaw.\n32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Without prejudice to\nArticle 8 of Directive 2011/36/EU, in the course of an individual assessment\nparticular attention should be given to children involved in criminal\nactivities which they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking\nin human beings.\n33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The extent and detail of\nsuch an assessment may be adapted according to the seriousness of the offence\nand the penalty imposed if the child is found guilty of the alleged offence.\nFor example, it is envisaged that a more in-depth assessment may be warranted\nin the case of a serious offence such as robbery or murder. \n34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The individual assessment\nshould be updated throughout the criminal proceedings and individual\nassessments that have been previously carried out with regard to the child may\nbe used, if they are updated.\n35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States may derogate\nfrom this obligation when it is not proportionate to carry out in an individual\nassessment taking into account the circumstances of the case and whether or not\nthe child has previously come to the attention of Member State authorities in\nthe context of criminal proceedings. In such cases, an authority for the\nprotection or welfare of children should be informed that an individual\nassessment is not carried out.\nArticle 8 \u2013 Right to medical examination\n\n36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Access to medical\nexamination by a physician and adequate medical care throughout a child's stay\nin detention is recommended by international legal instruments, such as the\n2007 UN General Comment N\u00b010 on the children's rights in juvenile justice.\nChildren, due to their young age and physical and mental immaturity, are more\nstrongly exposed to ill-treatment and health problems than other suspects or\naccused persons. Often they may not even able to properly express their health\nproblems. Particular care is needed to ensure their integrity, in particular in\ndetention.\n37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the child is deprived of\nliberty, the child should have the right to medical examination upon request by\nthe holder of parental responsibility, the appropriate adult or the child's\nlawyer. Such a medical examination should be carried out by a medical expert.\n38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case of prolongation of\ndeprivation of liberty or extension of measures taken against the child, a medical\nexamination may also be repeated.\n39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the medical examination\nof a child leads to the conclusion that the envisaged measures during the\ncriminal proceedings against the child (e.g. questioning of the child,\ndetention) are incompatible with the general mental and physical condition of\nthe child, the competent authorities should take appropriate measures in\naccordance with national law (e.g. postponement of questioning, medical\ntreatment of the child). Due account should be taken of the best interests of\nthe child. \nArticle 9\n\u2013 Questioning of children\n40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The questioning of children\nis a potentially risky situation where their procedural rights and dignity may\nnot always be respected and their vulnerability may not be duly taken into\naccount. \n41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nsufficient protection of children who are not always able to understand the\ncontent of interviews they are subject to, including during any questioning by the\npolice, interviews should be audio-visually recorded. However, it would not be\nproportionate to require that the competent authorities should ensure the\naudio-visual recording in all cases. Due account should be taken of the\ncomplexity of the case, the seriousness of the alleged offence and the\npotential sanction that can be incurred. However, if a child is deprived of\nliberty, questioning should always be recorded.\n42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such records must be\naccessible only to the judicial authorities and the parties of the proceedings\nto ensure their content and context. Any public dissemination of the records\nshould be prevented. Moreover, the length, style and pace of interviews should\nbe adapted to the age and maturity of the child questioned. \nArticle 10 \u2013 Right to liberty\n43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to liberty and\nsecurity of a person is enshrined in Article 5 (1) ECHR and Article 6 of the\nCharter.\n44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with international\nrules, such as Article 37 UN CRC, 2007 UN General Comment N\u00b010 on Children's\nrights in juvenile justice, point 79 and the Recommendation of the Committee of\nMinisters of the Council of Europe[11],\nany form of deprivation of liberty of children should be a measure of last\nresort and be for the shortest appropriate period of time[12].\n45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account these\ninternational standards, this Directive sets minimum rules as regards\ndetention. This is notwithstanding the compliance by Member States with these\ninternational standards as regards detention, in particular the separation of\nchildren from adults and access to educative measures, beyond conviction.\nArticle 11 \u2013 Alternative measures\n46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid deprivation\nof liberty for children, all measures alternative to deprivation of liberty\nshould be taken by the competent authorities whenever this is in the best\ninterests of the child. Such measures should include for instance reporting\nobligations to the competent authorities, restrictions on contacts with\nspecific persons or participation in therapeutic treatment or educational\nmeasures[13].\nArticle 12 - Right to specific treatment\nin case of deprivation of liberty\n47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases deprivation\nof liberty might be necessary, for example to avoid the risk of tampering with\nevidence, influencing witnesses, when there is a risk of collusion or flight\netc. In such cases, particular attention should be paid to the way detained\nchildren are treated.\n48.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, given the\nvulnerability of children deprived of liberty, the importance of family ties\nand promoting the reintegration into society, competent authorities should\nrespect and actively support the fulfilment of the rights of the child as set\nout in international and European instruments. In addition to other rights,\nchildren in particular should have the right to:\n(a)                   \nmaintain regular and meaningful contact with\nparents, family and friends. Restrictions on this right should never be used as\na punishment;\n(b)                   \nreceive appropriate education, guidance and\ntraining, \n(c)                   \nreceive medical\ncare. \n49.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\ninternational standards[14]\nchildren should be kept separately from adults in order to take into account\ntheir needs and vulnerability. When a detained child reaches the age of 18, the\nperson should have the possibility to continue the separate detention. For that\npurpose, the individual circumstances of the case should be taken into account.\nThe measures foreseen by this Directive do not require, however, the creation\nof separate detention facilities or prisons for children.\nArticle 13 \u2013 Timely and diligent\ntreatment of cases\n50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In proceedings involving\nchildren, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a rapid response\nand protect the best interests of the child. Courts should exercise particular\ndiligence to avoid any risk of adverse consequences on the family and social\nrelations of the child.\nArticle 14 \u2013 Right to protection of\nprivacy\n51.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirement to protect\nthe privacy of children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings is arising\nfrom international standards[15].\nThe involvement in criminal proceedings stigmatises the individuals concerned\nand may have in particular for children a detrimental impact on their chances\nfor reintegration into society and their future professional and social life.\nThe protection of privacy of children involved in criminal proceedings is a\ncritical component of the youth rehabilitation.\n52.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children should be judged\nin the absence of public. In exceptional cases the court may decide that a\nhearing is held publicly after it has taken due account of the best interests\nof the child.\n53.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, with regard to\nthe best interests of the child and the family, authorities should prevent that\ninformation that could lead to their identification is publicly disseminated\n(e.g. name and the image of the child and family members)\nArticle 15 \u2013 Right of access to court\nhearings of the holder of parental responsibility\n54.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure proper\nassistance and support of the child during court hearings, the holder of\nparental responsibility or another appropriate adult as referred to in Article 5\nshould be present. \nArticle 16 - Right of children to appear\nin person at the trial aiming at assessing the question of their guilt\n55.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If children are not present\nduring the trial, their rights of defence are at stake. The defendants are in\nsuch case neither able to give their version of the facts to the Court, nor are\nthey able to present evidence accordingly. They might therefore be found guilty\nwithout having had the opportunity to rebut the grounds for such a conviction. \n56.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right to be present at\ntrial, or being able to waive such right after having been informed of it, is\nindispensable for the exercise of the rights of defence. \n57.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 16 provides that\nMember States must ensure that the right to be present applies to any trial\naiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both\nconviction and acquittal decisions) in line with ECHR case-law. The presence of\nthe child at this moment in the criminal proceedings is of particular\nimportance given the consequences that moment could have.\nArticle 17 \u2013European arrest warrant proceedings\n58.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive applies to\nchildren subject to proceedings pursuant to Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA\nfrom the time they are arrested in the executing State. Improving the EAW\nsystem is a central tenet of the Commission's third report on implementation of\nthe Council Framework Decision on the EAW[16].\n59.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authorities\nin the executing Member States shall apply the rights as foreseen by the\ncurrent Directive. This will promote mutual trust and mutual recognition by\nproviding a minimum level of protection to children in the executing Member State as exists in the issuing Member State.\n60.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proceedings for the\nexecution of the EAW will not be delayed since this Article is without\nprejudice to the time-limits set out in the Framework decision. \n61.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the best\ninterests of the child and in accordance with international rules that any form\nof deprivation of liberty of children should be a measure of last resort and be\nfor the shortest appropriate period of time (see above, Article 10), the\ncompetent authorities shall take all measures to limit the duration of the\ndeprivation of liberty of children covered by such a EAW.\nArticle 18 \u2013 Right to legal aid\n62.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although this Directive\ndoes not seek to regulate the issue of legal aid, it requires Member States to ensure\nthat their domestic legal aid regimes guarantee the effective exercise of the\nright of access to a lawyer. \n63.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right of suspected or\naccused children to have provisional legal aid when deprived of liberty or when\nsubject to European arrest warrant proceedings will be covered by the [proposal\nfor a] Directive on the right to provisional legal aid for suspects or accused\npersons in criminal proceedings that are deprived of liberty and for requested\npersons in European arrest warrant proceedings and by the [proposal for a]\nCommission Recommendation on the right to legal aid for suspects and accused\npersons in criminal proceedings. In the latter, the situation of children is\nspecifically referred to as regards the 'means test' and the 'merits test'[17]. \nArticle 19 \u2013 Training\n64.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Judicial authorities, law\nenforcement authorities and prison staff dealing with cases involving children\nshould be aware of the particular needs of children of different age groups and\nshould take care that the proceedings are adapted to them. For that purpose\nthey need appropriate training with regard to children's legal rights and the\nneed of children of different age groups, child development and child\npsychology, pedagogical skills, communicating with children at all ages and\nstages of development and on children in situations of particular\nvulnerability.[18]\nAlso defense lawyers specialising in children\u2019s cases should benefit from such\ntraining. \n65.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those providing children\nwith support or restorative justice services should also be trained to an\nappropriate level to ensure that children are treated in a respectful,\nimpartial and professional manner.\nArticle 20 \u2013 Data collection\n66.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor and\nevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this Directive, there is a need\nfor collection of data by the Member States with regard to the exercise of the rights\nset out in this Directive. Relevant data include data recorded by the judicial\nauthorities and by law enforcement authorities and, as far as possible,\nadministrative data compiled by healthcare and social welfare services.\nArticle 21 \u2013 Costs\n67.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The costs resulting from\nthe application of this Directive with regard to the assessment of the child,\nthe medical examination and audio-visual recording are to be met by Member\nStates, even in the event of conviction of the suspected or accused child.\nArticle 22 \u2013 Non-regression clause\n68.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article ensures that\nsetting common minimum standards in accordance with this Directive does not\nhave the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the\nstandards set in the Charter and in the ECHR are maintained. Since this\nDirective provides for minimum rules, Member States remain free to set\nstandards higher than those agreed in this Directive.\nArticle 23 \u2013 Transposition\n69.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States must\nimplement the Directive [24 months after its publication] and, by the same\ndate, transmit the text of the provisions transposing it into national law to\nthe Commission.\n70.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should notify\ntheir transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the\nrelationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts\nof national transposition instruments. \nArticle 24 \u2013 Entry into force\n71.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Article provides that\nthe Directive will enter into force on the twentieth day following its\npublication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 subsidiarity principle\n72.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the\nproposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, since the aim\nof the proposal is to promote mutual trust between them and it is therefore\nimportant to agree on common minimum standards on procedural safeguards for\nchildren suspected or accused in criminal proceedings across the European\nUnion. The need for EU action and explanations on why the EU is better placed\nto take action on special safeguards for children confronted to criminal\nproceedings is further developed in the Impact Assessment accompanying the\nproposal for a Directive. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 proportionality principle\n73.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposal complies with\nthe proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum\nrequired in order to achieve the stated objective at European level and what is\nnecessary for that purpose. Measures aimed at achieving more harmonisation of standards\nwere discarded, such as the age of criminal responsibility, establishment of\nyouth courts, rules on diversion from justice systems, which would have lead to\nsubstantial changes of criminal justice systems in Member States. For reasons\nof proportionality of EU action, the Directive does not therefore propose a\ncomprehensive set of rules for children in criminal proceedings. It only sets\nup minimum rules that are considered indispensable to meet the objective of\nachieving an effective standard of protection for children and to enhance\nmutual trust and judicial cooperation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 budgetary implications\n74.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This proposal has no\nbudgetary implications for the budget of the EU.\n2013/0408 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non procedural safeguards for children\nsuspected or accused in criminal proceedings\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(2)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[19],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[20],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of this\nDirective is to establish procedural safeguards to ensure that children who are\nsuspected or accused in criminal proceedings are able to understand and follow\nthose proceedings, to enable such children to exercise their right to a fair\ntrial and to prevent re-offending by children and foster their social\nintegration.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By establishing minimum\nrules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons,\nthis Directive should strengthen the trust of Member States in the criminal\njustice systems of other Member States and can thus help improve mutual\nrecognition of decisions in criminal matters. Such common minimum rules should\nalso remove obstacles to the free movement of citizens throughout the territory\nof the Member States.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the Member States\nare parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\nand the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, experience has\nshown that this in itself does not always provide a sufficient degree of trust\nin the criminal justice systems of other Member States.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Stockholm Programme[21] put a strong focus on the\nstrengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. In its\npoint 2.4, the European Council invited the Commission to put forward proposals\nsetting out a step by step approach[22]\nto strengthening the rights of suspects or accused persons. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three measures have been\nadopted to date, namely Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council[23],\nDirective 2012/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[24] and Directive 2013/48/EU of\nthe European Parliament and the Council[25].\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive promotes\nthe rights of the child, taking into account the Guidelines of the Council of\nEurope on child-friendly justice. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children who are suspects\nor accused in criminal cases should be given special attention in order to\npreserve their potential for development and reintegration into society.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should apply\nto children meaning persons under the age of 18 at the time when they become suspected\nor accused of having committed an offence, regardless of their age during the\ncriminal proceedings until the final judgment.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should also\napply in respect of offences which have been committed after the age of 18\nyears by the same suspect or accused person and which are jointly investigated\nand prosecuted as they are inextricably linked to offences where criminal\nproceedings started against that person before the age of 18.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When, at the time a person\nbecomes a suspect or accused person in criminal proceedings, that person is\nabove the age of 18, Member States are encouraged to apply the procedural\nsafeguards foreseen by this Directive until this person reaches the age of 21.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should\ndetermine the age of children on the basis of the children\u2019s own statements, checks\nof their civil status, documentary research, other evidence and, if such\nevidence is unavailable or inconclusive, on the basis of a medical examination.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive should be\nimplemented taking into account the provisions of Directive 2012/13/EU and\nDirective 2013/48/EU. Information with regard to minor offences should be\nprovided under the same conditions as provided for by Article 2(2) of Directive\n2012/13/EU. However, this Directive provides further complementary safeguards\nwith regard to information to be provided to the holder of parental\nresponsibility and mandatory access to a lawyer in order to take into account\nthe specific needs of children. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a child is deprived of liberty, the Letter of Rights provided to\nthe child pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2012/13/EU should include clear\ninformation on the child\u2019s rights under this Directive. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \"holder of\nparental responsibility\" means any person having parental responsibility\nover a child as defined in Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003[26]. Parental responsibility means\nall rights and duties relating to the person or the property of a child which\nare given to a natural or legal person by judgment, by operation of law or by\nan agreement having legal effect, including rights of custody and rights of\naccess.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children should have the\nright to have the holder of parental responsibility informed about applicable\nprocedural rights, either orally or in writing. This information should be\nprovided promptly and in such detail as is necessary to safeguard the fairness\nof the proceedings and the effective exercise of the rights of defence of the\nchild. Where it would be contrary to the best interests of the child to inform\nthe holder of parental responsibility of those rights, another appropriate\nadult should be informed. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children should not be able\nto waive their right of access to a lawyer because they are not able to fully\nunderstand and follow criminal proceedings. Therefore, the presence or assistance\nof a lawyer should be mandatory for children.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some Member States an\nauthority other than a public prosecutor and a court having jurisdiction in\ncriminal matters has competence for imposing penalties other than deprivation\nof liberty in relation to relatively minor offences. That may be the case, for\nexample, in relation to traffic offences which are committed on a large scale\nand which might be established following a traffic control. In such situations,\nit would be unreasonable to require the competent authorities to ensure\nmandatory access to a lawyer. Where the law of a Member State provides for the\nimposition of a penalty regarding minor offences by such an authority and there\nis either a right of appeal or the possibility for the case to be otherwise\nreferred to a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters, mandatory access\nto a lawyer should therefore apply only to the proceedings before that court\nfollowing such an appeal or referral. In some Member States proceedings\ninvolving children may be dealt with by public prosecutors who may impose\npenalties. In such proceedings children should have mandatory access to a\nlawyer. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some Member States\ncertain minor offences, in particular minor traffic offences, minor offences in\nrelation to general municipal regulations and minor public order offences, are\nconsidered to be criminal offences. It would be disproportionate to require the\ncompetent authorities to ensure mandatory access to a lawyer in respect of such\nminor offences. Where the law of a Member State provides that deprivation of\nliberty cannot be imposed as a penalty in respect of minor offences, the right\nto mandatory access to a lawyer should therefore apply only to proceedings\nbefore a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children who are suspected\nor accused in criminal proceedings should have the right to an individual\nassessment to identify their specific needs in terms of protection, education,\nformation and social integration, to determine if and to what extent they would\nneed special measures during the criminal proceedings and to determine the\nextent of their criminal responsibility and the adequacy of a penalty or\neducative measure for them. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\npersonal integrity of a child who is arrested or detained, the child should\nhave access to a medical examination. The medical examination should be carried\nout by a physician.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nsufficient protection of children who are not always able to understand the\ncontent of interviews to which they are subject, to avoid any challenge of the\ncontent of an interview and thereby undue repetition of questioning, questioning\nof children should be audio-visually recorded. This does not include questioning\nnecessary to identify the child.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it would be\ndisproportionate to require the competent authorities to ensure audio-visual\nrecording in all circumstances. Due account should be taken of the complexity\nof the case, the seriousness of the alleged offence and the potential penalty\nthat can be incurred. If a child is deprived of liberty before conviction, any\nquestioning of the child should be audio-visually recorded. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such audio-visual records should\nbe accessible only to the judicial authorities and the parties to the proceedings.\nMoreover, the questioning of children should be carried out in a manner that\ntakes into account their age and level of maturity.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When deciding the issue of\nlegal aid, Member States should aim at having rules which guarantee the\neffective exercise of the right to access to a lawyer for children.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children are in a\nparticularly vulnerable position in relation to detention. Special efforts should\nbe undertaken to avoid deprivation of liberty of children given the inherent\nrisks for their physical, mental and social development. The competent\nauthorities should consider alternative measures and impose such measures whenever\nthis is in the best interests of the child. This may include the obligation to\nreport to a competent authority, a restriction on contact with specific\npersons, a requirement to undergo therapeutic treatment or treatment for\naddiction and participation in educational measures. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When deprivation of liberty\nis imposed on children, they should benefit from special protection measures. In\nparticular they should be held separately from adults unless it is considered\nin the child's best interest not to do so, in accordance with Article 37(c) of\nthe United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child. When a detained child\nreaches the age of 18 years, there should be the possibility to continue the\nseparate detention where warranted, taking into account the individual\ncircumstances of the case. Particular attention should be paid to the way\ndetained children are treated given their inherent vulnerability. Children\nshould have access to educational facilities according to their needs.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professionals in direct\ncontact with children should take into account the particular needs of children\nof different age groups and should take care that the proceedings are adapted\nto them. For that purpose, they should be specially trained in dealing with\nchildren.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children should be judged\nin the absence of the public in order to protect their privacy and to\nfacilitate their re-integration into society. In exceptional cases the court\nmay decide that a hearing should be held publicly after it has taken due\naccount of the best interests of the child. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\nappropriate assistance and support of children, the holder of parental\nresponsibility or another appropriate adult should have access to the court\nhearings involving the suspected or accused child.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The right of an accused\nperson to appear in person at the trial is based on the right to a fair trial\nprovided for in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as interpreted by the European Court of\nHuman Rights. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rights provided for by\nthis Directive should apply to children subject to European arrest warrant\nproceedings from the time they are arrested in the executing Member State. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any individual assessment,\nmedical examination and audio-visual recording provided for by this Directive\nshould be carried out free of charge for the child.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to monitor and\nevaluate the effectiveness of this Directive, there is a need for collection of\ndata by the Member States with regard to the implementation of the rights set\nout in this Directive. Relevant data include data recorded by the judicial\nauthorities and by law enforcement authorities and, as far as possible,\nadministrative data compiled by healthcare and social welfare services as\nregards the rights set out in this Directive, in particular in relation to the\nnumber of children given access to a lawyer, the number of individual\nassessments carried out, the number of interviews audio-visually recorded and\nthe number of children deprived of liberty. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive upholds the\nfundamental rights and principles as recognised by the Charter of Fundamental\nRights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, including the prohibition of torture and\ninhuman and degrading treatment, the right to liberty and security, respect for\nprivate and family life, the right to the integrity of the person, the rights\nof the child, integration of persons with disabilities, the right to an\neffective remedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the\nrights of defence. This Directive should be implemented in accordance with\nthose rights and principles.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive sets minimum\nrules. Member States may extend the rights set out in this Directive in order\nto provide a higher level of protection. Such higher level of protection should\nnot constitute an obstacle to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions that\nthose minimum rules are designed to facilitate.
