These substances,\r\nwhich act on the central nervous system, modifying mental functions, also have\r\nuses in industry or research - as active substances for medicines, for\r\ninstance. A rising number of individuals, in particular young people, consume new\r\npsychoactive substances, despite the risks that they may pose, which may be\r\ncomparable to those posed by UN-controlled drugs. \nDuring the past years, one new psychoactive\r\nsubstance was reported every week in the EU, and the rapid pace of notification\r\nis expected to continue in the coming years. These substances are sold freely,\r\nunless public authorities subject them to various restriction measures,\r\nunderpinned by administrative or criminal sanctions, because of the risks that\r\nthey pose when consumed by humans. Such national restriction measures, which may\r\ndiffer depending on the Member State and on the substance, can hamper trade in\r\nthe internal market and hinder the development of future industrial or\r\ncommercial uses. \nNew\r\npsychoactive substances are not subjected to control measures under the UN\r\nConventions on Drugs, unlike psychoactive substances such as cocaine or\r\namphetamines, although they could be considered for UN-level control on the basis\r\nof a risk assessment conducted by the World Health Organisation at the request\r\nof at least one UN Member State. \nThe Commission Communication \"Towards\r\na stronger European response to drugs\"[1],\r\nadopted in October 2011, identified the spread of new psychoactive substances as\r\none of the most challenging developments in drugs policy requiring a firmer EU response.\r\nThe Communication set the ground for new EU legislative proposals on new\r\npsychoactive substances, building on the Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the\r\ninformation exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances[2].\r\nIn December 2011[3],\r\nthe Council requested the Commission to table a legislative proposal revising\r\nCouncil Decision 2005/387/JHA. A legislative proposal on new psychoactive\r\nsubstances is foreseen in the Commission's 2013 Work Programme[4].\nThis proposal for a Regulation aims at improving\r\nthe functioning of the internal market regarding licit uses of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances, by reducing obstacles to trade, preventing the emergence of such obstacles\r\nand increasing legal certainty for economic operators, while reducing the\r\navailability of substances that pose risks through swifter, more effective and\r\nmore proportionate EU action. It is accompanied by a proposal for a Directive amending\r\nCouncil Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum\r\nprovisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the\r\nfield of illicit drug trafficking[5].\r\nThis aims at expanding the scope of application of the Framework Decision to\r\ncover the most harmful new psychoactive substances, which pose severe\r\nrisks. This means that substances that pose severe health, social and safety\r\nrisks and are, therefore, submitted to permanent market restriction under this\r\nproposed Regulation, are also covered, through the proposed amended Framework\r\nDecision, by the criminal law provisions applying to controlled drugs. \nThe case for swifter, more effective and\r\nmore proportionate action on new psychoactive substances at EU level is\r\ncompelling, considering the rapid changes in this market, which put national\r\nauthorities under pressure to act. During the past years, Member States have\r\nnotified an increasing number of new psychoactive substances to the European\r\nMonitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). Between 1997 and 2012\r\nthey reported around 290 substances. The number of notified substances tripled between\r\n2009 and 2012 (from 24 to 73). Around 80% of these substances were reported by\r\nmore than one Member State. The number of substances that can emerge may run\r\ninto the thousands because many variations of existing or new, still\r\nunexploited substances, can be manufactured at relatively low cost. The issue\r\nhas been further highlighted in the 2012[6]\r\nand 2013[7]\r\nEMCDDA annual reports, as well as in the EMCCDA-Europol \"EU drug markets\r\nreport: a strategic analysis\"[8],\r\npublished in January 2013.\nConsumption of new psychoactive substances appears\r\nto be increasing in Europe and use is predominant among young people. According\r\nto the 2011 Eurobarometer \"Youth attitudes on drugs\", 5% of young\r\npeople in the EU have used such substances at least once in their life, with a\r\npeak of 16% in Ireland, and close to 10% in Poland, Latvia and the UK.\r\nAccording to the results of snapshot surveys conducted by the EMCDDA, the\r\nnumber of online shops selling new psychoactive substances increased four-fold\r\nbetween 2010 and 2012, to 690.\nThe consumption of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances can cause harms to individuals' health and safety, resulting in\r\ndeaths, injury or disease, and can pose risks to and burdens on society, as it may\r\nlead to violent behaviour and crime. These risks are amplified by the fact that\r\nmany such substances are sold to consumers without appropriate labelling and\r\ninstructions of use. In some cases they are sold on the black market alongside,\r\nor instead of, controlled drugs.\nThe rapid emergence and spread of these\r\nsubstances, and the potential risks that they pose, have led national\r\nauthorities to subject them to various restriction measures. Hundreds such\r\nsubstances or mixtures of substances have been subjected to different\r\nrestriction measures in the Member States in the past years. Such national measures\r\ndisrupt trade in licit uses of these substances. Around a fifth of the\r\nsubstances notified by the Member States have other uses (but information on such\r\nuses is not collected systematically across the EU). \nNational restriction measures, which can\r\nvary depending on the Member State and on the substance, lead to obstacles to\r\ntrade in licit uses, fragmentation, an uneven level playing field and legal uncertainties\r\nfor economic operators, and make it difficult for companies to operate across\r\nthe internal market. They make research more cumbersome, hampering the\r\ndevelopment of new uses for these substances. They have a chain-reaction impact\r\non operators in different markets, because such substances are used in the\r\nproduction of other substances or mixtures, which in turn are used for\r\nmanufacturing various goods. As the market for new psychoactive substances is\r\nlikely to grow, so will these obstacles to licit trade. \nIn order to facilitate the functioning of\r\nthe internal market while protecting consumers from harmful new psychoactive\r\nsubstances, EU-level action shall ensure the free movement of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances for commercial and industrial use, and for scientific research and\r\ndevelopment, and provide for a graduated set of restriction measures for\r\nsubstances posing risks, proportionate to their level of risk. \nThis proposal, therefore, sets up a robust\r\nsystem for exchanging rapidly information on new psychoactive substances\r\nemerging on the market, including on their commercial and industrial uses, for\r\nassessing the risks of substances that cause EU-wide concern and for\r\nwithdrawing from the market those substances that pose risks. \nThe substances suspected to pose immediate\r\npublic health risk will be withdrawn from the consumer market temporarily,\r\npending their risk assessment. Once the risk assessment is completed, measures will\r\nbe taken proportionate to the risks of substances. While no restrictions will\r\nbe introduced at the EU level on substances posing low health, social and\r\nsafety risks, substances posing moderate risks will be subjected to consumer\r\nmarket restriction, which means that they cannot be sold to consumers (except for\r\nuses specifically authorised, for instance by medicines legislation) but their\r\ntrade is allowed for commercial and industrial purposes as well as for\r\nscientific research and development. \nNew psychoactive substances posing severe\r\nrisks will be subjected to permanent market restriction, covering both the\r\nconsumer and commercial markets, and their use will only be possible for\r\nspecifically authorised industrial and commercial purposes, as well as for\r\nscientific research and development. In addition, as explained above, these substances\r\nwill be subjected to EU criminal law provisions under the accompanying proposal\r\nfor a Directive amending the Framework Decision on illicit drug trafficking. \nIn relation to new psychoactive substances\r\non which the EU has not acted, Member States may introduce national technical\r\nregulations, in full compliance with the EU provisions preventing the emergence\r\nof unjustified barriers to trade[9].\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal context\nSoon after a borderless internal market was\r\ncreated, and following the emergence and rapid spread of synthetic drugs, such\r\nas amphetamines and ecstasy, it became clear that the effectiveness of national\r\nactions is limited and that EU action was necessary to contain the spread of\r\nharmful substances. The EU Joint Action 97/396/JHA concerning the information\r\nexchange, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs[10] was adopted in 1997 to address\r\nthis problem. \nCouncil Decision 2005/387/JHA, which\r\nrepealed Joint Action 97/396/JHA, established an EU-wide system for tackling\r\nnew psychoactive substances (synthetic and natural) that raise concern at EU\r\nlevel. It lays down rules on the exchange of information on these substances\r\nbetween Member States, coordinated by the EMCDDA and Europol, on the assessment\r\nof their risks and the submission to control and criminal penalties across the EU\r\nof those substances that pose risks.\nThe Commission's assessment report[11] of July 2011, concluded that,\r\nwhile Council Decision 2005/387/JHA is a useful instrument, it is inadequate,\r\nconsidering the scale and complexity of the problem, and it, therefore,\r\nrequires revision. This is because it involves a lengthy process, it is\r\nreactive and it lacks options to the submission to control and criminal penalties.\r\n\nThis Regulation replaces Council Decision\r\n2005/387/JHA.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultations with\r\ninterested parties\nBroad stakeholder and expert consultations\r\ntogether with a web-based public consultation and an external study have\r\ninformed the preparatory work for this proposal. The Commission involved all\r\nMember States in the assessment of the functioning of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA,\r\nthrough written consultation. In the context of the external study, the\r\nCommission collected and examined the views of a host of national authorities\r\n(responsible for drug legislation, justice and health ministries, health\r\ninstitutes and law enforcement agencies) and of EU agencies involved in the\r\nimplementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA. It also collected and examined\r\nthe views of international organisations (including the World Health Organisation),\r\ncivil society organisations, economic operators in various markets, research\r\ninstitutes and academic experts.\nThe survey conducted among Member States in\r\nthe context of the assessment report showed that a large number of Member\r\nStates view the lack of alternatives to control and criminal penalties in the\r\ncurrent instrument as inadequate and suggest that a wider range of options\r\nshould be considered, backed by administrative law. Moreover, all Member States\r\nagreed that swifter action is necessary to address new psychoactive substances (including\r\ntemporary measures) and that the current decision-making process is too slow. \nDuring the two experts' meetings organised\r\nby the Commission on 15 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, academic experts and\r\npractitioners stressed that the Council Decision and product safety legislation\r\nare inadequate to tackle the large number of new psychoactive substances emerging\r\non the market, whose effects and risks are mostly unknown. They pointed out\r\nthat new legislation on new psychoactive substances should be calibrated to the\r\ndifferent levels of risks posed by these substances. Certain participants\r\nexpressed concern that too rigorous policy responses (such as blanket\r\nrestrictions on entire groups of substances or a wide recourse to criminal penalties)\r\ncould have adverse effects. Such adverse effects include a displacement of\r\nsubstances from the licit to the illicit market, a replacement of the\r\nsubstances withdrawn from the market with other substances, possibly even more\r\nharmful, and rendering such substances inaccessible for research. \nSurveys and interviews were conducted with\r\neconomic operators which manufacture such substances for various industrial\r\nuses, and with their trade associations, as well as with those who produce or\r\ndistribute new psychoactive substances for recreational use. Recreational users\r\nof new psychoactive substances were also interviewed. \nThe views of young people (15-24 years'\r\nold) were collected through the 2011 Eurobarometer \"Youth attitudes on\r\ndrugs\". Almost half of respondents (47%) thought that only those\r\nsubstances which are proved to pose risks to health should be restricted, while\r\n34% held that all substances which imitate the effects of controlled drugs\r\nshould be restricted. \nThe Commission run a public consultation on\r\ndrugs policy from 28 October 2011 to 3 February 2012. It included a question on\r\nregulatory measures that the EU should develop to contain the spread of new\r\npsychoactive substances. Among the 134 replies, most stressed the need for more\r\nrapid action on new psychoactive substances and warned against imposing\r\ncriminal sanctions indiscriminately. The European Economic and Social Committee\r\nhas urged[12]\r\nthe Commission to explore options that avoid making the personal use of such\r\nsubstances a criminal offence. \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nThe Commission conducted an impact\r\nassessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the consultation of\r\ninterested parties and the results of external studies. The impact assessment\r\nconcluded that the following solution would be preferred:\n\u2013                        \r\na more graduated and better targeted set of\r\nrestriction measures on new psychoactive substances, which should not hinder the\r\nindustrial use of substances. \n\u2013                        \r\nrestriction measures should be introduced\r\nearlier and substances suspected to pose immediate public health risks should\r\nbe subjected to temporary restrictions.\n\u2013                        \r\nrestriction measures should be proportionate to\r\na better determined level of risk of substances, with substances posing\r\nmoderate risks subjected to restrictions on the consumer market (covered by\r\nadministrative law), while substances posing severe risks should be subjected\r\nto a wider market restriction, as well as being covered by criminal law.\n\u2013                        \r\nrestriction measures should be introduced\r\nthrough a quicker procedure. \nThe impact assessment concluded that the\r\nmost effective way to keep harmful new psychoactive substances out of the\r\nmarket is to apply the EU provisions on illicit drug trafficking to new\r\npsychoactive substances that pose severe risks. Applying the same criminal law\r\nprovisions to controlled drugs and to equally harmful new psychoactive\r\nsubstances, posing severe risks, will help deter trafficking in such substances\r\nand the involvement of criminal groups, while streamlining and clarifying the\r\nEU legal framework on drugs.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal base\nThe proposal aims at ensuring that trade in\r\nnew psychoactive substances having industrial and commercial uses is not\r\nhindered and that the functioning of this market is improved, while the health\r\nand safety of individuals are protected from harmful substances, which cause\r\nconcern at the EU level.\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which empowers the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council to adopt measures for the approximation of\r\nthe provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member\r\nStates which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the\r\ninternal market. Article 114(3) TFEU requires the Commission to ensure a high\r\nlevel of health, safety and consumer protection in its proposals envisaged in paragraph\r\n1 of Article 114 TFEU. This proposal falls within the scope of action to\r\nimprove the functioning of the internal market for the following reasons:\n\u2013                        \r\nit addresses obstacles to trade in new\r\npsychoactive substances having dual uses, while enabling the adoption of\r\nmeasures to restrict the availability to consumers of substances posing risks.\n\u2013                        \r\nit addresses the lack of legal certainty for\r\neconomic operators by harmonising the response given to substances causing\r\nconcern across the EU.\n\u2013                        \r\nit connects the market for industrial uses of new\r\npsychoactive substances to the wider internal market.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity,\r\nproportionality and the respect for fundamental rights\nThere is a clear need for EU action on new\r\npsychoactive substances. This is because Member States alone cannot reduce the\r\nproblems caused by the spread in the internal market of harmful new\r\npsychoactive substances and by the proliferation of divergent national\r\nresponses. Uncoordinated national action in this area can produce adverse\r\nknock-on effects, for instance hindrance to the operation of the internal\r\nmarket as far as licit trade in these substances is concerned or displacement\r\nof harmful substances from one Member State to another. \nConsequently, EU-level action is necessary\r\nto ensure that potentially harmful new psychoactive substances, which cause\r\nEU-wide concern, can be identified, assessed and, if they pose risks, withdrawn\r\nfrom the market rapidly in all Member States. \nThe proposal is relevant for the following\r\nrights and principles enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: the\r\nright to health care (notably to a high level of human health protection,\r\nArticle 35) and to consumer protection (Article 38), the respect of the freedom\r\nto conduct a business (Article 16), the right to property (Article 17), the\r\nright to an effective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47), the presumption\r\nof innocence and right to defence (Article 48). These rights and freedoms can\r\nbe subject to limitations, but only under the limits and requirements set by\r\nArticle 52(1) of the EU Charter.\nThe proposal is proportionate and does not\r\ngo beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives because it only addresses\r\nnew psychoactive substances that are a concern at the EU level and because it\r\nsets out a calibrated, graduated approach, under which measures are proportionate\r\nto the actual risks of substances. \nExplicit safeguards laid down in the\r\ninstrument itself guarantee that any person whose rights are affected by the\r\nimplementation of any administrative measures or sanctions pursuant to the\r\nRegulation shall have the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal. \n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instrument\nIn order to establish uniform rules, ensure\r\nclarity of concepts and procedures, and provide legal certainty for market\r\noperators, while ensuring that restriction measures are directly applicable in\r\nall Member States, a Regulation is the appropriate instrument. \n3.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific\r\nprovisions\nArticle\r\n1: Subject matter and scope \u2013 this provision sets\r\nout the purpose and scope of the proposal, and in particular that it establishes\r\nrules for restrictions to the free movement of new psychoactive substances in\r\nthe internal market.\nArticle 2: Definitions \u2013 this provision sets out definitions which apply throughout the\r\ninstrument. \nArticle 3: Free movement \u2013 this provision lays down the principle of free movement of new\r\npsychoactive substances for industrial and commercial uses, and for research\r\nand development.\nArticle 4: Prevention of barriers to\r\nfree movement \u2013 this provision clarifies under what\r\nconditions Member States may introduce restrictions on new psychoactive\r\nsubstances.\nArticle 5: Information exchange \u2013 this provision establishes the respective roles of Member States,\r\nthe EMCDDA and Europol in the process of exchange of information on new psychoactive\r\nsubstances. \nArticle 6: Joint report \u2013 this provision lays down the contents and the procedures for the\r\ndrawing up and the transmission by the EMCDDA and Europol of a joint report on a\r\nnew psychoactive substance.

It lays down the procedures for the risk\r\nassessment, which is to be conducted by the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA,\r\nand for the drawing up and the transmission of a risk assessment report. \nArticle 8: Exclusion from risk\r\nassessment \u2013 this provision details such\r\ncircumstances in which no risk assessment is to be conducted on a new\r\npsychoactive substance.\nArticle 9: Immediate risks to public\r\nhealth and temporary consumer market restriction \u2013 this\r\nprovision lays down the criteria on the basis of which the Commission determines\r\nwhether a new psychoactive substance poses immediate risks to public health, and\r\nempowers the Commission to prohibit, temporarily, the making available of this\r\nsubstance on the consumer market, if it poses such immediate risks to public\r\nhealth.\nArticle 10: Determination of the level\r\nof health, social and safety risks following the risk assessment \u2013 this provision lays down the criteria on the basis of which the\r\nCommission determines the level of health, social and safety risks posed by a\r\nnew psychoactive substance. \nArticle 11: Low risks \u2013 this provision sets out that the Commission shall introduce no\r\nrestriction measures on new psychoactive substances posing low health, social\r\nand safety risks and provides a definition of low risks.\nArticle 12: Moderate risks and permanent\r\nconsumer market restriction \u2013 this provision\r\nempowers the Commission to prohibit the making available on the consumer market\r\nof new psychoactive substances which pose moderate health, social and safety\r\nrisks, and provides a definition of moderate risks. \nArticle 13: Severe risks and permanent\r\nmarket restriction \u2013 this provision empowers the\r\nCommission to prohibit the production, manufacture, making available on the market,\r\ntransport, importation or exportation of new psychoactive substances which pose\r\nsevere health, social and safety risks, and provides a definition of severe risks.\nArticle 14: Authorised uses \u2013 this provision sets out the exceptions to the market restrictions\r\nintroduced under the Regulation. \nArticle 15: Monitoring \u2013 this provision lays down monitoring obligations with regard to\r\nsubstances on which a joint report has been drawn up. \nArticle 16: Re-examination of the level\r\nof risks \u2013 this provision sets out the procedure\r\nfor re-examining the level of risks posed by a new psychoactive substance in\r\nthe light of new information and evidence on the substance.\nArticle 17: Sanctions \u2013 this provision establishes the obligation for the Member States\r\nto lay down the rules on administrative sanctions applicable to infringements to\r\nmarket restriction, and to ensure that they are effective, proportionate and\r\ndissuasive. \nArticle 18: Remedy \u2013 this provision sets out the right to an effective judicial remedy\r\nenshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. \nArticles 19: Committee \u2013 this provision lays down the standard rules for the exercise of implementing\r\npowers in line with Article 291 TFEU.\nArticle 20: Research and analysis \u2013 this provision describes the ways in which the EU shall support\r\nthe development, sharing and dissemination of information and knowledge on new\r\npsychoactive substances, to support the rapid exchange\r\nof information on and risk assessment of new psychoactive substances. \nArticle 21: Reporting \u2013 this provision requests the EMCDDA and Europol to report annually\r\non the implementation of certain aspects of the Regulation. \nArticle 22: Evaluation \u2013 this provision sets out an obligation for the Commission to regularly\r\nassess the implementation, application and effectiveness of this Regulation and\r\nto report to the European Parliament and Council. \nArticle 23: Replacement of Decision\r\n2005/387/JHA \u2013 this provision sets out that this Regulation\r\nreplaces Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.\nArticle 24: Entry into force \u2013 this establishes when the Regulation shall enter into force.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no direct impact on the EU\r\nbudget and does not create new tasks for the EMCDDA, Europol, the European\r\nMedicines Agencies, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Food\r\nSafety Authority (EFSA). For the purpose of this Regulation, the ECHA and the EFSA\r\nare only required to share the information at their disposal, on a limited\r\nnumber of substances, and are not requested to produce new information.\n2013/0305 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non new psychoactive substances\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\r\n114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[13],\r\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New psychoactive\r\nsubstances, which may have numerous commercial and industrial uses, as well as\r\nscientific uses, can pose health, social and safety risks when consumed by\r\nhumans. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the past years,\r\nMember States have notified an increasing number of new psychoactive substances\r\nvia the mechanism for rapid exchange of information which was established by\r\nJoint Action 97/396/JHA of 16 June 1997 adopted by the Council on the basis of\r\nArticle K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, concerning the information\r\nexchange, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs[14] and was further strengthened\r\nby the Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information\r\nexchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances[15]. A large majority of these new\r\npsychoactive substances were reported by more than one Member State. Many such new\r\npsychoactive substances were sold to consumers without appropriate labelling\r\nand instructions of use.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States' competent\r\npublic authorities introduce various restriction measures on these new\r\npsychoactive substances to address the risks that they pose or may pose when\r\nconsumed. As new psychoactive substances are often used in the production of various\r\ngoods or of other substances which are used for manufacturing goods, such as\r\nmedicines, industrial solvents, cleaning agents, goods in the hi-tech industry,\r\nrestricting their access for this use can have an important impact on economic\r\noperators, potentially disrupting their business activities in the internal market.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increasing number of\r\nnew psychoactive substances available in the internal market, their growing\r\ndiversity, the speed with which they emerge on the market, the different risks\r\nthat they may pose when consumed by humans and the growing number of\r\nindividuals who consume them, challenge the capacity of public authorities to\r\nprovide effective responses to protect public health and safety without\r\nhampering the functioning of the internal market.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restriction measures vary\r\nsignificantly in different Member States, meaning that economic operators that\r\nuse them in the production of various goods must comply, in the case of the\r\nsame new psychoactive substance, with different requirements, such as\r\npre-export notification, export authorisation, or import and export licences. Consequently,\r\nthe differences between the Member States' laws, regulations and administrative\r\nprovisions on new psychoactive substances hinder the functioning of the\r\ninternal market, by causing obstacles to trade, market fragmentation, lack of\r\nlegal clarity and of an even level playing field for economic operators, making\r\nit difficult for companies to operate across the internal market. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restriction measures not\r\nonly cause barriers to trade in the case of new psychoactive substances that\r\nalready have commercial, industrial or scientific uses, but can also impede the\r\ndevelopment of such uses, and are likely to cause obstacles to trade for\r\neconomic operators that seek to develop such uses, by making access to those new\r\npsychoactive substances more difficult.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The disparities between\r\nthe various restriction measures applied to new psychoactive substances can\r\nalso lead to displacement of harmful new psychoactive substances between the\r\nMember States, hampering efforts to restrict their availability to consumers and\r\nundermining consumer protection across the Union. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such disparities are\r\nexpected to increase as Member States continue to pursue divergent approaches\r\nto addressing new psychoactive substances. Therefore, the obstacles to trade\r\nand market fragmentation, and the lack of legal clarity and of a level playing field\r\nare expected to increase, further hindering the functioning of the internal\r\nmarket. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those distortions to the\r\nfunctioning of the internal market should be eliminated and, to that end, the\r\nrules relating to new psychoactive substances that are of concern at Union\r\nlevel should be approximated, while, at the same time, ensuring a high level of\r\nhealth, safety and consumer protection. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New psychoactive substances\r\nand mixtures should be able to move freely in the Union when intended for\r\ncommercial and industrial use, as well as for scientific research and\r\ndevelopment. This Regulation should establish rules for introducing restrictions\r\nto this free movement.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New psychoactive substances\r\nthat pose health, social and safety risks across the Union should be addressed\r\nat the Union level. Action on new psychoactive substances under this Regulation\r\nshould contribute to a high level of protection of human health and safety, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should not\r\napply to drug precursors because the diversion of those\r\nchemical substances for the purpose of manufacturing narcotic drugs or\r\npsychotropic substances is addressed under Regulation\r\n(EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February\r\n2004 on drug precursors[16]\r\nand Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 of 22 December 2004 laying down rules\r\nfor the monitoring of trade between the Community and third countries in drug\r\nprecursors[17].\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any Union action on new\r\npsychoactive substances should be based on scientific evidence and subject to a\r\nspecific procedure. Based on the information notified by Member States, a\r\nreport should be drawn up on new psychoactive substances that give rise to\r\nconcerns across the Union. The report should indicate whether it is necessary\r\nto carry out a risk assessment. Following the risk assessment, the Commission\r\nshould determine whether the new psychoactive substances should be subjected to\r\nany restriction measures. In case of immediate public health concerns, the\r\nCommission should subject them to temporary consumer market restriction before\r\nthe conclusion of the risk assessment. In case new information emerges on a new\r\npsychoactive substance, the Commission should re-assess the level of risks that\r\nit poses. Reports on new psychoactive substances should be made publicly\r\navailable.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No risk assessment should\r\nbe conducted under this Regulation on a new psychoactive substance if it is\r\nsubject to an assessment under international law, or if it is an active\r\nsubstance in a medicinal product or in a veterinary medicinal product.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where\r\nthe new psychoactive substance\r\non which a report is drawn up is an active substance in\r\na medicinal product or in a veterinary medicinal product, the Commission should\r\nassess with the European Medicines Agency the need for further action.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures taken on new\r\npsychoactive substances at Union level should be proportionate to the health,\r\nsocial and safety risks that they pose.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Certain new psychoactive substances\r\npose immediate public health risks, requiring urgent action. Therefore, their\r\navailability to consumers should be restricted for a limited time, pending\r\ntheir risk assessment. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No restriction measures should\r\nbe introduced at Union level on new psychoactive substances which pose low\r\nhealth, social and safety risks.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those new psychoactive\r\nsubstances which pose moderate health, social and safety risks should not be\r\nmade available to consumers. \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those new psychoactive\r\nsubstances which pose severe health, social and safety risks should not be made\r\navailable on the market.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\r\nprovide for exceptions in order to ensure the protection of human and animal\r\nhealth, to facilitate scientific research and development, and to allow the use\r\nof new psychoactive substances in industry, provided that they cannot be abused\r\nor recovered. \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the efficient\r\nimplementation of this Regulation, the Member States should lay down rules on\r\nthe sanctions applicable to infringements of restriction measures. Those\r\nsanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Monitoring\r\nCentre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) established by Regulation\r\n1920/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006[18] should have a central role in\r\nthe exchange of information on new psychoactive substances and in the\r\nassessment of the health, social and safety risks that they pose.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mechanism for rapid\r\nexchange of information on new psychoactive substances has proved to be a\r\nuseful channel for sharing information on new psychoactive substances, on new\r\ntrends in the use of controlled psychoactive substances and on related public\r\nhealth warnings. That mechanism should be further strengthened to enable a more\r\neffective response to the rapid emergence and spread of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances across the Union. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information from Member States\r\nis crucial for the effective functioning of the procedures leading to decision\r\non market restriction of new psychoactive substances. Therefore, Member States should\r\ncollect, on a regular basis, data on the use of new psychoactive substances,\r\nrelated health, safety and social problems and policy responses, in accordance\r\nwith the EMCDDA framework for data collection for the key epidemiological\r\nindicators and other relevant data. They should share this data.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lack of capacity to identify\r\nand anticipate the emergence and spread of new psychoactive substances and a\r\nlack of evidence about their health, social and safety risks hamper the\r\nprovision of an effective response. Therefore, support should be provided,\r\nincluding at Union level, to facilitate cooperation between the EMCDDA,\r\nresearch institutes and forensic laboratories with relevant expertise, in order\r\nto increase the capacity to assess and address effectively new psychoactive\r\nsubstances. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedures for\r\ninformation exchange, risk assessment and adoption of temporary and permanent\r\nrestriction measures on new psychoactive substances established by this\r\nRegulation should enable swift action. Market restriction measures should be\r\nadopted without undue delay, not later than eight weeks from receipt of the joint\r\nreport or risk assessment report.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As long as the Union has\r\nnot adopted measures to subject a new psychoactive substance to market\r\nrestriction under this Regulation, Member States may adopt technical\r\nregulations on that new psychoactive substance in compliance with the\r\nprovisions of Directive 98/34/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying\r\ndown a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical\r\nstandards and regulations and of rules on Information Society Services[19]. In order to preserve the unity of the Union\u2019s internal market and to\r\nprevent the emergence of unjustified barriers to trade, Member States should immediately communicate to the Commission any\r\ndraft technical regulation on new psychoactive substances, in accordance with the procedure established by Directive 98/34/EC.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prevention, treatment and\r\nharm reduction measures are important for addressing the growing use of new\r\npsychoactive substances and their potential risks. The internet, which is one\r\nof the important distribution channels through which new psychoactive substances\r\nare sold, should be used for disseminating information on the health, social and\r\nsafety risks that they pose. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicinal products and\r\nveterinary medicinal products are addressed under Directive 2001/82/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on\r\nthe Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products[20], Directive 2001/83/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on\r\nthe Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[21] and Regulation (EC) No\r\n726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying\r\ndown Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal\r\nproducts for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines\r\nAgency[22].\r\nTheir abuse or misuse should, therefore, not be covered by this Regulation.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of temporary and permanent market\r\nrestrictions, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\r\nThose powers should be\r\nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the\r\nrules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member\r\nStates of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[23].\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\r\nimmediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases\r\nrelating to a rapid increase in the number of reported fatalities in several\r\nMember States associated with the consumption of the new psychoactive substance\r\nconcerned, imperative grounds of urgency so require. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the application of this\r\nRegulation, the Commission should consult Member States' experts, relevant\r\nUnion agencies, civil society and economic operators.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of the\r\nproposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can\r\ntherefore, by reason of the effects of the envisaged action, be better achieved\r\nat the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European\r\nUnion. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that\r\nArticle, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\r\nachieve those objectives. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish\r\nuniform rules and ensure clarity of concepts and procedures, as well as to\r\nprovide legal certainty for economic operators, it is appropriate to adopt this\r\nact in the form of a Regulation.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nfundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, including the freedom to conduct a\r\nbusiness, the right to property and the right to an effective remedy, \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSubject matter - Scope - Definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation\r\nestablishes rules for restrictions to the free movement of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances in the internal market. For that purpose it sets up a mechanism for\r\ninformation exchange on, risk assessment and submission to market restriction\r\nmeasures of new psychoactive substances at Union level.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation shall not\r\napply to scheduled substances as\r\ndefined in Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005.\nArticle 2 \nDefinitions \nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the\r\nfollowing definitions apply:\n(a)                   \r\n\u2018new psychoactive substance\u2019 means a natural or\r\nsynthetic substance that, when consumed by a human, has the capacity to produce\r\ncentral nervous system stimulation or depression, resulting in hallucinations,\r\nalterations in motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or\r\nmood, which is intended for human consumption or is likely to be consumed by\r\nhumans even if not intended for them with the purpose of inducing one or more\r\nof the effects mentioned above, which is neither controlled under the 1961\r\nUnited Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972\r\nProtocol, nor the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances;

The assessment of risks of substances at the EU level has the\r\nadded value of pooling scientific resources and analytical capacities from\r\nacross the EU, to provide the best evidence available on a substance and help\r\ndevelop effective responses to it. EU-level decisions on restricting the\r\navailability of harmful substances would increase legal certainty and reduce\r\nobstacles for economic operators in the market for legitimate uses, while\r\nimproving consumer protection across the EU. \n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nThe 2011 Commission's assessment report[27] on the implementing of the\r\ncurrent Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment\r\nand control of new psychoactive substances, based on an extensive consultation\r\nof Member State stakeholders, concluded that the Council Decision is a useful\r\ninstrument for tackling new substances at the EU level, but that it has several\r\nmajor shortcomings, including:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is slow and reactive, and it is\r\ntherefore not able to address effectively the increase in the number of new\r\npsychoactive substances. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient evidence is available to\r\ntake appropriate and sustainable decisions under this instrument.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It lacks options for restriction\r\nmeasures. \n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nAction in the field of new psychoactive\r\nsubstances is in compliance with the existing rules on the functioning of the\r\ninternal market, as well as with EU strategic policy documents, including the\r\nEU Drugs Strategy 2013-2020, the Stockholm Programme and the Commission\r\nCommunication \"Towards a stronger European response to drugs\". EU action\r\nin the field of new psychoactive substances is also fully consistent with\r\naction at the United Nations' level.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 Financial impact from YYYY to YYYY \n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of unlimited\r\nduration\n\u2013     \r\nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\r\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \r\nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s) planned[28] \nFrom the 2014 budget\n\u00fd Direct management by the Commission\n\u2013     \r\n\u00fd by its departments, including by its staff in the Union\r\ndelegations; \n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8\u00a0 by the executive agencies; \n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States \n\u00a8 Indirect management by delegating implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8the EIB and the European Investment Fund;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies referred to in Articles 208 and 209 of the Financial\r\nRegulation;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 public law bodies;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the\r\nextent that they provide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are\r\nentrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that\r\nprovide adequate financial guarantees;\n\u2013     \r\n\u00a8 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in\r\nthe CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU, and identified in the relevant basic\r\nact.\n\u2013       If more than one management mode is\r\nindicated, please provide details in the \"Comments\" section.\nComments:\nThe only minor costs expected for the EU\r\nbudget relate to the evaluation of the legislative instrument and meetings of\r\nthe committee of Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nThe Commission will evaluate the\r\nimplementation, functioning, effectiveness, efficiency, utility and added value\r\nof the future mechanism on new psychoactive substances every five years,\r\npublish the results and propose amendments, if necessary.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control\r\nsystem \n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified\nNone identified.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information concerning the\r\ninternal control system set up\nStandard Commission control/infringement\r\nprocedures concerning the application of the future Regulation and Directive.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Estimate of the costs and\r\nbenefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error\nNot relevant as no specific risk identified.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nIn order to combat fraud, corruption and other\r\nunlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 apply.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing expenditure budget lines\nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [\u2026]Heading\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
