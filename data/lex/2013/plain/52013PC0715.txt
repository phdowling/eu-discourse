Although triggered by an earthquake and\r\ntsunami of an immense magnitude, investigations of the causes of the accident\r\nreveal a range of foreseeable factors which combined to produce a catastrophic\r\noutcome. The analysis of the Fukushima nuclear accident reveals quite\r\nsubstantial and recurring technical issues as well as persistent institutional\r\nfailures similar to the ones from the post-accident evaluations of the Three\r\nMile Island and Chernobyl nuclear accidents decades ago. This latest nuclear\r\naccident once again undermined public confidence in the safety of nuclear\r\npower; and particularly so at a time when the use of nuclear power is being\r\ndebated as a possible option to meet global energy demands in a sustainable\r\nmanner. \nThe Fukushima nuclear accident renewed\r\nattention on the paramount importance of ensuring the most robust levels of\r\nnuclear safety in the EU and worldwide.\nNuclear energy currently generates close to\r\n30% of all electricity in the EU and about two-thirds of its low-carbon\r\nelectricity. The EU has 132 operating reactors, representing about one-third of\r\nthe 437 operating nuclear power reactors in the world. Many of the EU NPPs were\r\nconstructed already three to four decades ago, and are based on designs and\r\nsafety provisions that were continuously updated since then. \nNuclear safety is of the utmost importance\r\nto the EU and its people. The effects of nuclear accidents do not stop at\r\nnational borders and can entail potential harmful consequences for the health\r\nof workers and citizens but also wide-ranging economic implications. It is\r\ntherefore essential for society and the economy to reduce the risk of a nuclear\r\naccident in an EU Member State by applying high nuclear safety standards and\r\nguaranteeing a high quality of regulatory oversight. \nIn the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear\r\naccident, the EU response to the events was immediate.\nBased upon a mandate from the European\r\nCouncil at its meeting of 24-25 March 2011[1],\r\nthe European Commission, together with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators\r\nGroup (ENSREG), launched EU-wide comprehensive risk & safety assessments of\r\nnuclear power plants ('Stress Tests'). The Stress Tests were defined as a\r\ntargeted reassessment of the safety margins of NPPs in the light of the events\r\nin Fukushima related to extreme natural events challenging the plants safety\r\nfunctions. All fourteen EU Member States that operate nuclear power plants[2] plus Lithuania[3] participated in these\r\nassessments. Switzerland, Ukraine and Croatia participated fully in the EU\r\nStress Tests and the peer review process, while other neighbouring countries\r\n(e.g. Turkey, Belarus and Armenia) that agreed to use the same methodology, are\r\nworking within different timetables. Stress Tests were started in 2011 by self-assessments\r\ncarried out by nuclear operators and the preparation of national reports by\r\nnational regulators. Preliminary findings were presented in a Commission Communication on an Interim Stress Tests Report[4] in\r\nNovember 2011 and an extensive EU-wide peer review process was carried out from\r\nJanuary to April 2012. An overview report was produced by the ENSREG Peer\r\nReview Board[5] and endorsed by ENSREG. In addition, ENSREG also agreed on\r\nan Action Plan[6] to follow up the implementation of the peer review recommendations.\r\nIn October 2012, the Commission issued a Communication on the Final Stress\r\nTests Report[7]. Currently, in line with the requirements of the ENSREG\r\nAction Plan, National Action Plans[8] associated with post-Fukushima lessons learned and\r\nStress Test peer review recommendations have been prepared and were reviewed in\r\nterms of contents and status of implementation in the framework of a Workshop\r\nin April 2013. The Summary Report of the Workshop is intended to be presented\r\nat the 2013 Second ENSREG Conference on Nuclear Safety in Europe[9]. Furthermore in the process of\r\nensuring a proper follow-up of the Stress Tests, the Commission will elaborate,\r\nin close cooperation with ENSREG, a consolidated report on the status of the\r\nimplementation of the Stress Tests recommendations, envisaged to be issued in\r\nJune 2014 and transmitted to the European Council. \nIn the legislative domain, the European\r\nCommission received a clear mandate from the European Council in March 2011\r\n\"to review the existing legal and regulatory framework for the safety of\r\nnuclear installations\" and propose any improvements that may be necessary.\r\n\nThe European Parliament has also encouraged\r\na legislative review. In the 2011 Resolution on energy infrastructure\r\npriorities for 2020 and beyond[10],\r\nit stated that \"future legislative initiatives to set up a common\r\nframework for nuclear safety are essential in order to continuously improve\r\nsafety standards in Europe\". Furthermore, in the 2011 Resolution on the\r\nCommission Work Programme 2012[11],\r\nthe Parliament called for \"an urgent revision of the Nuclear Safety\r\nDirective with a view to its strengthening, namely by taking into account the\r\nresults of the Stress Tests implemented in the aftermath of the Fukushima\r\naccident\". More recently, in the 2013 Resolution on Stress Tests[12], it called on the revision to\r\nbe \"ambitious in nature\", including major improvements in areas such\r\nas \"safety procedures and frameworks \u2013 in particular through the\r\ndefinition and implementation of binding nuclear safety standards that reflect\r\nstate-of-the-art practices in the EU in technical, regulatory and operational\r\nrespects \u2013 as well as in the role and resources of the nuclear regulatory\r\nauthorities and, in particular, should boost the latter's independence,\r\nopenness and transparency, while also strengthening monitoring and peer\r\nreview\".\nThe European Economic and Social Committee\r\nexpressed in the 2012 Opinion on the Commission\r\nCommunication on a Final Stress Tests Report[13] its\r\nsupport for the \"Commission's intention to undertake an ambitious revision\r\nof the Nuclear Safety Directive\".\nIn response to the mandate from the\r\nEuropean Council and the calls from the other EU institutions and bodies, the\r\nCommission engaged in a comprehensive process of analysis and opinion\r\ngathering, to identify the appropriate areas and mechanisms for legislative\r\nintervention. This process included an open on-line public consultation\r\n(December 2011 \u2013 February 2012), complemented by an extensive dialogue with the\r\nstakeholders.\nThe 2011 and\r\n2012 Stress Tests Communications contain indications on the potential areas of\r\nlegislative improvement. In this context, with reference to the existing\r\nCouncil Directive 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for the\r\nnuclear safety of nuclear installations[14]\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Nuclear Safety Directive\"), the latter\r\nCommunication highlights the areas of safety procedures and frameworks, role\r\nand means of nuclear regulatory authorities, openness and transparency,\r\nmonitoring and verification. \nMoreover, the Commission services developed\r\nin the course of 2012 an Impact Assessment, based on a wide range of\r\ninformation sources and taking into account the post-Fukushima EU and\r\ninternational developments in the nuclear domain.\nOn this basis, a proposal for a Directive\r\namending the Nuclear Safety Directive has been developed, benefiting from the\r\ninput and expertise of the Euratom Treaty Article 31 Group of scientific\r\nexperts, of the European Economic and Social Committee, as well as an extensive\r\nconsultation process with the high-level representatives of the national\r\nnuclear regulatory authorities reunited in ENSREG.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds and objectives of\r\nthe proposal\nThe current\r\nNuclear Safety Directive has been a key advancement. However, in the spirit of\r\nnuclear safety's philosophy of continuous improvement, and thus with the\r\nintention to take account inter alia of the lessons learned from the\r\nFukushima nuclear accident and of the outcomes of the subsequent Stress Tests,\r\nit was necessary to reconsider the sufficiency of the existing provisions. \nThe Fukushima nuclear accident has shown\r\nthat well-known lessons learned from accidents decades ago have not been taken\r\nup voluntarily by parts of the industry and not been sufficiently enforced by\r\nregulators, even in a nation \u2013 Japan \u2013 that was assumed to have particularly\r\nhigh standards of industrial and nuclear safety. The technical and\r\norganisational issues arising from the analysis of this accident are therefore\r\nrelevant for wider consideration.\nIn Europe, the Stress Tests have confirmed\r\nthat there are continued differences between Member States in ensuring\r\ncomprehensive and transparent identification and management of key safety\r\nissues. Moreover, the Stress Tests clearly showed the benefits of cooperation\r\nand coordination mechanisms between all parties having responsibilities for\r\nnuclear safety, such as peer reviews. \nIn addition, in the course of the public\r\nmeetings held in the framework of the Stress Tests, demands have emerged to\r\nextend the assessment to emergency preparedness and response arrangements.\nThe Commission considers it therefore\r\nappropriate to amend, strengthen and supplement the Nuclear Safety Directive,\r\nby combining technical improvements with wider safety issues such as\r\ngovernance, transparency and on-site emergency preparedness and response.\nThe proposed amendments aim at enhancing\r\nthe regulatory framework for nuclear safety in the EU, in particular by:\n\u2013              \r\nStrengthening the role and effective\r\nindependence of the national regulatory authorities;\n\u2013              \r\nEnhancing transparency on nuclear safety\r\nmatters;\n\u2013              \r\nStrengthening existing principles, and\r\nintroducing new general nuclear safety objectives and requirements, addressing\r\nspecific technical issues across the entire lifecycle of nuclear installations,\r\nparticularly NPPs;\n\u2013              \r\nReinforcing monitoring and exchange of\r\nexperiences, by establishing a European system of peer reviews;\n\u2013              \r\nEstablishing a mechanism for developing EU-wide\r\nharmonised nuclear safety guidelines.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing EU legislation in\r\nthe nuclear safety area\nFollowing the\r\nrecognition by the Court of Justice of the EU in the Case 29/99[15] of the intrinsic link between\r\nradiation protection and nuclear safety and, thus, of the competence of the\r\nEuratom Community to legislate in the area of nuclear safety, the Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive is the first EU-wide topical legally binding instrument[16]. The Directive sets up a\r\nlegally binding framework based upon recognised principles and obligations of\r\nthe main international instruments available, namely the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety[17]\r\nand the Safety Fundamentals[18]\r\nestablished by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other\r\npolicy areas\nThe Euratom nuclear safety legislation, due\r\nto the fact that it ultimately aims at ensuring the protection of the workers\r\nand the general public against the dangers of ionising radiation, is mainly\r\nlinked to the Euratom radiation protection corpus of legislation, whose\r\nmain pillar is the Basic Safety Standards Directive[19]. It is not possible to achieve\r\nthe protection of workers and the general public from the dangers of ionising\r\nradiation without controlling the potentially harmful sources of that\r\nradiation.\nNuclear safety is also of paramount\r\nimportance for the overall prevention, preparedness for and response to\r\ndisasters in the Member States. The nuclear safety directive is thus closely\r\nlinked to the Union Civil Protection Mechanism[20]\r\nwhich provides the framework for the EU cooperation in this area, including the\r\nresponse to radiological emergencies inside and outside the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation of interested\r\nparties\nIn the period following the Fukushima\r\nnuclear accident, the Commission has engaged in an extensive and transparent\r\ndialogue process with the various stakeholders and the public, which included\r\nlaunching an open consultation via the Internet, in line with the Commission's\r\nminimum consultation standards[21].\r\n\nIn response to the on-line public\r\nconsultation seeking views on areas of reinforcing the existing Euratom\r\nnuclear safety legislative framework, contributions\r\nwere received from nuclear regulatory\r\nauthorities, other public authorities, companies, non-governmental\r\norganisations, as well as individuals. This consultation offers insights into a\r\nlarge range of stakeholder opinions. The broad outcome shows that more\r\nthan 90% of respondents agree on the importance of a Euratom nuclear safety\r\nframework, setting up common rules for EU Member States, whilst 76% agree with\r\nthe need to reinforce the existing safety legislative framework. \nThe Commission\r\nalso received both written and meeting-based contributions from various\r\nstakeholders, e.g. nuclear regulatory authorities, other public authorities,\r\nindividual companies, industry associations and non-governmental organisations.\r\nIn addition, the Commission has organised with ENSREG conferences and public\r\ndebates involving a wide range of stakeholders, including non-governmental\r\norganisations, on the process, the intermediate and final results of the Stress\r\nTests[22].\r\n\nThe European\r\nsocial partners from the Electricity Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee\r\nindustry have also been consulted. In their response, the social partners\r\nunderline the role of a Euratom nuclear safety legislative framework in setting\r\nup common rules for Member States. \nA special role\r\nwas given to ENSREG, which represents a unique focal point of expertise, as it\r\nreunites high-level representatives of the national competent nuclear\r\nregulatory authorities from all the EU Member States, nuclear and non-nuclear\r\nalike. A detailed contribution of ENSREG was received and taken into account. \nAs part of the\r\nprocedure laid out in the Euratom Treaty, the Commission consulted the Article\r\n31 Group of scientific experts. In their opinion, the experts welcomed the\r\nCommission proposal for amending the Nuclear Safety Directive and make several\r\nsuggestions for enhancing the link with radiation protection legislation. \nFinally, in its\r\nOpinion on the draft proposal issued under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty[23], the European Economic and\r\nSocial Committee (EESC) apreciates the prompt action taken by the Commission in\r\nbringing forward the proposal for amending the Nuclear Safety Directive. The\r\nCommittee is pleased that several issues highlighted in its previous opinions\r\non nuclear safety have been adressed in this proposal. In particular, it\r\nwelcomes the stronger approach to harmonisation amongst Member States, the clarification\r\nof regulatory responsibilities, competence and capacity, the enhanced independence\r\nof national regulators, and action on on-site emergency preparedness and\r\nresponse. The Committe also commends the strengthened approach to overall\r\ntransparency. Underlining that new legislative requirements should be\r\nnecessary, proportionate and serve the purpose of assuring public safety, the\r\nCommittee welcomes the appropriate balance that has been achieved in that\r\nperspective in the amending directive.\nThe Committee\r\nproposed to strenghten the provisions of the draft proposal in some areas and\r\nit recommended that Member States are required to\r\nensure that a participative processes for strengthening public involvement in\r\nplanning, review and decision-making be put in place.\r\nIn this regard, the Commission believes that the role of the public in the\r\nregulatory decision-making is recognised through the requirement of the\r\nproposal that it is effectively involved during the licensing process of\r\nnuclear installations.\nIn accordance\r\nwith the procedure laid down in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, the\r\nconsultation of the European Economic and Social Committee on the draf proposal\r\nwas a prerequisite for the subsequent adoption of the final proposal by the\r\nCommission.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact Assessment\nIn 2012, an Impact Assessment was\r\ndeveloped. The document analyses the challenges of ensuring sufficient levels\r\nof nuclear safety in the EU. It defines the general and specific objectives for\r\nenhancing the prevention and mitigation of nuclear accidents. A number of\r\npolicy options are proposed and analysed, ranging from maintaining the current\r\nsituation to more profound reforms. Each option has been assessed for its\r\nestimated safety, economic, environmental and social impacts.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal Basis\nAny legislative\r\namendment should build upon and enhance the approach of the current Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive. The legal basis remains thus Articles 31 and 32 of the\r\nEuratom Treaty.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity and\r\nproportionality\nThe proposal\r\naims at strengthening even further the role and independence of the competent\r\nregulatory authorities, as it is clear that only strong regulators endowed with\r\nall the necessary powers and independence guarantees can oversee and ensure the\r\nsafe operation of nuclear installations in the EU. Close cooperation and\r\ninformation-sharing between regulators, taking into account the potential\r\ncross-border impacts of a nuclear accident, is encouraged. \nGiven the wide\r\nconsequences of a nuclear accident and particularly the public need for\r\ninformation in such a case, an EU-wide approach on transparency issues is\r\nessential. This can ensure that, irrespective of state borders, the public is\r\nproperly informed on all relevant nuclear safety matters. The existing\r\nprovisions of the Directive are amended in this sense.\nIn Europe, the\r\nStress Tests have confirmed that there are not only continued differences\r\nbetween the EU Member States in ensuring comprehensive and transparent\r\nidentification and management of key safety issues, but that also gaps remain.\r\nTherefore, the Nuclear Safety Directive is strengthened to include a set of shared\r\nobjectives aiming at harmonising the EU approach to nuclear safety. Moreover,\r\nthe experience from the Fukushima nuclear accident and the valuable insights\r\ncoming from the Stress Tests have clearly shown that exchange of information\r\nand peer-reviews are an essential element to ensure the effective and\r\ncontinuous implementation of any safety regime. \nIn accordance with the proportionality principle, the proposed legislative action does not\r\ngo beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives. Furthermore, taking into\r\naccount the different situations in the Member States, a flexible and\r\nproportionate approach as regards the level of applicability is defined. A mechanism of joint development by the Member States of EU-wide\r\ntechnical guidelines is defined with special regard to the principle of\r\nproportionality, by using the knowledge and practical experience of the\r\nregulatory experts. \nThe applicability and the extent of the\r\nprovisions of the proposal vary according to the type of nuclear installation.\r\nTherefore, when implementing these provisions, Member States should follow a\r\nproportionate approach, taking account of the risks from the specific types of\r\nnuclear installations.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal elements of the\r\nproposal\nThe proposal introduces new or strengthens\r\nthe existing provisions of the Nuclear Safety Directive with the overall aim of\r\ncontinuously improving nuclear safety and its regulation at EU level. Specific\r\ninformation on the main proposed amendments of the Nuclear Safety Directive is\r\npresented below.\nObjectives\nArticle 1 is complemented with a new\r\nobjective aiming at ensuring the avoidance of radioactive releases during all\r\nstages of the lifecycle of nuclear installations (siting, design, construction,\r\ncommissioning, operation, decommissioning).\nDefinitions\nIn Article 3,\r\nnew definitions are introduced corresponding to terms used in the new\r\nprovisions, such as \"accident\", \"abnormal event\",\r\n\"design basis\", \"design basis accident\", \"beyond\r\ndesign basis accident\", \"periodic safety review\". These\r\ndefinitions are aligned with the international terminology, such as the IAEA\r\nSafety Glossary.\nLegislative,\r\nregulatory and organisational framework\nArticle 4 is\r\namended in order to further clarify the main elements of the national\r\nframework. For instance, it is specified that the national safety requirements\r\nmentioned in Article 4(1)(a) should cover all stages of the lifecycle of\r\nnuclear installations. \nCompetent regulatory authority\r\n(effective independence, regulatory role) \nThe Nuclear Safety\r\nDirective contains only minimal provisions underlying\r\nthe independence of the national competent regulatory authority in Article 5(2). These provisions are strengthened in line\r\nwith latest international guidance[24], by defining strong and effective benchmark\r\ncriteria and requirements to guarantee the effective independence of\r\nregulators. New requirements include ensuring effective independence in\r\ndecision-making, own appropriate budget allocations and autonomy in\r\nimplementation, clear requirements for the appointment and dismissal of staff,\r\navoidance and resolution of conflicts of interests, and staffing levels with\r\nthe necessary qualifications, experience and expertise.\nThe Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive enumerates in a general manner the main competencies of the\r\ncompetent regulatory authority in Article 5(2). Through the amendment, these provisions are further detailed to\r\nensure that regulators possess the appropriate powers to\r\ncarry out a strong regulatory oversight. For this purpose, the core task of the\r\ncompetent regulatory authority to define national nuclear safety requirements\r\nis added to the existing catalogue of regulatory competencies. \nTransparency\r\n\nThe existing provisions of Article 8 of the\r\nNuclear Safety Directive are limited to generic requirements on public\r\ninformation. Moreover, this Article does not impose any obligation on the\r\nlicence holder, who has the prime responsibility for nuclear safety. To fill these gaps, in the proposed amendment, the existing provisions are extended and specified. Thus, both the\r\ncompetent regulatory authority and the licence holder are required to develop a\r\ntransparency strategy, which covers information provision under normal\r\noperating conditions of nuclear installations as well as communication in case\r\nof accident or abnormal event conditions. The role of the public is fully\r\nacknowledged through the requirement that it effectively participates in the\r\nlicensing process of nuclear installations. Recently organised exchanges with\r\nexperts[25]\r\nin the field have confirmed that the public has a very important role to play\r\nby being involved effectively in the decision-making procedures and that their\r\nviews should be considered, taking into account the provisions of the Aarhus\r\nConvention[26].\r\n\nNuclear Safety Objectives \nThe current\r\nNuclear Safety Directive does not include specific requirements for the\r\ndifferent stages of the lifecycle of nuclear installations. Therefore, for\r\nexample the type of risks related to the issues identified in the analysis of\r\nthe Fukushima accident and the subsequent Stress Tests are not sufficiently\r\nidentified and addressed by the provisions of the current Directive, e.g.: \n\u00b7              \r\nThe need to evaluate the appropriateness of the\r\nsiting of nuclear installations based on considerations on how to prevent,\r\nwhere possible, and minimise the impact from external hazards;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe need to continuously re-assess the\r\nprobability of such hazards and their impacts in the course of periodic safety\r\nreviews and perform a corresponding design basis review for each nuclear\r\ninstallation, including for the purpose of possible lifetime extension;\n\u00b7              \r\nThe need to base risk assessments, including\r\nthose for external events, on methods reflecting progress in scientific\r\ndevelopment and thus enable effective continuous improvement of safety. \nIn line with\r\nthe principle of continuous improvement of nuclear safety the amendment\r\nintroduces general safety objectives for nuclear installations (Article 8a)\r\nwhich reflect the progress achieved at the level of WENRA in developing safety\r\nobjectives for new NPPs. \nFor achieving these high level safety\r\nobjectives, more detailed provisions are laid down for different life-cycle\r\nphases of nuclear installations (Article 8b). \nIn addition, in order to support their\r\nconsistent implementation, methodological requirements concerning the siting,\r\ndesign, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear\r\ninstallations, are laid out in Article 8c.\nThis approach\r\nprovides flexibility to the national frameworks, by assigning high level\r\nobjectives that have to be fulfilled by national legislation in line with the\r\nprinciple of continuous improvement of nuclear safety. For example, this leaves\r\nto Member States the choice of selecting among the available engineering\r\nsolutions to upgrade their nuclear installations when addressing safety issues\r\nbased on lessons learned from severe accidents, such as the need to allow safe\r\ndepressurizing of a reactor containment in case of an accident (e.g. by means\r\nof containment filtered venting). \nOn-site emergency preparedness and\r\nresponse\nThe amendment includes provisions regarding\r\non-site emergency preparedness and response as the current Directive does not\r\nprovide for such measures. The new provisions include indications on the\r\nplanning and organisational measures that should be provided by the licence\r\nholder (Article 8d). As an example of new requirements, the amendment\r\nprescribes that an on-site emergency response centre is required for a nuclear\r\ninstallation, sufficiently protected against the effects from external events\r\nand severe accidents, including radiological ones, and equipped with the\r\nnecessary material to mitigate the effects of severe accidents. \nPeer Reviews\nThe existing provisions of the Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive of Article 9(3) include a requirement for periodic\r\nself-assessment of the Member States national framework and competent\r\nregulators authorities, combined with the obligation to invite an international\r\npeer review on relevant segments. This concept remains unchanged in the\r\nproposal, in Article 8e(1).\nThe amendment introduces new provisions on\r\nself-assessments and peer-reviews of nuclear installations based on nuclear\r\nsafety topics selected by the Member States jointly and\r\nin close coordination with the Commission across the\r\nentire lifecycle of nuclear installations (example could be the above-mentioned\r\ncontainment depressurisation in case of severe accident in order to avoid\r\nhydrogen explosion). Should Member States fail to\r\njointly select at least a topic, the European Commission should select the\r\ntopics to be subject to the peer reviews. Further, each\r\n  Member State has to define a methodology for the implementation of the\r\ntechnical recommendations from the peer review process. Should the Commission identify substantial deviations or delays in\r\nthe implementation of the technical recommendations from the peer review\r\nprocess, the Commission should invite the competent regulatory authorities of\r\nMember States not concerned to organise and carry out a verification mission to\r\nget a full picture of the situation and inform the Member State concerned about\r\npossible measures to remedy any identified shortcomings.\nIn case of an accident with off-site\r\nconsequences, a special peer review should be arranged. \nThis new compulsory and regular mechanism\r\nof EU peer reviews (Article 8e(2) to (5)) aims at verifying the level of technical\r\ncompliance with the safety objectives in each Member State.\nThese new provisions setting out the\r\npeer-review mechanism are without prejudice to the rules governing the\r\ninfringement procedure in case a Member State fails to fulfil an obligation\r\nunder the Treaties, as laid out in Articles 258, 259 and 260 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\nProportionate implementation of the\r\namended Directive\nThe amendment\r\nacknowledges that the applicability and the extent of the provisions of the\r\namended Directive vary according to the type of nuclear installation.\r\nTherefore, when implementing these provisions, Member States should follow a\r\nproportionate approach, taking account of the risks posed by the specific types\r\nof nuclear installations they plan or operate.\nReporting on practical implementation of\r\nthe amended directive\nThe provisions of the Nuclear Safety\r\nDirective on reporting are not changed by this proposal, leaving the date for\r\nthe first reporting on 22 July 2014 at which the Member States are expected to\r\nsubmit a report on the implementation of the existing provisions of the\r\nDirective. At the time of the second reporting on the implementation however,\r\nby 22 July 2017, the Member States should report on the implementation of the\r\nNuclear Safety Directive as amended by this proposal.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no\r\nbudgetary implications for the EU budget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explanatory documents\nIn accordance with the Joint Political\r\nDeclaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28\r\nSeptember 2011, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases,\r\nthe notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the\r\ncorresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\nWith regard to this Directive, the\r\nCommission considers the transmission of such documents to be justified for the\r\nfollowing reasons:\n\u00b7                        \r\nThe complexity of the transposition of the\r\namended Nuclear Safety Directive at national level\nThe existing provisions of the Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive are significantly strengthened by this proposal which also\r\nintroduces new substantial provisions in several areas. The complexity of\r\ntransposition of the amended directive is therefore determined by the fact that\r\nis covers many different issues, including requirements on national framework\r\nfor nuclear safety of nuclear installations, role and independence of national\r\nregulatory authorities, obligations of the licence holders, skills in nuclear\r\nsafety, transparency on nuclear safety matters, technical objectives and\r\nrequirements on nuclear safety of nuclear installations, on-site emergency\r\npreparedness and response and provisions on national assessments of nuclear\r\ninstallations and related topical peer-reviews. Moreover, the directive places\r\nrequirements on different Member States' bodies as well as private actors.\nThe different obligations inherent to the amended\r\ndirective are therefore likely to lead to a complex transposition at national\r\nlevel. The existing provisions of the Nuclear Safety Directive have already\r\nbeen transposed in general by several national transposition measures per Member State, the number is however exceeding 15 transposition measures in some cases. The\r\nnumber of notified transposition measures can be legitimately expected to rise\r\nwith the new provisions brought to the existing directive by this proposal.\r\nFurthermore, due to the specificity of nuclear safety, various transposition\r\nmeasures are used and notified to the Commission, ranging from laws, government\r\ndecrees and ministerial orders to instructions and decisions of national\r\nnuclear regulatory authorities. \nThe need for explanatory documents\r\nexplaining the relationship between the provisions of the amended Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition measures\r\nseems to be obvious under these circumstances.\n\u00b7                        \r\nPre-existing national legislation \nIn some Member States, some legislation is\r\nalready in place in the area of amendments brought by this proposal. The\r\ntransposition of the amended Directive is therefore likely to result in a\r\ncombination of amendments to existing national legislation and adoption of new\r\nlegislation. In such a situation, the explanatory documents would be necessary\r\nto obtain a clear and comprehensive picture of the transposition.\n\u00b7                        \r\nFramework directive\nThe proposed amendments do not\r\nfundamentally change the 'framework' character of the Nuclear Safety Directive.\r\nThe amended directive continues to include general principles and requirements.\nIt is important for the Commission and its\r\nmonitoring of transposition and implementation to know which national\r\nprovisions transpose the general principles and requirements that the amended\r\ndirective lays down. For instance, the proposal introduces general safety\r\nobjectives and requirements for all types of nuclear installations. Given the\r\nvery broad scope of these new safety objectives and requirements, it is of\r\nutmost importance for the Commission but also the public to be able to\r\nascertain how they are transposed at national level.\nPROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLE\nThe requirement to provide explanatory\r\ndocuments can create an additional administrative burden on the Member States.\r\nThis burden is however not disproportionate considering\r\nthe objectives of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive and the complexity of\r\nits subject matter. It is furthermore necessary for the Commission to allow effective verification of correct transposition. There are no less burdensome measures to\r\nallow efficient verification, considering the likely complexity of\r\ntransposition at national level which may result in new or amended legislation.\r\nIt is also to be mentioned that a relevant number of Member States have already\r\nbeen notifying useful explanatory documents to the Commission on their\r\ntransposition of the existing Euratom legislation such as the existing Nuclear\r\nSafety Directive or other pieces of legislation.\n2013/0340 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2009/71/EURATOM\r\nestablishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear\r\ninstallations\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing\r\nthe European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 31 and 32 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission, drawn up after obtaining the opinion of a group of persons\r\nappointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee from among scientific\r\nexperts in the Member States,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament, \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, \nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\r\n2(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community ('Euratom\r\nTreaty') provides for the establishment of uniform safety standards to\r\nprotect the health of workers and of the general public.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article\r\n30 of the Euratom Treaty provides for the establishment of basic\r\nstandards within the European Atomic Energy Community ('Community') for the\r\nprotection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers\r\narising from ionizing radiations.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for\r\nthe protection of the health of workers and the general public against the\r\ndangers arising from ionizing radiation[27]\r\nestablishes the basic safety standards. This Directive\r\nestablishes requirements for a system of radiation protection including the\r\njustification and optimisation of radiation exposures and dose-limitation for\r\npublic and occupational exposure. It specifies requirements for the control of\r\nradiation exposures to the public and to workers under both normal operations\r\nand emergency situations. The provisions of Directive\r\n96/29/Euratom have been supplemented by more specific legislation.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCourt of Justice of the European Union has recognised in its case-law[28] that the Community shares competences, together with its Member\r\nStates, in fields covered by the Convention on Nuclear Safety[29].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 2009/71/Euratom of 25 June 2009 establishing a Community framework\r\nfor the nuclear safety of nuclear installations[30]\r\nimposes obligations on the Member States to establish and maintain a national\r\nframework for nuclear safety. That Directive reflects the provisions of the\r\nmain international instruments in the field, namely the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety[31]\r\nand the Safety Fundamentals[32] established by the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency ('IAEA'). The deadline for Member States to bring into force and\r\nnotify the Commission the laws, regulations and administrative procedures to\r\ncomply with, Directive 2009/71/Euratom expired on 22 July 2011.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nDirective 2011/70/Euratom of 19 July 2011 establishing a Community framework\r\nfor the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste[33] imposes obligations on the Member States to establish and maintain\r\na national framework for spent fuel and radioactive waste management.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council\r\nConclusions of 8 May 2007 on nuclear safety and safe management of spent\r\nnuclear fuel and radioactive waste[34]\r\nhighlighted that \u201cnuclear safety is a national responsibility exercised where\r\nappropriate in an EU-framework. Decisions concerning safety actions and the\r\nsupervision of nuclear installations remain solely with the operators and national\r\nauthorities\u201d.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\r\nup on the Council\u2019s invitation to set up a High Level Group at EU level, as\r\nrecorded in its above mentioned Conclusions of 8 May 2007, the European Nuclear\r\nSafety Regulators Group (ENSREG) was established by Commission Decision\r\n2007/530/Euratom of 17 July 2007 on establishing the European High Level Group\r\non Nuclear Safety and Waste Management[35] to\r\ncontribute to the achievement of the Community objectives in the field of\r\nnuclear safety.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\n Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 renewed attention worldwide on the\r\nmeasures needed to minimise risk and ensure the most robust levels of nuclear\r\nsafety. Based on a mandate from\r\nthe European Council in March 2011[36], the\r\nCommission, together with the European Nuclear Safety Regulator Group ('ENSREG'),\r\ncarried out Union wide comprehensive risk and safety assessments of nuclear\r\npower plants ('stress tests'). The results identified a number of improvements\r\nwhich could be implemented in nuclear safety approaches and industry practices\r\nin the participating countries[37].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\r\nthe European Council also mandated the Commission to review the existing\r\nlegal and regulatory framework for the safety of nuclear installations and\r\npropose any improvements that may be necessary. The European Council also\r\nstressed that the highest standards for nuclear safety should be implemented\r\nand continuously improved in the EU.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission included initial views on potential areas of legislative improvement\r\nin its Communication on the Interim Report on the Comprehensive Risk and Safety\r\nAssessments (\"stress tests\") of Nuclear Power Plants in the European\r\nUnion[38] of 24 November 2011. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nline with its general principles of consultation and dialogue, the Commission\r\nalso conducted an on-line public consultation, between December 2011 and\r\nFebruary 2012, seeking views on areas of reinforcing the Community nuclear\r\nsafety framework.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nCommission identified a number of areas for revising the current Directive\r\n2009/71/Euratom, as outlined in its 4 October 2012 Communication from the\r\nCommission to the Council and the European Parliament on the comprehensive risk\r\nand safety assessments (\"stress-tests\") of nuclear power plants in\r\nthe EU and related activities[39].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nidentifying the relevant areas for improvement, the Commission took into\r\naccount technical progress achieved at European and international level, the\r\nexperience and results gained from the stress tests, the findings of the\r\nvarious reports into the Fukushima nuclear accident, the views expressed in the\r\npublic consultation on areas of reinforcing the Community legislative\r\nframework, the views expressed by different stakeholders including national\r\ncompetent regulatory authorities, industry and civil society, and the results\r\nof the preliminary assessment of the transposing measures of the Member States.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\nstrong and independent competent regulatory authority is a fundamental\r\ncondition of the European nuclear safety regulatory framework. Its independence\r\nand the exercise of its powers impartially and transparently are crucial\r\nfactors to ensure a high level of nuclear safety. Objective regulatory\r\ndecisions and enforcement actions should be established without any undue\r\nexternal influence that might compromise safety, such as pressures associated\r\nwith changing political, economic or societal conditions, or pressures from\r\ngovernment departments or any other public or private entities. The negative\r\nconsequences of the lack of independence were evident in the Fukushima\r\naccident. The provisions of Directive 2009/71/Euratom on functional separation\r\nof competent regulatory authorities should be strengthened to ensure the\r\nregulatory authorities' effective independence and to guarantee that they are\r\nprovided with the appropriate means and competencies to properly carry out the\r\nresponsibilities assigned to them. In particular, the regulatory authority\r\nshould have sufficient legal powers, sufficient staffing and sufficient\r\nfinancial resources for the proper discharge of its assigned responsibilities. The\r\nstrengthened requirements aiming at ensuring independence in carrying out the\r\nregulatory tasks should be however without prejudice to close cooperation, as\r\nappropriate, with other relevant national authorities or to general policy\r\nguidelines issued by the government not related to the regulatory powers and\r\nduties.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nindependence of the regulatory authority's decision making further depends on\r\nthe competence of its staff. Therefore the regulatory authority should employ\r\nstaff with the necessary qualifications, experience and expertise to be able to\r\nundertake its functions and responsibilities. Given the specialised nature of\r\nthe nuclear industry and the limited availability of persons with the required\r\nexpertise and competence, resulting in the possible rotation of persons with\r\nexecutive responsibility between the nuclear industry and the regulators,\r\nspecial attention should be given to avoiding conflicts of interest. Moreover,\r\narrangements should be made to ensure that there is no conflict of interest for\r\nthose organisations that provide the regulatory body with advice or services. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When\r\nundertaking infrastructure projects that could affect the nuclear safety of\r\nnuclear installations, the appropriate national mechanisms of consultation with\r\nnational regulatory authorities and the public should be in place and full\r\naccount should be taken of the opinions expressed by them.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/92/EU on the\r\nassessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the\r\nenvironment[40]\r\nis relevant for nuclear installations. This Directive provides that the Member\r\nStates must ensure that, before development consent is given, projects likely\r\nto have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of\r\ntheir nature, size or location are made subject to an assessment of the\r\nenvironmental effects. In this regard, it is a tool for ensuring that\r\nenvironmental considerations are integrated in the licensing process of nuclear\r\ninstallations.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any\r\nassessment under this Directive is without prejudice to\r\nany relevant environmental assessment.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For nuclear installations\r\nfor which the obligation to carry out assessments of the effects on the\r\nenvironment arises simultaneously from this Directive and other Union\r\nlegislation, Member States may provide for coordinated or joint procedures\r\nfulfilling the requirements of the relevant Union legislation.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nconsequences of a nuclear accident can go beyond national borders, therefore\r\nclose cooperation, coordination and information exchange between regulatory\r\nauthorities of neighbouring countries or of countries in the same region,\r\nirrespective of whether they operate nuclear installations or not, need to be\r\nencouraged. In this respect, Member States should ensure that appropriate\r\narrangements are in place to facilitate such cooperation on nuclear safety\r\nmatters with cross-border impacts, including with third countries. Synergies should be sought with the Union Civil Protection Mechanism[41] which provides an EU framework\r\nfor cooperation between the Member States in the field of civil protection in\r\nimproving the effectiveness of systems for preventing, preparing for and\r\nresponding to natural and man-made disasters.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to ensure that the proper skills are acquired and that adequate levels of\r\ncompetence are achieved and maintained, all parties should ensure that all\r\nstaff (including sub-contractors), having responsibilities relating to the\r\nnuclear safety of nuclear installations and to the on-site emergency\r\npreparedness and response arrangements, undergo a continuous learning process.\r\nThis can be achieved through the establishment of training programmes and\r\ntraining plans, procedures for periodic review and updating of the training\r\nprogrammes as well as appropriate budgetary provisions for training.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another\r\nkey lesson learned from the Fukushima nuclear accident is the importance of\r\nenhancing transparency on nuclear safety matters. Transparency is also an\r\nimportant means to promote independence in regulatory decision making.\r\nTherefore, the current provisions of Directive 2009/71/Euratom on the\r\ninformation to be provided to the public should be more specific as to which\r\ntype of information should be provided, as a minimum by the competent\r\nregulatory authority and by the licence holder, and within which time frames.\r\nTo this purpose, for example, the type of information that should be provided,\r\nas a minimum by the competent regulatory authority and by the licence holder as\r\npart of their wider transparency strategies, should be identified. Information\r\nshould be released in a timely manner, particularly in case of abnormal events\r\nand accidents. Results of periodic safety reviews and international peer\r\nreviews should also be made public. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nrequirements of this Directive on transparency are complementary to those of\r\nthe existing Euratom legislation. Council Decision 87/600/Euratom of 14\r\nDecember 1987 on Community arrangements for the early exchange of information\r\nin the event of a radiological emergency[42]\r\nimposes obligations on Member States to notify and provide information to the\r\nCommission and to other Member States in case of a radiological emergency on\r\nits territory, whilst Council Directive 89/618 Euratom of 27 November 1989[43] includes requirements on Member States to inform the public about health\r\nprotection measures to be applied and steps to be taken in the event of a\r\nradiological emergency, and to provide advance and continuing information to\r\nthe population likely to be affected in the event of a such an emergency.\r\nHowever, in addition to the information to be provided in such an event, Member\r\nStates should under this Directive arrange for appropriate transparency\r\nprovisions, with prompt and regularly updated release of information to ensure\r\nthat workers and the general public are kept informed about all nuclear safety\r\nrelated events, including abnormal events or accident conditions. Moreover, the\r\npublic should be given opportunities to participate effectively in the\r\nlicencing process of nuclear installations and the competent regulatory authority\r\nshould provide any safety-related information independently, without need for\r\nprior consent from any other public or private entity. \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nDirective 2009/71/Euratom sets up a legally binding Community framework\r\nunderlying a nuclear safety legislative, administrative and organisational\r\nsystem. It does not include specific requirements for nuclear installations. In\r\nview of the technical progress achieved by the IAEA, and the Western European\r\nNuclear Regulators Association ('WENRA') and other sources of expertise,\r\nincluding the lessons learned from the stress tests and the Fukushima nuclear\r\naccident investigations, Directive 2009/71/Euratom should be amended to include\r\nCommunity nuclear safety objectives covering all stages of the lifecycle of\r\nnuclear installations (siting, design, construction, commissioning, operation,\r\ndecommissioning).\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk-informed\r\nmethods examine the probability of each event in an event sequence likely to\r\nlead or contribute to an accident as well as its possible consequences. The\r\nanswers can be used to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of\r\nthe design and operation of a nuclear installation and can thus guide\r\nrequirements and regulatory attention to the issues where the largest benefit\r\nfor the safety of a nuclear installation can be obtained. Having invested over\r\nthe last decades considerable resources in developing Probabilistic Safety\r\nAssessments for nuclear installations, particularly for nuclear power plants\r\nand research reactors, licence holders and competent regulatory authorities\r\nworldwide are now in a position to use the insights derived to enhance the\r\nsafety of nuclear installations on a risk-informed basis while operating them\r\nin the most efficient manner.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ageing\r\nof the safety related structures, systems and components of a nuclear\r\ninstallation, and especially embrittlement of components which are difficult to\r\nreplace in practice, such as reactor pressure vessels, puts a natural limit to\r\nits acceptable continued operation. From both a safety and an economical point\r\nof view, the limit of operational lifetime is typically 40 years after the\r\nstart of commercial operation therefore Member States should ensure that\r\npossible lifetime extension of existing nuclear power plants does not expose\r\nthe workers and the public to additional risks. To this end, Directive\r\n2009/71/Euratom should be amended to include new Community wide safety\r\nobjectives to be complied with by the regulatory authorities and the licence\r\nholders in case of a lifetime extension of existing nuclear power plants.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nnew reactor design, there is a clear expectation to address in the original\r\ndesign what was beyond design for previous generations of reactors. Design extension conditions are accident conditions that are not\r\nconsidered for design basis accidents, but are considered in the design process\r\nof the installation in accordance with best estimate methodology, and for which\r\nreleases of radioactive material are kept within acceptable limits. Design\r\nextension conditions could include severe accident conditions.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Application of the concept\r\nof defence-in-depth in organisational, behavioural, or design activities\r\nrelated to a nuclear installation, ensures that safety related activities are\r\nsubject to independent layers of provisions, such that if a failure were to\r\noccur, it would be detected and compensated by appropriate measures. The\r\nindependent effectiveness of each of the different layers is an essential\r\nelement of defence in depth to prevent accidents and mitigate the consequences if\r\nthey do occur.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After\r\nthe nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the Fukushima nuclear\r\naccident highlighted once again the critical importance of the containment\r\nfunction, which is the last barrier to protect people and the environment\r\nagainst radioactive releases resulting from an accident. Therefore the\r\napplicant for a licence for the construction of a new power or research reactor\r\nshould demonstrate that the design practically limits the effects of a reactor\r\ncore damage to within the containment, i.e. he has to prove that a radioactive\r\nrelease outside the containment is physically impossible or can be considered\r\nextremely unlikely with a high degree of confidence for such release to occur.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2009/71/Euratom does not include measures regarding\r\non-site emergency preparedness and response, which, as the Fukushima nuclear\r\naccident highlighted, are crucial to mitigate the consequences of a nuclear\r\naccident. Council Directive 96/29/Euratom foresees\r\nthat, in case of radiological emergencies, it is necessary to organise\r\nappropriate intervention to stop or reduce the emission of radionuclides, and\r\nto assess and record the consequences of the emergency and the effectiveness of\r\nthe intervention. Measures should also be in place for the protection and\r\nmonitoring of the environment and population. However, more specific provisions\r\nregarding on-site emergency preparedness and response are needed in order to\r\nassess situations that might require on-site protective measures, to have an organisational\r\nstructure and coordination among response bodies, and to ensure that sufficient\r\nresources are available to apply those appropriate protective measures even in\r\nextreme cases.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nstress tests demonstrated the key role of enhanced cooperation and coordination\r\nmechanisms between all parties having responsibilities for nuclear safety. The\r\npeer-reviews have proved to be a good means of building confidence, with the\r\naim of developing and exchanging experience and ensuring the common application\r\nof high nuclear safety standards. The scope of the provisions of Directive\r\n2009/71/Euratom is however limited only to self-assessments and international\r\npeer-reviews of Member States' legislative, regulatory and organisational\r\ninfrastructure and therefore the Directive should be widened to include peer\r\nreviews of nuclear installations.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\nDirective introduces new provisions on self-assessments and peer-reviews of\r\nnuclear installations based on selected nuclear safety topics covering their\r\nentire lifecycle. At an international level, there is already confirmed\r\nexperience with conducting such peer-reviews on nuclear power plants. At the EU\r\nlevel, the experience from the stress tests process shows the value of a\r\ncoordinated exercise to assess and review the safety of EU nuclear power\r\nplants. A similar mechanism, based on cooperation between the Member States'\r\nregulatory authorities and the Commission, should be applied here. Therefore,\r\ncompetent regulatory authorities coordinating in the context of expert groups\r\nsuch as ENSREG, could contribute with their expertise to identifying the\r\nrelevant safety topics and in carrying out these peer reviews. If Member States fail to jointly select at least one topic the\r\nCommission should select one or more topics to be subject to the peer reviews. Participation of other stakeholders, such\r\nas Technical Support Organisations, international observers or non-governmental\r\nOrganisations could bring added value to the peer reviews. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to guarantee the rigour and the objectivity of the peer reviews, Member\r\nStates should provide access to all necessary information, subject to the\r\nrequired security clearance procedures, to staff and to the nuclear\r\ninstallation concerned. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\nappropriate follow-up mechanism should be established to ensure that the\r\noutcome of these peer-reviews is properly implemented. Peer reviews should help\r\nimprove the safety of individual nuclear installations as well as help\r\nformulate generic technical safety recommendations and guidelines valid across\r\nthe Union.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\ncase the Commission identifies substantial deviations or delays in the implementation of the\r\ntechnical recommendations from the peer review process, the Commission should\r\ninvite the competent regulatory authorities of Member States not concerned to\r\norganise and carry out a verification mission with the aim of getting a full\r\npicture of the situation and informing the Member State concerned about\r\npossible measures to remedy any identified shortcomings.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions setting out the\r\npeer-review mechanism of this Directive are without prejudice to the rules\r\ngoverning the procedure in case a Member State fails to fulfil an obligation\r\nunder the Treaties, as laid out in Articles 258, 259 and 260 of the Treaty on\r\nthe Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nperiodicity of the peer reviews and the reporting under this Directive should\r\nbe aligned with the review and reporting cycles of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the principle\r\nof proportionality, the applicability of the provisions of Chapter 2, Section 2\r\n\"Specific Obligations\" of this Directive depends on the type of\r\nnuclear installations on the territory of a Member State. Therefore, when\r\nimplementing these provisions in national law, Member States should take\r\naccount of the risks posed by the specific types of nuclear installations they\r\nplan or operate. In particular, the proportionality principle will concern\r\nthose Member States that keep only a small inventory of nuclear and radioactive\r\nmaterials, e.g. linked to the operation of smaller research reactor facilities,\r\nwhich in case of a severe accident would not engender consequences comparable\r\nto those generated by nuclear power plants.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nprovisions of this Directive which are intrinsically linked to the existence of\r\nnuclear installations, namely those concerning the licence holder's\r\nobligations, the new specific requirements for nuclear installations and the\r\nprovisions concerning the on-site emergency preparedness and response are not\r\napplicable to Member States without nuclear installations as defined by this\r\nDirective. These Member States need not transpose and implement the requirement\r\nto impose penalties on those who do not comply with this Directive. The other\r\nprovisions of this Directive should be transposed and implemented in a\r\nproportionate manner in accordance with national circumstances and taking into\r\naccount the fact that these Member States do not have nuclear installations,\r\nwhilst ensuring that nuclear safety receives appropriate attention by the\r\ngovernment or by the competent authorities.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According\r\nto Directive 2009/71/Euratom, the Member States have to establish and maintain\r\na national legislative, regulatory and organisational framework ('national\r\nframework') for nuclear safety of nuclear installations. The determination on\r\nhow the provisions of the national framework are adopted and through which\r\ninstrument they are applied rests with the competence of the Member States.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\naccordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the\r\nCommission on explanatory documents of 28 September 2011, Member States have\r\nundertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their\r\ntransposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship\r\nbetween the provisions of a directive and the corresponding parts of national\r\ntransposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator\r\nconsiders the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2009/71/Euratom should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 2009/71/Euratom is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nThe heading of Chapter 1 is replaced by the\r\nfollowing: \n\"OBJECTIVES, SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND\r\nDEFINITIONS\".\n(2)                   \r\nIn Article 1, the following point (c) is added:\n\"(c) to ensure that Member States shall\r\nprovide for appropriate national arrangements so that nuclear installations are\r\ndesigned, sited, constructed, commissioned, operated or decommissioned so as to\r\navoid unauthorised radioactive releases.\"\n(3)                   \r\nArticle 2 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nparagraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\"1.

These design extension conditions are used to identify the additional\r\naccident scenarios to be addressed in the design and to plan practicable\r\nprovisions for the prevention of such accidents or the mitigation of their\r\nconsequences if they do occur.\n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'periodic safety review' means a systematic\r\nreassessment of the safety of an existing installation carried out at regular\r\nintervals to deal with the cumulative effects of ageing, modifications,\r\noperating experience, technical developments and siting aspects and aimed at\r\nensuring a high level of safety throughout the service life of the installation.\".\n(5)                   \r\nIn Chapter 2, the following title is inserted\r\nafter the heading \u2018OBLIGATIONS\u2019:\n\"SECTION\r\n1\nGeneral\r\nobligations\". \n(6)                   \r\nArticle 4, paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \r\nthe introductory part is replaced by the\r\nfollowing:\n\"1.
