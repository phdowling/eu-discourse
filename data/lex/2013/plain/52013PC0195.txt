It also indicates the conditions under which\nderogations may be granted for the traffic of vehicles that exceeds these\nmaximum dimensions.\nIn the light of the evolving market and the\navailable technologies, the question today is whether the choices made when the\nDirective was adopted in 1996 are still relevant. In particular, it has become\ncrucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of petroleum\nproducts in the field of transport, and even more crucial for road transport,\nwhich accounts for 82% of the energy consumption of the transport sector. The\nsteady rise in the price of fuel is continuously increasing Europe's energy\nbill and prompt us to identify solutions to reduce vehicle fuel consumption.\nThe White Paper on Transport Policy[2]\npublished in 2011 set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by\n2050 in comparison with 1990 levels. \nIn this context, the White Paper announced\nthe revision of the Directive on the maximum dimensions and weight for road transport\nvehicles, with the aim of allowing more energy-efficient, aerodynamic vehicles\nto be put on the market. Indeed, the improvement of vehicles\u2019 aerodynamic\nperformances and the installation of alternative propulsion systems, hybrid or\nelectric, is only possible, within the limits of the maximum dimensions and\nweights authorized by the current Directive, to the detriment of the vehicle\u2019s\ncommercial load. The hybrid engine or the batteries carry a considerable amount\nof excess weight. Tractor cabs which are rounded at the front to be more\naerodynamic will be longer. The installation of streamlined flaps at the back\nof the vehicle will also increase its length. This reduction in the commercial\nload discourages transporters, shippers, and manufacturers from using and\ndeveloping vehicles that are more energy-efficient.\nThe revision of the Directive also offers\nan opportunity to improve road safety by improving the streamlining of the cab,\nallowing a reduction of the driver\u2019s blind spots, adding an energy-absorbing\nstructure in case of shocks, as well as increasing the driver\u2019s safety and\ncomfort. This would help spare the lives of numerous vulnerable users, such as\npedestrians and cyclists, who the driver does not necessarily see when making\nmanoeuvres.\nIt is thus necessary to amend Directive\n96/53/EC to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency,\nwhile continuing to improve road safety, and within the limits imposed by the geometry\nof road infrastructures. \nFor example, some studies[3] show that adding flaps of\n1 m to 2 m in length at the rear of the vehicle would allow savings\nof between 5 and 10 % in fuel consumption at an average speed of\n80 to 90 km/h.\nFurthermore, since the adoption of\nDirective 96/53/EC, the average weight of a bus passenger has increased.\nMoreover, EU legislation has made onboard safety devices mandatory, the weight\nof which must be offset by a corresponding reduction in the vehicle\u2019s payload\nand thus the number of passengers transported. This is counter to the aim of\nreducing fuel consumption per person transported and also counter to the\nobjective aimed at shifting from individual vehicles to public transport, which\nis clearly better for the environment.\nFuel savings and reducing polluting\nemissions are not the only motives for proposing to revise Directive 96/53/EC.\nIndeed, Directive 96/53/EC does not take\nthe recent developments in containerisation and intermodal transport into\naccount. Some containers used on rail, waterways, intercontinental maritime\ntransport and maritime cabotage can thus currently only end their journeys by\nroad, necessitating special permits which increase the administrative costs for\ntransporters and administrations. Yet for the most common of these containers,\nwhich are 45 feet (13.72 m) long, the length of a truck would only\nneed to be increased by 15 cm to avoid the need for these special permits,\nwhich would not pose any problems in terms of road safety or the geometry of\ninfrastructures.\nFinally, because the current Directive has\nno provisions on vehicle checks and the applicable penalties, many\ninfringements go unpunished, which undermines the Directive\u2019s requirements. The\nmain infringement committed is overloading the vehicle. On average, one in\nthree vehicles checked is overloaded. These excess loads often exceed the\nmaximum authorized weight by 10 or even 20%. This causes premature wear and\ntear of surfaces and increases the risk of accidents on the road. It also\ndistorts competition between transport companies, because the fraudsters can illegally\ngain undue competitive advantages. Yet, there are technical filtering solutions\navailable that make it possible to conduct more and faster and more effective\nchecks, without needing to stop all the vehicles that are to be checked. On-board\nweighing systems also exist which allow the driver him- or herself to ensure\nthe standards imposed are respected. It is therefore necessary to add\nprovisions on controls and penalties to Directive 96/53/EC to re-establish\ncompliance with the rules of competition between transporters, to ensure a good\nlevel of road safety and the durability of the infrastructure. \nSome stakeholders raised questions about\nthe interpretation of Article 4 of Directive 96/53/EC. In the light of these\nquestions, Vice-President Kallas sent a letter on 13 June 2012 to the Chairman\nof the Committee on Transport of the European Parliament. This letter offered\nguidance on this subject and considered that the cross-border use of longer\nvehicles is lawful for journeys that only cross one border, if the two Member\nStates concerned already allow it, and if the conditions for derogations under\nArticle 4(3), (4) or (5) of Directive 96/53/EC are met. This use should not\nhave any significant impact on international competition. To reflect the guidelines\ngiven in that letter, this revision includes the provisions regarding Article\n4(4) in the text of the Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission organised public and\nsectoral consultations in 2011 and 2012. \nThe public consultation organised from\nDecember 2011 to February 2012 yielded over a thousand contributions from\ncitizens, Member States and different professional and non-governmental\norganisations. The consultation allowed the following opinions to be\nidentified: \n(i) the improved aerodynamic performance of\nheavy goods vehicles is unanimously welcomed as progress and most of the\ncontributions believed that Directive 96/53/EC should be amended to allow\nthis improvement. \n(ii) The idea of facilitating the\nintroduction of hybrid or electric engine types, and the development of\ncontainerisation and intermodality by amending Directive 96/53/EC, are largely\napproved. \n(iii) The establishment of measures to\ncheck overloading is welcomed by the profession since it restores fair\ncompetition between transporters, and it appears essential to give the Member\nStates the means to conduct such checks without increasing their financial\nburden or disrupting or delaying traffic. \nBased on the results of this public\nconsultation, the Commission held working seminars bringing together vehicle\nmanufacturers, transporters and shippers, combined transport stakeholders, road\ncontrol bodies and road safety stakeholders. Those consultations produced a\nconsensus on targets for reducing pollution and fuel consumption and for\nimproving road safety, and an agreement for opening up to new possibilities of\nintermodal transport. A consensus was also reached on the need to step up\nchecks, particularly on possible overloading of vehicles. In the area of\naerodynamic performance, more streamlined cabs and the installation at the back\nof vehicles of equipment to reduce the drag effect are desirable. A limited\nadaptation of the maximum weights and dimensions, accompanied by appropriate\nsignposting for the dimensions, does not seem to present any risk to road\nsafety.\nThe measures presented in this revision are\nthe result of these consultations. \nThey were examined in an impact assessment,\nwhich allowed the best options in terms of economic and environmental\nefficiency to be selected. The option selected, described in detail in\nparagraph 4 below, combines technical harmonisation work conducted with a group\nof experts with a view to adopting delegated acts and a moderate regulatory approach,\nto avoid imposing disproportionate or inapplicable obligations, which would\npenalise small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.\nThe consultation also concerned Article 4\nof Directive 96/53/EC, which determines the conditions to meet to benefit from\nderogations from the limits imposed by the Directive, which can be determined\nby the Member States in certain well-defined cases. Differences emerged\nconcerning international traffic for vehicles which exceed the dimensions laid\ndown in the Directive. The Commission has therefore decided to make its own orientations\non the current Directive public (letter dated 13 June 2012 to the President of\nthe Committee on Transport of the European Parliament). The guidance relative\nto Article 4(4) is reflected in Article 1(2) of this proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe proposal for amending Directive\n96/53/EC is based on Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union (TFEU). Improving the efficiency and environmental performance of\nroad transport is indeed an essential goal of the common transport policy. The\nharmonisation of rules at European level is also a continuing demand of the\nprofession.\nThis proposal is in keeping with the\nprinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality. Given the importance of\ntransport for the functioning of the internal market, its increasing\ncross-border dimension and the increasing fuel costs and greenhouse gas\nemissions, provisions are essential to increase the fuel-efficiency of road\ntransport, reduce its environmental impact, and ensure compliance with the\nrules.\nThe proposal leaves the Member States free\nto decide on derogations from the rules contained therein as far as national\ntransport is concerned. It establishes a Committee to assist the Commission in\ndrawing up the requirements in relation to aerodynamics, along with guidelines\non checking policy procedures and penalties adapted to the infringements\ncommitted. The proposal therefore does not exceed what is required to achieve\nits objective.\nAs the amendment of an existing directive\nis proposed, the instrument proposed is a directive. The proposal concerns a\nmatter relevant to the European Economic Area and should therefore be extended\nto the EEA.\nFinally, this proposal has no implications\nfor the Union budget.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe Commission proposal intends first of\nall to grant derogations from the maximum dimensions of vehicles for the\naddition of aerodynamic devices to the rear of vehicles or to redefine the\ngeometry of the cabs for tractors. These derogations open up new prospects for\nmanufacturers of tractors, lorries and trailers but must meet certain\nrequirements, one of which is not to increase the load capacity of vehicles.\nThe Commission will, with the assistance of a Committee, specify these\nrequirements at a later stage. The requirements will ensure compliance with\nroad safety rules and the constraints imposed by infrastructure and traffic\nflow. In addition to the reduction of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas\nemissions, streamlining of cabs must also improve the drivers\u2019 field of vision,\nand thus save around 400 lives each year in Europe. The drivers\u2019 comfort and\nsafety will also be increased. \nThe Commission will amend Commission Regulation\n(EU) 1230/2012 of 12 December 2012 implementing Regulation 661/2009 with regard\nto the requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles, in order to make\nthem compatible with this proposal for a Directive.\nThe proposed Directive plans to authorise a\nweight increase of one tonne for vehicles with an electric or hybrid\npropulsion, to take account of the weight of batteries or the dual\nmotorisation, without prejudice to the load capacity of the vehicle.\nFurthermore, the maximum weight of buses will be increased by a tonne to take\naccount of various developments such as the increase in the average weight of\npassengers and their baggage, of new equipment imposed by the safety\nregulations, and the new Euro VI class. \nThe amendment of Directive 96/53/EC will\nfacilitate the development of intermodal transport by allowing a derogation of\n15 cm in the length of trucks carrying 45-foot containers, which are\nincreasingly used in intercontinental and European transport.\nThe proposal also confirms that\ncross-border use of longer vehicles is lawful for journeys that only cross one\nborder, if the two Member States concerned already allow it and if the\nconditions for derogations under Article 4(3), (4) or (5) of the Directive are\nmet. Concerning Article 4(4), these operations do not have a significant impact\non international competition if the cross-border use remains limited to two\nMember States and the existing infrastructure and the road safety situation\nallow it. Article 4(4) is amended accordingly.\nNew provisions will be added to Directive\n96/53/EC to enable the inspection authorities to better detect infringements\nand harmonise administrative penalties that apply to them. The Commission will\npublish guidelines on inspection procedures to ensure harmonisation of\ninspection methods between all Member States. Member States must carry out a\nminimum number of vehicle checks, using either weighing systems built into the\nroad or by means of onboard sensors in vehicles which communicate remotely with\nroadside inspectors. These measurements will allow the inspection authorities\nto filter the vehicles, so that only vehicles strongly suspected of\ninfringement are stopped for manual inspection. The Commission will define the\ntechnical standards for onboard weighing devices that can communicate with the\ninspection authorities, particularly the standards for the electromagnetic\ncommunication interface. This will encourage the spread of such devices. They\noffer the additional advantage of enabling drivers to better control the weight\nof their vehicles.\nInfringements of Directive 96/53/EC are\nclassified by their degree of severity to harmonise at EU level the types of\nadministrative penalties applicable.\nIn order to accelerate the introduction of\nvehicles that are more aerodynamic and have hybrid motorisation, the Commission\nwill use the budgets at its disposal, in particular those allocated to\ntrans-European networks and the EU programmes for research, development and\ninnovation, to help industrial research, and equipping vehicle fleets. \n2013/0105 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directive 96/53/EC of\n25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the\nCommunity the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international\ntraffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee\nof the Regions[5],\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The White Paper \u2018Roadmap\nto a Single European Transport Area \u2013 Towards a competitive and resource\nefficient transport system\u2019 published in 2011[6]\nemphasised the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon\ndioxide (CO2) emissions, by 60% in comparison with 1990 levels by\n2050.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, the White\nPaper proposed to adapt Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying\ndown for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum\nauthorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum\nauthorised weights in international traffic in the aim of reducing energy\nconsumption and greenhouse gas emissions, so as to adapt the legislation to\ntechnological developments and changing market needs and to facilitate\nintermodal transport.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technological developments\ninclude the possibility of attaching retractable or foldable aerodynamic\ndevices to the rear of vehicles, mainly trailers or semi-trailers, but which\nthen exceed the maximum lengths allowed under Directive 96/53/EC. This\nequipment may be installed as soon as this Directive enters into force, as the\nproducts are available on the market and already used in other continents.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The improved aerodynamics\nof the cabs of motor vehicles would also allow significant gains on the energy\nperformance of vehicles, in conjunction with the devices mentioned in recital 3\nabove. However, this improvement is impossible under the current maximum\nlengths set by Directive 96/53/EC without reducing the vehicle load capacity\nand threatening the economic equilibrium of the sector. Therefore a derogation\nfrom this maximum length is required. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its policy orientations\non road safety 2011-2020[7],\nthe Commission set out measures to make vehicles safer and better protect\nvulnerable road users. The importance of visibility for vehicle drivers was\nalso underlined in the Commission\u2019s report to the European Parliament and the\nCouncil on the implementation of Directive 2007/38/EC on the retrofitting of\nmirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community[8]. A new cab profile will also\ncontribute to improving road safety by reducing the blind spot in the drivers\u2019\nvision, including under the windscreen, which should help save the lives of\nmany vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists. This new profile\ncould also incorporate energy absorption structures in the event of a\ncollision. The potential gain in the volume of the cab would also improve the\ndriver\u2019s comfort and safety.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aerodynamic devices and\ntheir installation in vehicles must be tested before being put on the market.\nTo this end, Member States are to issue certificates that will be recognised by\nother Member States.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Longer vehicles may be\nused in cross-border transport if the two Member States concerned already allow\nit and if the conditions for derogation under Article 4(3), (4) or (5) of the\nDirective are met. The European Commission has already provided guidance on the\napplication of Article 4 of the Directive. The transport operations referred to\nin Article 4(4) do not have a significant impact on international competition\nif the cross-border use remains limited to two Member States where the existing\ninfrastructure and the road safety requirements allow it. This balances the\nMember States\u2019 right under the principle of subsidiarity to decide on transport\nsolutions suited to their specific circumstances with the need to prevent such\npolicies from distorting the internal market. The provisions of Article 4 (4)\nare clarified in this respect.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using alternative engines\nthat no longer rely only on fossil fuels and are therefore non-polluting or\nless polluting, such as electric or hybrid engines for heavy-duty vehicles or\nbuses (mainly in urban or suburban environments) generates extra weight which\nshould not be counted at the expense of the effective load of the vehicle so\nthat the road transport sector is not penalised in economic terms.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The White Paper on\nTransport also stresses the need to monitor developments in intermodal\ntransport, particularly in the area of containerisation, where 45-foot\ncontainers are increasingly used. They are transported by rail or inland\nwaterways. But the road components of intermodal journeys can only be\nundertaken today if both the Member States and the transporters follow\ncumbersome administrative procedures or if these containers have patented\nchamfered corners, the cost of which is prohibitive. Increasing the length of\nthe vehicles transporting them by 15 cm could eliminate these\nadministrative procedures for transporters and facilitate intermodal transport,\nwithout risk or prejudice to the infrastructure or other road users. The small\nincrease that this 15 cm represents in relation to the length of an\narticulated truck (16.50 m) does not constitute an additional risk to road\nsafety. In the policy orientation of the White Paper on Transport, this\nincrease is however authorised only for intermodal transport, for which the\nroad component does not exceed 300 km for operations involving a rail,\nriver or sea component. This distance appeared sufficient to link an industrial\nor commercial site with a freight terminal or a river port. To link a seaport\nand support the development of motorways of the sea, a longer distance is\npossible for a short intra-European maritime transport operation.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further promote\nintermodal transport and take into account the unladen weight of 45-foot\ncontainers, the provision authorising the circulation of 44-tonne combinations\nof vehicles with 5 or 6 axles transporting 40-foot containers in intermodal\ntransport should be extended to those carrying 45-foot containers.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the adoption of\nDirective 96/53/EC, the average weight of bus passengers and their luggage has\nincreased substantially, leading to a gradual reduction in the number of\npassengers carried, given the weight limits imposed by the Directive. The need\nto promote public transport over private transport in the interests of better\nenergy efficiency means that the previous number of bus passengers must be\nre-established, taking into account this increase in their weight and that of\ntheir luggage. This can be done by increasing the authorised weight for buses\nwith two axles, within limits that nonetheless ensure that the infrastructure\nis not damaged through faster erosion.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The authorities responsible\nfor enforcing road transport-related requirements note a high number of\ninfringements, sometimes serious, particularly in relation to the weight of\ntransport vehicles. This situation stems from the insufficient number of checks\nconducted under Directive 96/53/EC, or from their inefficiency.\nFurthermore, the procedures and rules for checks differ between Member States,\ncreating legal uncertainty for drivers of vehicles operating in several Member\nStates of the Union. Furthermore, transporters that do not comply with the\nrelevant rules enjoy a significant competitive advantage over competitors that\ndo comply with the rules, and over other modes of transport. This situation\nconstitutes an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market. It is\ntherefore important that Member States increase the pace of checks carried out,\nboth the manual checks and the pre-selections for manual checks. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple technological\nsolutions, fixed or mobile, are now available that allow inspectors to\npreselect vehicles suspected of infringements without stopping the vehicles in\nquestion, which is less disadvantageous in terms of traffic flow, less onerous\nand allows optimal safety conditions. Some devices may be installed onboard\nheavy goods vehicles and give the driver a way of checking whether his or her\nvehicle is compliant with the law. These onboard devices may also use a\nmicrowave communication interface to communicate their data to officials or to\nroadside automatic inspection systems without stopping the vehicle. The\npre-selection should have a minimum threshold of one weighing per 2 000 vehicle\nkilometres to ensure the effectiveness of the roadside checks on the territory\nof the Union, because this would allow every vehicle to be checked on a\nstatistical average of every three days.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The observation of a high\nnumber of infringements of the provisions of Directive 96/53/EC is to a\nlarge extent due to the non-deterrent level of penalties prescribed by Member\nStates\u2019 legislation for violations of these rules, or even the absence of any\nsuch penalties. This weak point is further compounded by the wide variety in\nthe levels of administrative penalties applicable in the different Member\nStates. To remedy these weak points, the levels and categories of\nadministrative penalties for infringements of Directive 96/53/EC should be\napproximated at Union level. These administrative penalties should be effective,\nproportionate and dissuasive.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The inspection authorities\nin the Member States must be able to exchange information to make checking the\nweight of vehicles or vehicle combinations more effective at international\nlevel, and to facilitate the smooth operation of these checks, in particular\nthe identification of offenders, the description of offences and penalties\napplied, and the state of good repute of the undertaking concerned. The contact\npoint designated in accordance with Article 18(1) of Regulation 1071/2009/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing\ncommon rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the\noccupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC[9] could serve as a relay for this\nexchange of information.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament and\nthe Council should be regularly informed of the checks on road traffic carried\nout by the Member States. This information, provided by the Member States, will\nenable the Commission to ensure compliance with this Directive by hauliers and\nto define whether or not additional coercive measures should be developed.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should be\nempowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union, to define the requirements imposed on\nnew aerodynamic devices placed in the rear of the vehicle or the design of new\nmotor vehicles, as well as the technical specifications to ensure full\ninteroperability of onboard weighing devices, and guidelines on the procedures\nfor checking the weight of vehicles in circulation. It is particularly\nimportant that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level.
