In the legislative procedure\r\nlawmakers aimed to amend the proposal to introduce specific rules on cloning[3]. Yet no agreement was\r\nreached on the scope and features of these insertions so that the proposal was\r\nabandoned after a failed Conciliation in March 2011. As a result the Commission\r\nwas asked to prepare a legislative proposal on cloning in food production based\r\non an impact assessment outside the Novel Food Regulation[4].\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) views\r\ncloning primarily as an animal welfare hazard related to the low efficiency of\r\nthe technique. It up-dated its opinion on cloning of animals in 2012[5] concluding that\r\nscientific knowledge available on cloning has increased but that nevertheless\r\nits efficiency remains low compared to other reproduction techniques.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objectives of the proposal\nThe objective of this proposal is to ensure uniform conditions of production for farmers while\r\nprotecting the health and welfare of animals.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulatory framework\nDirective 98/58/EC[6] on the protection of\r\nanimals kept for farming purposes sets very general minimum animal welfare\r\nstandards for animals used in agriculture. It does not refer explicitly to cloning,\r\nbut calls on Member States to avoid unnecessary pain, suffering or injury in\r\nfarm animals. If cloning causes unnecessary pain, suffering or injury Member\r\nStates have to act at national level to avoid it.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency with other\r\npolicies and objectives of the Union\nThis initiative responds to the above-mentioned\r\nconcerns while avoiding unnecessary burdens for farmers and breeders\r\nestablished in the Union and in third countries. \nThe proposal envisages a suspension on Union\r\nterritory of:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the use of the technique for food\r\nproduction purposes; \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the marketing of live clones (animal\r\nclones).\nThese provisional prohibitions will confine a\r\nproduction technique causing distress to animals to areas where it appears to\r\nhave particular benefit.\nThe provisional prohibitions are kept under\r\nreview given the development of knowledge on the technique and progress in the\r\napplication of the technique in areas outside farming.\nThis initiative excludes cloning carried out in\r\nresearch, for the preservation of rare breeds or endangered species and for the\r\nproduction of medicinal products and medical devices.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation process\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation methods and\r\nmain sectors targeted\nMember States, stakeholders and third country\r\ntrade partners were consulted. \nThe Standing Committee for the Food Chain and\r\nAnimal Health was the main forum for discussions with Member States. In\r\naddition all Member States completed a specific questionnaire on cloning on\r\ntheir territory.\nStakeholders were consulted in the Advisory\r\nGroup of the Food Chain. Twenty-two organisations representing all sectors\r\nconcerned (farmers, breeders, food industry, retailers, consumers and animal\r\nrights activists) participated. In addition five technical meetings were held\r\nwith organisations representing farmers, breeders and the food industry.\nA specific questionnaire was sent to the 15\r\nmajor third country trade partners of which 13 replied.\nThe general public was consulted via the\r\nInteractive Policy Making Initiative in March 2012. This tool reaches\r\napproximately 6000 subscribers of which 360 replied[7]. \nTwo Eurobarometer surveys addressed cloning: a\r\n2008 specific survey on cloning[8]\r\nperformed in 27 Member States and a 2010 survey on biotechnology[9] with specific questions\r\non cloning performed in 27 Member States and 5 non-Union European countries.\nThe specific report on cloning by the European\r\nGroup on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) of 2008[10] expressed doubts that\r\nanimal cloning for farming purposes can be justified \"considering the\r\ncurrent level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal\r\nclones\". The EGE also concluded that it did \"not see\r\nconvincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their\r\noffspring\".\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of responses and\r\nhow they have been taken into account\nMember States confirmed that animals are\r\npresently not cloned for faming purposes in the Union. The economic sectors\r\ninvolved (farming and breeding) indicated that they have, at this time, no\r\ninterest to produce animals for farm purposes though cloning. Farmers and\r\nbreeders however stressed that to remain competitive they need to have access\r\nto high performance genes including the reproductive material of clones.\nArgentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States confirmed that animals are cloned on their\r\nterritory but could not indicate to what extent. In Brazil, Canada and United States clones are registered by\r\nprivate companies. In Canada the legal situation on\r\ncloning is similar to that in the Union, i.e. food produced from animal clones\r\nis considered novel and requires pre-market approval. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Paraguay and the United States pointed out that\r\nmeasures should be science-based. They moreover stressed that measures should\r\nbe no more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil legitimate objectives.\nUnion citizens, on the other hand, held a\r\nbroadly negative perception of the use of the cloning technique for the production\r\nof animals for farming purposes.\nThis initiative takes account of the results of\r\nthe consultations. It addresses justified concerns in a proportionate manner\r\nand considers the limits of the powers conferred to the Commission by the\r\nTreaties. This implies limiting the measures to the animals concerned (i.e. the\r\nsurrogate mothers and the clones) and the species likely to be cloned (bovine,\r\nporcine, caprine, ovine and equine) for farming purposes.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 External expertise\nIn 2008 the European Food Safety Authority\r\n(EFSA) delivered an opinion on cloning. It focused on animal clones, their\r\nprogeny and of the products obtained from those animals. This opinion was\r\nup-dated by three statements in 2009, 2010 and 2012[11]. Based on the\r\navailable data EFSA saw animal welfare problems related to the health of\r\nsurrogate mothers (carrying the clones) and the clones themselves. Surrogate dams\r\nsuffer in particular from placenta dysfunctions contributing to increased\r\nlevels of miscarriages. This contributes, amongst others, to the low efficiency\r\nof the technique (6-15 % for bovine and 6 % for porcine species) and the need\r\nto implant embryo clones into several dams to obtain one clone. In addition,\r\nclone abnormalities and unusually large offspring result in difficult births\r\nand neonatal death. A high mortality rate is a characteristic of the cloning\r\ntechnique. On the other hand EFSA repeatedly stated that cloning has no impact\r\non the safety of meat and milk obtained from the clones.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment[12]\nBased on the experience gained in the\r\nlegislative procedure which failed in March 2011 and the positions expresses by\r\nstakeholders, four options were assessed[13].\r\nAs a result of the analysis of the four options, and considering their impacts\r\nand the objectives pursued, elements of Option 4 (i.e. temporary suspension of\r\nthe technique and of imports of live clones) were retained as the basis of the\r\npresent proposal. Suspending the use of the technique and the marketing of animal\r\nclones for farming purposes ensures that all Union farmers and breeders are\r\nsubject to the same conditions while adequately protecting animal welfare. To\r\npreserve the competitiveness of Union farmers, the proposal does not regulate\r\nreproductive material of clones.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis \nThe proposal is based on Article 43 TFEU\r\n(agriculture). The objectives of the Union's agricultural policy enumerated in\r\nArticle 39 TFEU require ensuring, amongst others, the\r\nrational development of agricultural production. This implies ensuring uniform\r\nconditions of production for farmers. In choosing the means to achieve\r\nthese objectives, account must also be taken of Article 13 TFEU. Article 13\r\nTFEU requires that in formulating and implementing of, amongst others, the\r\nUnion's agriculture policy that the Union and the Member States pay full regard\r\nto the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nIsolated approaches to animal cloning could\r\nlead to distortions of the agricultural markets concerned. It is thus necessary\r\nto ensure that the same conditions apply and thus to address the matter at\r\nUnion level.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe suspension of the cloning technique and the\r\nsuspension of imports of live clones are suitable and necessary measures to\r\nachieve the objectives. They also present the best cost-benefit ratio to\r\nresolve the issues at stake. \nAt its present state of development it appears\r\nthat the use of the cloning technique for farming purposes is of limited\r\nbenefit. For this reason, this proposal addresses only those aspects related to\r\nanimal production for farming purposes. It does not cover other areas where\r\ncloning can be justified due to a positive risk-benefit ratio (such as research\r\nor the use of reproductive material of clones).\nThe suspension of the cloning technique and of\r\nimports of animal clones for farming purposes thus strikes a reasonable fair\r\nbalance between animal welfare, citizens' concerns and the interests of\r\nfarmers, breeders and other stakeholders involved.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nThe proposed instrument is a Directive. Other\r\ntypes of measures would not be appropriate for the following reasons:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a directive allows Member States\r\nemploy existing control tools as appropriate for the implementation of Union rules\r\nand thus to limit the administrative burden;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 soft law instruments are considered\r\ninsufficient to prevent the use of a technique throughout the Union.\nIn accordance with the Joint Political\r\nDeclaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents,\r\nMember States have undertaken to accompany, only in justified cases, the\r\nnotification of their transposition measures with one or more explanatory\r\ndocuments explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and\r\nthe corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. Considering the\r\nlimited legal obligations set by this Directive, explanatory documents from the\r\nMember States in the context of transposition of this Directive are not needed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis initiative has no budgetary implications for\r\nthe EU and requires no additional human resources in the Commission.\n2013/0433 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the cloning of animals of the bovine,\r\nporcine, ovine, caprine and equine species kept and reproduced for farming\r\npurposes\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee,\nAfter transmission of the proposal to the\r\nnational Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 98/58/EC[14] lays down general\r\nminimum welfare standards for animals bred or kept for farming purposes. It\r\ncalls on Member States to avoid unnecessary pain, suffering or injury of farm\r\nanimals. If cloning causes unnecessary pain, suffering or injury, Member States\r\nhave to act at national level to avoid it. Different national approaches to\r\nanimal cloning could lead to market distortion. It is thus necessary to ensure\r\nthat the same conditions apply to all involved in the production and distribution\r\nof live animals throughout the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Food Safety\r\nAuthority (EFSA) has confirmed that surrogate dams used in cloning suffer in\r\nparticular from placenta dysfunctions contributing to increased levels of\r\nmiscarriages[15].\r\nThis contributes, amongst other things, to the low efficiency of the technique,\r\n6 to 15 % for bovine and 6 % for porcine species, and the need to implant\r\nembryo clones into several dams to obtain one clone. In addition, clone\r\nabnormalities and unusually large offspring result in\r\ndifficult births and neonatal deaths.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account the\r\nobjectives of the Union's agricultural policy, the results of the recent\r\nscientific assessments of EFSA and the animal welfare requirement provided in Article\r\n13 of the Treaty, it is prudent to provisionally prohibit the use of cloning in\r\nanimal production for farm purposes of certain species.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Currently animals of\r\nbovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species are likely to be cloned for farming\r\npurposes. The scope of this Directive should therefore be limited to the use of\r\ncloning for farming purposes of those five species.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is expected that the\r\nknowledge on the impact of the cloning technique on the welfare of the animals\r\nused will increase. The cloning technique is likely to improve over time.\r\nConsequently prohibitions should only apply provisionally. This Directive\r\nshould therefore be reviewed within a reasonable time taking into account the\r\nexperience gained by the Member States in its implementation, scientific and technical progress and\r\ninternational developments.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive respects\r\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\r\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the freedom to conduct a\r\nbusiness and the freedom of the sciences. This Directive has to be implemented\r\nin accordance with these rights and principles.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1 \r\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Directive lays down rules on:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the cloning of animals in the Union;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the placing on the market of\r\nembryo clones and animal clones.\nIt shall apply to animals of the bovine,\r\nporcine, ovine, caprine and equine species ('the animals') kept and reproduced for\r\nfarming purposes.\nArticle 2 \r\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the\r\nfollowing definitions shall apply:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 animals \"kept and reproduced for farming purposes\"\r\nmeans animals kept and reproduced for the production of food, wool, skin or fur\r\nor for other farming purposes. It shall not include animals kept and reproduced\r\nexclusively for other purposes such as research, the production of medicinal\r\nproducts and medical devices, the preservation of rare breeds or endangered\r\nspecies, sporting and cultural events;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"cloning\" means asexual\r\nreproduction of animals with a technique whereby the nucleus of a cell of an\r\nindividual animal is transferred into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been\r\nremoved to create genetically identical individual embryos (\"embryo clones\"),\r\nthat can subsequently be implanted into surrogate mothers in order to produce\r\npopulations of genetically identical animals (\"animal clone\");\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"placing on the market\"\r\nmeans the first making available of an animal or a product on the internal market.\r\n\nArticle 3\r\nProvisional prohibition\nMember States shall provisionally prohibit:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the cloning of animals;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the placing on the market of animal\r\nclones and embryo clones.\nArticle 4\r\nPenalties\nMember States shall lay\r\ndown the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national\r\nprovisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures\r\nnecessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must\r\nbe effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
