Essentially, the technical requirements set\nout in the annexes to Directive 82/714/EEC incorporated the provisions laid\ndown in the Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulation, in the version approved by the\nCentral Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR) in 1982.\nThe conditions and technical requirements for\nissuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised\nConvention for Rhine Navigation have been revised regularly since then for most\ncurrent types of vessels and are recognised as reflecting current technological\ndevelopments. For competition and safety reasons it was desirable, specifically\nin the interests of promoting harmonisation at European level, to set a framework\nfor such technical requirements for the whole of the EU's inland waterway\nnetwork. Therefore, Directive 2006/87/EC[2],\nwhich has replaced Directive 82/714 EEC, ensures that Union inland navigation\ncertificates attesting that all types of crafts are fully compliant with the\naforementioned revised technical requirements are valid on all EU inland\nwaterways, including on the Rhine and that Rhine certificates are valid on all\nEU inland waterways.\nAccording to Article 3 of Directive 2006/87/EC\nit is mandatory when navigating on the Rhine (zone R) it is obligatory to carry\neither: \n\u2013              \na certificate issued under Article 22 of the\nRevised Convention for Rhine Navigation or \n\u2013              \na Community inland navigation certificate issued\nor renewed after 30 December 2008 and attesting to the full compliance of the\ncraft with the technical requirements referred to in Annex II of Directive\n2006/87/EC for which equivalency with the technical requirements laid down in\napplication of the abovementioned Convention has been established according to\nthe applicable rules and procedures, without prejudice to the transitional\nprovisions of the section in Annex II on \"Transitional and final\nprovisions\".\nHowever, the equivalence of the two\ncertificates is difficult to maintain. They are linked to two different legal\nframeworks, each of which operates on a separate set of standards in accordance\nwith its own specific rules and procedures.\nIn the interest of safety and in order to achieve\na level playing field, progress towards a single, uniform set of technical\nstandards is needed. This would provide more legal certainty and ensure that technical\nadaptations to technical progress can be introduced within a reasonable time so\nas to ensure that high safety standards on all EU inland waterways are maintained\nand that innovation in the sector is not hampered. \nAs the two legal regimes mentioned above operate\naccording to their own rules and procedures, progress towards a single, uniform\nset of technical standards can only be achieved gradually. As a first step, it\nis important to separate the rules that refer to decision-making from those of\na more general \u2013 non EU specific \u2013 procedural or technical nature. In the\ncurrent version of the Directive, these provisions are not neatly separated,\nmaking it difficult to devise a single technical standard applicable to both\nlegal regimes.\nAs a second step, it will be important to\nestablish appropriate structures that enable the EU and CCNR to develop and\nmaintain uniform common technical standards. Therefore, a dedicated structure\nneeds to be created with the necessary expertise to develop technical standards\nwithin a context combining EU and CCNR Member States and associating other\ninterested international organisations. To this effect, an administrative\narrangement has been signed by the Commission services and the Secretariat\nGeneral of the CCNR on 22 May 2013 which expresses the intention of both sides to\nestablish a dedicated committee for this purpose under the auspices of the\nCCNR. This committee will be open to experts representing EU and CCNR member\nstates and will also allow an adequate participation of other stakeholders. \nThis committee should develop technical standards.\nOnce this dedicated Committee has been set up it would start its work in\ndeveloping technical standards. The present proposal allows the Commission to\ntake into account the technical standards developed by this dedicated Committee,\nby making a reference to its standards when adapting the technical requirements\nincluded in the directive to technical progress or to the work of international\norganisations.\nIf, in accordance with the administrative\narrangement of 22 May 2013, the CCNR would proceed in a similar way to adapt\nthe Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulation, allowing this Regulation to refer also\nto the standards of this new sui generis Committee, the administrative\nprocedures for the maintenance of technical standards for inland navigation\nvessels would become more streamlined and full uniformity of standards would be\nachieved between the legal regimes of the EU and the Rhine. \nFurthermore, there are amendments related to\nthe fact that Directive 2006/87/EC is being reviewed for the first time after\nthe entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon; the new rules on delegated and\nimplementing powers needed to be introduced. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES \nOn 1 March 2013, the Commission convened a\nmeeting with the Directors in charge of inland navigation in the Member States'\nadministrations and in the EEA and the Secretary Generals of the River\nCommissions. Participants in the meeting generally welcomed the overall\napproach to revising governance in order to streamline updates of the technical\nstandards for inland navigation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nIn the context of Directive 2006/87/EC, the\ntechnical requirements for inland waterway vessels are laid down in annex II.\nThe proposed Directive re-organises the content of the annexes so as to ensure\nthat these only cover aspects of a technical or a procedural nature. Aspects\nreferring to the decision-making mechanism are integrated into the main text of\nthe Directive. This concerns mainly the following provisions:\n\u2013              \nEquivalences and derogations (Article 18), Adaptation\nof the Annexes (Article 22), \n\u2013              \nCarrying out of technical inspections (Article\n9). \nThe approach taken in this proposal is to delegate\npowers to the Commission in respect of adapting the annexes of this directive in\nlight of scientific and technical progress or of developments in this area\narising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that\nof the CCNR. \nIn particular, the Commission should be\nempowered to adopt delegated acts for adapting the annexes, including for modifying\nthe models of documents set out in the annexes to this Directive and adopting or\nmodifying administrative instructions. \nFurthermore, to ensure uniform conditions for\nthe implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred\non the Commission, to authorise certain derogations to the technical\nrequirements for specific craft, to approve classification societies and to\napprove certain additional technical requirements for certain zones that are\nnot linked to the navigable inland waterways of another Member State. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the\nrules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States\nof the Commission's exercise of implementing powers.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe Directive has no financial impact. Certain\nactivities linked to the Directive will be financed through other basic acts.\n\u00a0\n2013/0302 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down technical requirements for\ninland waterway vessels and repealing Directive 2006/87/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft\nlegislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[4],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure[5],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2006/87/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council[6]\nestablishes harmonised conditions for issuing technical certificates for inland\nwaterway vessels throughout the Union's inland waterway network.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The technical requirements\nfor vessels navigating on the Rhine river are established by the Central\nCommission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The technical requirements\nset out in the annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC for the most part incorporate\nthe provisions laid down in the Rhine Vessels Inspection Regulations, in the\nversion approved in 2004 by the CCNR. The conditions and technical requirements\nfor issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised\nConvention on the Navigation on the Rhine are updated regularly and are\nrecognised as reflecting current technological developments.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maintaining two different\nset of rules, those for certificates issued pursuant to Article 22 of the\nRevised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine and for the Union inland\nnavigation certificate, does not ensure legal certainty and safety.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to achieve\nharmonisation at Union level and to prevent distortions of competition and\nvarying levels of safety the same technical requirements for the whole of the Union's inland waterway network should be applied and updated regularly. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the CCNR has built\nup significant expertise in updating technical requirements for inland\nnavigation vessels, this expertise should be fully used for the inland\nwaterways in the Union. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union inland navigation\ncertificates attesting that craft are fully compliant with the technical\nrequirements should be valid on all Union inland waterways.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conditions for the\nissuing of supplementary Union inland navigation certificates by Member States\nfor operations on Zone 1 and 2 waterways (estuaries)and for operations on Zone\n4 waterways should be harmonised more closely.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interests of safety,\nstandards should be harmonised at a high level and in such a way that there is\nno reduction in safety standards on the Union inland waterways. However, Member\nStates should be allowed, after consulting the Commission, to establish\nspecific provisions concerning additional or reduced technical requirements for\ncertain zones provided that such measures are limited to the specific subjects set\nout in Annexes III and IV.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should have\nthe possibility to derogate from the provisions of this Directive in certain\ncases related to navigable waterways not linked to the inland waterways of\nother Member States or to certain craft that operate exclusively on a national\nwaterway.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States, after\nauthorisation by the Commission, should also be allowed to derogate from the\nprovisions of this Directive for specific crafts to accommodate alternative\napproaches, promote innovation or to prevent unreasonable costs. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union inland navigation\ncertificate should be issued to a craft that passes a technical inspection\ncarried out prior to the craft being put into service. This technical\ninspection should be used to check whether the craft complies with the\ntechnical requirements set out in this Directive. The competent authorities of\nthe Member States should be entitled to carry out additional inspections at any\ntime to verify that the craft's physical state matches the Union inland\nnavigation certificates.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate, within\ncertain time limits and depending on the category of craft concerned, to\ndetermine the period of validity of Union inland navigation certificates in\neach specific case.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Detailed provisions concerning\nthe replacement, renewal, extension of validity and issuance of new Union\ninland navigation certificates need to be established, within certain limits, in\norder to maintain a high degree of safety in inland navigation.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures set out in\nDirective 2009/100/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[7] need to remain in force for\nvessels not covered by this Directive.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A transitional regime should\nbe applied in the case of craft in service not yet carrying a Union inland\nnavigation certificate when they undergo a first technical inspection under the\nrevised technical requirements established by this Directive.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Binding administrative\ninstructions should be issued in order to provide detailed rules on the\napplication of the technical requirements in a harmonised manner.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Changes in technical\nrequirements need to be taken into account for reasons of safety of inland\nnavigation and equivalence of certificates. In order to do so, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union should be delegated to the Commission to adapt the annexes\nto this Directive in line with scientific and technical progress or with\ndevelopments in this area arising from the work of other international\norganisations, in particular the CCNR. It is particularly important that the\nCommission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\ndelegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate submission\nof the relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\u00a0(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to accommodate\nalternative approaches, to promote innovation, to prevent unreasonable costs, to\nprovide for an efficient process for issuing certificates or to take account of\nregional circumstances, implementing powers should be conferred on the\nCommission as regards the authorisation of certain derogations to the technical\nrequirements for specific craft, to approve classification societies and to\napprove additional or reduced technical requirements for vessels operating in certain\nzones which are not linked to the navigable inland waterways\u00a0 of another Member\nState. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8].\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2006/87/EC should\ntherefore be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nClassification of\nwaterways\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the\ninland waterways of the Union shall be classified as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zones 1, 2, 3 and 4:\n(i) Zones 1 and 2: the waterways listed\nin Chapter 1 of Annex I;\n(ii) Zone 3: the waterways listed in\nChapter 2 of Annex I;\n(iii) Zone 4: the waterways listed in\nChapter 3 of Annex I.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zone R: those of the waterways\nreferred to in point (a) for which certificates are to be issued in accordance\nwith Article 22 of the Revised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine as\nthat Article is worded when this Directive enters into force.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions and scope of\napplication\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this\nDirective, the following definitions shall apply: \n(a)         \n\u2018craft\u2019: means a vessel or item of floating\nequipment;\n(b)         \n\u2018vessel\u2019: means an inland waterway vessel or\nsea-going ship;\n(c)         \n\u2018tug\u2019: means a vessel specially built to perform\ntowing operations;\n(d)         \n\u2018pusher\u2019: means a vessel specially built to\npropel a pushed convoy;\n(e)         \n\u2018passenger vessel\u2019: means a day trip or cabin\nvessel constructed and equipped to carry more than 12 passengers;\n(f)           \n\u2018floating equipment\u2019: means a floating\ninstallation carrying working gear such as cranes, dredging equipment, pile\ndrivers or elevators;\n(g)         \n\u2018recreational craft\u2019: means a vessel other than\na passenger vessel, intended for sport or pleasure;\n(h)         \n\u2018water displacement\" : means the immersed\nvolume of the vessel, in m\u00b3;\n(i)           \n\u2018length (L)\u2019: means the maximum length of the\nhull in m, excluding rudder and bowsprit;\n(j)           \n\u2018breadth (B)\u2019: means the maximum breadth of the\nhull in m, measured to the outer edge of the shell plating (excluding paddle\nwheels, rub rails, and similar);\n(k)         \n\u2018draught (T)\u2019: means the vertical distance in m\nbetween the lowest point of the hull without taking into account the keel or\nother fixed attachments and the maximum draught line;\n(l)           \n'Classification society': means a classification\nsociety that has been approved in accordance with the criteria and procedures referred\nto in Article 9;\n(m)       \n\u2018Union inland navigation certificate\u2019: means a\ncertificate issued to an inland waterway vessel by the competent authority,\nsignifying compliance with the technical requirements of this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall apply\nto the following craft:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 vessels having a length (L) of 20\nmetres or more;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 vessels for which the product of\nlength (L), breadth (B) and draught (T) is a volume of 100 m3 or more.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall also\napply to the following craft:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tugs and pushers intended for towing\nor pushing craft referred to in paragraph 1 or floating equipment or for moving\nsuch craft or floating equipment alongside;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 vessels intended for passenger\ntransport which carry more than 12 passengers in addition to the crew;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 floating equipment.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Directive shall not\napply to the following craft:\n(a) ferries;\n(b) naval vessels;\n(c) sea-going vessels, including sea-going\ntugs and pusher craft, which:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i) operate or are based on tidal\nwaters;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (ii) operate temporarily on inland\nwaterways, provided that they carry:\n\u2013              \na certificate proving conformity with the 1974\nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), or equivalent,\na certificate proving conformity with the 1966 International Convention on Load\nLines, or equivalent, and an international oil pollution prevention (IOPP)\ncertificate proving conformity with the 1973 International Convention for the\nPrevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL);

However, in the case of hatches, h is obtained by reducing the height of the coamings by half of the safety distance according to Article 4.01(1) and (2). In no case will a value exceeding 0,36 m be taken for h. \nIf or\nis\nless than 0,6 the effective length le of the superstructure will be zero.\n4.                      \nCoefficients \u03b2v and \u03b2a are calculated\nusing the following formulae:\n5.                      \nThe effective aft/forward sheers Sev/Sea are\ncalculated using the following formulae:\nSev\n= Sv \u0387 p\nSea\n= Sa \u0387 p\nwhere:\n Sv ||   || is the actual forward sheer, in mm; however Sv shall not be taken to be more than 1000 mm; \n Sa ||   || is the actual aft sheer, in mm; however Sa may not be taken to be more than 500 mm; \n p ||   || is a coefficient calculated using the following formula: \n x ||   || is the abscissa, measured from the extremity of the point where the sheer is 0,25 Sv or 0,25 Sa (see figure).     \nHowever, coefficient p will not be taken to\nbe more than 1.\n6.                      \nIf \u03b2a \u0387 Sea is greater than \u03b2v\n\u0387 Sev, the value \u03b2v \u0387 Sev of will be taken as being the value\nfor \u03b2a \u0387 Sea.\nArticle 4.03\nMinimum freeboard\nIn view of the reductions referred to in\nArticle 4.02 the minimum freeboard shall be not less than 0 mm.\nArticle 4.04\nDraught marks\n1.                      \nThe plane of maximum draught shall be determined\nin such a way that the specifications concerning minimum freeboard and minimum\nsafety clearance are both met. However, for safety reasons, the inspection body\nmay lay down a greater value for the safety clearance or freeboard. The plane\nof maximum draught shall be determined at least for Zone 3.\n2.                      \nThe plane of maximum draught shall be indicated\nby means of highly visible, indelible draught marks.\n3.                      \nThe draught marks for Zone 3 shall consist of a\nrectangle 300 mm long and 40 mm deep, the base of which is horizontal and\ncoincides with the plane of the maximum authorised draught. Any differing\ndraught marks shall include such a rectangle.\n4.                      \nVessels shall have at least three pairs of\ndraught marks, of which one pair shall be centrally located and the two others\nlocated, respectively, at a distance from the bow and stern that is equal to\nroughly one-sixth of the length.\nHowever,\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where a vessel is less than 40 m in\nlength it will suffice to affix two pairs of marks at a distance from the bow\nand stern, respectively, that is equal to a quarter of the length;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where vessels are not intended for the\ncarriage of goods, a pair of marks located roughly halfway along the vessel\nwill suffice.\n5.                      \nMarks or indications which cease to be valid\nfollowing a further inspection shall be deleted or marked as being no longer\nvalid under the supervision of the inspection body. If a draught mark should\ndisappear, it may only be replaced under the supervision of an inspection body.\n6.                      \nWhere a vessel has been measured in\nimplementation of the 1966 Convention on the Measurement of Inland Navigation\nVessels and the plane of the measurement marks meets the requirements of this\nDirective, those measurement marks shall take the place of the draught marks;\nthis shall be mentioned in the Union inland navigation certificate.\n7.                      \nFor vessels operating on zones of inland\nwaterways other than Zone 3 (Zones 1, 2 or 4) the bow and stern pairs of\ndraught marks provided for in paragraph 4 shall be supplemented by adding a\nvertical line to which one or, in the case of several zones, several additional\ndraught lines 150 mm long shall be affixed towards the bow, in relation to the\ndraught mark for Zone 3.\nThis vertical line and the horizontal line\nshall be 30 mm thick. In addition to the draught mark towards the bow of the\nvessel, the relevant zone numbers shall be indicated in lettering 60 mm high \u00d7\n40 mm deep (see Figure 1).\n Figure 1 \nArticle 4.05\nMaximum loaded draught of vessels\nwhose holds are not always closed so as to be spray-proof and weathertight\nIf the plane of maximum draught for Zone 3\nof a vessel is determined by assuming that the holds may be closed in such a\nway as to make them spray-proof and weathertight, and if the distance between\nthe plane of maximum draught and the upper edge of the coamings is less than\n500 mm, the maximum draught for sailing with uncovered holds shall be\ndetermined.\nThe following statement shall be entered on\nthe Union inland navigation certificate:\n\u2018Where the hold hatches are totally or\npartly uncovered the vessel may only be loaded up to ... mm below the draught\nmarks for Zone 3.\u2019\u00bb\nArticle 4.06\nDraught scales\n1.                      \nVessels whose draught may exceed 1 m shall bear\na draught scale on each of their sides towards the stern; they may bear\nadditional draught scales.\n2.                      \nThe zero points on each draught scale shall be\ntaken vertically to this within the plane running parallel to the plane of\nmaximum draught passing through the lowest point of the hull or of the keel\nwhere such exists. The vertical distance above the zero point shall be\ngraduated in decimetres. That graduation shall be located on each scale, from\nthe unladen water line up to 100 mm above the maximum draught by means of\npunched or chiselled marks, and shall be painted in the form of a\nhighly-visible band in two alternating colours. That graduation shall be\nidentified by figures at a distance of every five decimetres marked next to the\nscale as well as at the top of the scale.\n3.                      \nThe two stern measurement scales affixed pursuant\nto the Convention referred to in Article 4.04 (6), may replace the draught\nscales, provided that they include a graduation that meets the requirements\nplus, where appropriate, figures indicating the draught.\nCHAPTER 5\nMANOEUVRABILITY\nArticle 5.01\nGeneral\nVessels and convoys shall display adequate\nnavigability and manoeuvrability.\nUnpowered vessels intended to be towed\nshall meet the specific requirements laid down by the inspection body.\nPowered vessels and convoys shall meet the\nrequirements set out in Articles 5.02 to 5.10.\nArticle 5.02\nNavigation tests\n1.                      \nNavigability and manoeuvrability shall be\nchecked by means of navigation tests. Compliance with the requirements of\nArticles 5.06 to 5.10 shall, in particular, be examined.\n2.                      \nThe inspection body may dispense with all or\npart of the tests where compliance with the navigability and manoeuvrability\nrequirements is proven in another manner.\nArticle 5.03\nTest area\n1.                      \nThe navigation tests referred to in Article 5.02\nshall be carried out on areas of inland waterways that have been designated by\nthe competent authorities.\n2.                      \nThose test areas shall be situated on a stretch\nof flowing or standing water that is if possible straight, at least 2 km long\nand sufficiently wide and is equipped with highly-distinctive marks for determining\nthe position of the vessel.\n3.                      \nIt shall be possible for the inspection body to\nplot the hydrological data such as depth of water, width of navigable channel\nand average speed of the current in the navigation area as a function of the\nvarious water levels.\nArticle 5.04\nDegree of loading of\nvessels and convoys during navigation tests\nDuring navigation tests, vessels and\nconvoys intended to carry goods shall be loaded to at least 70 % of their\ntonnage and loading, distributed in such a way as to ensure a horizontal\nattitude as far as possible. If the tests are carried out with a lesser load\nthe approval for downstream navigation shall be restricted to that loading.\nArticle 5.05\nUse of on-board facilities\nfor navigation test\n1.                      \nDuring the navigation test, all of the equipment\nreferred to in items 34 and 52 of the Union inland navigation certificate which\nmay be actuated from the wheelhouse may be used, apart from anchors.\n2.                      \nHowever, during the test involving turning into\nthe current referred to in Article 5.10, bow anchors may be used.\nArticle 5.06\nPrescribed (forward) speed\n1.                      \nVessels and convoys shall achieve a speed in\nrelation to the water of at least 13 km/h.

Movement of that\nlever towards the bow of the vessel shall cause forward motion, whereas\nmovement of the lever towards the stern shall cause the vessel to go astern.\nClutch engagement and reversal of the direction of motion shall take place\nabout the neutral position of that lever. The lever shall catch in the neutral\nposition.\n3.                      \nThe direction of the propulsion thrust imparted\nto the vessel and the rotational speed of the propeller or main engines shall\nbe displayed.\n4.                      \nThe indicating and monitoring devices required\nby Article 6.07(2), Article 8.03(2), and Article 8.05 (13), shall be located at\nthe steering position.\n5.                      \nVessels with wheelhouses designed for radar\nnavigation by one person shall be steered by means of a lever. It shall be\npossible to move that lever easily by hand. The position of the lever in\nrelation to the longitudinal axis of the vessel shall correspond precisely to\nthe position of the rudder blades. It shall be possible to release hold of the\nlever in any given position without that of the rudder blades changing. The\nneutral position of the lever shall be clearly perceptible.\n6.                      \nWhere the vessel is fitted with bow rudders or\nspecial rudders, particularly for going astern, these shall be actuated in\nwheelhouses designed for radar navigation by one person by special levers\nwhich, mutatis mutandis, meet the requirements set out in paragraph 5.\nThat requirement shall also apply where, in\nconvoys, the steering system fitted to craft other than those powering the\nconvoy is used.\n7.                      \nWhere rate-of-turn regulators are used, it shall\nbe possible for the rate-of-turn control to be released in any given position\nwithout altering the speed selected.\nThe control shall turn through a wide enough\narc to guarantee adequately precise positioning. The neutral position shall be\nclearly perceptible from the other positions. The scale illumination shall be\nsteplessly variable.\n8.                      \nThe remote-control equipment for the entire\nsteering system shall be installed in a permanent manner and be arranged in\nsuch a way that the course selected is clearly visible. If the remote control\nequipment can be disengaged, it shall be equipped with an indicating device\ndisplaying the respective operational conditions \u2018in service\u2019 or \u2018out of\nservice\u2019. The disposition and manipulation of the controls shall be functional.\nFor systems that are subsidiary to the steering\nsystem, such as active bow thrusters, remote-control equipment not permanently\ninstalled shall be acceptable provided that such a subsidiary installation can\nbe activated by means of an override at any time within the wheelhouse.\n9.                      \nIn the case of rudder-propeller, water-jet,\ncycloidal-propeller and bow-thruster systems, equivalent devices shall be\nacceptable as control, indicating and monitoring devices.\nThe requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 8\nshall apply, mutatis mutandis, in view of the specific characteristics and\narrangements selected for the abovementioned active steering and propulsion\nunits. In analogy to paragraph 2, each unit shall be controlled by a lever\nwhich moves in the form of an arc within a vertical plane that is approximately\nparallel to the direction of the thrust of the unit. From the position of the\nlever the direction of the thrust acting on the vessel shall be clear.\nIf rudder propeller or cycloidal-propeller\nsystems are not controlled by means of levers, the inspection body may allow\nderogations from paragraph 2. These derogations shall be mentioned in the Union\ninland navigation certificate in box 52 referred to in Annex V.\nArticle 7.05\nNavigation lights, light\nsignals and sound signals\n1.                      \nNavigation lights, their casings and accessories\nshall bear the approval mark prescribed by Council\nDirective 2013/XXX/EC of XX MMM 2013 on marine equipment.*\n(*)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ LXX, JJ.MM.JJJJ, p.

and 5.10 in\nconjunction with Articles 5.02(1), 5.03(1), 5.04 and 16.06 of Annex II)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General conditions and boundary conditions relating to\nthe evasive action test\n1.1. According to Article 5.09, vessels and\nconvoys shall be able to take evasive action in good time and the capacity for\nsuch action shall be proved by evasive action manoeuvres in the test area in\naccordance with Article 5.03. This shall be proved by simulated evasive action\nmanoeuvres to port and starboard with prescribed values whereby for specific\nturning speeds of the vessel in response to putting across and then checking\nthe helm a certain time limit shall be complied with.\nDuring tests the requirements of Section 2\nshall be complied with keeping a keel clearance of at least 20 % of the\ndraught, but not less than 0,50 m.\n2. Evasive action test procedure and recording of data\n(Diagram in Annex 1)\n2.1. Evasive action manoeuvres shall be\nperformed as follows:\nWith the vessel or convoy under way at a\nconstant speed of V0 = 13 km/h in relation to the water, at the\nstart of the manoeuvre (time t0 = 0 s, turning speed r = 0\u00b0/min,\nrudder angle \u03b40 = 0\u00b0, engine speed kept constant), evasive\naction to port or starboard is to be initiated by putting across the helm. The\nrudder shall be set to an angle \u03b4, or the steering unit to an angle \u03b4a\nin the case of an active steering device, at the start of the manoeuvre, in\naccordance with the indications given in point 2.3. The rudder angle \u03b4\n(e.g. 20\u00b0 to starboard) shall be maintained until the value r1 of\nthe turning speed referred to in point 2.2 for the corresponding dimensions of\nthe vessel or convoy is reached. When the turning speed r1 is\nreached, the time t1 shall be recorded and the rudder set to the\nsame angle on the opposite side (e.g. 20\u00b0 to port) so as to stop the turn and\ncommence turning in the opposite direction, i.e., to reduce the turning speed\nto r2 = 0 and let it to rise again to the value given in point 2.2.\nWhen the turning speed r2 = 0 is reached, the time t2\nshall be recorded. When the turning speed r3 given in point 2.2 is\nreached, the rudder shall be set in the opposite direction to the same angle\n\u03b4, so as to stop the turning movement. The time t3 shall be\nrecorded. When the turning speed r4 = 0 is reached, the time t4\nshall be recorded and the vessel or convoy shall be returned to its original\ncourse.\n2.2. The following limit values shall be\ncomplied with to reach turning speed r4 depending on the dimensions\nof the vessels or the convoys and on the water depth h:\n   || Dimensions of vessels or convoys L \u00d7 B || Required turning speed r1 = r3 (\u00b0/min) || Limit values for the time t4 (s) in shallow and deep water \n \u03b4 = 20\u00b0 || \u03b4 = 45\u00b0 || 1,2 \u2264 h/T \u2264 1,4 || 1,4 < h/T < 2 || h/T > 2 \n 1 || All motor vessels; single-in-line convoys \u2264 110 \u00d7 11,45 || 20\u00b0/min || 28\u00b0/min || 150 s || 110 s || 110 s \n 2 || Single-in-line convoys up to 193 \u00d7 11,45 or two-abreast convoys up to 110 \u00d7 22,90 || 12\u00b0/min || 18\u00b0/min || 180 s || 130 s || 110 s \n 3 || Two-abreast convoys \u2264 193 \u00d7 22,90 || 8\u00b0/min || 12\u00b0/min || 180 s || 130 s || 110 s \n 4 || Two-abreast convoys up to 270 \u00d7 22,90 or three-abreast convoys up to 193 \u00d7 34,35 || 6\u00b0/min || 8\u00b0/min || [30] || [31] || [32] \nThe times t1, t2, t3\nand t4 required to reach turning speeds r1, r2,\nr3 and r4 shall be recorded in the measurements report in\nAnnex 2. The t4 values shall not exceed the limits given in the\ntable.\n2.3. At least four evasive action\nmanoeuvres shall be carried out, namely:\n\u2013                        \none to starboard with a rudder angle \u03b4 =\n20\u00b0\n\u2013                        \none to port with a rudder angle \u03b4 = 20\u00b0\n\u2013                        \none to starboard with a rudder angle \u03b4 =\n45\u00b0\n\u2013                        \none to port with a rudder angle \u03b4 = 45\u00b0.\nIf necessary (e.g. in the case of\nuncertainty about the values measured or of unsatisfactory manoeuvres), the\nevasive action manoeuvres shall be repeated. The turning speeds given in point\n2.2 and the time limits shall be complied with. For active steering devices or\nspecial types of rudder, a position \u03b4a of the steering unit or\nrudder angle \u03b4a other than \u03b4 = 20\u00b0 and \u03b4 = 45\u00b0 may be\nselected, according to the expert\u2019s assessment, depending on the type of\nsteering system.\n2.4. In order to determine the turning\nspeed, a rate-of-turn indicator in accordance with Appendix VIII this Directive\nshall be on board.\n2.5. In accordance with Article 5.04, the\nload condition during the evasive action manoeuvre shall be between 70 % and\n100 % of the maximum deadweight. If the test is carried out with a smaller\nload, approval for downstream and upstream navigation shall be restricted to\nthat load limit.\nThe procedure for evasive action manoeuvres\nand the terms used are shown in a diagram in Annex 1.\n3. Turning capacity\nThe turning capacity of vessels and convoys\nwhose length (L) does not exceed 86 m and width (B) does not exceed 22,90 m\nshall be considered sufficient under Article 5.10, in conjunction with Article\n5.02(1) when during an upstream turning manoeuvre with an initial speed in\nrelation to the water of 13 km/h, the limit values for stopping facing\ndownstream established in Administrative instruction No 2 are complied with.\nThe keel clearance conditions according to Section 1.1 shall be complied with.\n4. Other requirements\n4.1. Notwithstanding points 1 to 3, the\nfollowing requirements shall be met:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) for manually controlled\nsteering systems, a single turn of the wheel shall correspond to a rudder angle\nof at least 3\u00b0;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) for powered steering\nsystems, when the rudder is at maximum immersion, it shall be possible to\nachieve an average angular velocity of 4\u00b0/s over the rudder\u2019s entire turning\nrange.\nThis requirement shall also be checked,\nwith the vessel at full speed, for moving the rudder over a range from 35\u00b0 port\nto 35\u00b0 starboard. In addition, it shall be checked whether the rudder keeps the\nposition of maximum angle at maximum propulsion power. For active steering\nsystems or special types of rudder, this provision applies mutatis mutandis.\n4.2. If any of the additional equipment\nreferred to in Article 5.05 is needed in order to reach the required\nmanoeuvring capacities, it shall comply with the requirements of chapter 6, and\nthe following particulars shall be entered under item 52 of the Union inland\nnavigation certificate:\n\u2018Flanking rudders[33]/bow steering systems[34]/other equipment[35] referred to under item 34 is[36]/are[37] necessary to comply with the\nmanoeuvrability requirements of chapter 5.\u2019\u00bb\n5.

Stopping manoeuvre\nThe vessels and convoys referred to in\nChapter 5 shall carry out a test in flowing water or in standing water, in a\ntest area, to prove that they are capable of stopping facing downstream only\nwith their propulsion system without the use of anchors. The stopping manoeuvre\nshall, in principle, be carried out in accordance with figure 1. It begins when\nthe vessel is travelling at a constant speed of as near as possible to 13 km/h\nin relation to the water by reversing the engines from \u2018ahead\u2019 to \u2018astern\u2019\n(point A of the order \u2018stop\u2019) and is completed when the vessel is\nstationary in relation to the ground (point E: v = 0 in relation to the\nground or point D: = point E: v = 0 in relation to the water and\nin relation to the ground if the stopping manoeuvre is carried out in standing\nwater).\nWhen stopping manoeuvres are carried out in\nflowing water, the position and the moment of stopping in relation to the water\nshall also be recorded (the vessel moves at the speed of the current; point D:\nv = 0 in relation to the water).\nThe data measured shall be entered in a\nreport as shown in the diagram of table 1. Before the stopping manoeuvre is\ncarried out, the unchanging data shall be entered at the top of the form.\nThe average current velocity (vSTR)\nin the fairway shall be determined, if available, based on the reading of an\nestablished water level gauge, or by measuring the movement of a floating body\nand shall be entered in the report.\nIn principle, the use of current metres is\npermitted to determine the speed of the vessel in relation to the water during\nthe stopping manoeuvre, if it is possible to record the movement and the\nrequired data in accordance with the procedure above.\n2. Registration of the data measured and recording them in the\nreport (table 1)\nFor the stopping manoeuvre, first of all\nthe initial speed in relation to the water shall be determined. This can be\ndone by measuring the time taken to travel between two markers on land. In\nflowing water, the average current velocity shall be taken into account.\nThe stopping manoeuvre is initiated by the\norder \u2018stop\u2019A, given on passing a marker on land. Passing the land\nmarker shall be recorded perpendicularly to the axis of the vessel and shall be\nentered in the report. Passing all other land markers during the stopping\nmanoeuvre shall be similarly recorded and each marker (e.g. kilometre post) and\nthe time of passing shall be noted in the report.\nThe values measured shall, if possible, be\nrecorded at intervals of 50 m. In each case, note should be taken of the time\nwhen points B and C \u2014 if possible \u2014 as well as when points D\nand E are reached and the respective position shall be estimated. The\ndata concerning the engine speed need not be recorded in the report, but should\nbe noted to permit more accurate control of the initial speed.\n3. Description of the stopping manoeuvre\nThe stopping manoeuvre according to figure\n1 shall be presented in the form of a diagram. First of all, the time-traverse\ndiagram shall be plotted using the measurements entered in the test report and\npoints A to E shall be indicated. It will then be possible to\ndetermine the average speed between two measurement points and to plot the\nspeed/time diagram.\nThis is done as follows (see figure 1):\nBy determining the quotient of the\ndifference of position over the difference in time \u0394s/\u0394t, the average\nspeed of the vessel for this period can be calculated.\nExample:\nDuring the interval between 0 sec. and 10\nsec., the distance from 0 m to 50 m is covered.\n\u0394s/\u0394t = 50 m/10 s = 5,0 m/s = 18,0 km/h\nThis value is entered as the average speed at\nthe 5 sec. abscissa-position. During the second interval, from 10 sec. to 20\nsec., a distance of 45 m is covered.\n\u0394s/\u0394t = 45 m/10 s = 4,5 m/s = 16,2 km/h\nAt marker D, the vessel has stopped\nin relation to the water i.e. current velocity is approximately 5 km/h.\nFigure 1\nStopping manoeuvre\nKey to symbols in figure 1\n A ||   || \u2018stop\u2019 order \n B ||   || propeller stopped \n C ||   || propeller in reverse \n D ||   || v = 0 in relation to the water \n E ||   || v = 0 in relation to the ground \n v ||   || speed of vessel \n vL ||   || v in relation to the ground \n s ||   || distance covered in relation to the ground \n t ||   || measured time \nTable 1\nReport of the stopping manoeuvre\n Inspection Body: || \u2026 || Type of vessel or convoy: || \u2026 || Test area: || \u2026 \n L \u00d7 B [m]: || \u2026 || Water level gauge reading || [m]: || \u2026 \n Date: || \u2026 || T at test [m]: || \u2026 || Water depth || [m]: || \u2026 \n Name: || \u2026 || Load at Test [t]: || \u2026 || Gradient || [m/km]: || \u2026 \n Test run No: || \u2026 || % of maximum deadweight || \u2026 || VSTR || [km/h]: || \u2026 \n   ||   || Power of propulsion engines PB[kW] || \u2026 || [m/s]: || \u2026 \n   ||   || Propulsion system according to Annex 2, table 2: || \u2026 || Max. displacement || [m3]: || \u2026 \n Position [river-km] || Time [sec.] || \u0394s [m] || \u0394t [sec.] || vIL [km/h] || Engine speed n [min\u20131] || Observations \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   \nAppendix 2\nto Administrative instruction No 2\nEVALUATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE\nSTOPPING MANOEUVRE\n1.                      \nOn the basis of the values recorded compliance\nwith the limit values in accordance with Appendix 1 shall be verified.

General requirements\n1.1. Every coupling system shall guarantee\nthe rigid coupling of all the craft in a convoy, i.e. under foreseen operating\nconditions the coupling device shall prevent longitudinal or transversal\nmovement between the vessels, so that the assembly can be seen as a \u2018nautical\nunit\u2019\n1.2. The coupling system and its components\nshall be safe and easy to use, enabling craft to be coupled rapidly without\nendangering personnel.\n1.3. The forces arising from foreseen\noperating conditions shall be properly absorbed and safely transmitted into the\nvessel\u2019s structure by the coupling system and its components.\n1.4. A sufficient number of coupling points\nshall be available.\n2. Coupling forces and dimensioning of coupling devices\nThe coupling devices of convoys and\nformations of vessels to be authorised shall be dimensioned so as to guarantee\nsufficient safety levels. This condition is deemed to be fulfilled if the\ncoupling forces determined according to points 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are assumed to\nbe the tensile strength for the dimensioning of the longitudinal coupling\ncomponents.\n2.1.

Each\ncoupling point shall be dimensioned for the coupling force determined according\nto points 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3. If rigid coupling components are used, a single\ncoupling point may be authorised if that point ensures secure connection of the\ncraft.\nThe tensile strength of the cables shall be\nselected according to the foreseen number of windings. There shall be no more\nthan three windings at the coupling point. Cables shall be selected according\nto their intended use.\n2.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of pushers with\na single pushed lighter, formula in point 2.2 can be used to determine the\ncoupling force if such pushers have been authorised to propel several such\nlighters.\n2.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sufficient numbers of\nbollards or equivalent devices shall be available and be capable of absorbing\nthe coupling forces arising.\n3. Special requirements for articulated couplings\nArticulated couplings shall be designed so\nas to also ensure a rigid coupling between craft. Compliance with the\nrequirements of Chapter 5 shall be checked during navigation tests with a rigid\nconvoy in accordance with Article 16.06.\nThe drive unit of the articulated coupling\nshall enable a satisfactory return from the articulated position. The requirements\nof Articles 6.02 to 6.04 shall be applied mutatis mutandis, hence when a\npowered drive unit is used, a second independent drive unit and energy source\nshall be available in the event of failure.\nIt shall be possible to operate and monitor\nthe articulated coupling (its articulated movement, at least) from the\nwheelhouse, the requirements of Articles 7.03 and 7.05 shall be applied mutatis\nmutandis.\nADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION No 4\nApplication\nof Transitional provisions \n(Chapters 15 to 22b, Chapter 24 and Chapter 24a of\nAnnex II)\n1.                      \nApplication of transitional provisions in\njoining together parts of craft \n1.1.                \nPrinciples \nWhere parts of different vessels are joined\ntogether, status quo protection shall be granted only for the parts which\nbelong to the vessel which retains its Union inland navigation certificate.\nTransitional provisions may therefore be invoked only for those parts.

Introduction\nPersons with reduced mobility have safety\nneeds exceeding those of other passengers. These needs are taken into account\nin the requirements of Chapter 15, which are explained as follows.\nThese requirements are intended to ensure\nthat persons with reduced mobility can stay and move safely on board vessels.\nIn addition, in an emergency such persons should have the same level of safety\nas other passengers.\nIt is not necessary that all passenger\nareas fulfil the specific safety requirements of persons with reduced mobility.\nTherefore those requirements apply only to certain areas. However, the persons\nin question must be given the opportunity of being informed of the areas\nspecially adapted for them in view of safety, so that they can organise their\nstay on board accordingly. It is the responsibility of the ship-owner to make\nthe corresponding areas available, make them known and communicate them to\npersons with reduced mobility.\nThe provisions concerning persons with\nreduced mobility make reference to:\n\u2013                        \nDirective 2003/24/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 14 April 2003 amending Council Directive 98/18/EC on\nsafety rules and standards for passenger ships, and\n\u2013                        \nthe guide for the adaptation of inland waterway\npassenger vessels to people with disabilities in accordance with Resolution No\n25 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\nThe definition of the term \u2018persons with\nreduced mobility\u2019 used in Annex II is largely identical to that of Directive 2003/24/EC\nand most of the technical requirements are based on the guide. In cases of\ndoubt, therefore, both can be referred to when taking decisions. In general,\nthe requirements of Directive 2003/24/EC and UN/ECE Resolution No. 25 entitled\n\u201cGuidelines for Passenger Vessels also suited for carrying Disabled Persons\u201d go\nbeyond those of Annex II.\nThe requirements of Annex II do not concern\nberths and similar installations. These are subject to national provisions.\n2. Article 1.01(104) \u2014 Term \u2018Persons with reduced mobility\u2019\n\u2018Persons with reduced mobility\u2019 means\nanyone who, as a result of physical impairments, cannot move or distinguish their\nsurroundings in the same way as other passengers. This definition includes\npersons with impaired eyesight or hearing or persons accompanying children in\nbuggies or being carried. However, for the purposes of these provisions,\npersons with reduced mobility do not include anyone with psychic impairments.\n3. Article 18(1c) of this Directive \u2014 Areas provided for use by\npersons with reduced mobility\nAreas provided for use by persons with\nreduced mobility range from, in the simplest case, the entrance area to the\nplaces from which an evacuation will take place in an emergency. They shall\ninclude:\n\u2013                        \na place where life-saving equipment is stowed or\nissued in an emergency,\n\u2013                        \nseats,\n\u2013                        \na suitably-adapted toilet (No 10 of these\nguidelines), and\n\u2013                        \nconnecting corridors.\nThe number of seats corresponds at least\napproximately to the number of persons with reduced mobility that \u2014 over a\nlengthy period \u2014 are most frequently onboard simultaneously. The number should\nbe determined by the ship-owner on the basis of experience, as this is beyond\nthe knowledge of the competent authority.\nOn cabin vessels consideration shall also\nbe given to connecting corridors to passenger cabins used by persons with\nreduced mobility. The number of such cabins is to be determined by the\nship-owner in the same way as the number of seats. With the exception of the\nwidth of doors, no requirements are imposed for the special arrangement of\ncabins. It is the responsibility of the owner to make any further necessary\narrangements.\n4. Article 15.06(3)(g) \u2014 Exits of rooms\nWith regard to the requirements concerning\nthe width of connecting corridors, exits and openings in bulwarks or guard\nrails intended for use by persons with reduced mobility or usually used for the\nembarkation or disembarkation of persons with reduced mobility, consideration\nshall be given to buggies and the fact that people may be dependent on various\ntypes of walking aids or wheelchairs. In the case of exits or openings for\nembarkation or disembarkation account shall also be taken of the additional\nspace needed for any assisting staff.\n5. Article 15.06(4)(d) \u2014 Doors\nThe requirements regarding the arrangement\nof the area surrounding doors intended for use by persons with reduced mobility\nshall ensure that persons dependent for example on walking aids can open such\ndoors safely.\n6. Article 15.06(5)(c) \u2014 Connecting corridors\nSee point 4 of this Administrative\ninstruction.\n7. Article 15.06(9) \u2014 Stairways and elevators\nThe requirements for the arrangement of\nstairways shall, in addition to possible reduced mobility, also take into\naccount eyesight impediments.\n8. Article 15.06(10)(a) and (b) \u2014 Bulwarks and guard rails\nThe requirements for bulwarks and guard\nrails of decks intended for use by persons with reduced mobility shall provide\nfor a greater height since such persons are more likely to lose their balance\nor be unable to hold on by themselves.\nSee also point 4 of this Administrative\ninstruction.\n9. Article 15.06(13) \u2014 Traffic areas\nFor various reasons, persons with reduced\nmobility need to support themselves or hold on more frequently, so walls in\ntraffic areas intended for use by persons with reduced mobility shall be\nequipped with handrails at an appropriate height.\nSee also point 4 of this Administrative\ninstruction\n10. Article 15.06(17) \u2014 Toilets\nPersons with reduced mobility shall also be\nable to stay and move safely in toilets, so at least one toilet shall be\nadapted accordingly.\n11. Article 15.08(3)(a and b) \u2014 Alarm system\nPersons with reduced mobility are more\nlikely to encounter situations in which they are dependent on the help of\nothers. In rooms in which, as a general rule, they cannot be seen by crew\nmembers, on-board personnel or passengers, the possibility of triggering an\nalarm should therefore be provided for. This applies to toilets intended for\nuse by persons with reduced mobility.\nPersons with reduced mobility include\npersons with impaired eyesight or hearing. Consequently, at least in areas\nintended for use by persons with reduced mobility, the passenger alarm system\nshall provide suitable visual and audible alarms.\n12. Article 15.10(3)(d) \u2014 Sufficient lighting\nPersons with reduced mobility also include\npersons with impaired eyesight. Sufficient lighting in areas intended for use\nby persons with reduced mobility is therefore essential and shall meet higher\nrequirements than lighting for other passenger areas.\n13. Article 15.13(1) \u2014 Safety rota\nThe special safety measures necessary for\npersons with reduced mobility to be taken into consideration in the safety rota\nshall take into account both the possibility of reduced mobility and impaired\nhearing and eyesight. For such persons measures for normal operation shall be\ntaken into account in addition to measures in the event of emergencies.\n14. Article 15.13(2) \u2014 Safety plan\nThe areas covered by point 3 of this\nAdministrative instruction shall be designated.\n15. Article 15.13(3)(b) \u2014 Displaying the safety rota and the safety\nplan\nAt least the copies of the safety rota and\nthe safety plan displayed in the areas intended for use by persons with reduced\nmobility shall be such that they can, where possible, also be read by persons\nwith impaired eyesight. This can be achieved for example by appropriate use of\ncontrast and character size.\nIn addition, the plans shall be displayed\nat a height so that wheelchair users can read them as well.\n16. Article 15.13(4) \u2014 Code of conduct for passengers\nPoint 15 of this Administrative instruction\napplies accordingly\nADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION No 23\nEngine application covered by the appropriate type approval\n(Article 8a.03(1) of Annex II)\n1.Introduction\nAccording to Article 8a.03(1),\ntype-approvals pursuant to Directive 97/68/EC and type-approvals, which\npursuant to Directive 97/68/EC are recognised as equivalent, are recognised,\nprovided that the engine application is covered by the appropriate\ntype-approval.\nIn addition, it is possible that engines on\nboard of inland waterway vessels have to serve more than one application.\nSection 2 of this administrative\ninstruction explains when engine applications can be considered to be covered\nby the appropriate type-approval. In Section 3 clarification is given with\nrespect to the question how to treat engines which in the course of on-board\noperations need to be allocated to more than one engine application.\n2.Appropriate type-approval\nEngine applications are considered to be\ncovered by the appropriate type-approval if the engine has been allocated to\nthe type-approval on the basis of the following table. The engine categories,\nlimit value stages and test cycles are indicated in accordance with the\ntype-approval number designations.\n Engine application || Legal basis || Engine category || Limit value stage || Test \n   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || requirement || cycle ISO 8178 \n Propulsion engines with propeller characteristics || I || Directive 97/68/EC || V || IIIA || C[63] || E3 \n RVIR || \u2014 || I, II[64] || \u2014 || E3 \n Main propulsion engines with constant speed (including installations with diesel electric propulsion and variable pitch propeller) || II || Directive 97/68/EC || V || IIIA || C[65] || E2 \n RVIR || \u2014 || I, II[66] || \u2014 || E2 \n Auxiliary engines with || Constant speed || III || Directive 97/68/EC || D, E, F,G || II || B || D2 \n H, I, J, K || IIIA \n V[67] \n RVIR || \u2014 || I, II[68] || \u2014 || D2 \n Variable speed and variable load || IV || Directive 97/68/EC || D,E,F,G || II || A || C 1 \n H, I, J, K || IIIA \n V[69] \n L, M, N, P || IIIB \n Q, R || IV \n RVIR || \u2014 || I, II[70] || \u2014 || C1 \n3.Special engine applications\n3.1. Engines which in the course of\non-board operations need to be allocated to more than one engine application\nshall be treated as follows:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 auxiliary engines which drive units or\nmachinery which, pursuant to the table in Section 2, have to be allocated to\napplications III or IV need to have obtained type-approval for each of the\nrespective applications provided for in this table;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 main propulsion engines which drive\nadditional units or machinery need only to have obtained the type-approval\nnecessary for the relevant type of main propulsion pursuant to the table in\nSection 2, in so far as the engine\u2019s main application is craft propulsion. If\nthe time taken up by the sole auxiliary application exceeds 30 %, the engine\nwill need to have obtained, in addition to type-approval for the main\npropulsion application, further type-approval in respect of the auxiliary\napplication.\n3.2. Engines driving bow thrusters, whether\ndirectly or by means of a generator at:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 variable engine speed and load may be\nallocated to applications I or IV pursuant to the table in Section 2;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 constant engine speed may be allocated\nto applications II or III pursuant to the table in Section 2.\n3.3. The engines shall be installed with\nthe power output as authorised under the type-approval and indicated on the\nengine by means of identification of type. If such engines have to drive units\nor machinery of lower power consumption, power may be reduced only by measures\nexternal to the engine, in order to achieve the power level needed for the\napplication.\nADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION No 24\nSuitable gas warning equipment\n(Article 15.15(9) of Annex II)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nSections 24.02(2) and 24.06(5) (in each case transitional provision to Section\n15.01(2)(e)) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) systems for household purposes on\nboard existing passenger vessels may only be operated until the first renewal\nof the Union inland navigation certificate after 1 January 2045, on condition\nthat a gas warning equipment in accordance with Section 15.15(9) is available.\nIn accordance with Section 15.15(9), LPG systems for household purposes may in\nthe future also be installed on passenger vessels put into operation for the\nfirst time and of which the length does not exceed 45 m, if such warning\nequipment is installed at the same time.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nSections 24.02(2) and 24.06(5) (in each case transitional provision to Section\n15.15(9)) this gas warning equipment shall be installed on the first renewal of\nthe certificate in accordance with Section 14.15.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gas warning equipment\nconsists of sensors, equipment and pipes and shall be considered suitable if it\nat least meets the following prescribed requirements:\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements to be met by\nthe system (sensors, equipment, pipes):\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gas warning shall be given\nat the latest when reaching or exceeding one of the following values:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) 10 % lower explosion limit\n(LEL) of a propane-air mixture; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) 30 ppm CO (carbon monoxide).\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The time until activation of\nthe alarm for the whole system must not exceed 20 s.\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The limit values mentioned\nin numbers 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 must not be adjustable.\n3.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The test gas production\nshall be so designed that any interruption or obstruction is detected.

When applying Article 9.15, Section 5,\nreduced ventilation of shielded cables or cables in totally enclosed trunks has\nto be taken into account.\n2. In Article 9.15, Section 9 the number of\ncable joints should be kept to a minimum. They may be used for repair or\nreplacement purposes as well as, exceptionally, for the simplification of\ninstallation. Cable joints made in accordance with 3.28 and Annex D to IEC\n60092-352:2005, or equivalent regulations recognised by one of the Member\nStates, will be considered acceptable.\nPassenger vessels \u2014 Article 15.10(6)\n1. On passenger vessels, cables and cable\nrouting are considered to be satisfactory if they meet the conditions in 2 and\n3.\n2. For cables providing power in an\nemergency to equipment listed in Article 15.10, Section 4, compliance with\nArticle 15.10, Section 6 second paragraph will require that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) the cables are run in such a\nmanner as to avoid being rendered unserviceable by heating of the bulkheads and\ndecks that may be caused by a fire in an adjacent space;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) where the cables supply\nequipment located within high fire risk areas, the cable runs within such areas\nmust avoid routes which pass over or near the top of diesel engines and\noil-fired equipment, or near to hot surfaces e.g. diesel engine exhaust\nsystems. Where there is no alternative route, cables must be protected from\nheat and fire damage. Such fire protection could be in the form of a steel\nplate or trunk;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) the cables and associated\nequipment supplied from the emergency source of power should, as far as\npracticable, be kept within the safe area;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) cable systems are arranged\nso that fire in any area bounded by Type A partitions as shown in Article\n15.11, Section 2 will not interfere with services essential for safety in any\nother such area. This requirement will be met if main and emergency cables do\nnot pass through the same area. If they pass through the same area, the requirement\nwill be met if:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (aa) they are separated as wide as is\npracticable; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (bb) the emergency cable is of the\nfire resistant type.\n3. Consideration should be given to the\narrangements of bunched cable runs to ensure that the flame-retardant\ncharacteristics of the cables are not impaired. This requirement is met if the\ncables are in accordance with IEC 60332-3:2000. If compliance with IEC\n60332-3:2000, or equivalent regulations recognised by one of the Member States,\nis not met, fire stops in long runs of bunched cables (over 6 m vertical and 14\nm horizontal) should be considered, unless the cables are totally enclosed in\ncable trunks. The use of unsuitable paints, trunking and casings may\nsignificantly affect the fire propagation characteristics of cables and shall\nbe avoided. The use of special types of cables such as radio frequency cables\nmay be permitted without complying with the foregoing. \nADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION No. 26 \nExperts\nand Competent Persons\n(Article 1.01 paragraphs 106 and 107 of Annex II)\nExperts\nExperts are required to carry out\nacceptance tests which call for specialist knowledge either on account of the\ncomplexity of the systems or on account of the safety level required.
