Fishing opportunities contained in those Regulations are\r\nusually amended several times during the period in which they are in effect. \nRegulation (EU) No 1262/2012 fixes, for\r\n2013 and 2014, the fishing opportunities for EU vessels for certain deep-sea\r\nfish stocks.\nAs for Regulation (EC) No 754/2009, it\r\nexcludes certain groups of vessels from the fishing effort regime for cod laid\r\ndown in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008. When an excluded group of\r\nvessels needs to be re-included in Regulation (EC) No 754/2009, the relevant provision\r\nthereof needs to be amended, as well as the effort limits shown in Annex IIA of\r\nthe two fishing opportunities regulations mentioned above.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe proposed amendments seek to modify the four\r\nRegulations mentioned above as follows:\n\u2013                        \r\nRe-inclusions of groups of vessels in the effort\r\nmanagement regime for cod. The cod management plan (Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n1342/2008) establishes an effort regime for this stock which is based on\r\nregular data to be provided by Member States to the Commission and the\r\nScientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). On the\r\nbasis of the STECF advice regarding Member States data, the Commission may then\r\npropose to exclude certain groups of vessels from the fishing effort regime\r\nestablished in the cod plan. The essential condition for such exclusion is that\r\nthe vessels concerned should catch no more than 1.5% of cod. Member States must\r\nreport annually on the excluded vessels in order for the Commission to\r\nascertain (based on STECF advice) that the 1.5% cod catches limit is\r\nmaintained. Otherwise, the cod plan foresees that the Council shall re-include\r\nthe vessels concerned in the effort regime. In this respect, and by following\r\nthe procedures established in the cod plan and its implementing rules, the\r\nproposed amendments provide for the re-inclusion of one group of French vessels\r\nand one group of Spanish vessels heretofore excluded from the cod plan effort\r\nregime through amending Regulations (EC) No 754/2009, (EU) No 39/2013 and\r\n40/2013.\n\u2013                        \r\nTwo errors are corrected in this proposal. The\r\nfirst one concerns the TAC entry for Tusk in Norwegian waters of IV in\r\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013, which should have been amended earlier in 2013, in\r\naccordance with the results of the consultations held between the EU and Norway. The second one refers to the Norwegian share of its blue whiting quota that can be\r\nfished in EU waters. A calculation mistake must be corrected in the figure\r\nintroduced as part of the first amendment to the 2013 fishing opportunities set\r\nout in Regulation (EU) No 40/2013.\n\u2013                        \r\nIn 2010, the Western and Central Fisheries Commission\r\n(WCPFC) banned the targeted fisheries of south Pacific albacore in the WCPFC\r\nConvention Area south of 20\u00baS. Although no EU vessels have targeted this stock neither\r\nprior to nor since 2010, it is appropriate to complete the regulatory framework\r\napplicable to EU vessels registered at the WCPFC set out in Regulation (EU) No\r\n40/2013.\n\u2013                        \r\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2013, the Indian Ocean\r\nTuna Commission (IOTC) adopted a Resolution aiming at the protection of oceanic\r\nwhitetip sharks and applicable to fishing vessels on\r\nthe IOTC Record of Authorised Vessels, or authorised to fish for tuna or\r\ntuna-like species managed by the IOTC on the high seas\r\nfisheries. The measure also provides for a more lenient regime as regards\r\nfishing opportunities for artisanal fisheries, i.e. vessels engaged in fishing\r\nactivities solely in their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). This IOTC measure\r\nmust be added to the existing measures regarding thresher sharks of the all the\r\nspecies of the family Alopiidae set out in\r\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013. In\r\naddition to this, an error must be corrected in point 2 of Annex VI for EU\r\nvessels authorised to fish for swordfish and albacore in the\r\nIOTC Convention Area.\n\u2013                        \r\nThe Commission requested the International\r\nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to advise whether it is appropriate\r\nto revise the list of deep-sea sharks laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n1262/2012 fixing for 2013 and 2014 the fishing opportunities for EU vessels for\r\ncertain deep-sea fish stocks. In July 2013 ICES advised that there is\r\nsufficient scientific information to exclude blackmouth catshark (Galeus\r\nmelastomus) from that list and include all species belonging to the genus Centrophorus\r\nspp. \n2013/0337 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL REGULATION\namending Regulations (EC) No 754/2009,\r\n(EU) No 1262/2012, (EU) No 39/2013 and (EU) No 40/2013 as regards certain\r\nfishing opportunities \nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n2371/2002[1]\r\nrequires that Union measures governing access to waters and resources and the\r\nsustainable pursuit of fishing activities be established taking into account\r\navailable scientific, technical and economic advice and in particular reports\r\ndrawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries\r\n(STECF), as well as advice received from Regional Advisory Councils. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Council Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 754/2009[2],\r\nthe Council excluded certain groups of vessels from the fishing effort regime\r\nlaid down in Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008[3]. The allowable fishing effort\r\nfor vessels subject to that regime is currently fixed by Annex IIA to Council Regulation\r\n(EU) No 39/2013[4]\r\nand Annex IIA to Council Regulation (EU) No 40/2013[5]\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A group of vessels flying\r\nthe flag of Spain and fishing in the West of Scotland is currently excluded\r\nfrom the application of the fishing effort regime laid down in Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 1342/2008. On the basis of information provided by Spain in 2013, the STECF was not in a position to assess whether the conditions set out in\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1342/2008 remained fulfilled in the 2012 management period.\r\nIt is therefore appropriate to re-include this group of Spanish vessels in that\r\nfishing effort regime. Regulations (EC) No 754/2009 and Annex IIA to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 39/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A group of vessels flying\r\nthe flag of France and fishing in the North Sea is currently excluded from the\r\napplication of the fishing effort regime laid down in Regulation (EC) No\r\n1342/2008. On the basis of information provided by France in 2013, the STECF assessed\r\nthat catches for those vessels exceeded the established threshold. It is\r\ntherefore appropriate to re-include that group of French vessels in that\r\nfishing effort regime. Regulation (EC) No 754/2009 and Annex IIA to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 40/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n1262/2012[6]\r\nfixes catch limits for 2013 and 2014 as regards a list of deep-sea sharks. The\r\nCommission requested the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\r\n(ICES) to advise whether it is appropriate to revise that list. ICES concluded\r\nthat there is sufficient scientific information supporting the exclusion of\r\nblackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and the inclusion of all species\r\nof the genus Centrophorus (Centrophorus spp.) on the list\r\nof deep-sea sharks. Regulation (EU) No 1262/2012 should be amended accordingly.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\r\nits Annual Meeting in 2013, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted a\r\nResolution aiming at the protection of oceanic whitetip sharks and applicable\r\nto fishing vessels on the IOTC Record of Authorised\r\nVessels by prohibiting, as an interim pilot measure, to retain on board, tranship, land or store any part or whole carcass\r\nof oceanic whitetip shark. The resolution provides for an\r\nexception for artisanal fisheries, namely fishing vessels engaged in fishing\r\noperations within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Member State whose flag they fly. Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No\r\n40/2013 should be amended accordingly. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\r\nits Annual Meeting in 2010, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries\r\nCommission (WCPFC) adopted a recommendation limiting the number of vessels\r\nactively fishing for south Pacific albacore in the Convention Area south of\r\n20\u00baS. Consequently, it should be ensured that EU vessels continue to operate\r\nwithout targeting that species in the WCPFC Convention\r\nArea south of 20\u00b0S. A new\r\nparagraph should be added to Article 29 of Regulation (EU) accordingly. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fishing opportunities for\r\nEU vessels in Norwegian waters and for Norwegian vessels in EU waters are\r\nestablished each year in the light of consultations on fishing rights held in\r\naccordance with the bilateral agreement on fisheries with Norway[7]. Pending the conclusion of\r\nthose consultations on the arrangements for 2013, Regulation (EU) No 40/2013\r\nfixed provisional fishing opportunities for the stocks concerned. On 18 January\r\n2013, the consultations with Norway were concluded, and Council Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 297/2013[8]\r\namended the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 40/2013. However, the\r\nstock of tusk in Norwegian waters of IV was erroneously excluded from Regulation\r\n(EU) No 297/2013. Furthermore, the amount of blue whiting that Norway can fish in EU waters of II, IVa, V, VI north of 56\u00b0 30' N and VII west of 12\u00b0 W did\r\nnot reflect the agreed record after consultations with that country. Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 40/2013 should be\r\namended accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\nerror was identified in the number of vessels and the capacity allocated to the\r\nEU and authorised to fish for swordfish and albacore in the IOTC Convention\r\nArea. Annex VI of Regulation (EU) No 40/2013 should be amended accordingly.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this\r\nRegulation concerning fishing effort limits should apply from 1 February 2013. The\r\nprovisions concerning catch limits and allocations should apply from 1 January\r\n2013, except for the new provisions regarding WCPFC and IOTC, which should\r\napply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. Such retroactive\r\napplication will be without prejudice to the principle of legal certainty as\r\nthe fishing opportunities concerned have not yet been exhausted. Since\r\nmodifications of effort regimes have a direct influence on the economic\r\nactivities of the fleets concerned, this Regulation should enter into force\r\nimmediately upon its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 754/2009\nIn Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No\r\n754/2009, points (b) and (j) are deleted.\nArticle 2\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 1262/2012\nThe Annex to Council Regulation (EU) No\r\n1262/2012 is amended in accordance with the text set out in Annex I to this\r\nRegulation.\nArticle 3\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 39/2013\nAnnex IIA to Regulation (EU) No 39/2013 is\r\namended in accordance with the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation. \nArticle 4\r\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 40/2013\nRegulation (EU) No 40/2013 is amended as\r\nfollows:\n(1)                   \r\nArticle 23 is replaced by the following:\n\u201cArticle 23\r\nSharks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retaining on board, transshipping or\r\nlanding any part or whole carcass of thresher sharks of all the species of the\r\nfamily Alopiidae in any fishery shall be prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retaining on board, transshipping or\r\nlanding any part or whole carcass of oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) in any fishery\r\nshall be prohibited, except for vessels under 24 metres overall length engaged\r\nsolely in fishing operations within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Member\r\nState whose flag they fly, and provided that their catch is destined solely for\r\nlocal consumption.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When accidentally caught, species\r\nreferred to in paragraph 1 and 2 shall not be harmed.
