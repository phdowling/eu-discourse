That resolution established procedures\nfor the identification of countries whose vessels had fished for tuna and\ntuna-like species in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT\nconservation and management measures. It also specified measures to be taken,\nincluding if necessary non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures, in order\nto prevent those countries\u2019 vessels from continuing such fishing practices.\nFollowing the adoption of resolution 98-18,\nICCAT has identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra\nLeone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)\nin a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and\nmanagement measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches,\ntrade and the activities of vessels. As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that Contracting\nParties take appropriate measures, consistent with provisions of the 1998\nResolution, to the effect that the import of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its\nproducts in any form from the above mentioned countries be prohibited.\nAs a consequence, imports of Atlantic\nbigeye tuna originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone into the European Union have been prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004[2]\nAt its 14th Special Meeting in 2004, ICCAT\nacknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of\ntrade-restrictive measures against those three countries.\nAs a consequence, Regulation\n(EC) No 827/2004 has been amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005[3], so that it continues\nprohibiting such imports only from Bolivia and Georgia, whereas imports from Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone are authorized again.\nFurthermore, at its 22nd regular\nannual meeting, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made and actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye\ntuna and its products which had been imposed imposed on those two countries.\nRegulation (EC) No 827/2004 as amended by\nRegulation (EC) No 919/2005 should therefore be repealed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nN/A\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nThe lifting of the import prohibitions on\nAtlantic bigeye tuna and its products that were imposed on Bolivia and Georgia has been adopted by ICCAT, international body to which the European Union is a\nContracting Party. In order to uphold its international commitments, the\nEuropean Union should enact such decision into Union law and therefore repeal Regulation\n(EC) No 827/2004. As this proposal deals with common commercial policy, its\nlegal basis should be Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\nEuropean Union.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nN/A\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS \nN/A\n2013/0097 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nrepealing Council Regulation (EC) No\n827/2004 prohibiting imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) originating\nin Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone and repealing\nRegulation (EC) No 1036/2001\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has been a\nContracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of\nAtlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the\nadoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC[4].\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ICCAT Convention\nprovides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and\nmanagement of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent\nseas through the establishment of an International Commission for the Conservation\nof Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the adoption by the latter of conservation and\nmanagement measures which become binding on the contracting parties.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1998, ICCAT adopted\nresolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by\nlarge-scale long line vessels in the Convention area.
