It lays down global\nminimum labour protection for domestic workers.\nAs of December 2012, the Domestic Workers\nConvention No 189 has been ratified by three State parties to the ILO. It\nis among the ILO Conventions that have been classified by the ILO as up to date\nand are therefore actively promoted.\nThe European Union (EU) is committed to\npromoting the decent work agenda, both internally and in its external\nrelations. Labour standards are a core element of the concept of decent work.\nThe ratification of ILO Conventions by Member States thus sends an important\nsignal as to the coherence of the Union\u2019s policy in improving labour standards\nworldwide.\nIn addition, as part of the EU\u2019s Strategy towards\nthe eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings[1],\nthe Commission urged Member States to ratify all international instruments,\nagreements and legal obligations which will contribute to addressing\ntrafficking in human beings in a more effective, coordinated and coherent\nmanner. These include the Domestic Workers Convention No 189.\nIt is therefore necessary that any legal\nimpediments to ratification by Member States be removed at the level of the EU\nfor the Domestic Workers Convention No 189, the substance of which does\nnot cause concern in the light of the existing Union acquis.\nThe provisions of the Domestic Workers\nConvention No 189 are intended to help curb the abuse and exploitation of\ndomestic workers. Article 1 of the Convention defines a domestic worker as any\nperson engaged in domestic work (work\nperformed in or for a household or households) within an employment\nrelationship. The Convention requires ILO Member States\nto take measures to prevent violence and child labour in the domestic\nemployment setting. Article 3 protects the fundamental labour-related rights of\ndomestic workers by requiring each State party to take the measures set out in\nthe Convention to respect, promote and realise the fundamental principles and\nrights at work. Subsequent provisions notably require ILO Member States to:\n\u00b7                        \nestablish a minimum age for domestic work and safeguards for\nworkers under age 18;\n\u00b7                        \nprevent abuse and violence;\n\u00b7                        \nensure fair terms and decent conditions of employment;\n\u00b7                        \nmake certain that workers are informed of the\nterms and details of their employment;\n\u00b7                        \nregulate foreign recruitment and ensure freedom of movement;\n\u00b7                        \nmandate equal\ntreatment between domestic workers and other workers with\nregard to compensation and benefits;\n\u00b7                        \nregulate and monitor private employment agencies; and\n\u00b7                        \ndevelop a specific complaints mechanism.\nThe Domestic Workers Convention No 189\naddresses areas of Union law where the degree of regulation has already reached\nan advanced stage.\nThe Convention mainly deals with aspects\nrelating to the social policy area, where Union law sets minimum requirements\non health and safety at work, protecting young people at work, maternity\nprotection, the written statement, working time, immigration and temporary\nagency work[2].\nThe Convention deals with aspects relating\nto the anti-discrimination area where Union law sets minimum requirements on\nemployment equality, gender equality and maternity protection[3].\nThe Convention also deals with aspects\nrelating to judicial cooperation in the criminal matters area and in the asylum\nand immigration area, where Union law sets minimum requirements on\nanti-trafficking and employers\u2019 sanctions[4].\nIn addition, Article 8 of the Domestic\nWorkers Convention deals with the protection of migrant domestic workers, which\nincludes aspects relating to the freedom of movement for workers under Union\nlaw[5].\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED\nPARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nNot applicable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nIn accordance with the rules on external\ncompetences that have been drawn up by the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion[6],\nand more specifically as regards the conclusion and ratification of a\nConvention of the International Labour Organisation[7], Member States are not in a\nposition to autonomously decide on the ratification of a Convention without the\nCouncil\u2019s prior authorisation, where parts of the Convention fall under Union\ncompetence.\nAt the same time, the European Union as\nsuch cannot ratify any ILO Convention, because only States can be parties to\nsuch conventions.\nConsequently, if the subject-matter of an\nagreement or contract falls partly within the competence of the Union and partly within that of the Member States, the Union institutions and the Member\nStates must take all the necessary measures to best ensure cooperation in ratifying\nthe Convention and in implementing commitments resulting from that Convention[8].\nAs regards three ILO Conventions adopted\nover the last decade, parts of which fell under the competence of the Union,\nthe Council has therefore authorised Member States to ratify, in the interests\nof the Union, those parts falling under Union competence[9]. The Commission has also\nadopted a proposal for such a Council decision as regards the Chemicals\nConvention No 170[10].\nSpecifically with reference to the Domestic\nWorkers Convention No 189, the degree of regulation in the various aspects of\nsocial policy and in the areas of antidiscrimination, judicial cooperation in\ncriminal matters and asylum and immigration covered by the Convention, has\nreached an advanced stage, to the point where Member States are no longer able\nto act sovereign in the external sphere in this regard[11]. Article 153 TFEU constitutes\nthe main legal basis for the related Union law, which is in most cases more\ndetailed than the general principles established in the Domestic Workers\nConvention No 189. There is no contradiction between the general principles\nestablished in the Convention and Union law, and there is no incompatibility between the provisions of\nthe Convention and the minimum requirements in these areas laid down in the Union\nacquis.\nIt follows from Article 19(8) of the ILO\nConstitution that the Convention contains minimum standards, which means that\nnational implementation can provide for higher standards than those under the\nConvention.\nThere is no inconsistency of approach between\nthe rules on the protection and equal treatment of workers under the Convention\nand the minimum requirements under the Union acquis in this area. This\nmeans that Union measures can be more stringent than the ILO standards and vice\nversa[12].\nThe Domestic Workers Convention No 189\ncontains one article to protect migrant domestic workers (Article 8) that could\npotentially interfere with the freedom of movement for workers \u2014 an area which\nfalls under the Union\u2019s exclusive competence[13].\nHowever, the main aim of the Convention is not to regulate an issue falling\nunder the Union\u2019s exclusive competence. In addition, Article 8(2) of the\nConvention states that the requirement to receive a written offer prior to\ncrossing national borders does not apply to regional economic integration\nareas. This safeguard clause prevents any potential incompatibility between the Convention and the Union acquis\non the freedom of movement for workers under Article 45 TFEU and\nRegulation No 492/2011. Consequently, the provisions of the Convention in this area\nare not incompatible with the Union acquis.\nThe aim of this proposal is therefore to\nauthorise Member States to ratify, in the interests of the Union, those parts\nthe Domestic Workers Convention No 189 that fall under Union competence.\nThe proposal is based on Article 218(6) of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), applicable by\nanalogy, in conjunction with Article 153 TFEU, which provides the main legal\nbasis for Union legislation on the protection and improvement of workers\u2019\nworking conditions.\n2013/0085 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nauthorising Member States to ratify, in\nthe interests of the European Union, the Convention concerning decent work for\ndomestic workers, 2011, of the International Labour Organisation (Convention No\n189)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153 in conjunction\nwith Article 218(6) (a) (v) and Article 218(8), first subparagraph thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the\nEuropean Parliament[14],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Parliament,\nthe Council and the Commission are promoting the ratification of international\nlabour conventions that have been classified by the International Labour\nOrganisation as up-to-date, as a contribution to the European Union\u2019s effort to\npromote decent work for all both inside and outside the Union, of which the\nprotection and improvement of workers\u2019 working conditions is an important\naspect.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the rules under\nConvention No 189 concerning decent work for domestic workers, 2011, of the\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO), hereinafter \u2018the Convention\u2019, are\ncovered to a large extent by Union acquis in the areas of social policy[15], anti-discrimination[16], judicial cooperation in\ncriminal matters[17]\nand asylum and immigration[18].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Convention\u2019s\nprovisions on protecting migrant domestic workers potentially affect the\nfreedom of movement for workers \u2014 an area which falls under the Union\u2019s exclusive competence[19].\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, parts of\nthe Convention fall within the competence of the Union, and Member States may not enter into commitments in relation to these parts outside the framework\nof the Union\u2019s institutions[20].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union cannot\nratify the Convention, as only States can be parties thereto.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this situation, Member States and the Union\u2019s institutions must cooperate in regard to the ratification of the\nConvention.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Council shall\ntherefore authorise the Member States that are bound by Union law on minimum\nrequirements in the area of working conditions to ratify the Convention in the\ninterests of the European Union.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nMember States are hereby authorised to\nratify, for the parts falling under the competence conferred upon the Union by the Treaties, the Convention concerning decent work for domestic workers, 2011, of\nthe International Labour Organisation (Convention No 189).\nArticle 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member\nStates.\nDone at Brussels,
