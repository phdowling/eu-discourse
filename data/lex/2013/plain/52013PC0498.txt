The first EDCTP\nprogramme (EDCTP1, 2003-2012) is now beyond its active funding period.\nDespite the results and impact of EDCTP so\nfar, the health and socio-economic burden of poverty-related diseases persists\nand hinders the sustainable development of developing countries, in particular\nin sub-Saharan Africa. More than one billion people, including 400 million\nchildren, are suffering from one or more poverty-related diseases, including\nneglected infectious diseases such as sleeping sickness and worm infections.\nHIV/AIDS alone kills an estimated 2 million people, while malaria and\ntuberculosis together kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually. In\naddition to creating unnecessary suffering and premature deaths these diseases\nundermine productivity and increase insecurity and infirmity, thus perpetuating\nthe cycle of poverty. Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately affected by such\ndiseases, with approximately 90 % of all malaria-related deaths occurring\nin Africa. This region also accounts for over two thirds of all people living\nwith HIV and for nearly three quarters of AIDS-related deaths.\nWhile general improvements in nutrition,\nsanitation and health infrastructure are important, the effective long-term\ncontrol of poverty-related diseases also requires the development of new or\nimproved medical interventions (products, treatments and vaccines). While there\nis a general lack of such medical products, many of the existing drugs and\nvaccines currently used date back to the early 20th century and, moreover, are\nno longer effective due to the emergence of drug resistance in these diseases.\nMost of the new drugs and vaccines under development, however, are stuck at the\nstage of early clinical development. This is mainly due to the significant\ncosts involved in the clinical development and testing needed in humans to\nprove the effectiveness and safety of new or improved medical interventions. These\ncosts are linked to three key problem drivers: (i) insufficient investment by\nthe private sector due to a lack of return on investment (market failures),\n(ii) weak clinical research capacity in sub-Saharan African countries, and\n(iii) fragmented public support.\nFollowing the recommendations from the\nindependent interim evaluation of EDCTP1 and the conclusions from the Member\nStates\u2019 meeting in September 2010, the Belgian EU Council Presidency proposed\nto the Competitiveness Council on 26 November 2010 the launch of a second EDCTP\njoint programme (EDCTP2) with at least ten years duration. To that end, the\nEDCTP1 participating states published a Strategic Business Plan 2014-2024 for\nEDCTP2.\nOn these grounds, the Commission puts\nforward a proposal for a Decision on the participation of the EU in a second\nEuropean and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme\n(EDCTP2) based on Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which\nmakes provision for the EU to participate in research and development\nprogrammes undertaken by several Member States.\nAim of EDCTP2\nThe general objective of EDCTP2 is to\nimprove the EU'\u2019s capacity to invest more efficiently in the research and\ndevelopment of new or improved medical interventions against poverty-related\ndiseases for the benefit of and in partnership with developing countries, in\nparticular sub-Saharan African countries.\nMore specifically, EDCTP2 aims to achieve\nthe following specific objectives:\n\u00b7                        \nAn increased number of new or improved medical interventions\nfor HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other poverty-related diseases, and by\nthe end of the programme to have delivered at least one new medical\nintervention, such as a new drug or a new vaccine against TB or any other\npoverty-related disease; to have issued at least 30 guidelines for improved or\nextended use of existing medical interventions; and to have progressed the\nclinical development of at least 20 candidate medical interventions.\n\u00b7                        \nStrengthened cooperation with sub-Saharan\nAfrican countries, in particular on building their capacity for conducting\nclinical trials in full compliance with fundamental ethical principles and\nrelevant national, Union and international legislation, including the EU\u2019s\nCharter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and its\nSupplementary Protocols, the 2008 version of the World Medical Association\u2019s\nDeclaration of Helsinki and the standards on good clinical practice of the\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation.\n\u00b7                        \nBetter coordination, alignment and integration\nof relevant national programmes to increase the cost-effectiveness of European\npublic investments.\n\u00b7                        \nExtended international cooperation with\nother public and private funders.\n\u00b7                        \nAn increased impact due to effective cooperation\nwith relevant EU initiatives, including EU development assistance.\nEDCTP2 has been conceived to complement the\nactions implemented under the European Development Funds and the Development\nCooperation Instruments, and to respond to the Union\u2019s commitment to the 2012 Rio+20 conference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally agreed\nSustainable Development Goals, following and including the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe preparation of the proposal has taken\nfull account of the responses received to an extensive stakeholder\nconsultation, including a public consultation. Views were expressed by European\nand African policy makers as well as stakeholders from industry, academia and\ncivil society. The proposal also relies on the external interim evaluations of\nthe EDCTP1 programme and the in-depth impact assessment of the prospective\nEDCTP2 programme. These consultations, evaluations and assessments of the EDCTP\nconsistently call for it to be continued but with the next programme lasting 10\nyears and covering a scope that extends to other poverty-related diseases\n(beyond HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) and to all phases of clinical\ndevelopment. The geographical focus should continue to be on sub-Saharan\nAfrica, which is disproportionally affected by poverty-related diseases and\nwith which the Union has established a strategic partnership.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1 Legal basis\nThe proposal for the EDCTP2 Programme is\nbased on Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which allows\nthe Union, in implementing the multiannual framework\nprogramme, to make provision, for participation in research and development\nprogrammes undertaken by several Member States, in agreement with the Member\nStates concerned, including participation in the structures created for the\nexecution of those programmes.\n3.2 Subsidiarity principle\nThe fundamental basis of the EDCTP\ninitiative is the joint programme being based on and composed of national\nprogrammes and activities of the participating Member States and Associated\nCountries, with the support and participation of the Union.\nIt improves cost-effectiveness of Europe\u2019s\ninvestment in clinical research programmes by providing a common platform that\ncan better exploit research results for the development of new or improved\nmedical interventions against HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other\npoverty-related diseases for the benefit of the developing countries, in\nparticular in sub-Saharan Africa. The expected impact at the European level\nwill be greater than the sum of the impacts of national programmes and\nactivities. It will allow the required critical mass to be achieved, both in\nhuman and financial terms, by bringing together available complementary\nexpertise and resources to accelerate the development of new or improved\nmedical interventions that are urgently needed to reduce the devastating impact\nof poverty-related diseases in developing countries. Furthermore, at the global\nlevel it contributes to a unified voice to represent European research efforts\nin the fight against these diseases in developing countries. Finally, it\npromotes a long-term structuring effect on European and developing countries\u2019\nresearch policies and systems alike, and helps to integrate the EU\u2019s research\nand development policies and systems in a coherent context.\nThe Commission\u2019s proposal for Horizon 2020\nmakes provision for the Union\u2019s continued participation in a second EDCTP\nprogramme under Article 185 of the Treaty, which is the appropriate instrument\nfor the Union to support the EDCTP since it allows for both the coordination of\nnational research programmes and the participation of the Union in the joint\nprogramme.\n3.3 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal\ndoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. Union\nparticipation in the EDCTP2 Programme will take place within the limits of the\ncompetence provided by the Treaty and will only facilitate and support,\nincluding financially, the fulfilment of the EDCTP2 objectives by the\nparticipating states. They will have to collaborate and work towards reaching better coordination, alignment and integration of relevant national\nprogrammes or activities and ultimately developing more and better\nmedical interventions against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, as well as other\npoverty related diseases.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe Legislative Financial Statement\npresented with this decision sets out the indicative budgetary implications.\nThe Union contribution shall be up to EUR 683 million[1] including EFTA contribution.\nThe envelope is in current prices. The Union contribution shall be made from\nthe \u2018Health, demographic change and wellbeing\u2019 challenge, DG Research &\nInnovation envelope, as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 \u2013 The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum amount of Union\ncontribution for administrative costs is up to EUR 41 million.\nDuring the course of the action, the Union\nmay consider matching additional commitments from Participating Member States or countries associated to Horizon 2020 Framework\nProgramme. \n2013/0243 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non the participation of the Union in a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme\njointly undertaken by several Member States\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 185 and the\nsecond paragraph of Article 188 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\nEconomic and Social Committee[2],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)                   \nIn its Communication Europe 2020 A Strategy for\nsmart, sustainable and inclusive growth[3],\nthe Commission underscores the need to develop favourable conditions for\ninvestment in knowledge and innovation so as to achieve smart, sustainable and\ninclusive growth in the Union. The European Parliament and Council have\nendorsed this strategy.\n(2)                   \nHorizon 2020 \u2014 The Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020) established by Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013[4] (hereinafter \u201cHorizon 2020\nFramework Programme\u201d) aims at achieving a greater impact on research and\ninnovation by contributing to the strengthening of public-public partnerships,\nincluding through Union participation in programmes undertaken by several\nMember States in accordance with Article 185 of the Treaty.\n(3)                   \nBy Decision No 1209/2003/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on Community participation in a\nresearch and development programme aimed at developing new clinical\ninterventions to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through a long-term\npartnership between Europe and developing countries, undertaken by several Member\nStates[5],\nthe Community decided to make a financial contribution to the European and\nDeveloping Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (hereinafter ''EDCTP1'')\nmatching that of the participating states but not exceeding EUR 200 million,\nfor the duration of the Sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for\nresearch, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing\nto the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002 to 2006)\nestablished by Decision No 1513/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 27 June 2002[6].\nEDCTP1 was also supported under the Seventh Framework Programme of the European\nCommunity for research, technological development and demonstration activities\n(2007 \u2013 2013) established by Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006[7].\n(4)                   \nIn 2009, independent\nexperts adopted the report of the interim evaluation of EDCTP1[8]. The opinion of the expert\npanel was that EDCTP1 provided a unique platform for a genuine dialogue with\nAfrican scientists and it has started to bridge the gap between North and South\nin building research capacities and in providing learning and working\nopportunities for young African researchers. Following this report, there are\nfundamental issues to be taken into consideration for a second European and\nDeveloping Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (hereinafter\n''EDCTP2 Programme''): the current scope of EDCTP1 needs to be changed and\nextended; the integration of European national programmes should be further\nimproved; collaboration with other major public and private funders, including\nthe pharmaceutical industry, needs to be strengthened and extended; synergies\nwith European external policy actions should be developed, in particular with Union\ndevelopment assistance; co-funding rules should be clarified and simplified;\nmonitoring tools need to be strengthened. \n(5)                   \nAccording to Council Decision \u2026 /2013/EU of \u2026\n2013 establishing the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020 - The\nFramework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)[9] further support may be provided\nto the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(6)                   \nEDCTP1 had major achievements and has so far\ndeveloped eight improved medical treatments, in particular for new-borns,\nchildren or pregnant/lactating women suffering from HIV/AIDS or malaria. It has\nresulted in the launch of the first four African Regional Networks of\nExcellence promoting South-South cooperation on clinical research and more than\n400 African researchers have been trained. It has also contributed to establishing\nthe Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry and the African Vaccine Regulators\nForum.\n(7)                   \nDespite the considerable results and\nachievements of EDCTP1, poverty-related diseases still represent a major obstacle\nto the sustainable development of developing countries due to their social and\neconomic burden, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Effective, safe and\naffordable medical treatments still do not exist for most poverty-related\ndiseases and investment in clinical research remains inadequate as conducting\nclinical trials is costly and the return on investment is limited due to market\nfailure. Moreover, European research activities and programmes are still often\nfragmented and thus either subcritical in scale or overlapping, whereas\nresearch capacity and investment in developing countries are inadequate.\n(8)                   \nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution on\n15 June 2010 on progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals\n(hereinafter ''MDG'') ahead of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010 in\nwhich it \u2018asks the Commission, the Member States and developing countries to\naddress MDG 5 (on improving maternal health), MDG 4 (on child mortality) and\nMDG 6 (on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in a coherent and holistic way\u2019.\n(9)                   \nThe Union is committed to the 2012 Rio+20\nconference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally agreed\nSustainable Development Goals (hereinafter \u2018\u2018SDG\u2019), following and including the\nMDG.\n(10)               \nIn 2000 the Union launched a high-level policy\ndialogue with Africa leading to the establishment of an Africa-EU Strategic\nPartnership, following which a Joint Africa-EU Strategy was adopted in 2007 and\na high-level policy dialogue on Science, Technology and Innovation was established\nin 2011.\n(11)               \nThe Commission presented a communication on 31\nMarch 2010 on the Union\u2019s role in global health[10] which calls for a more\ncoordinated approach among Member States and across relevant policies to\nidentify and jointly address shared global priorities for health research.\n(12)               \nThe Commission presented a communication on 21\nSeptember 2011 on partnering in research and innovation[11] which puts partnerships across\ninstitutional, national and continental borders at the centre of the Union\u2019s research policy.\n(13)               \nIn line with the objectives of Horizon 2020\nFramework Programme, any Member State and any country associated to the Horizon\n2020 Framework Programme should be entitled to participate in the EDCTP2\nProgramme. \n(14)               \nThe participating states intend to contribute to\nthe implementation of EDCTP2 Programme during the period covered by the EDCTP2\nProgramme (2014 \u2013 2024).\n(15)               \nA ceiling should be established for the Union's participation in EDCTP2 for the duration of Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Within\nthat ceiling, the Union contribution should be equal to the initial contributions\ncommitted by the participating states in order to achieve a high leverage\neffect and ensure a stronger integration of participating states' programmes. That\nceiling should also provide for matching the contributions from any other Member State or country associated to Horizon 2020 Framework Programme joining the EDCTP2\nProgramme during the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. \n(16)               \nThe Union\u2019s financial contribution should be\nsubject to formal commitments from the participating states to contribute to\nimplement the EDCTP2 Programme and their fulfilment. \n(17)               \nThe joint implementation of the EDCTP2 Programme\nrequires an implementation structure. The participating states have agreed on the\nimplementation structure for EDCTP2 and set up the EDCTP2-Implementation\nStructure (hereinafter \u2018\u2018EDCTP2-IS\u2019\u2019). The EDCTP2-IS should be the recipient of\nthe Union\u2019s financial contribution and should ensure efficient implementation\nof the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(18)               \nThe Union\u2019s financial contribution should be\nmanaged in compliance with the principle of sound financial management and in\naccordance with the relevant rules on indirect management set out in Regulation\n(EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council of 25\nOctober 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the\nUnion[12]\nand Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the\nrules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012[13].\n(19)               \nIn order to protect the Union\u2019s financial\ninterests, the Commission should have the right to reduce, suspend or terminate\nthe Union\u2019s financial contribution if the EDCTP2 Programme is implemented\ninadequately, partially or late, or if the participating states do not\ncontribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of the EDCTP2\nProgramme. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to\nbe concluded between the Union and the EDCTP2-IS.\n(20)               \nIn order to efficiently implement the EDCTP2\nProgramme, financial support should be provided by the EDCTP2-IS mainly in the\nform of grants to participants in actions selected at the level of the\nEDCTP2-IS. The selection of these actions should be made following open and\ncompetitive calls for proposals under the responsibility of the EDCTP2-IS.\n(21)               \nParticipation in indirect actions under the\nEDCTP2 Programme is subject to Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of \u2026 2013 laying down the rules for the\nparticipation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for\nResearch and Innovation (2014-2020)[14].\nHowever, due to specific operating needs of the EDCTP2 Programme it is\nnecessary to provide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with\nArticle 1(3) of that Regulation. \n(22)               \nDerogations from Articles 8(1)(b), 9(1)(c) and\n11 of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2013 are necessary in order to require participation\nand allow funding of African entities, and allow cooperation through joint\ncalls between the EDCTP2 Programme and any other legal entity.\n(23)               \nAudits of recipients of Union funds provided in\naccordance with this Decision should ensure a reduction of administrative\nburden, in compliance with the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.\n(24)               \nThe Union\u2019s financial interests should be\nprotected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure life-cycle,\nincluding the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the\nrecovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where\nappropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(25)               \nThe Commission should conduct interim evaluations,\nassessing in particular the quality and efficiency of EDCTP2, progress towards\nthe objectives set and a final evaluation and prepare reports on those\nevaluations.\n(26)               \nUpon request from the Commission, EDCTP2-IS and\nthe participating states should submit any information the Commission needs to\ninclude in the reports on the evaluation of the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(27)               \nIt is essential that the research activities\ncarried out under the EDCTP2 Programme are in full compliance with the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human\nRights and its Supplementary Protocols, ethical principles included in the World\nMedical Association's Declaration of Helsinki of 2008, the standards of good\nclinical practice adopted by the International Conference on Harmonisation of\nTechnical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, relevant\nEU legislation and local ethics requirements of the countries where the\nresearch activities are to be conducted.\n(28)               \nSince the objectives of this Decision, namely to\ncontribute to the reduction of the social and economic burden of\npoverty-related diseases in developing countries and in particular in\nsub-Saharan Africa by accelerating the clinical development of effective, safe\nand affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases, cannot be\nsufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the lack of necessary\ncritical mass to be achieved, both in human and financial terms, and can\ntherefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union\nlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union.

While a general improvement in factors such as nutrition, sanitation and\ninfrastructure is certainly important, the development of new and better\nmedical interventions is essential for an effective containment and long-term\ncontrol of PRDs. \nThe persistent lack of effective medical interventions for PRDs is\naffected by five key drivers that require Union intervention through EDCTP2:\ninsufficient investment; weak clinical research capacity in sub-Saharan African\ncountries; fragmented public support; the limited scope of the EDCTP1\nprogramme; and insufficient links to other EU initiatives. First and foremost,\nthe medical interventions needed for PRDs will not be developed by the private\nsector alone owing to limited financial incentives (market failure). Second,\nclinical trials are of such scale and complexity that no single country can\nprovide the necessary resources. The EU-level approach on which EDCTP is built makes\nit possible to achieve the necessary critical mass of resources, with Union funding complementing participating states\u2019 contributions to EDCTP2. \nFor more information, please read the impact assessment report of\nEDCTP2 accompanying this legislative proposal.\n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\ninvolvement\nPublic intervention at EU level is necessary to bring together\ncompartmentalised national research programmes, help design common research and\nfunding strategies across national borders and achieve the critical mass of\nactors and investment needed for undertaking resource-intensive clinical trials\nof new medical interventions for poverty-related diseases in developing\ncountries. In doing so, the impact of European activities and effectiveness of\npublic investment in this field is maximised. In light of budgetary restrictions\nand from a purely economic perspective, it makes more sense than ever to invest\ncollectively in order to maximise the cost-effectiveness and impact. Public intervention\nis in line with the overall provisions of the EU Treaty, related EU policies\nand, in particular, contributes to delivering on the Union\u2019s commitments to\npromote aid effectiveness, inclusive growth and progress towards achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\nsimilar experiences in the past\nUp until now, EDCTP\nhas funded 241 projects involving 185 African and 70 European research\ninstitutions. This includes 88 clinical trials which were all subject to\nethical clearance from the competent national ethics board(s) in the country or\ncountries in which the trial(s) were due to take place before any funding was granted\nby EDCTP. Most of the clinical trials supported by EDCTP were launched after\n2007 and are still on-going. Nevertheless, they have already generated more\nthan 350 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, while the results of\neight clinical trials so far have been integrated in guidelines for improved\nclinical practice. \nDespite these\nachievements, a number of issues were raised in the 2009 interim evaluation\nreport and the public consultation. These following issues are fundamental to the\ndesign and subsequent implementation of EDCTP2:\n- the current scope\nof EDCTP needs to be changed and extended;\n- the integration of\nEuropean national programmes should be further improved;\n- collaboration with\nother major public and private funders, including the pharmaceutical industry,\nneeds to be strengthened and extended;\n- synergies with European\nexternal policy actions should be developed, in particular with EU development\nassistance;\n- co-funding rules\nshould be clarified and simplified;\n- monitoring tools\nneed to be strengthened.\nFor more information,\nplease read the impact assessment report of EDCTP2 accompanying this\nlegislative proposal.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nEDCTP was conceived to complement the actions implemented under the\nEuropean Development Fund (EDF) and the Development Cooperation Instrument\n(DCI) to ensure the development and delivery of medical interventions to those\nin need. So far, interaction with these European programmes for development\nassistance has been limited, but the opportunity remains to better exploit\nsynergies and achieve greater impact of Union actions in research and\ndevelopment assistance. The remit of EDCTP is restricted to support clinical\ntrials and corresponding capacity-building. However, in resource-poor settings\nlike sub-Saharan Africa, such activities do not exist in isolation, and would\nachieve a far greater impact if they were integrated in and coordinated with\nnational healthcare systems and programmes.\nFor more information, please read the impact assessment report of\nEDCTP2 accompanying this legislative proposal.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\nimpact\n\u00fd Proposal/initiative of limited\nduration\n\u2013     \n\u00fd\u00a0 Proposal/initiative in effect from 1/1/2014 to 31/12/2024\n\u2013     \n\u00fd\u00a0 Financial impact from 2014 to 2020 for commitment appropriations\nand from 2014 to 2024 for payment appropriations\n\u00a8 Proposal/initiative of unlimited\nduration\n\u2013     \nImplementation with a start-up period from YYYY\nto YYYY,\n\u2013     \nfollowed by full-scale operation.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\nenvisaged[19]\n\u00a8 Centralised direct management by the Commission\n\u00fd Centralised indirect management with the delegation of implementation tasks to:\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 executive agencies\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 bodies set up by the Communities[20]\n\u2013     \n\u00fd\u00a0 national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission\n\u2013     \n\u00a8\u00a0 persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions\npursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union and identified in the\nrelevant basic act within the meaning of Article 49 of the Financial Regulation\n\u00a8 Shared management with the Member States\n\u00a8 Decentralised management with third countries\n\u00a8 Joint management with international organisations (to be specified)\nIf more than one\nmanagement mode is indicated, please provide details in the \u2018Comments\u2019 section.\nComments\nEDCTP2 shall\nbe implemented through the EDCTP legal entity as the implementation structure\n(EDCTP2-IS).
