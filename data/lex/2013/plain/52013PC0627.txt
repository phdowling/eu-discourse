Objectives of\r\nthe proposal\nEurope must tap into new sources of growth to restore\r\ncompetitiveness, drive innovation and create new jobs. The global economy is\r\nevolving towards an Internet economy, and ICT should be fully recognised as a\r\nsource of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Europe cannot afford to\r\nrenounce the benefits of connected technologies which account for 50% of\r\nproductivity gains in recent years, across all sectors; which create five jobs\r\nfor every two lost; which is a driver of innovative new services which can\r\nquickly reach global scale if enabled to grow. This is the key for Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis, if we address impediments to growth arising from\r\nongoing fragmentation. This has been fully acknowledged by the Spring European\r\nCouncil of 2013, the Conclusions of which foresaw that the Commission should\r\nreport by October 2013 on the remaining obstacles to the completion of a fully\r\nfunctioning Digital Single Market, and present concrete measures to establish\r\nthe single market in information and telecommunications technology as early as\r\npossible.\nThe\r\ngeneral objective of the proposal is to move towards a single market for\r\nelectronic communications in which:\n-\r\ncitizens and businesses can access electronic communications services wherever\r\nthey are provided in the Union, without cross-border restrictions or\r\nunjustified additional costs;\n-\r\ncompanies providing electronic communications networks and services can operate\r\nand provide them wherever they are established or their customers are situated\r\nin the EU.\nThis ambitious goal is important in itself,\r\nafter over a decade of Union legislative interventions to liberalise and\r\nintegrate these markets. Urgent and decisive measures to achieve it, as laid\r\ndown in this proposal, are all the more vital because some of them will take\r\ntime, after adoption, to produce all of their effects. A single market for electronic communications would promote\r\ncompetition, investment and innovation in networks and services by fostering\r\nmarket integration and the cross-border investment in networks and the provision\r\nof services. The specific measures proposed should lead to greater levels of\r\ncompetition on infrastructure quality as well as price, stronger innovation and\r\ndifferentiation, including in business models, and to easier planning of the\r\ncommercial and technical elements of investment decisions regarding entry or\r\nexpansion on wireless or fixed markets. It will thus underpin other measures\r\ntaken to promote the ambitious broadband targets set out in the Digital Agenda\r\nfor Europe as well as the establishment of a genuine Digital Single Market\r\nwhere content, application and other digital services can freely circulate.\r\nEnhanced levels of infrastructure competition and integration across the Union\r\nshould also lead to a reduction in bottlenecks and thus in the need for ex\r\nante regulation of electronic communications markets, making this over time\r\na sector like any other economic sector subject to horizontal regulation and\r\ncompetition rules. \nThe growing\r\navailability of digital infrastructures and services would in turn increase\r\nconsumer choice and quality of service, and contribute to territorial and\r\nsocial cohesion, as well as facilitate mobility across the EU; while for the\r\ndigital economy at large, a better functioning electronic communications sector\r\nthroughout the Union should lead to greater choice and quality of business\r\ninputs, enabling the attainment of productivity gains associated with ICT use as\r\nwell as from modernised public services. The ultimate goal is to underpin\r\nEuropean competitiveness in a world which increasingly depends on the digital\r\neconomy to function and to grow.\nOutstanding single market integration\r\nchallenges include: first, to remove unnecessary obstacles in the authorisation\r\nregime and in the rules applying to service provision so that an authorisation\r\nobtained in one Member State is valid in all Member States, and that operators\r\ncan provide services on the basis of consistent and stable application of\r\nregulatory obligations. Second, to ensure greater harmonisation for accessing\r\nessential inputs: by guaranteeing mobile operators predictable assignment\r\nconditions and coordinated timeframes to access spectrum for wireless broadband\r\nacross the EU; by harmonising ways to access European fixed networks so that\r\nproviders can more easily offer their services across the single market. Third,\r\nto guarantee common high levels of consumer protection across the Union and common commercial conditions in this respect, including measures to gradually end\r\nmobile roaming surcharges and safeguarding access to the open internet. These\r\nare distinct challenges, to which this proposal brings distinct solutions, but\r\nall are vital to commercial and investment decision-making in this sector and\r\nfor consumers\u00b4 benefit, all must be addressed together now to unleash the\r\nsingle market . These sit alongside the wider challenges of building a digital\r\nsingle market, such as the rules that apply to on line content.\nFor Europeans to be\r\nable to enjoy new innovative high quality services, investment in next\r\ngeneration infrastructure needs to speed up. The right regulatory environment\r\nis crucial to contribute to a dynamic and competitive market.\r\nIt must provide the right balance of risk and reward for those prepared to invest. And it can bring\r\nfragmentation of services provision to an end, so that their full benefits are\r\navailable to all industries and users across the EU. In order to support these\r\nobjectives, the Commission is adopting together with this proposal a\r\nRecommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing\r\nmethodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment\r\nenvironment.[1]\r\nThis Recommendation will promote competition and enhance investments in\r\nhigh-speed networks by providing long-term stability of copper access prices,\r\nensuring access seekers equal access to the incumbent operators' networks\r\nthereby ensuring a level playing field, and by setting out the conditions under\r\nwhich price regulation of NGA networks is no longer warranted, in order that\r\ninvestors in such networks would have greater freedom to discover appropriate\r\npricing strategies to secure a return in the presence of competing\r\ninfrastructures such as regulated copper, as well as cable in some areas and,\r\nincreasingly, 4th generation mobile networks. \nThis proposal must also\r\nbe considered in the context of other recent or impending initiatives in the\r\nfield. The proposal builds upon and advances the main directives of 2002\r\ngoverning the provision of electronic communications, as amended in 2009, by\r\nintroducing directly applicable legislative provisions which shall operate in\r\nconjunction with the provisions of the directives on subjects such as\r\nauthorisation, spectrum assignment and access to networks. The proposal is\r\nadopted against the background of the Commission proposal for a Regulation of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the cost of\r\ndeploying high-speed electronic communications networks[2], which already took the approach of addressing in a single\r\ninstrument a number of distinct regulatory cost elements at various stages of\r\nthe network investment process which, taken together, allow reductions in\r\nbroadband roll-out costs of up to 30%. This proposal is also adopted in the\r\nknowledge that the Commission Recommendation on relevant markets[3] is to be reviewed in 2014, and that preparatory\r\nwork is well advanced; rapid adoption and implementation of this proposal could\r\nallow a reduction in the number or scope of markets subject to ex ante\r\nregulation as part of the prospective analysis of the development of\r\ncompetition in a single market.\n1.2. General context\nIn today's world, many\r\nnew digital services and applications are coming online within the EU's single\r\nmarket. Today's innovation and growth opportunities are often digital in\r\nvirtually every sector of the economy, ranging from the automotive sector (connected\r\ncars) to energy (smart grids), from public administrations (e-government) to\r\ngeneral services (e-health). Running almost any kind of business, from small\r\nstart-ups to large enterprises, requires access to state of the art services\r\nand infrastructure. This entire ecosystem depends on the connectivity provided\r\nby electronic communications networks. \nToday,\r\n Europe is fragmented into 28 separate national communications markets, each\r\nwith a limited number of players. As a consequence, while no operator is\r\npresent in more than half of the Member States, most in far fewer, overall more\r\nthan 200 operators serve a market of 510 million of customers. EU rules on, for\r\nexample, authorisations, regulatory conditions, spectrum assignment and\r\nconsumer protection are implemented in diverging ways. This patchy scenario\r\nraises barriers to entry and increases the costs for operators wanting to\r\nprovide cross-border services thereby impeding their expansion. This stands in\r\nstark contrast with the US or China who have one single market of 330 and 1400\r\nmillion customers respectively, served by four to five large operators, with\r\none legislation, one licensing system, and one spectrum policy. \nEconomies of scale and\r\nnew growth opportunities can improve the returns on investment in high-speed\r\nnetworks and can at the same time drive competition and global competitiveness.\r\nYet within the EU, operators cannot benefit sufficiently from them. Other parts\r\nof the world are making significant digital efforts and investments - these investments are paying off\r\nfor both investors and consumers, but in Europe such upgrades are not happening\r\nfast enough. \nAt the same time, due\r\nto fragmented national markets, consumers face less choice, services which are less\r\ninnovative and of lower quality, and they still pay a high price to make calls\r\nacross borders or \u2018roam\u2019 within the EU. This means they are unable to make the\r\nmost of digital services potentially available today.\nAs\r\na result, Europe is losing out on a major potential source of growth. In a\r\nworld where ICT is pervasive, a fragmented electronic communications market\r\nundermines efficiency and productivity across the economy. The untapped\r\npotential of an EU single market in electronic communications is estimated at\r\nup to 0.9% GDP, or \u20ac110 billion per year.[4]\r\nThe benefits from a single market for business communication services alone amount\r\nto almost \u20ac90 billion per year.[5]\nA sound\r\ntelecommunications market underpins a wider digital economy, whose dynamism of\r\nis reflected in its sustained employment growth. To give some idea of the scale\r\nand robustness of that wider economy, there are more than 4 million ICT\r\nspecialists working in the EU, a number which keeps on growing despite the\r\nrecession .In the wider economy, increasing ICT investment, improving e-skills in the labour force\r\nand reforming the conditions for the Internet economy could boost GDP by an\r\nadditional 5% up to 2020,[6] and create 3.8 million jobs.[7]\r\n\nMarket barriers for electronic communications impede the\r\nbenefits of cross-European services: better quality, economies of scale,\r\ngreater investment, increased efficiency and stronger bargaining positions.\r\nThis negatively affects the wider digital eco-system including EU equipment\r\nmanufacturers, and content and application providers, from start-ups to\r\ngovernments. It also has an impact on economic sectors such as banking,\r\nautomotive, logistics, retail, health, energy or transport that rely on connectivity to enhance productivity, for instance, through\r\ncloud computing, connected objects and integrated service provision.\n1.3. Political\r\nbackground \nThe\r\nDigital Agenda for Europe (DAE), a flagship initiative of the EU's Europe 2020\r\nStrategy, has already signalled this vital role of ICT and network\r\nconnectivity. It sets out many initiatives to promote investment, enhance\r\ncompetition and reduce the cost of rolling out high-speed networks, to ensure\r\nthat all Europeans have access to fast broadband. The Commission has also\r\nlaunched a Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs, to address the employment\r\npotential of this sector. \nThe\r\nCommission is also implementing initiatives to ensure a \"Digital Single Market\",\r\nand to promote online content, including e-commerce and e-government. It has\r\nalso proposed a reformed EU Data Protection Regulation, to protect citizens\u2019\r\nprivacy while facilitating innovation and business within a single market; and\r\na strategy to promote cyber-security and defend EU critical infrastructures and\r\nnetworks, including a draft Directive on Network and Information Security,[8] which is a vital\r\nsupport to the confidence of citizens and consumers in the online environment. \nMoving\r\ntowards a single market in electronic communications would support the Digital\r\nSingle Market ecosystem. Such a market would imply, not just modern\r\ninfrastructure, but also innovative and secure digital services. \nRecognising\r\nthis, the 2013 Spring European Council stressed the importance of the digital\r\nsingle market for growth and called for the Commission to present (in time for\r\nthe October European Council) concrete measures to establish a Single Market in\r\nICT as early as possible. This proposal, together with the Commission\r\nRecommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing\r\nmethodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment\r\nenvironment, forms a set of balanced measures aimed at moving towards a Single\r\nMarket in Telecommunications and fostering investment. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\r\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1. Views of\r\nstakeholders\nSince the Spring\r\nEuropean Council set out in its conclusions the need for concrete proposals to\r\nbe presented before its October European Council, public consultations had to\r\nbe conducted within this challenging time-table. In addition to specific formal\r\nconsultations and consultative events, the Commission has engaged extensively\r\nwith a wide range of stakeholder organisations to assess the general state of\r\nthe electronic communications market and how to establish a single market. It\r\nhas met and received submissions from stakeholders representing all industry\r\nsegments, consumer organisations, civil society, and national regulators and\r\ngovernments.\nOn top of that, the\r\nCommission organised several consultative events attended by stakeholders\r\nrepresenting all segments of the industry, consumers and civil society[9]. These consultations have shown\r\nthat a large majority of stakeholders share the Commission's problem analysis\r\nand recognise that urgent action is needed.\nFurthermore, discussions were held in the\r\nEuropean Parliament and in the Council of Ministers (TTE Council). In Council,\r\nmost delegations shared the problem analysis and the need for taking measures\r\nto move towards a single market, with a view to safeguard or improve\r\ncompetition and consumer choice, to address net neutrality and roaming and to\r\navoid regulatory arbitrage whilst ensuring more regulatory consistency,\r\nincluding in spectrum management and at the same time avoiding excessive\r\ncentralisation of competences. Discussions in the European Parliament showed\r\nstrong support for the thrust of the Commission's proposals and highlighted in\r\nparticular the urgency of eliminating roaming as part of a single market for\r\nelectronic communications as well as of introducing a high level of consumer\r\nprotection and clear rules on net neutrality. \n2.2. Expertise\nA major study was\r\ncompleted in 2012 on 'Steps towards a truly internal market for\r\ne-communications', also known as the \"cost of non-Europe in\r\ntelecoms\".[10]\r\nThe study assessed the state of the EU's single market for electronic\r\ncommunications and estimated the economic potential of a single market. \nThe Commission also\r\nused many other sources of evidence, such as the annual Digital Agenda\r\nScoreboard and economic studies conducted by DG ECFIN, for instance on\r\nfragmentation of the telecommunications market in Europe.[11] The EU consultation mechanism\r\nunder the regulatory framework has also highlighted inconsistent practices by\r\nnational regulatory authorities (NRAs) when regulating relevant markets.\r\nFurthermore, in the context of the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme, the\r\nCommission detected a considerable lack of coherence across Member States\r\nregarding the authorisation and the opening of spectrum bands for\r\ntechnology-neutral use especially in terms of conditions attached and timing.\n2.3. Assessment of\r\nthe impact of the proposed Regulation\nIn\r\nline with its \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d policy, the Commission\r\nservices carried out an impact assessment of policy\r\nalternatives.\nThe\r\nmain sources for regulatory fragmentation are linked to the main\r\nsector-specific requirements for the provision of electronic communications\r\nwhich are subject to EU law (authorisation, access to fixed and wireless\r\ninputs, compliance with end-user protection rules). While each of these\r\nelements has very distinct features, and the solutions to fragmentation will\r\nnecessarily be very different, they are all vital if the main barriers to\r\nintegrated provision of electronic communications networks and services in the Union are to be overcome. In particular, the assessment of solutions has been broken down\r\nby reference to a) barriers due to national authorisation regimes linked with\r\ninconsistency in regulatory approaches implemented by NRAs; b) lack of\r\nco-ordination in spectrum assignments and conditions as well as regulatory\r\nuncertainty as to the availability of frequencies; c) lack of wholesale\r\nproducts which allow the provision of services using the network of another\r\noperator with consistent service interoperability levels, in the framework of\r\nmarket remedies or reciprocal negotiations; d) fragmentation of consumer\r\nprotection rules leading to uneven levels of consumer protection and varying\r\ncommercial conditions, including high costs of roaming and international calls\r\nas well as blocking or throttling of services. \nIn\r\norder to tackle these sources of fragmentation, three policy options were selected\r\nfor further analysis. The first option was based on the\r\nregulatory framework for electronic communications as it stands. The second\r\noption considered a single legislative instrument (a Regulation) adjusting the\r\nregulatory framework only where necessary for a single EU market for electronic\r\ncommunications, based on enhanced EU coordination. The third option included\r\nthe substance of the second option, but replaced the current governance\r\nstructure by a single EU regulator in order to achieve full regulatory\r\ncoordination. \nEach policy option\r\nwas assessed against its effectiveness to achieve the policy objectives, focusing on the costs and benefits for demand and supply sides,\r\nincluding the impact on the structure of the EU electronic communications\r\nindustry, the economy, jobs, consumer surplus and the environment.\nThe\r\nimpact assessment report concludes that the second option is the best\r\navailable. First of all, a single European authorisation aims at reducing the\r\nadministrative burden for European operators and would ensure consistency of\r\ntheir regulatory treatment. \nThe\r\ncoordination of use of radio spectrum within the Single market will ensure a\r\nsynchronised availability of spectrum input and the application of consistent\r\nconditions attached to its use across Europe, thereby ensuring an efficient use\r\nof spectrum. At the same time, this would support a predictable investment\r\nenvironment for high-speed networks, including their wide territorial coverage,\r\nwhich is also a long-term end-user interest. \nThe\r\navailability of standardised wholesale access products at EU level as a\r\npotential remedy for significant market power will allow fixed operators to\r\nprovide their connectivity services to their customers throughout the Union, with a high quality of service. Such availability is expected to have a positive effect\r\non investments, especially across Member State borders, making it easier for\r\ncompanies to enter new markets to follow customer demand and allowing them to\r\ndo so with access products of a high quality standard, thus enhancing\r\ncompetition and requiring operators to improve their offer by investing in\r\ninfrastructure and services. \nCommon\r\nrules on quality of services will ensure the freedom of users to have access to\r\nservices and applications of their choice and on the basis of clear contractual\r\nterms throughout the Union, without their internet access being unduly\r\nthrottled or blocked. They will at the same time ensure the possibility to\r\nacquire specialised services for the provision of specific content,\r\napplications and services with an enhanced quality of services. Strengthened\r\ntransparency and contractual rights would ensure the consumers' interest in\r\nhigh quality and reliable services and will strengthen the competitive dynamics\r\nof the market. \nFinally\r\nmeasures on unjustifiable price differences between domestic and intra-EU calls\r\nand those facilitating the provision of Roaming Like At Home offers through\r\nroaming agreements aim at abolishing unjustified additional costs for\r\nelectronic communications services provided across borders. \nIn conclusion this option would enhance\r\nlegal predictability and transparency in the most efficient and timely manner. In particular, greater contestability of\r\nmarkets, more common operating conditions (input access, consumer-specific\r\nrules) as well as the pass-on of scale advantages due to customer price\r\nelasticity or competitive pressure, should lead to greater convergence. Greater\r\ncompetitive pressure, leading to incentives to differentiate, plus greater\r\nscale advantages, greater regulatory predictability, and a better environment\r\nfor mass distribution of innovative services, should all in due course improve\r\nthe investment environment. While these proposals are\r\nexpected to have a positive impact on job creation, the precise social and\r\nemployment impacts are difficult to assess at this stage. The Commission will\r\npay special attention to this aspect during its monitoring and evaluation of\r\nthe legislation.\nCompared to the preferred option, 3 to 5\r\nyears more would be needed to achieve the desired result under options 1\r\n(applying the current framework) and 3 (complete change of the regulatory\r\ngovernance for pan-EU services), with foregoing\r\npotential additional GDP up to 3.7% over the period 2015 \u2013 2020. \nIt\r\nalso takes least time to produce its effects and deliver all the specific objectives,\r\nthus achieving the highest possible economic and social benefits of all the\r\noptions considered. \nThe\r\nImpact Assessment Board delivered an opinion on the draft impact assessment on 6\r\nSeptember 2013. \nThe report and its\r\nexecutive summary are published with the proposal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\r\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1. Legal basis\nThe proposal is based on Article 114 of the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as it relates to the internal\r\nmarket for electronic communications and its functioning. \n3.2. Subsidiarity\nThe current regulatory framework has not\r\nbeen able to fully deliver its objective to establish a single market for\r\nelectronic communications. The differences in national rules, while compatible\r\nwith the existing EU regulatory framework, nevertheless create barriers to\r\noperating and acquiring services across borders, thereby limiting the freedom\r\nto provide electronic communications, as guaranteed under EU law. This has a\r\ndirect effect on the functioning of the internal market. Member States have\r\nneither the competence nor the incentive to change the current regulatory\r\nlandscape. \nMeasures at EU level are needed to tackle\r\nthe underlying causes of the problem. First, the current fragmentation\r\nresulting from the national dimension of the general authorisation systems is\r\ncountered by introducing a single EU authorisation. A single EU authorisation\r\nmechanism coupled with the home-country control on the withdrawal and/or\r\nsuspension of such authorisation would facilitate registration of EU operators\r\nand the coordination of the most serious enforcement measures applicable to\r\nthem. The proposal guarantees greater regulatory consistency and predictability\r\nto such companies by granting the Commission the power to require national\r\nregulators to withdraw proposed remedies which would be incompatible with EU\r\nlaw. The proposal would ensure much greater convergence in regulated conditions\r\nof access to fixed and wireless inputs which facilitate the provision of\r\npan-European services. The full harmonisation of end-users' rights ensures that\r\ncitizens and providers across the EU have similar rights and obligations, in\r\nparticular the possibility to market and acquire services across borders under\r\nthe same conditions. \nThe principle of subsidiarity is respected\r\nas EU intervention will be limited to the extent necessary to remove specified\r\ninternal market barriers. \nFirst of all, the single EU authorisation\r\nis available to operators intending to carry out their\r\nactivities on a pan-EU dimension and the regulatory\r\nobligations inherently linked to the place where a network is located or a\r\nservice is provided remain to be decided by the national regulator of that Member State. Revenues levied from spectrum assignments will remain with the Member State concerned, while more detailed regulatory principles on spectrum use\r\ncomplementing the high level objectives framed in the EU Regulatory framework\r\nstill leave a large margin of discretion on details to Member States.\r\nSimilarly, with regard to the notification procedure to the Commission on\r\nspectrum, this is based on a legal compatibility check, rather than\r\nsubstitution of Commission discretion for that of Member States, and is subject\r\nto further safeguards such as the examination procedure under comitology. The\r\nextension of the benefit of general authorisation to use of small-area wireless\r\naccess points is confined to unobtrusive, low-power deployments strictly\r\ndefined by implementing measures. Finally, the imposition of European virtual\r\naccess products remains with the national regulatory authority of the Member State where the network is located, following a market analysis based on the\r\nexisting framework; at the same time, the harmonisation of virtual access\r\nproducts uses the same mechanism as for physical wholesale access products\r\nforeseen already under the existing framework.\n3.3. Proportionality\nEU action is limited to what is necessary\r\nto achieve the objectives identified. Measures will focus on tackling clear\r\nbottlenecks to the Single Market, with the minimum necessary amendments to the\r\nexisting regulatory framework needed in order to create the conditions for new\r\ncross-border electronic communications markets to develop at EU level. In doing\r\nso it would allow meeting the two-fold Single Market objective of freedom of\r\nprovision and freedom of consumption of electronic communications services. At\r\nthe same time, by leaving the existing regulatory framework largely untouched,\r\nincluding in the way that national regulatory authorities supervise markets, it\r\navoids disrupting operations of those providers that would opt for keeping a\r\nnational (or sub-national) footprint. \nMoreover the development of new\r\ncross-border markets should take place under the 'better regulation' principle,\r\ni.e. by progressively decreasing regulatory pressure if markets are proven to\r\nbe competitive within a more integrated European context but in accordance with\r\nthe supervisory competences of national regulatory authorities and subject to ex\r\npost competition control. That is beneficial as the national regulatory\r\nauthorities would also be the best placed to take account of the national\r\nspecificities when (i) regulating access to physical infrastructures that by\r\ntheir nature remain geographically confined to national or regional level; and\r\n(ii) addressing consumer questions in a national context (notably in their\r\nlanguage). \nAccordingly, the proposed measures will not involve significant changes to governance or shift\r\ncompetences to the European level such as through an EU regulator or\r\npan-European spectrum licensing. \nThe solutions will enable relevant\r\nstakeholders to exploit the synergies of a large single market and reduce\r\ninefficiencies in their operations and investments, in the most timely and\r\neffective manner. At the same time, the proposal ensures to those operators who\r\nopt to provide services in a single Member States continuity of the current\r\nrules while benefitting from improved and clearer rules concerning end-users\r\nrights, and a more predictable environment for access to spectrum inputs and to\r\nhigh-quality fixed network access products.\n3.4. Fundamental rights \nThe proposal\u2019s impact on fundamental rights\r\nsuch as the freedom of expression and information, the freedom to conduct a\r\nbusiness, non-discrimination, consumer protection and the protection of personal\r\ndata, has been analysed. In particular, the\r\nRegulation will safeguard access to the open internet; it sets a high standard\r\nfor fully harmonised end-user rights, increases business freedom at European\r\nscale and should lead to a reduction in sector-specific regulation over time.\n3.5. Choice of the instrument\nThe Commission proposes a Regulation as it\r\nensures the removal of single market barriers by complementing the existing\r\nregulatory framework for electronic communications. This includes specific, directly-applicable\r\nrights and obligations for providers and end users; it also includes\r\ncoordinating mechanisms regarding certain inputs at European level to\r\nfacilitate the provision of electronic communications services across borders.\r\nA Regulation is important, for example, in a field such as open Internet and\r\ntraffic management, where a truly common approach is necessary to avoid from\r\nthe outset the current tendency towards divergent national solutions and to\r\nenable both integrated network management and the development of online\r\ncontent, applications and services which can be made available in a common way\r\nthroughout the Union. \n3.6. Structure of the proposal and main\r\nrights and obligations\nGeneral provisions (Chapter I, Article 1\r\nand 2)\nChapter 1 contains the general provisions,\r\nincluding relevant definitions. It establishes regulatory principles pursuant\r\nto which the regulatory bodies involved shall act when applying this regulation\r\nin conjunction with the provisions of the existing framework\nSingle EU authorisation (Chapter II,\r\nArticle 3 to 7)\nOperators wanting to provide services in\r\nseveral Member States must currently be authorised in each of them. The\r\nRegulation introduces a single EU authorisation based on a single notification\r\nsystem in the Member State of main establishment of the European electronic\r\ncommunication provider (the home country) and sets out the conditions\r\napplicable to it. The withdrawal and/or suspension of the Single EU\r\nauthorisation are subject to home-country control. Holders of a single EU\r\nauthorisation are entitled to equal regulatory treatment in similar situations\r\nwithin and across Member States and new entrants and smaller cross-border\r\noperators are exempted from administrative charges and contributions to the\r\nuniversal service financing in Member States other than the home country (host\r\ncountries). Holders of a single EU authorisation will further provide services\r\nthroughout Europe on the basis of greater consistent application of regulatory\r\nobligations\nThe single European authorisation will\r\nthereby reduce unnecessary administrative hurdles and guarantee European\r\nproviders more consistent rights and obligations to operate across the EU and\r\nachieve scale.\nEuropean inputs (Chapter III)\nSection 1 (Articles 8 to 16)\nMobile providers in Europe today lack the\r\nnecessary predictability regarding spectrum availability across the EU and must\r\ndeal with diverging assignment conditions. It is thus more difficult to plan\r\nlong-term, to invest across borders and eventually to gain scale. Such a patchy\r\nsituation means that device manufacturers design their products for other\r\nmarkets with greater scale and growth prospects. To put an end to this\r\nunsustainable situation, harmonisation of spectrum inputs must be ensured by: \n\u00b7                        \r\nDefining common regulatory principles applicable\r\nto Member State when defining conditions on the use of spectrum which is\r\nharmonised for wireless broadband communications.\n\u00b7                        \r\nEmpowering the Commission to adopt implementing\r\nacts to harmonise spectrum availability, the timing of assignments and the\r\nduration of rights of use for spectrum. \n\u00b7                        \r\nA consultation mechanism enabling the Commission\r\nto review draft national measures concerning the assignment and the use of\r\nspectrum. \n\u00b7                        \r\nSimplifying conditions for the deployment and\r\nprovision of low-power wireless broadband access ('Wi-Fi', small cells) to\r\nenhance competition and reduce network congestion.\nSection 2 (Articles 17 to 20)\nHarmonised, high-quality virtual access to\r\nfixed networks would facilitate market entry and the provision of cross-border\r\nservices both to end-users and businesses, and would help drive competition and\r\ninvestment. Today, virtual fixed access products are defined in a variety of\r\nmanners across the EU. Virtual access to fixed networks to provide cross-border\r\nservices is harmonised through:\n\u00b7                        \r\nDefining common features of EU-harmonised\r\nvirtual broadband access products (virtual unbundling, IP bit-stream and\r\nterminating segments of leased lines) when mandated on operators with\r\nsignificant market power. \n\u00b7                        \r\nAccordingly, national regulators are required to\r\ntake into account the introduction of such harmonised access products when\r\nimposing regulatory remedies, with due regard for existing infrastructure\r\ncompetition and investments and overarching proportionality requirements. The\r\nproposal also reflects decisional practice in a provision linking consideration\r\nof wholesale price control obligations on NGA networks with competitive\r\nconstraints from alternative infrastructures, effective guarantees of\r\nnon-discriminatory access and the level of retail competition in terms of\r\nprice, choice and quality.\n\u00b7                        \r\nA right for electronic communications providers\r\nto offer and access on reasonable terms harmonised connectivity products with\r\nassured service quality to enable new types of online services.\nRights of end-users (Chapter IV,\r\nArticles 21 to 29)\nIn Europe, both electronic communications\r\nproviders and end-users face inconsistent rules regarding rights of end-users,\r\nleading to uneven levels of protection and a variety of diverging rules to\r\ncomply with in different Member States. This fragmentation is costly for\r\noperators, unsatisfactory for end-users and eventually hinders the provision of\r\nservices across borders and negatively impacts end-users' willingness to\r\nconsume them. To guarantee an appropriate level of consumer protection across\r\nthe EU, rules defining the rights of end-users are harmonised, including:\n\u2013                        \r\nnon-discrimination between certain domestic and intra-EU\r\n(international) communications (unless differences are objectively justified),\n\u2013                        \r\nmandatory pre-contractual and contractual\r\ninformation,\n\u2013                        \r\nincreased transparency and facilities to avoid\r\n\"bill shocks\",\n\u2013                        \r\nthe right to terminate the contract after six\r\nmonths without costs (excluding the residual value of any subsidised equipment\r\nor other promotions),\n\u2013                        \r\nthe obligation on providers to provide\r\nunhindered connection to all content, applications or services being accessed\r\nby end-users \u2013 also referred to as Net Neutrality - while regulating the use of\r\ntraffic management measures by operators in respect of general internet access.\r\nAt the same time, the legal framework for specialised services with enhanced\r\nquality is clarified. \nFacilitating change of provider (Chapter\r\nV, Article 30)\nImproved switching rules promote market\r\nentry and competition between electronic communication providers and allow\r\nend-users to choose more easily the provider which best meets their specific\r\nneeds. Harmonised principles applicable to switching procedures are provided,\r\nsuch as cost-orientation, receiving provider-led process, automatic termination\r\nof contract with the transferring provider. \nOrganisational and final provisions\r\n(Chapter VI, Articles 31 to 40)\nThis Chapter contains first general\r\nprovisions concerning sanctioning powers of the competent national authorities\r\nand rules on the Commission's power to adopt delegated or implementing acts.\nModifications to the Framework Directives\r\nas well as to the Roaming and BEREC Regulations are also set out. In\r\nparticular, with regard to ex ante market regulation and given that each NRA is\r\nstill responsible for its respective (national) markets, the modifications aim\r\nto foster greater consistency and stability across the EU with regard to NRAs'\r\nassessment of markets and imposition of regulatory obligations on holders of a\r\nsingle EU authorisation in order to avoid they face diverging obligations for\r\nthe same market failure in each Member State where they are present. To this\r\nend, the provisions envisage a Commission power to require withdrawal of\r\nremedies imposed on companies with a single EU authorisation, as well as legal\r\ncertainty concerning the criteria for identifying markets subject to such ex\r\nante remedies, taking also into account competitive constraints from\r\nequivalent services provided by \"over-the-top\" (OTT) players. \nWhile the Roaming III Regulation with its\r\nstructural measures will inject greater competition into the market it is not\r\nexpected of its own to create a situation where customers can confidently\r\nreplicate their consumption behaviour in their home Member State when travelling abroad and thereby to end roaming surcharges overall in Europe. Article 37, therefore, builds on the Roaming Regulation, providing\r\nincentives to operators to provide roaming at domestic price levels. The\r\nproposal introduces a voluntary mechanism for mobile operators to enter into\r\nbilateral or multilateral roaming agreements which allow them to internalise\r\nthe wholesale roaming costs and to gradually introduce roaming services at\r\ndomestic price levels up to July 2016 while limiting the risk of price\r\narbitrage. Such roaming agreements as such are not a novelty in the market.\r\nRoaming agreements already exist allowing their participants (subject to\r\ncompliance with competition law) to realise economies of scale in the provision\r\nof roaming services as between contracting parties. The proposal however\r\nrequires they are notified to improve their transparency. The proposed voluntary\r\nregime is designed to induce the pass-on of such legitimate scale economies to\r\nconsumers through the provision of roaming services at domestic price levels,\r\nunder conditions which ensure that roaming throughout the Union is covered and\r\nthat consumers throughout the Union benefit in due course from such offers. At\r\nthe same time, the proposal provides the necessary balance to allow operators\r\nto adjust their retail offers and to gradually ensure all of their customer\r\nbase benefits from them. Without bileteral or multilateral roaming agreements\r\nit is unrealistic to imagine that an operator alone would be able to provide\r\nroaming at domestic price levels throughout the whole Union in the envisaged\r\ntime frame.\nFinally, changes in the BEREC Regulation\r\nare necessary to provide more stability to the body and allow it to play a more\r\nstrategic role, in particular through the appointment of a professional three-year\r\nChair. \n4.\r\nBUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposed\r\nRegulation has no implications for the budget of the Union.\nIn particular, the proposal to amend the\r\nRegulation (EC) No 1211/2009 has no impact on either the number of\r\nestablishment plan posts or the EU financial contribution to the BEREC Office\r\nand is in line with the figures set out in the Communication to the European\r\nParliament and the Council (COM(2013)519 final).\n2013/0309 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nlaying down measures concerning the\r\nEuropean single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected\r\nContinent, and amending Directives 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC and\r\nRegulations (EC) No 1211/2009 and (EU) No 531/2012\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN\r\nPARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the\r\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the\r\nproposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of\r\nthe draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the\r\nopinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[12], \nHaving regard to the\r\nopinion of the Committee of the Regions[13],\r\n\nActing in accordance\r\nwith the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Europe has to tap all\r\nsources of growth to exit the crisis, create jobs and regain its\r\ncompetitiveness. Restoring growth and job creation in the Union is the aim of\r\nthe Europe 2020 Strategy. The 2013 Spring European Council stressed the\r\nimportance of the digital single market for growth and called for concrete\r\nmeasures, in order to establish a single market in information and\r\ncommunications technology (ICT) as early as possible. In line with the\r\nobjectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and with this call, this regulation aims\r\nat establishing a single market for electronic communications by completing and\r\nadapting the existing Union Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.\r\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Digital Agenda for\r\nEurope (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020 Strategy, has\r\nalready recognised the role of ICT and network connectivity as an indispensable\r\nbasis for the development of our economy and society. For Europe to reap the\r\nbenefits of digital transformation, the Union needs a dynamic single market in\r\nelectronic communications for all sectors and across all of Europe. Such a\r\ntruly single communications market will be the backbone of an innovative and\r\n'smart' digital economy and a foundation of the digital single market where\r\nonline services can freely flow across borders. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a seamless single\r\nmarket in electronic communications, the freedom to provide electronic\r\ncommunications networks and services to every customer in the Union and the\r\nright of each end-user to choose the best offer available on the market should\r\nbe ensured and should not be hindered by the fragmentation of markets along\r\nnational borders. The current regulatory framework for electronic\r\ncommunications does not fully address such fragmentation, with national, rather\r\nthan Union-wide general authorisation regimes, national spectrum assignment\r\nschemes, differences of access products available for electronic communications\r\nproviders in different Member States, and different sets of sector-specific consumer\r\nrules applicable. The Union rules in many cases merely define a baseline, and\r\nare often implemented in diverging ways by the Member States. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A truly single market for\r\nelectronic communications should promote competition, investment and innovation\r\nin new and enhanced networks and services by fostering market integration and\r\ncross-border service offerings. It should thus help to achieve the ambitious\r\nhigh-speed broadband targets set out in the DAE. The growing availability of\r\ndigital infrastructures and services should in turn increase consumer choice, quality\r\nof service and diversity of content, and contribute to territorial and social\r\ncohesion, as well as facilitating mobility across the Union. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefits arising from\r\na single market for electronic communications should extend to the wider\r\ndigital ecosystem that includes Union equipment manufacturers, content and\r\napplication providers and the wider economy, covering sectors such as banking,\r\nautomotive, logistics, retail, energy and transport, which rely on connectivity\r\nto enhance their productivity through, for example, ubiquitous cloud\r\napplications, connected objects and possibilities for integrated service\r\nprovision for different parts of the company. Public administrations and the\r\nhealth sector should also benefit from a wider availability of e-government and\r\ne-health services. The offer of cultural content and services, and cultural\r\ndiversity in general, may be also enhanced in a single market for electronic\r\ncommunications. The provision of connectivity through electronic communications\r\nnetworks and services is of such importance to the wider economy and society\r\nthat unjustified sector-specific burdens, whether regulatory or otherwise,\r\nshould be avoided.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation aims at\r\nthe completion of the single electronic communications market through action on\r\nthree broad, inter-related axes. First, it should secure the freedom to provide\r\nelectronic communications services across borders and networks in different\r\nMember States, building on the concept of a single EU authorisation which puts\r\nin place the conditions for ensuring greater consistency and predictability in\r\nthe content and implementation of sector-specific regulation throughout the Union. Second, it is necessary to enable access on much more convergent terms and\r\nconditions to essential inputs for the cross-border provision of electronic\r\ncommunications networks and services, not only for wireless broadband\r\ncommunications, for which both licensed and unlicensed spectrum is key, but also\r\nfor fixed line connectivity. Third, in the interests of aligning business\r\nconditions and building the digital confidence of citizens, this Regulation\r\nshould harmonise rules on the protection of end-users, especially consumers.\r\nThis includes rules on non-discrimination, contractual information, termination\r\nof contracts and switching, in addition to rules on access to online content,\r\napplications and services and on traffic management which not only protect\r\nend-users but simultaneously guarantee the continued functioning of the\r\nInternet ecosystem as an engine of innovation. In addition, further reforms in\r\nthe field of roaming should give end-users the confidence to stay connected\r\nwhen they travel in the Union, and should become over time a driver of convergent\r\npricing and other conditions in the Union.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should\r\ntherefore complement the existing Union regulatory framework (Directive 2002/19/EC\r\nof the European Parliament and of the Council[14],\r\nDirective 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[15], Directive 2002/21/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[16],\r\nDirective 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[17], Directive 2002/58/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[18],\r\nCommission Directive 2002/77/EC[19],\r\nas well as Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil[20],\r\nRegulation (EU) No 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[21] and Decision No 243/2012/EU of\r\nthe European Parliament[22])\r\nand the applicable national legislations adopted in conformity with Union law,\r\nby establishing specific rights and obligations for both electronic\r\ncommunications providers and end-users, by making consequential amendments to\r\nthe existing Directives and to Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 in order to secure\r\ngreater convergence as well as some substantive changes consistent with a more\r\ncompetitive Single Market.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures provided in\r\nthis Regulation respect the principle of technological neutrality, that is to\r\nsay they neither impose nor discriminate in favour of the use of a particular\r\ntype of technology.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of\r\ncross-border electronic communications is still subject to greater burdens than\r\nthose confined to the national borders. In particular, cross-border providers\r\nstill need to notify and pay fees in individual host Member States. Holders of\r\na single EU authorisation should be subject to a single notification system in\r\nthe Member State of their main establishment (home Member State), which will\r\nreduce the administrative burden for cross-border operators. The single EU\r\nauthorisation should apply to any undertaking that provides or intends to\r\nprovide electronic communications services and networks in more than one Member State, thereby entitling it to enjoy the rights attached to the freedom to provide\r\nelectronic communications services and networks in accordance with this\r\nRegulation in any Member State. A single EU authorisation defining the legal\r\nframework applicable to electronic communications operators providing services\r\nacross Member States on the basis of a general authorisation in the home Member State should ensure the effectiveness of the freedom to provide electronic\r\ncommunications services and networks in the whole Union. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision of electronic\r\ncommunications services or networks across borders may take different forms,\r\ndepending on several factors such as the kind of network or services provided,\r\nthe extent of the physical infrastructure needed or the number of subscribers\r\nin the different Member States. The intention to provide electronic\r\ncommunications services cross-border or to operate an electronic communications\r\nnetwork in more than one Member State may be demonstrated by activities such as\r\nnegotiation of agreements on access to networks in a given Member State or marketing via an internet site in the language of the targeted Member State. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Irrespective of how the\r\nprovider chooses to operate electronic communications networks or provide\r\nelectronic communications services across borders, the regulatory regime\r\napplicable to a European electronic communications provider should be neutral\r\nvis-\u00e0-vis the commercial choices which underlie the organisation of functions\r\nand activities across Member States. Therefore, regardless of the corporate\r\nstructure of the undertaking, the home Member State of a European electronic\r\ncommunications provider should be considered to be the Member State where the strategic decisions concerning the provision of electronic communications\r\nnetworks or services are taken. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The single EU authorisation\r\nshould be based on the general authorisation in the home Member State. It should not be made subject to conditions which are already applicable by virtue of\r\nother existing national law which is not specific to the electronic communications\r\nsector. In addition, the provisions of this Regulation and Regulation (EU) No.\r\n531/2012 should also apply to European electronic communications providers.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most sector-specific\r\nconditions, for example concerning access to or security and integrity of\r\nnetworks or access to emergency services, are strongly linked to the place\r\nwhere such network is located or the service is provided. Consequently a\r\nEuropean electronic communications provider may be subject to conditions\r\napplicable in the Member States where it operates, to the extent that this\r\nRegulation does not provide otherwise.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where Member States require\r\ncontribution from the sector in order to finance universal service obligations\r\nand to the administrative costs of the national regulatory authorities, the\r\ncriteria and procedures for apportioning contributions should be proportionate\r\nand non-discriminatory with regard to European electronic communications\r\nproviders, so as not to hinder cross-border market entry, in particular of new\r\nentrants and smaller operators; individual undertakings\u2019 contributions should\r\ntherefore take into account the contributor\u2019s market share in terms of turnover\r\nrealised in the relevant Member State and should be subject to the application\r\nof a de minimis threshold.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat in similar circumstances there is no discrimination in the treatment of\r\nany European electronic communications provider by different Member States and\r\nthat consistent regulatory practices are applied in the single market, in\r\nparticular as regards measures falling within the scope of Articles 15 or 16 of\r\nDirective 2002/21/EC, or Articles 5 or 8 of Directive 2002/19/EC. European\r\nelectronic communications providers should therefore have a right to equal\r\ntreatment by the different Member States in objectively equivalent situations\r\nin order to enable more integrated multi-territorial operations. Furthermore,\r\nthere should be specific procedures at Union level for the review of draft\r\ndecisions on remedies within the meaning of Article 7a of Directive 2002/21/EC\r\nin such cases, in order to avoid unjustified divergences in obligations\r\napplicable to European electronic communications providers in different Member\r\nStates. \n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An allocation of regulatory\r\nand supervisory competences should be established between the home and any host\r\nMember State of European electronic communications providers with a view to\r\nreducing the barriers to entry while ensuring that the applicable conditions\r\nfor the provision of electronic communications services and networks by these\r\nproviders are properly enforced. Therefore, while each national regulatory\r\nauthority should supervise compliance with the conditions applicable in its\r\nterritory in accordance with Union legislation, including by means of sanctions\r\nand interim measures, only the national regulatory authority in the home Member\r\nState should be entitled to suspend or withdraw the rights of a European\r\nelectronic communications provider to provide electronic communications\r\nnetworks and services in the whole Union or part thereof. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radio spectrum is a public\r\ngood and an essential resource for the internal market for mobile, wireless\r\nbroadband and satellite communications in the Union. Development of wireless\r\nbroadband communications contributes to the implementation of the Digital\r\nAgenda for Europe and in particular to the aim of securing access to broadband\r\nat a speed of no less than 30 Mbps by 2020 for all Union citizens and of\r\nproviding the Union with the highest possible broadband speed and capacity.\r\nHowever, the Union has fallen behind other major global regions - North\r\nAmerica, Africa and parts of Asia - in terms of the roll-out and penetration of\r\nthe latest generation of wireless broadband technologies that are necessary to\r\nachieve those policy goals. The piecemeal process of authorising and making\r\navailable the 800 MHz band for wireless broadband communications, with over\r\nhalf of the Member States seeking a derogation or otherwise failing to do so by\r\nthe deadline laid down in the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) Decision\r\n243/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council,[23] testifies to the urgency of\r\naction even within the term of the current RSPP. Union measures to harmonise\r\nthe conditions of availability and efficient use of radio spectrum for wireless\r\nbroadband communications pursuant to Decision 676/2002/EC of the European\r\nParliament and the Council[24]\r\nhave not been sufficient to address this problem.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application of various\r\nnational policies creates inconsistencies and fragmentation of the internal\r\nmarket which hamper the roll-out of Union-wide services and the completion of\r\nthe internal market for wireless broadband communications. It could in\r\nparticular create unequal conditions for access to such services, hamper\r\ncompetition between undertakings established in different Member States and stifle investments in more advanced networks and technologies and the emergence of\r\ninnovative services, thereby depriving citizens and businesses of ubiquitous\r\nintegrated high-quality services and wireless broadband operators of increased\r\nefficiency gains from large-scale more integrated operations. Therefore, action\r\nat Union level regarding certain aspects of radio spectrum assignment should\r\naccompany the development of wide integrated coverage of advanced wireless\r\nbroadband communications services throughout the Union. At the same time,\r\nMember States should retain the right to adopt measures to organise their radio\r\nspectrum for public order, public security purposes and defence.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Electronic communications\r\nservices providers, including mobile operators or consortia of such operators,\r\nshould be able to collectively organise the efficient and affordable coverage\r\nof a vast part of the Union's territory to the long-term benefit of end users,\r\nand therefore use radio spectrum across several Member States with similar\r\nconditions, procedures, costs, timing, duration in harmonised bands, and with\r\ncomplementary radio spectrum packages, such as a combination of lower and\r\nhigher frequencies for coverage of densely and less densely populated areas.\r\nInitiatives in favour of greater coordination and consistency would also\r\nenhance the predictability of the network investment environment. Such\r\npredictability would also be greatly favoured by a clear policy in favour of\r\nlong-term duration of rights of use related to radio spectrum, without\r\nprejudice to the indefinite character of such rights in some Member States, and\r\nlinked in its turn to clear conditions for the transfer, lease or sharing of\r\npart of all of the radio spectrum subject to such an individual right of use.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coordination and\r\nconsistency of rights of use for radio spectrum should be improved, at least\r\nfor the bands which have been harmonised for wireless fixed, nomadic and mobile\r\nbroadband communications. This includes the bands identified at ITU level for\r\nInternational Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) Advanced systems, as well as\r\nbands used for radio local area networks (RLAN) such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. It\r\nshould also extend to bands that may be harmonised in the future for wireless\r\nbroadband communications, as envisaged in Article 3(b) of the RSPP and in the\r\nRSPG Opinion on \"Strategic challenges facing Europe in addressing the\r\ngrowing radio spectrum demand for wireless broadband\" adopted on 13 June\r\n2013, such as, in the near future, the 700 MHz, 1.5 GHz and 3.8-4.2 GHz bands.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consistency between the\r\ndifferent national radio spectrum assignment procedures would be favoured by\r\nmore explicit provisions on the criteria relevant to the timing of authorisation\r\nprocedures; the duration for which the rights of use are granted, fees and\r\ntheir payment modalities; capacity and coverage obligations; definition of the\r\nrange of radio spectrum and spectrum blocks subject to a granting procedure;\r\nobjective threshold requirements for the promotion of effective competition;\r\nconditions for the tradability of rights of use, including sharing conditions.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limitation of the burden of\r\nfees to what is required by optimal radio spectrum management, with a balance\r\nbetween immediate payments and periodic fees, would encourage investment in\r\ninfrastructure and technology roll-out, and pass-on of the attendant cost\r\nadvantages to end users.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More synchronised radio\r\nspectrum assignments and consequential wireless broadband roll-out across the Union should support the achievement of scale effects in related industries such as for\r\nnetwork equipment and terminal devices. Such industries could in turn take into\r\naccount Union initiatives and policies regarding radio spectrum use, to a\r\ngreater extent than has recently been the case. A harmonisation procedure for\r\nthe timetables for assignment and minimum or common duration of rights of use\r\nin such bands should therefore be established.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the other main\r\nsubstantive conditions which may be attached to rights of use of radio spectrum\r\nfor wireless broadband, the convergent application by individual Member States\r\nof the regulatory principles and criteria set down in this Regulation would be\r\nfavoured by a coordination mechanism whereby the Commission and the competent\r\nauthorities of the other Member States have an opportunity to comment in\r\nadvance of the granting of rights of use by a given Member State and whereby\r\nthe Commission has an opportunity, taking into account the views of the Member\r\nStates, to forestall implementation of any proposal which appears to be\r\nnon-compliant with Union law.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considering the massive\r\ngrowth in radio spectrum demand for wireless broadband, solutions for\r\nalternative spectrally efficient access to wireless broadband should be\r\npromoted. This includes the use of low-power wireless\r\naccess systems with a small-area operating range such as so called\r\n'hotspots' of radio local area networks (RLAN, also known as 'Wi\u2011Fi'), as\r\nwell as networks of low-power small size cellular access points (also\r\ncalled femto-, pico- or metrocells).\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complementary wireless\r\naccess systems such as RLAN, in particular publicly accessible RLAN access\r\npoints, increasingly allow access to the internet for end users and allow\r\nmobile traffic off-loading by mobile operators, using harmonised radio spectrum\r\nresources without requiring an individual authorisation or right of use of the\r\nradio spectrum.\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most RLAN access points are\r\nso far used by private users as a local wireless extension of their fixed\r\nbroadband connection. If end users, within the limits of their own internet\r\nsubscription, choose to share access to their RLAN with others, the\r\navailability of a large number of such access points, particularly in densely\r\npopulated areas, should maximise wireless data capacity through radio spectrum\r\nre-use and create a cost-effective complementary wireless broadband\r\ninfrastructure accessible to other end users. Therefore, unnecessary\r\nrestrictions for end users to share access to their own RLAN access points with\r\nother end users or to connect to such access points, should be removed or\r\nprevented.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, unnecessary\r\nrestrictions to the deployment and interlinkage of RLAN access points should\r\nalso be removed. Public authorities or providers of public services\r\nincreasingly use RLAN access points in their premises for their own purposes,\r\nfor example for use by their personnel, to better facilitate cost-effective\r\non-site access by citizens to e-Government services, or to support provision of\r\nsmart public services with real-time information, such as for public transport\r\nor traffic management. Such bodies could also provide access to such access\r\npoints for citizens in general as an ancillary service to services offered to\r\nthe public on such premises, and should be enabled to do so in conformity with\r\ncompetition and public procurement rules. The making available of local access\r\nto electronic communications networks within or around a private property or a\r\nlimited public area as an ancillary service to another activity that is not\r\ndependant on such an access, such as RLAN hotspots made available to customers\r\nof other commercial activities or to the general public in that area, should\r\nnot qualify such a provider as an electronic communications provider. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low power small-area\r\nwireless access points are very small and unobtrusive equipment similar to\r\ndomestic Wi-Fi routers, for which technical characteristics should be specified\r\nat Union level for their deployment and use in different local contexts subject\r\nto general authorisation, without undue restrictions from individual planning\r\nor other permits. The proportionality of measures specifying the technical\r\ncharacteristics for such use to benefit from general authorisation should be\r\nensured through characteristics which are significantly more restrictive than\r\nthe applicable maximum thresholds in Union measures regarding parameters such\r\nas power output. \n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure\r\nthat the management of radio spectrum at national level does not prevent other\r\nMember States from using the radio spectrum to which they are entitled, or from\r\ncomplying with their obligations as regards bands for which the use is\r\nharmonised at Union level. Building on the existing activities of the RSPG, a\r\ncoordination mechanism is necessary to ensure that each Member State has equitable access to radio spectrum and that the outcomes of coordination are\r\nconsistent and enforceable.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience in the\r\nimplementation of the Union's regulatory framework indicates that existing\r\nprovisions requiring the consistent application of regulatory measures together\r\nwith the goal of contributing to the development of the internal market have\r\nnot created sufficient incentives to design access products on the basis of\r\nharmonised standards and processes, in particular in relation to fixed\r\nnetworks. When operating in different Member States, operators have\r\ndifficulties in finding access inputs with the right quality and network and\r\nservice interoperability levels, and when they are available, such inputs\r\nexhibit different technical features. This increases costs and constitutes an\r\nobstacle to the provision of services across national borders. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The integration of the\r\nsingle market for electronic communications would be accelerated through\r\nestablishment of a framework to define certain key European virtual products,\r\nwhich are particularly important for providers of electronic communication\r\nservices to provide cross-border services and to adopt a pan-Union strategy in\r\nan increasingly all-IP environment, based on key parameters and minimum\r\ncharacteristics. \n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The operational needs\r\nserved by various virtual products should be addressed. European virtual\r\nbroadband access products should be available in cases where an operator with\r\nsignificant market power has been required under the terms of the Framework\r\nDirective and the Access Directive to provide access on regulated terms at a\r\nspecific access point in its network. First, efficient cross-border entry\r\nshould be facilitated by harmonised products that enable initial provision by\r\ncross-border providers of services to their end customers without delay and\r\nwith a predictable and sufficient quality, including services to business\r\ncustomers with multiple sites in different Member States, where this would be\r\nnecessary and proportionate pursuant to market analysis. These harmonised\r\nproducts should be available for a sufficient period in order to allow access\r\nseekers and providers to plan medium and long term investments. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, sophisticated\r\nvirtual access products that require a higher level of investment by access\r\nseekers and allow them a greater level of control and differentiation,\r\nparticularly by providing access at a more local level, are key to creating the\r\nconditions for sustainable competition across the internal market. Hence, these\r\nkey wholesale access products to next-generation access (NGA) networks should\r\nalso be harmonised to facilitate cross-border investment. Such virtual\r\nbroadband access products should be designed to have equivalent functionalities\r\nto physical unbundling, in order to broaden the range of potential wholesale\r\nremedies available for consideration by national regulatory authorities under\r\nthe proportionality assessment pursuant to Directive 2002/19/EC.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirdly, it is also\r\nnecessary to harmonise a wholesale access product for terminating segments of\r\nleased lines with enhanced interfaces, in order to enable cross-border\r\nprovision of mission-critical connectivity services for the most demanding\r\nbusiness users.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a context of progressive\r\nmigration to 'all IP networks', the lack of availability of connectivity\r\nproducts based on the IP protocol for different classes of services with\r\nassured service quality that enable communication paths across network domains\r\nand across network borders, both within and between Member States, hinders the\r\ndevelopment of applications that rely on access to other networks, thus\r\nlimiting technological innovation. Moreover, this situation prevents the\r\ndiffusion on a wider scale of efficiencies which are associated with the\r\nmanagement and provision of IP-based networks and connectivity products with an\r\nassured service quality level, in particular enhanced security, reliability and\r\nflexibility, cost-effectiveness and faster provisioning, which benefit network\r\noperators, service providers and end users. A harmonised approach to the design\r\nand availability of these products is therefore necessary, on reasonable terms\r\nincluding, where requested, the possibility of cross-supply by the electronic\r\ncommunications undertakings concerned. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The establishment of\r\nEuropean virtual broadband access products under this Regulation should be\r\nreflected in the assessment by national regulatory authorities of the most\r\nappropriate access remedies to the networks of operators designated as having\r\nsignificant market power, while avoiding over-regulation through the\r\nunnecessary multiplication of wholesale access products, whether imposed\r\npursuant to market analysis or provided under other conditions. In particular,\r\nthe introduction of the European virtual access products should not, in and of\r\nitself, lead to an increase in the number of regulated access products imposed\r\non a given operator. Moreover, the need for national regulatory authorities,\r\nfollowing the adoption of this Regulation, to assess whether a European virtual\r\nbroadband access product should be imposed instead of existing wholesale access\r\nremedies, and to assess the appropriateness of imposing a European virtual\r\nbroadband access product in the context of future market reviews where they\r\nfind significant market power, should not affect their responsibility to\r\nidentify the most appropriate and proportionate remedy to address the\r\nidentified competition problem in accordance with Article 16 of Directive\r\n2002/21/EC.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interests of\r\nregulatory predictability, key elements of evolving decisional practice under\r\nthe current legal framework which affect the conditions under which wholesale\r\naccess products, including European virtual broadband access products, are made\r\navailable for NGA networks, should also be reflected in the legislation. These\r\nshould include provisions reflecting the importance, for the analysis of\r\nwholesale access markets and in particular of whether there is a need for price\r\ncontrols on such access to NGA networks, of the relationship between\r\ncompetitive constraints from alternative fixed and wireless infrastructures,\r\neffective guarantees of non-discriminatory access, and the existing level of\r\ncompetition in terms of price, choice and quality at retail level. The latter\r\nconsideration ultimately determines the benefits to end users. For example, in\r\nthe conduct of their case-by-case assessment pursuant to Article 16 of\r\nDirective 2002/21/EC and without prejudice to the assessment of significant\r\nmarket power and the application of EU competition rules, national regulatory\r\nauthorities may consider that in the presence of two fixed NGA networks, market\r\nconditions are competitive enough to be able to drive network upgrades and to\r\nevolve towards the provision of ultra-fast services, which is one important\r\nparameter of retail competition. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is to be expected that\r\nintensified competition in a single market will lead to a reduction over time\r\nin sector-specific regulation based on market analysis. Indeed, one of the\r\nresults of completing the Single Market should be a greater tendency towards\r\neffective competition on relevant markets, with ex post application of\r\ncompetition law increasingly being seen as sufficient to ensure market\r\nfunctioning. In order to ensure legal clarity and predictability of regulatory\r\napproaches across borders, clear and binding criteria should be provided on how\r\nto assess whether a given market still justifies the imposition of ex-ante\r\nregulatory obligations, by reference to the durability of bottlenecks and the\r\nprospects of competition, in particular infrastructure-based competition, and\r\nthe conditions of competition at retail level on parameters such as price,\r\nchoice and quality, which are ultimately what is relevant to end users and to\r\nthe global competitiveness of the EU economy. This should underpin successive\r\nreviews of the list of markets susceptible to ex ante regulation and\r\nhelp national regulators to focus their efforts where competition is not yet\r\neffective and to do so in a convergent manner. The establishment of a true\r\nsingle market for electronic communications may in addition affect the\r\ngeographical scope of markets, for the purposes of both sector-specific\r\nregulation based on competition principles and the application of competition\r\nlaw itself. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disparities in the national\r\nimplementation of sector-specific end-user protection rules create significant\r\nbarriers to the single digital market, in particular in the form of increased compliance\r\ncosts for providers of electronic communications to the public wishing to offer\r\nservices across Member States. Moreover, fragmentation and uncertainty as to\r\nthe level of protection granted in different Member States undermines\r\nend-users' trust and dissuades them from purchasing electronic communications\r\nservices abroad. In order to achieve the Union's objective to remove barriers\r\nto the internal market it is necessary to replace existing, divergent national\r\nlegal measures with a single and fully harmonised set of sector-specific rules\r\nwhich create a high common level of end-user protection. Such full\r\nharmonisation of the legal provisions should not prevent providers of\r\nelectronic communications to the public from offering end-users contractual arrangements\r\nwhich go beyond that level of protection.\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As this Regulation\r\nharmonises only certain sector-specific rules, it should be without prejudice\r\nto the general consumer protection rules, as established by Union acts and\r\nnational legislation implementing them.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the provisions in\r\nChapters 4 and 5 of this Regulation refer to end-users, such provisions should\r\napply not only to consumers but also to other categories of end-users,\r\nprimarily micro enterprises. At their individual request, end-users other than\r\nconsumers should be able to agree, by individual contract, to deviate from\r\ncertain provisions.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The completion of the\r\nsingle market for electronic communications also requires the removal of\r\nbarriers for end-users to have access to electronic communications services\r\nacross the Union. Public authorities should therefore not raise or maintain\r\nobstacles to the cross-border purchase of such services. Providers of\r\nelectronic communications to the public should not deny or restrict access or\r\ndiscriminate against end-users on the basis of their nationality or Member State of residence. Differentiation should, however, be possible on the basis of\r\nobjectively justifiable differences in costs, risks and market conditions such\r\nas demand variations and pricing by competitors. \n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Very significant price\r\ndifferences continue to prevail, both for fixed and mobile communications,\r\nbetween domestic voice and SMS communications and those terminating in another Member State. While there are substantial variations between countries, operators and\r\ntariff packages, and between mobile and fixed services, this continues to\r\naffect more vulnerable customer groups and to pose barriers to seamless\r\ncommunication within the Union. This occurs in spite of a very significant\r\nreduction, and convergence in absolute terms, of termination rates in the\r\ndifferent Member States, and low prices on transit markets. Moreover, the\r\ntransition to an \"all-IP\" electronic communications environment\r\nshould in due course bring additional cost reductions. Any significant retail\r\ntariff differences between domestic fixed long-distance communications which\r\nare communications other than those within one local area identified by a\r\ngeographic area code in the national numbering plan, and fixed communications\r\nterminating in another Member State, should therefore be justified by reference\r\nto objective criteria. Retail tariffs for international mobile communications\r\nshould not exceed the euro-voice and euro-SMS tariffs for regulated roaming\r\ncalls and SMS messages, respectively, provided for in Regulation (EU) No\r\n531/2012 unless justified by reference to objective criteria. Such criteria may\r\ninclude additional costs and a reasonable related margin. Other objective\r\nfactors may include differences in related price elasticity and the easy\r\navailability to all end users of alternative tariffs from providers of\r\nelectronic communications to the public which offer cross-border communications\r\nwithin the Union at little or no extra charge, or of information society services\r\nwith comparable functionalities, provided that end users are actively informed\r\nof such alternatives by their providers. \n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The internet has developed\r\nover the past decades as an open platform for innovation with low access\r\nbarriers for end-users, content and application providers and internet service\r\nproviders. The existing regulatory framework aims at promoting the ability of\r\nend-users to access and distribute information or run applications and services\r\nof their choice. Recently, however, the report of the Body of European\r\nRegulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) on traffic management\r\npractices published in May 2012 and a study, commissioned by the Executive\r\nAgency for Consumers and Health and published in December 2012, on the functioning\r\nof the market of internet access and provision from a consumer perspective,\r\nshowed that a significant number of end-users are affected by traffic\r\nmanagement practices which block or slow down specific applications. These\r\ntendencies require clear rules at the Union level to maintain the open internet\r\nand to avoid fragmentation of the single market resulting from individual\r\nMember States' measures.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The freedom of end-users to\r\naccess and distribute information and lawful content, run applications and use\r\nservices of their choice is subject to the respect of Union and compatible\r\nnational law. This Regulation defines the limits for any restrictions to this\r\nfreedom by providers of electronic communications to the public but is without\r\nprejudice to other Union legislation, including copyright rules and Directive\r\n2000/31/EC. \n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In an open internet,\r\nproviders of electronic communications to the public should, within\r\ncontractually agreed limits on data volumes and speeds for internet access services,\r\nnot block, slow down, degrade or discriminate against specific content,\r\napplications or services or specific classes thereof except for a limited\r\nnumber of reasonable traffic management measures. Such measures should be\r\ntransparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory. Reasonable traffic\r\nmanagement encompasses prevention or impediment of serious crimes, including\r\nvoluntary actions of providers to prevent access to and distribution of child\r\npornography. Minimising the effects of network congestion should be considered\r\nreasonable provided that network congestion occurs only temporarily or in\r\nexceptional circumstances.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume-based tariffs should\r\nbe considered compatible with the principle of an open internet as long as they\r\nallow end-users to choose the tariff corresponding to their normal data\r\nconsumption based on transparent information about the conditions and\r\nimplications of such choice. At the same time, such tariffs should enable\r\nproviders of electronic communications to the public to better adapt network\r\ncapacities to expected data volumes. It is essential that end-users are fully\r\ninformed before agreeing to any data volume or speed limitations and the\r\ntariffs applicable, that they can continuously monitor their consumption and\r\neasily acquire extensions of the available data volumes if desired. \n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is also end-user\r\ndemand for services and applications requiring an enhanced level of assured\r\nservice quality offered by providers of electronic communications to the public\r\nor by content, applications or service providers. Such services may comprise\r\ninter alia broadcasting via Internet Protocol (IP-TV), video-conferencing and\r\ncertain health applications. End-users should therefore also be free to\r\nconclude agreements on the provision of specialised services with an enhanced\r\nquality of service with either providers of electronic communications to the\r\npublic or providers of content, applications or services.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, there is\r\ndemand on the part of content, applications and services providers, for the\r\nprovision of transmission services based on flexible quality parameters,\r\nincluding lower levels of priority for traffic which is not time-sensitive. The\r\npossibility for content, applications and service providers to negotiate such\r\nflexible quality of service levels with providers of electronic communications\r\nto the public is necessary for the provision of specialised services and is\r\nexpected to play an important role in the development of new services such as\r\nmachine-to-machine (M2M) communications. At the same time such arrangements\r\nshould allow providers of electronic communications to the public to better\r\nbalance traffic and prevent network congestion. Providers of content,\r\napplications and services and providers of electronic communications to the public\r\nshould therefore be free to conclude specialised services agreements on defined\r\nlevels of quality of service as long as such agreements do not substantially\r\nimpair the general quality of internet access services. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National regulatory\r\nauthorities play an essential role in ensuring that end-users are effectively\r\nable to exercise this freedom to avail of open internet access. To this end\r\nnational regulatory authorities should have monitoring and reporting\r\nobligations, and ensure compliance of providers of electronic communications to\r\nthe public and the availability of non-discriminatory internet access services\r\nof high quality which are not impaired by specialised services. In their\r\nassessment of a possible general impairment of internet access services,\r\nnational regulatory authorities should take account of quality parameters such\r\nas timing and reliability parameters (latency, jitter, packet loss), levels and\r\neffects of congestion in the network, actual versus advertised speeds,\r\nperformance of internet access services compared with specialised services, and\r\nquality as perceived by end-users. National regulatory authorities should be\r\nempowered to impose minimum quality of service requirements on all or\r\nindividual providers of electronic communications to the public if this is\r\nnecessary to prevent general impairment/degradation of the quality of service\r\nof internet access services. \n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to ensure\r\nbetter transparency and comparability of prices, tariffs, terms and conditions,\r\nand quality of service parameters including those specific to the provision of internet\r\naccess services, should increase the ability of end-users to optimise their\r\nselection of providers and thus benefit fully from competition.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 End-users should be\r\nadequately informed of the price and the type of service offered before they\r\npurchase a service. This information should also be provided immediately prior\r\nto connection of the call when a call to a specific number or service is\r\nsubject to particular pricing conditions, such as calls to premium rate\r\nservices which are often subject to a special rate. Where such an obligation is\r\ndisproportionate in view of the duration and cost of the tariff information for\r\nthe service provider compared to the average call duration and the cost risk to\r\nwhich the end-user is exposed, national regulatory authorities may grant a\r\nderogation. End-users should also be informed if a free-phone number is subject\r\nto additional charges. \n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Providers of electronic\r\ncommunications to the public should inform end-users adequately inter alia\r\non their services and tariffs, quality of service parameters, access to\r\nemergency services and any limitation, and the choice of services and products\r\ndesigned for disabled consumers. This information should be provided in a clear\r\nand transparent manner and be specific to the Member States where the services\r\nare provided, and in the event of any change, be updated. Providers should be\r\nexempted from such information requirements as regards those offers which are\r\nindividually negotiated.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Availability of comparable\r\ninformation on products and services is paramount to the ability of end-users\r\nto make an independent evaluation of offers. Experience shows that availability\r\nof reliable and comparable information increases end-user confidence in the use\r\nof services and enhances the willingness to exercise their choice. \n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contracts are an important\r\nmeans of giving end-users a high level of transparency of information and legal\r\ncertainty. Providers of electronic communications to the public should give\r\nend-users clear and comprehensible information on all essential elements of the\r\ncontract before the end-user is bound by the contract. The information should\r\nbe mandatory and not be altered except by subsequent agreement of the end-user\r\nand the provider. The Commission and several national regulatory authorities\r\nrecently found considerable discrepancies between the advertised speed of internet\r\naccess services and the speed actually available to end-users. Providers of\r\nelectronic communications to the public should therefore inform end-users,\r\nprior to the conclusion of the contract, of the speed and other quality of\r\nservice parameters which they can realistically deliver at the end-user's main\r\nlocation. \n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to terminal\r\nequipment, contracts should specify any restrictions imposed by the provider on\r\nthe use of the equipment, for example by way of \u2018SIM-locking\u2019 mobile devices,\r\nand any charges due on termination of the contract prior to the agreed expiry\r\ndate. No charges should be due after expiry of the agreed contract duration.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to avoid bill\r\nshocks, end-users should be able to define maximum financial limits for the\r\ncharges related to their usage of calls and internet access services. This\r\nfacility should be available free of charge, with an appropriate notification\r\nthat can be consulted again subsequently, when the limit is being approached.\r\nUpon reaching the maximum limit, end-users should no longer receive or be\r\ncharged for those services unless they specifically request the continued\r\nprovision as agreed with the provider.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience from Member\r\nStates and from a recent study commissioned by the Executive Agency for\r\nConsumers and Health has shown that long contract periods and automatic or\r\ntacit extensions of contracts constitute significant obstacles to changing a\r\nprovider. It is thus desirable that end-users should be able to terminate,\r\nwithout incurring any costs, a contract six months after its conclusion. In\r\nsuch a case, end-users may be requested to compensate their providers for the\r\nresidual value of subsidised terminal equipment or for the pro rata temporis\r\nvalue of any other promotions. Contracts which have been tacitly extended\r\nshould be subject to termination with a one-month notice period. \n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any significant changes to\r\nthe contractual conditions imposed by providers of electronic communications\r\nservices to the public to the detriment of the end-user, for example in\r\nrelation to charges, tariffs, data volume limitations, data speeds, coverage,\r\nor the processing of personal data, should be considered as giving rise to the\r\nright of the end-user to terminate the contract without incurring any costs.\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bundles comprising\r\nelectronic communications and other services such as linear broadcasting have\r\nbecome increasingly widespread and are an important element of competition.\r\nWhere divergent contractual rules on contract termination and switching apply\r\nto the different services composing such bundles, end-users are effectively\r\nprevented from switching to competitive offers for the entire bundle or parts\r\nof it. The provisions of this Regulation regarding contract termination and\r\nswitching should, therefore, apply to all elements of such a bundle.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take full\r\nadvantage of the competitive environment, end-users should be able to make\r\ninformed choices and switch providers when it is in their interests. End-users\r\nshould therefore be able to switch without being hindered by legal, technical\r\nor procedural obstacles, including contractual conditions and charges. Number\r\nportability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition.\r\nIt should be implemented within a minimum delay so that the number is\r\neffectively activated within one working day of concluding an agreement to port\r\na number. Settlement of outstanding bills should not be a condition for\r\nexecution of a porting request. \n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to support the\r\nprovision of one-stop-shops and to facilitate a seamless switching experience\r\nfor end-users, the switching process should be led by the receiving provider of\r\nelectronic communications to the public. The transferring provider of\r\nelectronic communications to the public should not delay or hamper the\r\nswitching process. Automated processes should be used as widely as possible and\r\na high level of protection of personal data should be ensured. Availability of\r\ntransparent, accurate and timely information on switching should increase the\r\nend-users' confidence in switching and make them more willing to engage\r\nactively in the competitive process.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contracts with transferring\r\nproviders of electronic communications to the public should be cancelled\r\nautomatically after switching without any additional steps being required from\r\nend-users. In the case of pre-paid services any credit balance which has not\r\nbeen spent should be refunded to the switching consumer.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 End-users need to\r\nexperience continuity when changing important identifiers such as email\r\naddresses. To this end, and to ensure that email communications are not lost,\r\nend-users should be given the opportunity to opt, free of charge, for an email\r\nforwarding facility offered by the transferring internet access service\r\nprovider in cases where the end-user has an email address provided by the\r\ntransferring provider. \n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competent national\r\nauthorities may prescribe the global processes of porting numbers and\r\nswitching, taking into account technological development and the need to ensure\r\na swift, efficient and consumer-friendly switching process. Competent national\r\nauthorities should be able to impose proportionate measures to protect\r\nend-users adequately throughout the switching process including appropriate\r\nsanctions that are necessary to minimise risks of abuse or delays and of\r\nend-users being switched to another provider without their consent. They should\r\nalso be able to set an automatic compensation mechanism for end-users in such\r\ninstances.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National regulatory\r\nauthorities should be able to take effective action to monitor and secure\r\ncompliance with the provisions of this Regulation, including the power to\r\nimpose effective financial or administrative penalties in the event of any\r\nbreach thereof. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to take account of\r\nmarket and technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\r\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\r\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of adapting the Annexes. It is of\r\nparticular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations\r\nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when\r\npreparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely\r\nand appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament\r\nand to the Council.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing\r\npowers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the decision requiring\r\nMember States to adapt their plans for compliance with a common timetable for\r\ngranting rights of use and allowing actual use. \n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The implementing powers\r\nrelating to the harmonisation and coordination of authorisation of radio\r\nspectrum, characteristics of small-area wireless access points, coordination\r\nbetween Member States regarding allocation of radio spectrum, more detailed\r\ntechnical and methodological rules concerning European virtual access products\r\nand the safeguarding of internet access and of reasonable traffic management\r\nand quality of service, should be exercised in accordance with\r\nRegulation (EU) No182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.[25]\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure\r\nconsistency between the objective and the measures needed to complete the\r\nsingle market for electronic communications pursuant to this Regulation and\r\nsome specific existing legislative provisions and to reflect key elements of\r\nevolving decisional practice, Directive 2002/21/EC, the Directives 2002/20/EC\r\nand 2002/22/EC and Regulation No 531/2012 should be amended. This includes\r\nmaking provision for Directive 2002/21/EC and the related Directives to be read\r\nin conjunction with this Regulation, the introduction of strengthened powers of\r\nthe Commission in order to ensure consistency of remedies imposed on European\r\nelectronic communications providers having significant market power in the\r\ncontext of the European consultation mechanism, harmonisation of the criteria\r\nadopted in assessing the definition and competitiveness of relevant markets,\r\nthe adaptation of the notification system under Directive 2002/20/EC in view of\r\nthe single EU authorisation as well as the repeal of provisions on minimum\r\nharmonisation of end-users rights provided in Directive 2002/22/EC made\r\nredundant by the full harmonisation provided in this Regulation. \n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mobile communications\r\nmarket remains fragmented in the Union, with no mobile network covering all\r\nMember States. As a consequence, in order to provide mobile communications\r\nservices to their domestic customers travelling within the Union, roaming\r\nproviders have to purchase wholesale roaming services from operators in a\r\nvisited Member State. These wholesale charges constitute an important\r\nimpediment to providing roaming services at price levels corresponding to\r\ndomestic mobile services. Therefore further measures should be adopted to\r\nfacilitate lowering these charges. Commercial or technical agreements among\r\nroaming providers which allow a virtual extension of their network coverage\r\nacross the Union provide a means to internalise wholesale costs. To provide\r\nappropriate incentives, certain regulatory obligations laid down in Regulation\r\n(EC) No 531/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council[26] should be adapted. In\r\nparticular, when roaming providers, through their own networks or through\r\nbilateral or multilateral roaming agreements ensure that all customers in the\r\nUnion are offered by default roaming tariffs at the level of domestic tariffs,\r\nthe obligation of domestic providers to enable their customers to access voice,\r\nSMS and data roaming services of any alternative roaming provider should not\r\napply to such providers, subject to a transitional period where such access has\r\nalready been granted. \n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bilateral or multilateral \u00a0roaming\r\nagreements can allow a mobile operator to treat roaming by its domestic\r\ncustomers on the networks of partners as being to a significant degree equivalent\r\nto providing services to such customers on its own networks, with consequential\r\neffects on its retail pricing for such virtual on-net coverage across the\r\nUnion. Such an arrangement at the wholesale level could allow the development\r\nof new roaming products and therefore increase choice and competition at retail\r\nlevel. \n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Digital Agenda for Europe and Regulation No 531/2012 establish the policy objective that the difference\r\nbetween roaming and domestic tariffs should approach zero. In practical terms,\r\nthis requires that consumers falling into any of the broad observable\r\ncategories of domestic consumption, identified by reference to a party's various domestic\r\nretail packages, should be in a position to confidently\r\nreplicate the typical domestic consumption pattern associated with their\r\nrespective domestic retail packages while periodically travelling within the\r\nUnion, without additional costs to those incurred in a domestic setting. Such\r\nbroad categories may be identified from current commercial practice by\r\nreference, for example, to the differentiation in domestic retail packages\r\nbetween pre-paid and post-paid customers; GSM-only packages (i.e. voice, SMS);\r\npackages adapted for different volumes of consumption; packages for business\r\nand consumer use respectively; retail packages with prices per unit consumed\r\nand those which provide \"buckets\" of units (e.g. voice minutes,\r\nmegabytes of data) for a standard fee, irrespective of actual consumption. The\r\ndiversity of retail tariff plans and packages available to customers in\r\ndomestic mobile markets across the Union accommodates varying user demands\r\nassociated with a competitive market. That flexibility in domestic markets\r\nshould also be reflected in the intra-Union roaming environment, while bearing\r\nin mind that the need of roaming providers for wholesale inputs from\r\nindependent network operators in different Member States may still justify the\r\nimposition of limits by reference to reasonable use if domestic tariffs are\r\napplied to such roaming consumption. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While it is in the first\r\nplace for roaming providers to assess themselves the reasonable character of\r\nthe volumes of roaming voice calls, SMS and data to be covered at domestic\r\nrates under their various retail packages, national regulatory authorities should\r\nsupervise the application by roaming providers of such reasonable use limits\r\nand ensure that they are specifically defined by reference to detailed\r\nquantified information in the contracts in terms which are clear and\r\ntransparent to customers. In so doing, national regulatory authorities should\r\ntake utmost account of relevant guidance from BEREC. In its guidance, BEREC\r\nshould identify various usage patterns substantiated by the underlying voice,\r\ndata and SMS usage trends at the Union level, and the evolution of expectations\r\nas regards in particular wireless data consumption. \n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the\r\nsignificant reduction in mobile termination rates throughout the Union in the recent past should now allow the elimination of additional roaming charges for\r\nincoming calls.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide\r\nstability and strategic leadership to BEREC activities, BEREC Board of\r\nRegulators should be represented by a full-time Chairperson appointed by the\r\nBoard of Regulators, on the basis of merit, skills, knowledge of electronic\r\ncommunication market participants and markets, and of experience relevant to\r\nsupervision and regulation, following an open selection procedure organised and\r\nmanaged by the Board of Regulators assisted by the Commission. For the\r\ndesignation of the first Chairperson of the Board of Regulators, the Commission\r\nshould, inter alia, draw up a shortlist of candidates on the basis of merit,\r\nskills, knowledge of electronic communication market participants and markets,\r\nand of experience relevant to supervision and regulation. For the subsequent\r\ndesignations, the opportunity of having a shortlist drawn up by the Commission\r\nshould be reviewed in a report to be established pursuant to this Regulation.\r\nThe Office of BEREC should therefore\r\ncomprise the Chairperson of the Board of Regulators, a Management Committee and\r\nan Administrative Manager. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directives 2002/20/EC,\r\n2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1211/2009 and (EU) No\r\n531/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission may always\r\nseek BEREC's opinion in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009, when it\r\nconsiders it necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this\r\nRegulation. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\r\nfundamental rights and observes the rights and principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably Article 8 (the\r\nprotection of personal data), Article 11 (freedom of expression and\r\ninformation), Article 16 (freedom to conduct a business), Article 21\r\n(non-discrimination) and Article 38 (consumer protection).\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objective of this\r\nRegulation, namely to establishes the regulatory principles and detailed rules\r\nnecessary to complete a European single market for electronic communications,\r\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by\r\nreason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union\r\nmay adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out\r\nin Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle\r\nof proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, \nHAVE ADOPTED\r\nTHIS REGULATION:\nChapter I \r\nGeneral provisions \nArticle 1 \u2013 Objective and scope\n1.

The national\r\nregulatory authority in the host Member State shall take utmost account of the\r\nopinion issued by the national regulatory authority of the home Member State when deciding the dispute. \n7. European electronic communications providers who, at the\r\ndate of entry into force of this Regulation, have the right to provide\r\nelectronic communications networks and services in more than one Member State\r\nshall submit the notification provided for in Article 4 at the latest by 1 July\r\n2016.\nArticle 4 - Notification procedure for\r\nEuropean electronic communications providers\n1. A European electronic communications provider shall\r\nsubmit a single notification in accordance with this Regulation to the national\r\nregulatory authority of the home Member State, before beginning activity in at\r\nleast one Member State.\n2. The notification shall contain a declaration of the\r\nprovision or the intention to commence the provision of electronic\r\ncommunications networks and services and shall be accompanied by the following\r\ninformation only: \n(a) the name of the\r\nprovider, his legal status and form, registration number, where the provider is\r\nregistered in trade or other similar public register, the geographical address\r\nof the main establishment, a contact person, a short description of the\r\nnetworks or services provided or intended to be provided, including\r\nidentification of the home Member State; \n(b) the host Member\r\nState(s) where the services and the networks are provided or intended to be\r\nprovided directly or by subsidiaries and, in the latter case, the name, his\r\nlegal status and form, geographical address, registration number, where the\r\nprovider is registered in trade or other similar public register in the host\r\nMember State, and contact point of any subsidiary concerned and the respective\r\noperating areas. Where a subsidiary is controlled\r\njointly by two or more electronic communications providers with their main\r\nestablishments in different Member States the subsidiary shall indicate the\r\nrelevant home Member State among those of the parent companies for the purpose\r\nof this Regulation and shall be notified by the parent company of that home Member State accordingly. \nThe notification shall be submitted in the language or\r\nlanguages applicable in the home Member State and in any host Member State.\n3. Any change to the information submitted in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 2 shall be made available to the national regulatory authority\r\nof the home Member State within one month following the change. In the event\r\nthat the change to be notified concerns the intention to provide electronic\r\ncommunications networks or services in a host Member State that is not covered\r\nby a previous notification, the European electronic communications provider may\r\nbegin activity in that host Member State upon notification. \n4. Non-compliance with the notification requirement laid\r\ndown in this Article shall constitute a breach of the common conditions\r\napplicable to the European electronic communications provider in the home Member State. \n5. The national regulatory authority of the home Member State shall forward the information received in accordance with paragraph 2 and any\r\nchange to that information in accordance with paragraph 3 to the national\r\nregulatory authorities of the concerned host Member States and to the BEREC\r\nOffice within one week following reception of such information or any change.\nThe BEREC Office shall maintain a publicly accessible\r\nregistry of notifications made in accordance with this Regulation.\n6. At the request of a European electronic communications\r\nprovider, the national regulatory authority of the home Member State shall issue a declaration in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2002/20/EC,\r\nspecifying that the undertaking in question is subject to the single EU\r\nauthorisation.\n7. In the event that one or more national regulatory\r\nauthorities in different Member States consider that the identification of the\r\nhome Member State in a notification made in accordance with paragraph 2 or any\r\nchange to the provided information made available in accordance with paragraph\r\n3 does not correspond or no longer corresponds to the\r\nmain establishment of the undertaking pursuant\r\nto this Regulation, it shall refer the issue to the\r\nCommission, substantiating the grounds on which it bases its assessment. A copy\r\nof the referral shall be communicated to the BEREC Office for information. The\r\nCommission, having given the relevant European electronic communications\r\nprovider and the national regulatory authority of the disputed home Member State the opportunity to express their views, shall issue a decision determining the\r\nhome Member State of the undertaking in question pursuant to this Regulation\r\nwithin three months following the referral of the issue. \nArticle 5 \u2013Compliance with the single EU\r\nauthorisation \n1. The national regulatory authority of each concerned Member State shall monitor and ensure, in accordance with its\r\nnational legislation implementing the procedures provided for in Article 10 of\r\nDirective 2002/20/EC, that European electronic\r\ncommunications providers comply with the rules and conditions applicable in its\r\nterritory in accordance with Article 3. \n2. The national regulatory authority of a host Member State shall transmit to the national regulatory authority of the home Member State any relevant information concerning individual measures adopted in relation to a\r\nEuropean electronic communications provider with a view to ensuring compliance\r\nwith the rules and conditions applicable in its territory in accordance with\r\nArticle 3. \nArticle 6 \u2013 Suspension and withdrawal of\r\nthe rights to provide electronic communications of European electronic\r\ncommunications providers \n1. Without prejudice to measures concerning suspension or\r\nwithdrawal of rights of use for spectrum or numbers granted by any concerned\r\nMember State and interim measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 3, only\r\nthe national regulatory authority of the home Member State may suspend or\r\nwithdraw the rights of a European electronic communications provider to provide\r\nelectronic communications networks and services in the whole Union or part\r\nthereof in accordance with national legislation implementing Article 10(5) of\r\nDirective 2002/20/EC. \n2. In cases of serious or repeated breaches of the rules\r\nand conditions applicable in a host Member State in accordance with Article 3,\r\nwhere measures aimed at ensuring compliance taken by the national regulatory\r\nauthority in the host Member State in accordance with Article 5 have failed, it\r\nshall inform the national regulatory authority in the home Member State and\r\nrequest that it adopts the measures provided for in paragraph 1. \n3. Until a final decision on a request submitted in\r\naccordance with paragraph 2 is adopted by the national regulatory authority of\r\nthe home Member State, the national regulatory authority of the host Member\r\nState may take urgent interim measures in accordance with national legislation\r\nimplementing Article 10(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC where it has evidence of a\r\nbreach of the rules and conditions applicable in its territory in accordance\r\nwith Article 3. By way of derogation from the three months time-limit provided\r\nfor in Article 10(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC, such interim measures may be\r\nvalid until the national regulatory authority of the home Member State adopts a final decision. \nThe Commission, BEREC and the national regulatory\r\nauthorities of the home Member State and other host Member States shall be\r\ninformed of the interim measure adopted in due time.\n4. Where the national regulatory authority of the home\r\nMember State considers taking a decision to suspend or withdraw rights of a\r\nEuropean electronic communications provider in accordance with paragraph 1\r\neither on its own initiative or at the request of the national regulatory\r\nauthority of a host Member State, it shall notify its intention to the national\r\nregulatory authorities of any host Member State affected by such a decision.\r\nThe national regulatory authority of a host Member State may deliver an opinion\r\nwithin one month.\n5. Taking utmost account of any opinion of the national\r\nregulatory authority of the host Member States concerned, the national\r\nregulatory authority of the home Member State shall adopt a final decision and\r\nshall communicate it to the Commission, BEREC and the national regulatory\r\nauthorities of the host Member States affected by such a decision within one\r\nweek after its adoption.\n6. Where the national regulatory authority of the home\r\nMember State has decided to suspend or withdraw rights of a European electronic\r\ncommunications provider in accordance with paragraph 1, the national regulatory authority of any host Member\r\nState concerned shall take appropriate measures to prevent the European\r\nelectronic communications provider from further providing services or networks\r\nconcerned by this decision within its territory. \nArticle 7 \u2013 Coordination of enforcement\r\nmeasures \n1. When applying Article 6, the national regulatory\r\nauthority of the home Member State shall take supervisory or enforcement measures\r\nrelated to an electronic communications service or network provided in another\r\nMember State or which has caused damage in another Member State with the same\r\ndiligence as if the electronic communications service or network concerned was\r\nprovided in the home Member State.\n2. The Member States shall ensure that within their\r\nterritories it is possible to serve the legal documents relating to measures\r\ntaken in accordance with Articles 5 and 6.\nChapter\r\nIII \r\nEuropean inputs\nSection 1 - Coordination of use of radio spectrum within\r\nthe single market\nArticle 8 \u2013 Scope of application and\r\ngeneral provisions \n1. This section shall apply to harmonised\r\nradio spectrum for wireless broadband communications.\n2. This\r\nsection shall be without prejudice to the right of the Member States to benefit\r\nfrom fees imposed to ensure the optimal use of radio spectrum resources in\r\naccordance with Article 13 of Directive 2002/20/EC and to organise and use their radio spectrum for\r\npublic order, public security and defence.\n3. In the exercise of powers conferred in this section, the\r\nCommission shall take utmost account of any relevant opinion issued by the\r\nRadio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) established by Commission Decision\r\n2002/622/EC[28].\nArticle 9 \u2013 Radio Spectrum use for\r\nwireless broadband communications: regulatory principles\n1. The national competent authorities for radio spectrum shall\r\ncontribute to the development of a wireless space where investment and\r\ncompetitive conditions for high-speed wireless broadband communications\r\nconverge and which enables planning and provision of integrated\r\nmulti-territorial networks and services and economies of scale, thereby\r\nfostering innovation, economic growth and the long-term benefit of end users.\nThe national competent authorities shall refrain from\r\napplying procedures or imposing conditions for the use of radio spectrum which\r\nmay unduly impede European electronic communications providers from providing\r\nintegrated electronic communications networks and services in several Member\r\nStates or throughout the Union.\n2. The national competent authorities shall apply the least\r\nonerous authorisation system possible for allowing the use of radio spectrum,\r\non the basis of objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate\r\ncriteria, in such a way as to maximise flexibility and efficiency in radio\r\nspectrum use and to promote comparable conditions throughout the Union for\r\nintegrated multi-territorial investments and operations by European electronic\r\ncommunications providers.\n3. When establishing authorisation conditions and\r\nprocedures for the use of radio spectrum, national competent authorities shall\r\nhave regard in particular to equal treatment between existing and potential\r\noperators and between European electronic communications providers and other undertakings.\n4. Without prejudice to paragraph 5, the national competent\r\nauthorities shall take into account and, where necessary, shall reconcile the\r\nfollowing regulatory principles when establishing authorisation conditions and\r\nprocedures for rights of use for radio spectrum:\na) maximisation of end user interest, including end users'\r\ninterest in both efficient long-term investment and innovation in wireless\r\nnetworks and services and in effective competition;\nb) ensuring the most efficient use and effective management\r\nof radio spectrum;\nc) ensuring predictable and comparable conditions to enable\r\nthe planning of network investments and services on a multi-territorial basis\r\nand the achievement of scale economies;\nd) ensuring the necessity and proportionality of the\r\nconditions imposed, including through an objective assessment of whether it is\r\njustified to impose additional conditions which could be in favour of or to the\r\ndetriment of certain operators;\ne) ensuring wide territorial coverage of high-speed wireless\r\nbroadband networks and a high level of penetration and consumption of related\r\nservices.\n5. When considering whether to impose any of the specific\r\nconditions in respect of rights of use of radio spectrum referred to in Article\r\n10, national competent authorities shall have particular regard to the criteria\r\nlaid down in that Article.\nArticle 10 \u2013Relevant criteria to be\r\ntaken in account for use of radio spectrum \n1. When determining the amount and type of radio spectrum to\r\nbe assigned in a given procedure for granting rights of use for radio spectrum,\r\nthe national competent authorities shall have regard to the following:\n(a) the technical characteristics of different available\r\nradio spectrum bands,\n(b) the possible combination in a single procedure of\r\ncomplementary bands; and\n(c) the relevance of coherent portfolios of radio spectrum\r\nrights of use in different Member States to the provision of networks or\r\nservices to the entire Union market or a significant part thereof.\n2. When\r\ndetermining whether to specify any minimum or maximum\r\namount of radio spectrum, which would be defined in respect of a right of use\r\nin a given band or in a combination of complementary bands, national competent\r\nauthorities shall ensure:\n(a) the most efficient use of the radio spectrum in\r\naccordance with Article 9(4)(b), taking into account the characteristics of the\r\nband or bands concerned;\n(b) efficient network investment in accordance with Article\r\n9(4)(a).\nThis paragraph shall be without prejudice to the\r\napplication of paragraph 5 as regards conditions defining maximum amounts of\r\nradio spectrum.\n3. National\r\ncompetent authorities shall ensure that the fees for\r\nrights of use for radio spectrum, if any:\n(a) appropriately reflect the social and economic value of\r\nthe radio spectrum, including beneficial externalities;\n(b) avoid under-utilisation and foster investment in the\r\ncapacity, coverage and quality of networks and services;\n(c) avoid discrimination and ensure equality of opportunity\r\nbetween operators, including between existing and potential operators; \n(d) achieve an optimal distribution between immediate and,\r\nif any, periodic payments, having regard in particular to the need to\r\nincentivise rapid network roll-out and radio spectrum utilisation in accordance\r\nwith Article 9(4)(b) and (e).\nThis paragraph shall be without prejudice to the\r\napplication of paragraph 5 as regards any conditions resulting in\r\ndifferentiated fees between operators which are laid down with a view to\r\npromoting effective competition.\n4. National competent authorities may impose obligations to\r\nreach minimum territorial coverage only when they are necessary and\r\nproportionate, in accordance with Article 9(4)(d), to achieve specific\r\nobjectives of general interest determined at national level. When imposing such\r\nobligations, the national competent authorities shall have regard to the\r\nfollowing:\n(a) any pre-existing coverage of the national territory by\r\nthe relevant services, or by other electronic communications services;\n(b) the minimisation of the number of operators potentially\r\nsubject to such obligations;\n(c) the possibility of burden sharing and reciprocity among\r\nvarious operators, including providers of other electronic communications\r\nservices;\n(d) the investments required to achieve such coverage and\r\nthe need to reflect these in the applicable fees;\n(e) the technical suitability of the relevant bands for\r\nefficient provision of wide territorial coverage.\n5. When determining whether to impose any of the measures to\r\npromote effective competition provided for in Article 5(2) of Decision No\r\n243/2012/EC of the European Parliament and the Council,[29]\r\nnational competent authorities shall base their decision on an objective,\r\nprospective assessment of the following, taking into account market conditions\r\nand available benchmarks:\n(a) whether or not effective competition is likely to be\r\nmaintained or achieved in the absence of such measures, and\n(b) the likely effect of such temporary measures on\r\nexisting and future investments by market operators.\n6. National\r\ncompetent authorities shall determine conditions\r\nunder which undertakings may transfer or lease part or all of their individual\r\nrights to use radio spectrum to other undertakings, including the sharing of\r\nsuch radio spectrum. When determining those conditions, national competent authorities\r\nshall have regard to the following:\n(a) optimisation of efficient radio spectrum use in\r\naccordance with Article 9(4)(b);\n(b) enabling the exploitation of beneficial sharing\r\nopportunities;\n(c) reconciliation of the interests of existing and potential\r\nright-holders;\n(d) creation of a better-functioning, more liquid market\r\nfor access to radio spectrum.\nThis paragraph shall be without prejudice to the\r\napplication of competition rules to undertakings.\n7. National\r\ncompetent authorities shall authorise the sharing of\r\npassive and active infrastructure and the joint roll-out of infrastructure for\r\nwireless broadband communications, taking into account:\n(a) the state of infrastructure-based competition and any\r\nadditional service-based competition;\n(b) the requirements of efficient radio spectrum use;\n(c) increased choice and a higher quality of service for\r\nend users;\n(d) technological innovation.\nThis paragraph shall be without prejudice to the\r\napplication of competition rules to undertakings.\nArticle 11 \u2013 Additional provisions\r\nrelated to conditions for use of radio spectrum\n1. Where the technical conditions for the availability and\r\nefficient use of harmonised radio spectrum for wireless broadband\r\ncommunications make it possible to use the relevant radio spectrum under a\r\ngeneral authorisation regime, national competent authorities shall avoid imposing any additional condition and shall prevent\r\nany alternative use from impeding the effective application of such harmonised\r\nregime.\n2. National\r\ncompetent authorities shall establish authorisation\r\nconditions whereby an individual authorisation or right of use may be revoked\r\nor cancelled in case of persistent failure to use the relevant radio spectrum.\r\nThe revocation or cancellation may be subject to appropriate compensation when\r\nthe failure to use the radio spectrum is due to grounds beyond the control of\r\nthe operator, and is objectively justified.\n3. National\r\ncompetent authorities shall consider the need to establish, in conformity with competition rules, and with a view to\r\nthe timely freeing up or sharing of sufficient harmonised radio spectrum in\r\ncost-efficient bands for high-capacity wireless broadband services:\n(a) appropriate compensation or incentive payments to\r\nexisting users or radio spectrum usage right holders, inter alia through\r\nincorporation in the bidding system or fixed amount for rights of use; or\n(b) incentive payments to be paid by existing users or\r\nradio spectrum usage right holders.\n4. The national\r\ncompetent authorities shall consider the need to fix\r\nappropriate minimum technology performance levels for different bands in\r\naccordance with Article 6(3) of Decision No 243/2012/EC with a view to\r\nimproving spectral efficiency and without prejudice to measures adopted under\r\nDecision No 676/2002.\nWhen fixing those levels, they shall in particular:\n(a) have regard to the cycles of technology development and\r\nof renewal of equipment, in particular terminal equipment; and\n(b) apply the principle of technology neutrality to achieve\r\nthe specified performance level, in accordance with Article 9 of Directive\r\n2002/21/EC.\nArticle 12- Harmonisation of certain\r\nauthorisation conditions relative to wireless broadband communications\n1. National competent authorities shall establish\r\ntimetables for the granting or reassignment of rights of use, or for the\r\nrenewal of those rights under the terms of existing rights, which shall apply\r\nto radio spectrum harmonised for wireless broadband communications.\nThe duration of the rights of use or the dates for\r\nsubsequent renewal shall be set well in advance of the relevant procedure\r\nincluded in the timetable referred to in the first subparagraph. The\r\ntimetables, durations and renewal cycles shall take account of the need for a\r\npredictable investment environment, the effective possibility to release any\r\nrelevant new radio spectrum bands harmonised for wireless broadband\r\ncommunications and of the period for amortisation of related investments under\r\ncompetitive conditions.\n2. In order to ensure a\r\ncoherent implementation of paragraph 1 throughout the Union and in particular\r\nto enable the synchronised availability of wireless services within the Union, the Commission may, by way of implementing acts:\n(a) establish a common timetable for the\r\nUnion as a whole, or timetables appropriate to the circumstances of different\r\ncategories of Member States, the date or dates by which individual rights of\r\nuse for a harmonised band, or a combination of complementary harmonised bands,\r\nshall be granted and actual use of the radio spectrum shall be allowed for exclusive\r\nor shared provision of wireless broadband communications throughout the Union;\n(b) determine a minimum duration for the\r\nrights granted in the harmonised bands;\n(c) determine, in the case of rights which\r\nare not indefinite in character, a synchronised expiry or renewal date for the Union as a whole;\n(d) define the date of expiry of any\r\nexisting rights of use of harmonised bands other than for wireless broadband\r\ncommunications, or, in the case of rights of indefinite duration, the date by\r\nwhich the right of use shall be amended, in order to allow the provision of\r\nwireless broadband communications.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in\r\naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 33(2).\n3. The Commission may also adopt\r\nimplementing acts harmonising the date of expiry or renewal of individual\r\nrights to use radio spectrum for wireless broadband in harmonised bands, which\r\nalready exist at the date of adoption of such acts, with a view to synchronising\r\nthroughout the Union the date for renewal or reassignment of rights of use for\r\nsuch bands, including possible synchronisation with the date of renewal or\r\nreassignment of other bands harmonised by implementing measures adopted in\r\naccordance with paragraph 2 or with this paragraph. Those implementing acts\r\nshall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in\r\nArticle 33(2).\nWhere implementing acts provided for in\r\nthis paragraph define a harmonised date for renewal or reassignment of rights\r\nof use of radio spectrum which falls after the date of expiry or renewal of any\r\nexisting individual rights of use of such radio spectrum in any of the Member\r\nStates, the national competent authorities shall extend the existing rights\r\nuntil the harmonised date under the same previously applicable substantive\r\nauthorisation conditions, including any applicable periodic fees. \nWhere the extension period granted in\r\naccordance with the second subparagraph is significant in comparison with the\r\noriginal duration of the rights of use, national competent authorities may\r\nsubject the extension of rights to any adaptations of the previously applicable\r\nauthorisation conditions which are necessary in the light of the changed\r\ncircumstances, including the imposition of additional fees. These additional fees\r\nshall be based on an application pro rata temporis of any initial fee\r\nfor the original rights of use which was expressly calculated by reference to\r\nthe originally foreseen duration.\nThe implementing acts provided for in this\r\nparagraph shall not require the shortening of the duration of existing rights\r\nof use in any Member State except in accordance with Article 14(2) of Directive\r\n2002/20/EC and shall not apply to existing rights of indefinite duration.\nWhere the Commission adopts an implementing\r\nact pursuant to paragraph 2, it may apply the provisions of this paragraph mutatis\r\nmutandis to any rights of use of the harmonised band concerned for wireless\r\nbroadband.\n4. When adopting the implementing acts\r\nprovided for in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall have regard to:\n(a) the regulatory principles set out in\r\nArticle 9 ;\n(b) objective variations across the Union\r\nin the needs for additional radio spectrum for wireless broadband provision,\r\nwhile taking into account common radio spectrum needs for integrated networks\r\ncovering several Member States;\n(c) the predictability of operating\r\nconditions for existing radio spectrum users;\n(d) the take-up, development and investment\r\ncycles of successive generations of wireless broadband technologies;\n(e) end-user demand for high-capacity\r\nwireless broadband communications.\nIn determining timetables for different\r\ncategories of Member States which have not already granted individual rights of\r\nuse and allowed actual use of the harmonised band in question, the Commission\r\nshall have due regard to any submissions made by Member States regarding the\r\nway radio spectrum rights have been historically granted, the grounds of\r\nrestriction provided for in in Article 9(3) and (4) of Directive 2002/21/EC,\r\nthe possible need to vacate the band in question, the effects on competition or\r\ngeographical or technical constraints, taking into account the effect on the\r\ninternal market. The Commission shall ensure that implementation is not unduly\r\ndeferred and that any variation in timetables between Member States does not\r\nresult in undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between\r\nMember States.\n5. Paragraph 2 shall be without prejudice\r\nto the right of the Member States to grant rights of use for and to allow\r\nactual use of a harmonised band before the adoption of an implementing act in\r\nrespect of that band, subject to compliance with the second subparagraph of\r\nthis paragraph, or in advance of the harmonised date established by an\r\nimplementing act for that band.\nWhere national competent authorities grant\r\nrights of use in a harmonised band before the adoption of an implementing act\r\nin respect of that band, they shall define the conditions of such grant, and in\r\nparticular those relative to duration, in such a way that beneficiaries of the\r\nrights of use are made aware of the possibility that the Commission would adopt\r\nimplementing acts in accordance with paragraph 2 establishing a minimum\r\nduration of such rights or a synchronised expiry or renewal cycle for the Union\r\nas a whole. This subparagraph shall not apply to the grant of rights of\r\nindefinite duration.\n6. For the harmonised bands for which a\r\ncommon timetable for granting rights of use and allowing actual use has been\r\nestablished in an implementing act adopted in accordance with paragraph 2,\r\nnational competent authorities shall provide timely and sufficiently detailed\r\ninformation to the Commission on their plans to ensure compliance. The\r\nCommission may adopt implementing acts defining the format and procedures for\r\nthe provision of such information. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in\r\naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 33(2).\nWhere the Commission considers, upon\r\nreviewing such detailed plans provided by a Member State, that it is unlikely\r\nthat the Member State in question will be able to comply with the timetable\r\napplicable to it, the Commission may adopt a decision by means of implementing\r\nact requiring that Member State to adapt its plans in an appropriate way to\r\nensure such compliance. \nArticle 13 \u2013Coordination of\r\nauthorisation procedures and conditions for the use of radio spectrum for\r\nwireless broadband in the internal market \n1. Where a national competent authority\r\nintends to subject the use of radio spectrum to a general authorisation or to grant\r\nindividual rights of use of radio spectrum, or to amend rights and obligations\r\nin relation to the use of radio spectrum in accordance with Article 14 of\r\nDirective 2002/20/EC, it shall make accessible its draft measure, together with\r\nthe reasoning thereof, simultaneously to the Commission and the competent\r\nauthorities for radio spectrum of the other Member States, upon completion of\r\nthe public consultation referred to in Article 6 of Directive 2002/21/EC, if\r\napplicable, and in any event only at a stage in its preparation which allows it\r\nto provide to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member\r\nStates sufficient and stable information on all relevant matters.\nThe national competent authority shall\r\nprovide information which shall include at least the following matters, where\r\napplicable:\n(a) the type of authorisation process;\n(b) the timing of the authorisation\r\nprocess;\n(c) the duration of the rights of use;\n(d) the type and amount of radio spectrum\r\navailable, as a whole or to any given undertaking;\n(e) the amount and structure of any fees to\r\nbe paid;\n(f) compensation or incentives regarding\r\nthe vacation or sharing of radio spectrum by existing users;\n(g) coverage obligations;\n(h) wholesale access, national or regional\r\nroaming requirements;\n(i) the reservation of radio spectrum for\r\ncertain types of operators, or the exclusion of certain types of operators;\n(j) conditions related to the assignment,\r\ntransfer or accumulation of rights of use;\n(k) the possibility to use radio spectrum\r\non a shared basis;\n(l) infrastructure sharing;\n(m) minimum technology performance levels; \n(n) restrictions applied in accordance with\r\nArticles 9(3) and 9(4) of Directive 2002/21/EC; \n(o) a revocation or withdrawal of one or\r\nseveral rights of use or an amendment of rights or conditions attached to such\r\nrights which cannot be considered as minor within the meaning of Article 14(1)\r\nof Directive 2002/20/EC.\n2. National competent authorities and the\r\nCommission may make comments to the competent authority concerned within a\r\nperiod of two months. The two-month period shall not be extended.\nWhen assessing the draft measure in\r\naccordance with this Article, the Commission shall have regard in particular\r\nto:\n(a) the provisions of Directives 2002/20/EC\r\nand 2002/21/EC and Decision No. 243/2012/EC;\n(b) the regulatory principles set out in\r\nArticle 9;\n(c) the relevant criteria for certain\r\nspecific conditions set out in Article 10 and the additional provisions set out\r\nin Article 11;\n(d) any implementing act adopted in\r\naccordance with Article 12;\n(e) coherence with recent, pending or\r\nplanned procedures in other Member States, and possible effects on trade\r\nbetween Member States.\nIf, within this period, the Commission\r\nnotifies the competent authority that the draft measure would create a barrier\r\nto the internal market or that it has serious doubts as to its compatibility\r\nwith Union law, the draft measure shall not be adopted for an additional period\r\nof two months. The Commission shall also inform the competent authorities of\r\nthe other Member States of the position it has taken on the draft measure in\r\nsuch a case.\n3. Within the additional two-month period\r\nreferred to in paragraph 2, the Commission and the competent authority\r\nconcerned shall cooperate closely to identify the most appropriate and\r\neffective measure in the light of the criteria referred to in paragraph 2,\r\nwhilst taking due account of the views of market participants and the need to\r\nensure the development of consistent regulatory practice.\n4. At any stage during the procedure, the\r\ncompetent authority may amend or withdraw its draft measure taking utmost\r\naccount of the Commission's notification referred to in paragraph 2.\n5. Within the additional two-month period\r\nreferred in paragraph 2, the Commission may:\na) present a draft decision to the\r\nCommunications Committee requiring the competent authority concerned to\r\nwithdraw the draft measure. The draft decision shall be accompanied by a\r\ndetailed and objective analysis of why the Commission considers that the draft\r\nmeasure should not be adopted as notified, together where necessary with\r\nspecific proposals for amending the draft measure; or\nb) take a decision changing its position in\r\nrelation to the draft measure concerned.\n6. Where the Commission has not presented a\r\ndraft decision referred to in paragraph 5(a) or takes a decision referred to in\r\nparagraph 5(b), the competent authority concerned may adopt the draft measure.\nWhere the Commission has presented a draft\r\ndecision referred to in accordance with paragraph 5(a), the draft measure shall\r\nnot be adopted by the competent authority for a period not exceeding six months\r\nfrom the notification sent to the competent authority pursuant to paragraph 2.\nThe Commission may decide to change its\r\nposition in relation to the draft measure concerned at any stage of the\r\nprocedure, including after the submission of a draft decision to the\r\nCommunications Committee.\n7. The Commission shall adopt any decision\r\nrequiring the competent authority to withdraw its draft measure by means of\r\nimplementing acts. Those implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with\r\nthe examination procedure referred to in Article 33(2).\n8. Where the Commission has adopted a\r\ndecision in accordance with paragraph 7, the competent authority shall amend or\r\nwithdraw the draft measure within six months of the date of notification of the\r\nCommission's decision. When the draft measure is amended, the competent\r\nauthority shall undertake a public consultation where appropriate, and shall\r\nmake the amended draft measure accessible to the Commission in accordance with\r\nparagraph 1.\n9. The competent authority concerned shall\r\ntake the utmost account of any comments of competent authorities of the other\r\nMember States and the Commission and may, except in cases covered by the third\r\nsub-paragraph of paragraph 2, by the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 6 and by\r\nparagraph 7, adopt the resulting draft measure and where it does so, shall\r\ncommunicate it to the Commission.\n10. The competent authority shall inform\r\nthe Commission of the results of the procedure to which its measure relates\r\nonce that procedure has been concluded.\nArticle 14 \u2013 Access to radio local area\r\nnetworks \n1. National competent authorities shall\r\nallow the provision of access through radio local area networks to the network\r\nof a provider of electronic communications to the public as well as the use of\r\nthe harmonised radio spectrum for such provision, subject only to general\r\nauthorisation.\n2. National competent authorities shall not\r\nprevent providers of electronic communications to the public from allowing\r\naccess for the public to their networks, through radio local area networks,\r\nwhich may be located at an end user's premises, subject to compliance with the\r\ngeneral authorisation conditions and the prior informed agreement of the end\r\nuser.\n3. Providers of electronic communications\r\nto the public shall not unilaterally restrict:\na) the right of end users to accede to\r\nradio local area networks of their choice provided by third parties;\nb) the right of end users to allow\r\nreciprocally or more generally access to the networks of such providers by\r\nother end users through radio local area networks, including on the basis of\r\nthird-party initiatives which federate and make publicly accessible the radio\r\nlocal area networks of different end users.\n4. National competent authorities shall not\r\nrestrict the right of end users to allow reciprocally or more generally access\r\nto their radio local area networks by other end users, including on the basis\r\nof third-party initiatives which federate and make publicly accessible the\r\nradio local area networks of different end users.\n5. National competent authorities shall not\r\nrestrict the provision of public access to radio local area networks:\n(a) by public authorities on or in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of premises occupied by such public authorities, when it is\r\nancillary to the public services provided on such premises;\n(b) by initiatives of non-governmental\r\norganisations or public authorities to federate and make reciprocally or more\r\ngenerally accessible the radio local area networks of different end\r\nusers, including, where applicable, the radio local area networks to which\r\npublic access is provided in accordance with sub-point (a).\n6. An undertaking, public authority or\r\nother end user shall not be deemed to be a provider of electronic\r\ncommunications to the public solely by virtue of the provision of public access\r\nto radio local area networks, where such provision is not commercial in\r\ncharacter, or is merely ancillary to another commercial activity or public\r\nservice which is not dependent on the conveyance of signals on such networks.\nArticle 15 \u2013Deployment and operation of\r\nsmall-area wireless access points \n1. National competent authorities shall\r\nallow the deployment, connection and operation of unobtrusive small-area wireless\r\naccess points under the general authorisation regime and shall not unduly\r\nrestrict that deployment, connection or operation through individual town\r\nplanning permits or in any other way, whenever such use is in compliance with\r\nimplementing measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 2.\nThis paragraph is without prejudice to the\r\nauthorisation regime for the radio spectrum employed to operate small-area\r\nwireless access points.\n2. For the purposes of the uniform\r\nimplementation of the general authorisation regime for the deployment,\r\nconnection and operation of small-area wireless access points pursuant to\r\nparagraph 1, the Commission may, by means of an implementing act, specify\r\ntechnical characteristics for the design, deployment and operation of\r\nsmall-area wireless access points, compliance with which shall ensure their\r\nunobtrusive character when in use in different local contexts. The Commission\r\nshall specify those technical characteristics by reference to the maximum size,\r\npower and electromagnetic characteristics, as well as the visual impact, of the\r\ndeployed small-area wireless access points. Those technical characteristics for\r\nuse of small-area wireless access points shall at a minimum comply with the\r\nrequirements of Directive 2013/35/EU[30]\r\nand with the thresholds defined in Council Recommendation No 1999/519/EC.[31]\nThe characteristics specified in order for\r\nthe deployment, connection and operation of small-area wireless access point to\r\nbenefit from paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the essential\r\nrequirements of Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\r\nrelative to the placing on the market of such products.[32]\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in\r\naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 33(2).\nArticle 16 \u2013 Radio spectrum coordination\r\namong Member States\n1. Without prejudice to their obligations\r\nunder relevant international agreements including ITU Radio Regulations, the\r\nnational competent authorities shall ensure that the use of radio spectrum is\r\norganised on their territory, and shall in particular take all necessary radio\r\nspectrum allocation or assignment measures, in order that no other Member State\r\nis impeded from allowing on its territory the use of a specific harmonised band\r\nin accordance with Union legislation.\n2. Member States shall cooperate with each\r\nother in the cross-border coordination of the use of radio spectrum in order to\r\nensure compliance with paragraph 1 and to ensure that no Member State is denied equitable access to radio spectrum.\n3. Any concerned Member State may invite the Radio Spectrum Policy Group to use its good offices to assist it and any\r\nother Member State in complying with this Article.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing\r\nmeasures to ensure that coordinated outcomes respect the requirement of\r\nequitable access to radio spectrum among the relevant Member States, to resolve\r\nany practical inconsistencies between distinct coordinated outcomes between\r\ndifferent Member States, or to ensure the enforcement of coordinated solutions\r\nunder Union law.Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the\r\nexamination procedure referred to in Article 33(2).\nSection 2 \u2013\r\nEuropean virtual access products \nArticle 17 \u2013 European virtual broadband\r\naccess product \n1. The provision of a virtual broadband access product\r\nimposed in accordance with Article 8 and 12 of Directive 2002/19/EC shall be\r\nconsidered as the provision of a European virtual broadband access product if\r\nit is supplied in accordance with the minimum parameters listed in one of the\r\nOffers set out in Annex I and cumulatively meets the following substantive\r\nrequirements: \n(a) ability to be offered as a high quality\r\nproduct anywhere in the Union; \n(b) maximum degree of network and service\r\ninteroperability and non-discriminatory network management between operators\r\nconsistently with network topology; \n(c) capacity to serve end-users on\r\ncompetitive terms;\n(d) cost-effectiveness, taking into account\r\nthe capacity to be implemented on existing and newly built networks and to\r\nco-exist with other access products that may be provided on the same network\r\ninfrastructure; \n(e) operational effectiveness, in\r\nparticular in respect of limiting to the extent possible implementation\r\nobstacles and deployment costs for virtual broadband access providers and\r\nvirtual broadband access seekers; \n(f) respect of the rules on protection of\r\nprivacy, personal data, security and integrity of networks and transparency in\r\nconformity with Union law.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission shall be empowered to adopt\r\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 32 in order to adapt Annex I in light\r\nof market and technological developments, so as to continue to meet the\r\nsubstantive requirements listed in paragraph 1. \nArticle 18 \u2013 Regulatory conditions\r\nrelated to European virtual broadband access product \n1. A national regulatory authority which has previously\r\nimposed on an operator in accordance with Articles 8 and 12 of Directive\r\n2002/19/EC any obligation to provide wholesale access to a next-generation\r\nnetwork shall assess whether it would be appropriate and proportionate to\r\nimpose instead an obligation to supply a European virtual broadband access\r\nproduct which provides at least equivalent functionalities to the currently\r\nimposed wholesale access product. \nNational regulatory authorities referred to in the first\r\nsubparagraph shall conduct the requisite assessment of existing wholesale\r\naccess remedies as soon as possible after the entry into force of this\r\nRegulation, irrespective of the timing of the analysis of relevant markets in\r\naccordance with Article 16(6) of Directive 2002/21/EC.\nWhere a national regulatory authority which has previously\r\nimposed an obligation to provide virtual broadband access considers, following\r\nits assessment pursuant to the first sub-paragraph, that a European virtual broadband\r\naccess product is not appropriate in the specific circumstances, it shall\r\nprovide a reasoned explanation in its draft measure in accordance with the\r\nprocedure set out in Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2002/21/EC.\n2. Where a national regulatory authority intends to impose\r\non an operator an obligation to provide wholesale access to a next-generation\r\nnetwork in accordance with Articles 8 and 12 of Directive 2002/19/EC, it shall\r\nassess in particular, in addition to the factors set out in Article 12(2) of\r\nthat Directive, the respective merits of imposing\n(i) a passive wholesale input, such as physical unbundled\r\naccess to the local loop or the sub-loop;\n(ii) a non-physical or virtual wholesale input offering\r\nequivalent functionalities, and in particular a European virtual broadband\r\naccess product that satisfies the substantive requirements and parameters set\r\nout in Article 17(1) and in Annex I, point 1, of this Regulation. \n3. By way of derogation from Article 12(3) of Directive\r\n2002/19/EC, where a national regulatory authority intends to impose on an\r\noperator an obligation to provide virtual broadband access in accordance with\r\nArticles 8 and 12 of that Directive, it shall impose an obligation to supply a\r\nEuropean virtual broadband access product which has the most relevant\r\nfunctionalities to meet the regulatory need identified in its assessment. Where\r\na national regulatory authority considers that a European virtual broadband\r\naccess product would not be appropriate in the specific circumstances, it shall\r\nprovide a reasoned explanation in its draft measure in accordance with the\r\nprocedure set out in Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2002/21/EC.\n4. When assessing pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 whether\r\nto impose a European virtual broadband access product instead of any other\r\npossible wholesale access product, the national regulatory authority shall have\r\nregard to the interest in convergent regulatory conditions throughout the Union\r\nfor wholesale access remedies, the current and prospective state of\r\ninfrastructure-based competition and the evolution of market conditions towards\r\nprovision of competing next-generation networks, to investments made\r\nrespectively by the operator designated as having significant market power and\r\nby access-seekers, and to the amortisation period for such investments.\nThe national regulatory authority shall set a transitional\r\nperiod for replacing an existing wholesale access product by a European virtual\r\nbroadband access product if necessary.\n5. By way of derogation from Article 9(3) of Directive\r\n2002/19/EC, where an operator has obligations under Articles 8 and 12 of that\r\nDirective to provide a European virtual broadband access product, national\r\nregulatory authorities shall ensure the publication of a reference offer\r\ncontaining at least the elements set out in Annex I, point 1, point 2 or point\r\n3, as the case may be.\n6. By way of derogation from Article 16(3) of Directive\r\n2002/21/EC, a national regulatory authority shall not impose a mandatory period\r\nof notice before withdrawing a previously imposed obligation to offer a\r\nEuropean virtual broadband access product that satisfies the substantive\r\nrequirements and parameters set out in Article 17(1) and in Annex I, point 2 of\r\nthis Regulation, if the operator concerned voluntarily commits to make such\r\nproduct available at the request of third parties on fair and reasonable terms\r\nfor a further period of three years.\n7. Where a national regulatory authority is considering, in\r\nthe context of an assessment pursuant to paragraphs 2 or 3, whether or not to\r\nimpose or maintain price controls in accordance with Article 13 of Directive\r\n2002/19/EC for wholesale access to next-generation networks, whether by means\r\nof one of the European virtual broadband access products or otherwise, it shall\r\nconsider the state of competition in respect of the prices, choice and quality\r\nof products offered at retail level. It shall have regard to the effectiveness\r\nof protection against discrimination at wholesale level and to the state of\r\ninfrastructure-based competition from other fixed line or wireless networks,\r\ngiving due weight to the role of existing infrastructure-based competition\r\nbetween next-generation networks in driving further improvements in quality for\r\nend users, in order to determine whether price controls for wholesale access\r\nwould not be necessary or proportionate in the specific case. \nArticle 19 \u2013 Assured service quality\r\n(ASQ) connectivity product\n1. Any operator shall have the right to provide a European\r\nASQ connectivity product as specified in paragraph 4.\n2. Any operator shall meet any reasonable request to\r\nprovide a European ASQ connectivity product as specified in paragraph 4\r\nsubmitted in writing by an authorised provider of electronic communications\r\nservices. Any refusal to provide a European ASQ product shall be based on\r\nobjective criteria. The operator shall state the reasons for any refusal within\r\none month from the written request. \nIt shall be deemed to be an objective ground of refusal\r\nthat the party requesting the supply of a European ASQ connectivity product is\r\nunable or unwilling to make available, whether within the Union or in third\r\ncountries, a European ASQ connectivity product to the requested party on\r\nreasonable terms, if the latter so requests. \n3. Where the request is refused or agreement on specific\r\nterms and conditions, including price, has not been reached within two months\r\nfrom the written request, either party is entitled to refer the issue to the\r\nrelevant national regulatory authority pursuant to Article 20 of Directive\r\n2002/21/EC. In such a case, Article 3(6) of this Regulation may apply.\n4. The provision of a connectivity product shall be\r\nconsidered as the provision of a European ASQ connectivity product if it is\r\nsupplied in accordance with the minimum parameters listed in Annex II and cumulatively\r\nmeets the following substantive requirements:\n(a) ability to be offered as a high quality product\r\nanywhere in the Union; \n(b) enabling service providers to meet the needs of their\r\nend-users;\n(c) cost-effectiveness, taking into account existing solutions\r\nthat may be provided on the same networks; \n(d) operational effectiveness, in particular in respect of\r\nlimiting to the extent possible implementation obstacles and deployment costs\r\nfor customers; and\n(e) ensuring that the rules on protection of privacy,\r\npersonal data, security and integrity of networks and transparency in\r\naccordance with Union law are respected.\n5. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated\r\nacts in accordance with Article 32 in order to adapt Annex II in light of\r\nmarket and technological developments, so as to continue to meet the\r\nsubstantive requirements listed in paragraph 4. \nArticle 20 \u2013 Measures relating to\r\nEuropean access products \n1. The Commission shall adopt by 1 January 2016\r\nimplementing acts laying down uniform technical and methodological rules for\r\nthe implementation of a European virtual broadband access product within the\r\nmeaning of Article 17 and of Annex I, point 1, in accordance with the criteria\r\nand parameters specified therein and in order to ensure the equivalence of the\r\nfunctionality of such a virtual wholesale access product to next-generation\r\nnetworks with that of a physical unbundled access product. Those implementing\r\nacts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to\r\nin Article 33(2).\n2. The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down\r\nuniform technical and methodological rules for the implementation of one or\r\nmore of the European access products within the meaning of Articles 17 and 19\r\nand of Annex I, points 2 and 3, and Annex II, in accordance with the respective\r\ncriteria and parameters specified therein. Those implementing acts shall be\r\nadopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article\r\n33(2).\nChapter IV \r\nHarmonised rights of end-users\nArticle 21 \u2013 Elimination of restrictions\r\nand discrimination\n1. The freedom of end-users to use public electronic\r\ncommunications networks or publicly available electronic communications\r\nservices provided by an undertaking established in another Member State shall not be restricted by public authorities. \n2.

End-users shall have the right to terminate their\r\ncontract without incurring any costs upon notice of changes in the contractual\r\nconditions proposed by the provider of electronic communications to the public\r\nunless the proposed changes are exclusively to the benefit of the end-user.\r\nProviders shall give end-users adequate notice, not shorter than one month, of\r\nany such change, and shall inform them at the same time of their right to\r\nterminate their contract without incurring any costs if they do not accept the\r\nnew conditions. Paragraph 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n5. Any significant and non-temporary discrepancy between\r\nthe actual performance regarding speed or other quality parameters and the\r\nperformance indicated by the provider of electronic communications to the\r\npublic in accordance with Article 26 shall be considered as non-conformity of\r\nperformance for the purpose of determining the end-user's remedies in\r\naccordance with national law. \n6. A subscription to additional services provided by the\r\nsame provider of electronic communications to the public shall not re-start the\r\ninitial contract period unless the price of the additional service(s)\r\nsignificantly exceeds that of the initial services or the additional services\r\nare offered at a special promotional price linked to the renewal of the\r\nexisting contract. \n7. Providers of electronic communications to the public\r\nshall apply conditions and procedures for contract termination which do not\r\nraise obstacles to or disincentives against changing service provider.\nArticle 29 - Bundled offers\nIf a bundle of services offered to consumers comprises at\r\nleast a connection to an electronic communications network or one electronic\r\ncommunications service, Articles 28 and 30 of this Regulation shall apply to\r\nall elements of the bundle.\nChapter V \r\nFacilitating change of providers \nArticle 30 - Switching and portability\r\nof numbers \n1. All end-users with numbers from a national telephone\r\nnumbering plan who so request shall have the right to retain their number(s)\r\nindependently of the provider of electronic communications to the public providing\r\nthe service in accordance with Part C of Annex I to Directive 2002/22/EC,\r\nprovided the provider is an electronic communications provider in the Member\r\nState to which the national numbering plan relates or is a European electronic\r\ncommunications provider which has notified to the competent regulatory\r\nauthority of the home Member State the fact that it provides or intends to\r\nprovide such services in the Member State to which the national numbering plan\r\nrelates. \n2. Pricing between providers of electronic communications\r\nto the public related to the provision of number portability shall be\r\ncost-oriented, and direct charges to end-users, if any, shall not act as a\r\ndisincentive for end-users against changing provider.\n3. Porting of numbers and their activation shall be carried\r\nout within the shortest possible time. For end-users who have concluded an\r\nagreement to port a number to a new provider that number shall be activated\r\nwithin one working day from the conclusion of such agreement. Loss of service\r\nduring the process of porting, if any, shall not exceed one working day. \n4. The receiving provider of electronic communications to\r\nthe public shall lead the switching and porting process. End-users shall\r\nreceive adequate information on switching before and during the switching\r\nprocess, and also immediately after it is concluded. End-users shall not be\r\nswitched to another provider against their will. \n5. The end-users\u2019 contracts with transferring providers of\r\nelectronic communications to the public shall be terminated automatically after\r\nconclusion of the switch. Transferring providers of electronic communications\r\nto the public shall refund any remaining credit to the consumers using pre-paid\r\nservices. \n6. Providers of electronic communications to the public which\r\ndelay or abuse switching, including by not making available information\r\nnecessary for porting in a timely manner, shall be obliged to compensate\r\nend-users who are exposed to such delay or abuse.\n7. In the event that an end-user switching to a new provider\r\nof internet access services has an email address provided by the transferring\r\nprovider, the latter shall, upon request by the end-user, forward to any email\r\naddress indicated by the end-user, free of charge, all email communications\r\naddressed to the end-user\u2019s previous email address for a period of 12 months.\r\nThis email forwarding service shall include an automatic response message to\r\nall email senders alerting them about the end-user's new email address. The\r\nend-user shall have the option of requesting that the new email address should\r\nnot be disclosed in the automatic response message. \nFollowing the initial 12-month period, the transferring\r\nprovider of electronic communications to the public shall give the end-user an\r\noption to extend the period for email forwarding, at a charge if required. The\r\ntransferring provider of electronic communications to the public shall not\r\nallocate the end-users\u2019 initial email address to another end-user before a\r\nperiod of two years following contract termination, and in any case during the\r\nperiod for which the email forwarding has been extended. \n8. The competent national authorities may establish the\r\nglobal processes of switching and porting, including provision of appropriate\r\nsanctions on providers and compensations for end-users. They shall take into\r\naccount necessary end-user protection throughout the switching process and the\r\nneed to ensure efficiency of such process.\nChapter VI \r\nOrganisational and final provisions \nArticle 31 - Penalties\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties\r\napplicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and shall take\r\nall measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties\r\nprovided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall\r\nnotify those provisions to the Commission by 1 July 2016 at the latest and\r\nshall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.\nWith regard to European electronic communications\r\nproviders, penalties shall be imposed in accordance with Chapter II regarding\r\nthe respective competences of national regulatory authorities in the home and\r\nhost Member States.\nArticle 32 \u2013 Delegation of powers \n1. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the\r\nCommission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article. \n2. The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in\r\nArticles 17(2) and 19(5) shall be conferred on the Commission for an\r\nindeterminate period of time from the [date entry into force of the Regulation]\r\n\n3. The delegation of power referred to in Articles 17(2)\r\nand 19(5) may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the\r\nCouncil.

As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission\r\nshall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. \n5. A delegated act adopted pursuant to Articles 17(2) and\r\n19(5) shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by\r\nthe European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of\r\nnotification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if,\r\nbefore the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have\r\nboth informed the Commission that they will not object. That period\r\nshall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or\r\nthe Council.\nArticle 33 \u2013 Committee procedure\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Communications\r\nCommittee established by Article 22(1) of Directive 2002/21/EC. That committee\r\nshall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. \n2. Where\r\nreference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\r\nshall apply.\nArticle 34 \u2013 Amendments to Directive\r\n2002/20/EC\nIn Article 3(2), the second subparagraph is deleted.\nArticle 35 \u2013 Amendments to Directive\r\n2002/21/EC\nDirective 2002/21/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 1, the following paragraph 6 is added:\n\u02bbThis Directive and the Specific Directives shall be\r\ninterpreted and applied in conjunction with the provisions of Regulation No\r\n[XX/2014].\u02bc\n(2) Article 7a is amended as follows: \n\u2013                        \r\n(a) in paragraph 1, the first sub-paragraph is\r\nreplaced by the following:\n\u02bb1. Where an intended measure covered by Article 7(3)\r\naims at imposing, amending or withdrawing an obligation on an operator in\r\napplication of Article 16 of this Directive in conjunction with Article 5 and\r\nArticles 9 to 13 of Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive), and Article 17 of\r\nDirective 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive), the Commission may, within the\r\nperiod of one month provided for by Article 7(3) of this Directive, notify the\r\nnational regulatory authority concerned and BEREC of its reasons for\r\nconsidering that the draft measure would create a barrier to the single market\r\nor its serious doubts as to its compatibility with Union law, taking into\r\naccount as appropriate any Recommendation adopted pursuant to Article 19(1) of\r\nthis Directive concerning the harmonised application of specific provisions of\r\nthis Directive and the Specific Directives. In such a case, the draft measure\r\nshall not be adopted for a further three months following the Commission's\r\nnotification.\u02bc\n\u2013                        \r\n(b) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u02bb2. Within the three-month period referred to in\r\nparagraph 1, the Commission, BEREC and the national regulatory authority\r\nconcerned shall cooperate closely to identify the most appropriate and\r\neffective measure in the light of the objectives laid down in Article 8, whilst\r\ntaking due account of the views of market participants and the need to ensure\r\nthe development of consistent regulatory practice. When the intended measure\r\naims at imposing, amending or withdrawing an obligation on a European\r\nelectronic communications provider within the meaning of Regulation [XXX/2014]\r\nin a host Member State, the national regulatory authority of the home Member State may also participate in the cooperation process.\u02bc\n\u2013                        \r\n(c) in paragraph 5 the following point (aa) is\r\ninserted: \n\u02bb(aa) take a\r\ndecision requiring the national regulatory authority concerned to withdraw the\r\ndraft measure, together with specific proposals for amending it, when the\r\nintended measure aims at imposing, amending or withdrawing an obligation on a\r\nEuropean electronic communications provider within the meaning of Regulation\r\n[XXX/2014].\u02bc\n\u2013                        \r\n(d) in paragraph 6 the following sub-paragraph\r\nis added: \n\u02bbArticle 7(6) shall apply in the cases where the\r\nCommission takes a decision in accordance with paragraph 5 point (aa)\u02bc. \n(3) Article 15\r\nis amended as follows:\n\u2013                        \r\n(a) the following sub-paragraph is inserted\r\nbetween the first and second sub-paragraphs of paragraph 1:\n\u02bbIn\r\nassessing whether a given market has characteristics which may justify the\r\nimposition of ex-ante regulatory obligations, and therefore has to be included\r\nin the Recommendation, the Commission shall have regard in particular to the\r\nneed for convergent regulation throughout the Union, to the need to promote\r\nefficient investment and innovation in the interests of end users and of the\r\nglobal competitiveness of the Union economy, and to the relevance of the market\r\nconcerned, alongside other factors such as existing infrastructure-based\r\ncompetition at retail level, to competition on\r\nthe prices, choice and quality of products offered to end users. The Commission\r\nshall consider all relevant competitive constraints, irrespective of whether\r\nthe networks, services or applications which impose such constraints are deemed\r\nto be electronic communications networks, electronic communications services,\r\nor other types of service or application which are comparable from the\r\nperspective of the end-user, in order to determine whether, as a general matter\r\nin the Union or a significant part thereof, the following three criteria are\r\ncumulatively met:\n(a) the\r\npresence of high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory barriers to\r\nentry;\n(b) the\r\nmarket structure does not tend towards effective competition within the\r\nrelevant time horizon, having regard to the state of infrastructure-based and\r\nother competition behind the barriers to entry;\n(c)\r\ncompetition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified\r\nmarket failure(s).\u02bc\n\u2013                        \r\n(b) in paragraph 3 the following sub-paragraph\r\nis added:\n\u02bbIn the\r\nexercise of its powers pursuant to Article 7, the Commission shall verify\r\nwhether the three criteria set out in paragraph 1 are cumulatively met when\r\nreviewing the compatibility with Union law of a draft measure that concludes:\n(a) that a\r\ngiven market that is not identified in the Recommendation has characteristics\r\njustifying the imposition of regulatory obligations, in the specific national\r\ncircumstances; or \nb) that a\r\nmarket identified in the Recommendation does not require regulation in the\r\nspecific national circumstances.\u02bc\n(4) The first\r\nparagraph of Article 19 is amended as follows:\n\u02bbWithout\r\nprejudice to Article 9 of this Directive and Articles 6 and 8 of Directive\r\n2002/20/EC (Authorisation Directive), where the Commission finds that\r\ndivergences in the implementation by the national regulatory authorities of the\r\nregulatory tasks specified in this Directive, and the Specific\r\nDirectives and Regulation No [XX/2014] may create a barrier to the internal\r\nmarket, the Commission may, taking the utmost account of the opinion of BEREC,\r\nissue a recommendation or a decision on the harmonised application of the\r\nprovisions in this Directive, the Specific Directives and Regulation No\r\n[XX/2014] in order to further the achievement of the objectives set out in\r\nArticle 8.\u02bc\nArticle 36 \u2013 Amendments to Directive\r\n2002/22/EC \n1.

Member States shall maintain in force until 1 July 2016\r\nall measures transposing the provisions referred to in paragraph 1. \nArticle 37 \u2013 Amendments to Regulation\r\n(EU) No 531/2012 \nRegulation (EU) No 531/2012 is\r\namended as follows:\n(1) In Article\r\n1(1), the following third subparagraph is inserted:\n\u02bbThis\r\nRegulation shall apply to roaming services provided in the Union to end users\r\nwhose domestic provider is a provider of electronic communications to the\r\npublic in a Member State.\u02bc\n(2) In Article\r\n2 (2), the following point (r) is inserted:\n\u02bb(r) \"bilateral or multilateral roaming\r\nagreement\" means one or more commercial or technical agreements among\r\nroaming providers that allow the virtual extension of the home network coverage\r\nand the sustainable provision by each roaming provider of regulated retail roaming\r\nservices at the same price level as their respective domestic mobile\r\ncommunications services.\u02bc\n(3) In Article\r\n4, the following paragraph 7 is added:\n\u02bb7.This Article shall not apply to roaming providers\r\nthat provide regulated retail roaming services in accordance with Article 4a.\u02bc\n(4) The\r\nfollowing Article 4a is inserted:\n\u02bbArticle 4a\n1. This Article shall apply to roaming providers which: \n(a) apply, by default and in all their respective retail\r\npackages that include regulated roaming services, the applicable domestic\r\nservice rate to both domestic services and regulated roaming services\r\nthroughout the Union, as if the regulated roaming services were consumed on the\r\nhome network; and\n(b) ensure, whether through their own networks or by virtue\r\nof bilateral or multilateral roaming agreements with other roaming providers,\r\nthat the provisions of point (a) are complied with by at least one roaming\r\nprovider in all Member States. \n2. Paragraphs 1, 6 and 7 shall not preclude the limitation\r\nby a roaming provider of consumption of regulated retail roaming services at\r\nthe applicable domestic service rate by reference to a reasonable use\r\ncriterion. Any reasonable use criterion shall be applied in such a way that\r\nconsumers availing of the roaming provider's various domestic retail packages\r\nare in a position to confidently replicate the typical domestic consumption pattern\r\nassociated with their respective domestic retail packages while periodically\r\ntravelling within the Union. A roaming provider availing of this possibility\r\nshall publish, in accordance with Article 25(1)(b) of Regulation XXX/2014, and\r\ninclude in its contracts, in accordance with Article 26(1)(b) and (c) of that\r\nRegulation, detailed quantified information on how the reasonable use criterion\r\nis applied, by reference to the main pricing, volume or other parameters of the\r\nretail package in question.\nBy 31 December 2014, BEREC shall, after consulting\r\nstakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission, lay down general\r\nguidelines for the application of reasonable use criteria in the retail\r\ncontracts provided by roaming providers availing of this Article. BEREC shall\r\ndevelop such guidelines by reference to the overall objective set out in the\r\nfirst subparagraph, and shall have regard in particular to the evolution of\r\npricing and consumption patterns in the Member States, to the degree of\r\nconvergence of domestic price levels across the Union, to any observable effect\r\nof roaming at domestic service rates on the evolution of such rates, and to the\r\nevolution of wholesale roaming rates for unbalanced traffic between roaming\r\nproviders.\nThe competent national regulatory authority shall monitor\r\nand supervise the application of reasonable use criteria, taking utmost account\r\nof the BEREC general guidelines once they are adopted, and shall ensure that\r\nunreasonable terms are not applied.\n3. Individual end-users served by a roaming provider\r\navailing of this Article may, upon their own request, make a deliberate and\r\nexplicit choice to renounce the benefit of the application to regulated roaming\r\nservices of the applicable domestic service rate under a given retail package\r\nin return for other advantages offered by that provider. The roaming provider\r\nshall remind those end users of the nature of the roaming advantages which\r\nwould thereby be lost. National regulatory authorities shall monitor in\r\nparticular whether roaming providers availing of this Article engage in\r\nbusiness practices which would amount to circumvention of the default regime.\n4. Regulated retail roaming charges laid down in Articles\r\n8, 10 and 13 shall not apply to roaming services offered by a roaming provider\r\navailing of this Article to the extent that these are charged at the level of\r\nthe applicable domestic service rate. \nWhere a roaming provider availing of this Article applies\r\ncharges which are different from the applicable domestic service rate for consumption\r\nof regulated roaming services going beyond reasonable use of such services in\r\naccordance with paragraph 2, or where an individual end user explicitly\r\nrenounces the benefit of domestic service rates for regulated roaming services\r\nin accordance with paragraph 3, the charges for those regulated roaming\r\nservices shall not exceed the retail roaming charges laid down in Articles 8,\r\n10 and 13. \n5. A roaming provider wishing to avail of this Article\r\nshall notify its own declaration and any bilateral or multilateral agreements\r\nby virtue of which it fulfills the conditions of paragraph 1, and any changes\r\nthereto, to the BEREC Office. The notifying roaming provider shall include in\r\nits notification proof of agreement to such notification by any contractual\r\npartners to notified bilateral or multilateral roaming agreements. \n6. In the period from 1 July 2014 until 30 June 2016, this\r\nArticle shall apply to roaming providers which do not fulfill the conditions\r\nset out in paragraph 1, when they respect the following conditions:\n(a) the roaming provider notifies its own declarataion and\r\nany relevant bilateral or multilateral roaming agreements to the BEREC Office\r\nin accordance with paragraph 5, making specific reference to this paragraph;\n(b) the roaming provider ensures, whether through its own\r\nnetworks or by virtue of bilateral or multilateral roaming agreements with\r\nother roaming providers, that the conditions of points (c),(d) and (e) are\r\ncomplied with in at least 17 \u00a0Member States representing 70% of the population of\r\nthe Union;\n(c) the roaming provider and any contractual partners\r\nwithin the meaning of point (b) each undertakes to make available and actively\r\noffer, at the latest as from 1 July 2014, or as from the date of notification,\r\nwhichever is the later, at least one retail package with a tariff option\r\naccording to which the applicable domestic service rate applies to both\r\ndomestic services and regulated roaming services throughout the Union, as if\r\nthose regulated roaming services were consumed on the home network;\n(d) the roaming provider and any contractual partners\r\nwithin the meaning of point (b) each undertakes to make available and actively\r\noffer, at the latest as from 1 July 2015, or as from the date of notification,\r\nwhichever is the later, such tariff options in retail packages which, on 1\r\nJanuary of that year, were used by at least 50% of their respective customer\r\nbase;\n(e) the roaming provider and any contractual partners\r\nwithin the meaning of point (b) each undertakes to comply, at the latest as\r\nfrom 1 July 2016, with paragraph 1(b) in all of their respective retail\r\npackages.\nThe roaming provider availing of this Article and any\r\ncontractual partners within the meaning of point (b) may, as an alternative to\r\nthe undertaking referred to in point (d), undertake, as from 1 July 2015, or as\r\nfrom the date of notification, whichever is the later, that any roaming\r\nsurcharges applied in addition to the applicable domestic service rate in its\r\nvarious retail packages are, in aggregate, no more than 50% of those applicable\r\nin those packages on 1 January 2015, irrespective of whether such surcharges\r\nare calculated on the basis of units such as voice minutes or megabytes, of\r\nperiods such as days or weeks of roaming, or by any other means or combination\r\nthereof. Roaming providers invoking this point shall demonstrate compliance\r\nwith the requirement of a 50% reduction to the national regulatory authority\r\nand shall supply all necessary supporting evidence requested of them. \nWhere the roaming provider availing of this Article notifies\r\nits own declaration and any relevant bilateral or multilateral roaming\r\nagreements to the BEREC Office pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph\r\nand thereby falls under this paragraph, the notifying roaming provider and any\r\ncontractual partners within the meaning of point (b) shall each be bound to\r\ncomply with their respective undertakings in accordance with points (c), (d)\r\nand (e) of the first subparagraph, including any alternative undertaking to\r\nthat provided for in point (d) of that subparagraph, until at least 1 July\r\n2018.\n7.

By way of exception to paragraph 1, after 1 July 2016,\r\nthis Article shall apply to roaming providers availing of this Article when\r\nthose roaming providers demonstrate that they have sought in good faith to\r\nestablish or extend a bilateral or multilateral roaming agreements on the basis\r\nof fair and reasonable terms in all Member States where they do not yet fulfill\r\nthe requirements of 1 and have been unable to secure any bilateral or\r\nmultilateral roaming agreement with a roaming provider in one or more Member\r\nStates, provided they comply with the minimum coverage referred to in paragraph\r\n6(b) and with all other relevant provisions of this Article. In those cases, roaming\r\nproviders availing of this Article shall continue to seek to establish\r\nreasonable terms for conclusion of a roaming agreement with a roaming provider\r\nfrom any unrepresented Member State.\n10. Where an alternative roaming provider has already been\r\ngranted access to a domestic provider's customers pursuant to Article 4(1) and\r\nhas already made the necessary investments to serve those customers, Article\r\n4(7) shall not apply to such a domestic provider during a transitional period\r\nof three years.
