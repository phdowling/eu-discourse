The Commission had chosen to present its\nproposal under the comitology procedure based on Article 12(5) of the Schengen\nBorder Code[4]\nconsidering the decision as being an additional measure governing border\nsurveillance. \nThe decision was considered to be necessary\nand appropriate to implement the objective of border surveillance, namely to\nprevent unauthorised border crossings. In this regard, it was considered that\nsurveillance not only encompasses the notion of detection but extends to steps\nsuch as intercepting vessels trying to enter the Union unlawfully. The link of\nsearch and rescue to border surveillance was based on actual practice \u2013\nmigrants travelling in unseaworthy vessels are sometimes in a distress\nsituation upon detection. \nThe decision incorporated, within a single\nlegal instrument, existing provisions of EU and international law. The aim was\nto overcome the different interpretations of international maritime law adopted\nby Member States and their diverging practices to ensure the efficiency of sea operations\ncoordinated by the Agency. There was a risk that in a sea operation different\nrules, sometimes even conflicting ones, would apply to the same situation.\nAmidst this legal uncertainty, Member States\u2019 participation in sea operations\ncoordinated by the Agency was low in terms of contributing craft, vessels and\nhuman resources. This, in turn, hindered the effectiveness of the operations\nand undermined efforts of EU solidarity. \nThe decision intended to reinforce the\nprotection of fundamental rights and to guarantee respect for the\nprinciple of non-refoulement in sea operations. Some Member States,\nMembers of the European Parliament, human rights organisations and academics\nhad questioned whether fundamental rights and the rights of refugees were being\nrespected during sea operations coordinated by the Agency, particularly on the\nhigh seas. The decision aimed to address these concerns by establishing a\nnumber of guarantees to ensure the respect of these rights, such as the\nrequirement to inform the intercepted or rescued persons of the place of disembarkation,\nspecial consideration for the needs of vulnerable persons and the requirement\nfor border guards to be trained in relevant provisions of fundamental rights\nand refugee law.\nThe decision\nwas adopted on 26 April 2010 as a Council decision in accordance with the\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny. The European Parliament considered that the\ndecision should have been adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative\nprocedure and not the comitology procedure. Therefore, it brought an action\nbefore the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u2018the Court\u2019) against the\nCouncil requesting the annulment of the decision. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C-355/10:\nEuropean Parliament v. Council[5]\nThe European Parliament considered that the\ndecision exceeded the implementing powers conferred under Article 12(5) of the\nSchengen Borders Code because: (i) it introduced new essential elements into\nthe Schengen Borders Code; (ii) it altered essential elements of the Schengen\nBorders Code; and (iii) it altered the content of Regulation (EC)\nNo 2007/2004.[6]\nThe Council pleaded the inadmissibility of the action, and in the alternative,\nconsidered the action to be without merit. The Commission, as the only\nintervening party, acted in support of the Council.\nThe Court delivered its judgment on 5\nSeptember 2012. It annulled the decision on the first ground insofar as it\nconsidered that the provisions on interception measures, rescue and\ndisembarkation are essential elements to the basic act, namely the Schengen\nBorders Code. It did not examine whether the decision alters essential elements\nof the Schengen Borders Code or whether it alters the content of Regulation\n(EC) No 2007/2004.\nThe Court\ndecided to maintain the effects of the decision until it is replaced by new rules\nwithin a reasonable time.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS\nOF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nWhen assessing the need to carry out an\nimpact assessment, the following considerations were taken into account. \nFirstly, the adoption of Council Decision\n2010/252/EU had been preceded by a significant amount of preparatory work. In\n2005, the Council had requested the Commission to examine the legal framework\napplicable to border surveillance operations at sea and to subsequently prepare\nrules at Union level. In 2007, the Commission presented a study in which it\nanalysed the international legal framework as regards surveillance of the\nexternal sea borders and the obstacles to its effective implementation.[7] In the same year, the\nCommission set up an informal group of experts from Member States, the Agency, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International\nOrganisation for Migration to draw up guidelines for sea\noperations coordinated by the Agency. The results of this informal group were\nused by the Commission as a basis for its draft proposal presented under the\ncomitology procedure.\nSecondly, in view of preparing this\nproposal, the Commission consulted Member States and the Agency through an Expert\nGroup on External Borders to determine to what extent this proposal should\nreflect the content of the decision. In general, Member States considered that\nthis proposal should build upon the decision, keeping its scope limited to sea\noperations coordinated by the Agency, strengthening the provisions on the\nprotection of fundamental rights, clarifying the distinction between interception\nmeasures and rescue, addressing the issue of disembarkation and ensuring\nconsistency with international obligations, while taking into account legal and\njudicial developments at EU and international level.\nThirdly, on annulling Council Decision\n2010/252/EU, the Court required that the decision be replaced within a reasonable\ntime. Although the concept of \u2018reasonable time\u2019 is not defined in the judgment,\nit is understood that in view of possible difficult and lengthy discussions\nbetween the two EU legislators, the Commission should act expeditiously.\nConsequently, it was considered that this\nproposal need not be accompanied by an impact assessment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL\nELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThis proposal is based on Article 77(2)(d) of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. With a view to develop an\nexternal border policy, including ensuring efficient surveillance of the\nexternal borders as set out in Article 77(1), Article 77(2)(d) provides that\nthe European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure, shall adopt \u201cany measure necessary for the gradual\nestablishment of an integrated management system for external borders.\u201d \nThe objective of Union policy in the field\nof the EU external borders is to ensure the efficient monitoring of the\ncrossing of external borders including through border surveillance. The purpose\nof border surveillance is to prevent unauthorised border crossings, to counter\ncross-border criminality and to apprehend or take other measures against those\npersons who have crossed the border in an irregular manner. Border surveillance\nshould be effective in preventing and discouraging persons from circumventing\nthe checks at border crossing points. To this end, border surveillance is not\nlimited to the detection of attempts at irregular border crossing but equally\nextends to steps such as intercepting ships suspected of trying to gain entry\nto the Union without submitting to border checks, as well as arrangements\nintended to address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during\na sea operation and arrangements intended to bring such an operation to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nSince the objectives of the action to be\ntaken, namely the adoption of specific rules for the surveillance of the sea\nborders by border guards operating under the coordination of the Agency, cannot\nbe sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the differences in their\nlaws and practices, and can therefore, by reason of the multinational character\nof the operations, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may\nadopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in\nArticle 5 of the Treaty on European Union.\nIn accordance with the principle of\nproportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this\nRegulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those\nobjectives.\nIt is on the basis of these principles\nthat, as was the case for the decision, this proposal applies only in the\ncontext of operational cooperation coordinated by the Agency and it does not\nconcern surveillance activities carried out by Member States individually or\ncooperating outside that framework.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATION\nThis proposal does not impose any financial\nor administrative burden on the Union. Therefore it has no impact on the Union\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL\nELEMENTS \n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison between this\nproposal and Council Decision 2010/252/EU\nThe scope and content of this proposal are\nsimilar to those of the decision. The changes presented in the proposal when\ncompared to the decision are based on legal and judicial developments, such as\nthe amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004[8] and the judgment of the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights in Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy,[9] on the need to ensure clarity\nas regards the concepts of interception and rescue, and on the practical\nexperiences of Member States and the Agency when implementing the decision. \n5.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Form\nThe choice of legal instrument and the\ndecision-making procedures are different. This is a proposal for a Regulation\naddressed to all Member States in accordance with the Treaties and it is to be\nadopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Its form\nreflects the choice of legal instrument consisting of a preamble (citations and\neighteen recitals) and eleven articles divided into four chapters. It shall be\nbinding in its entirety and directly applicable in Member States. On the other\nhand, the decision had been adopted as an implementing measure using the\nregulatory procedure with scrutiny. It consists of a preamble (citations and\neighteen recitals), two articles and an Annex divided into two parts. Part I of\nthe Annex sets out rules for sea border operations coordinated by the Agency\nwhereas Part II of the Annex consists of non-binding guidelines for search and\nrescue situations and for disembarkation in the context of sea operations\ncoordinated by the Agency.\n5.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content\nThe scope of application of this proposal\nis the same as that of the decision, namely border surveillance operations at\nsea carried out by Member States under the coordination of the Agency (Article\n1). Although in the decision, the concept of \u2018border surveillance\u2019 was\nunderstood as including interception measures and arrangements for rescue arising\nduring border surveillance operations, there was still doubt as to whether\nthese measures did in fact fall under the concept of border surveillance as\ndefined in the Schengen Borders Code. This proposal explicitly covers this\nbroader concept of border surveillance by indicating that border surveillance\nis not limited to the detection of attempts at irregular border crossing but\nequally extends to steps such as interception measures, and arrangements\nintended to address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during\na sea operation and arrangements intended to bring such an operation to a\nsuccessful conclusion (recital 1 and Chapter III).\nWhen revisiting the decision, the\namendments to Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 needed to be taken into\naccount. The Agency is now also entrusted with assisting Member States in\ncircumstances requiring increased technical assistance at the external borders,\ntaking into account that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies\nand rescue at sea. This means that although the Agency neither becomes a search\nand rescue body nor does it take up the functions of a rescue coordination\ncentre, during a sea operation it assists Member States to fulfil their\nobligation under international maritime law to render assistance to persons in\ndistress and this proposal sets out rules on how to deal with these situations\nin a sea operation coordinated by the Agency (recital 2 and Article 9). \nWith the amendments to Regulation (EC)\nNo 2007/2004, the operational plan became a legally binding instrument\nwith regard to all operations coordinated by the Agency and not only as regards\nrapid interventions. The content of the operational plan is listed in Articles\n3a and 8e of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 which also refer specifically to\nsea operations. The rules laid down in this proposal are intended to form part\nof the operational plan drawn up in accordance with Regulation (EC)\nNo 2007/2004, taking into account the requirements for sea operations.\nThe legal and judicial developments\nconcerning the protection of fundamental rights are also taken into account in\nthis proposal. Article 4, which deals with the protection of fundamental rights\nand the principle of non-refoulement in sea operations, addresses concerns\nraised by the European Court of Human Rights in its ruling in Hirsi Jamaa\nand Others v. Italy as regards disembarkation of intercepted or rescued\npersons in third countries, both in terms of relations between Member States\nand third countries, and the obligations of Member States vis-\u00e0-vis the\nindividual. This article concerns the practical implementation of the principle\nof non-refoulement as enshrined in Article 19(2) of the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union. In case of disembarkation in a third\ncountry, the persons intercepted or rescued must be identified and their\npersonal circumstances must be assessed to the extent possible before\ndisembarkation. They must also be informed of the place of disembarkation in an\nappropriate way and they must be given an opportunity to express any reasons\nfor believing that disembarkation in the proposed place would be in violation\nof the principle of non-refoulement. This guarantees that the migrants\nare informed about their situation and the proposed place of disembarkation\nthereby allowing them to express any objections.\nUnder Chapter III, this proposal clearly\ndistinguishes between detection, interception and rescue. As regards\ninterception, this proposal while retaining the same set of measures as in the\ndecision, distinguishes between the measures that may be taken in the\nterritorial sea (Article 6), on the high seas (Article 7) and in the contiguous\nzone[10]\n(Article 8), thus clarifying the conditions under which these measures may be\ntaken and the jurisdictional basis on which action may be taken particularly as\nregards stateless ships. Based on the Protocol against the Smuggling of\nMigrants by Land, Sea and Air, interception of ships on the high seas is now\nclearly linked to the requirement of having a reasonable suspicion that the\nship is engaged in the smuggling of migrants. As in the decision, the exercise\nof jurisdiction on the high seas must always be based on the authorisation of\nthe flag State.\nAs regards search and rescue situations,\nthe text in this proposal remains similar to the decision (Article 9). The\nwording is aligned to that used in the 1979 International Convention on\nMaritime Search and Rescue and the International Aeronautical and Maritime\nSearch and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR). Also, on the basis of these international\ninstruments, the proposal includes criteria as to when a ship is considered to\nbe in a situation of uncertainty (Article 9(3)), alert (Article 9(4)) and distress\n(Article 9(5)) as well as a definition of a rescue coordination centre (Article\n2(12)).\nThis proposal, differently from the\ndecision, addresses the issue of disembarkation in terms of interception and\nrescue (Article 10). As regards interception in the territorial sea or in the\ncontiguous zone, disembarkation takes place in the coastal Member State. As regards interception on the high seas, subject to guaranteeing the protection\nof fundamental rights and the principle of non-refoulement,\ndisembarkation may take place in the third country from which the ship departed.\nIf this is not possible, then disembarkation takes place in the host Member State. \nAs regards disembarkation following a\nrescue operation, this proposal refers to the concept of \u2018place of safety\u2019 as\ndefined in the Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea issued by\nthe International Maritime Organisation,[11]\ntaking into account aspects of fundamental rights[12] (Articles 2(11) and 10(4)),\nand requires Member States to cooperate with the responsible rescue\ncoordination centre to provide a suitable port or place of safety and to ensure\nrapid and effective disembarkation. This proposal takes into account the fact\nthat at this stage the maritime and aerial units would be acting under the\ncoordination of the rescue coordination centre, which determines the appropriate\nport or place of disembarkation. However, it also recognises the possibility\nfor the maritime units to disembark in the host Member State if they are not released\nof their obligation to render assistance to persons in distress as soon as\nreasonably practicable, taking into account the safety of the rescued persons\nand that of the maritime unit itself.\n2013/0106 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nestablishing rules for the surveillance of\nthe external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated\nby the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the\nExternal Borders of the Members States of the European Union \nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(d) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of Union\npolicy in the field of the Union external borders is to ensure the\nefficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders including through\nborder surveillance. The purpose of border surveillance is to prevent\nunauthorised border crossings, to counter cross-border criminality and to\napprehend or take other measures against those persons who have crossed the\nborder in an irregular manner. Border surveillance should be effective in\npreventing and discouraging persons from circumventing the checks at border\ncrossing points. To this end, border surveillance is not limited to the\ndetection of attempts at irregular border crossing but equally extends to steps\nsuch as intercepting ships suspected of trying to gain entry to the Union\nwithout submitting to border checks, as well as arrangements intended to\naddress situations such as search and rescue that may arise during a border\nsurveillance operation at sea and arrangements intended to bring such an\noperation to a successful conclusion.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Agency for\nthe Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member\nStates of the European Union (\u2018the Agency\u2019) established by Council Regulation\n(EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004[13]\nis responsible for the coordination of operational cooperation between\nMember States in the field of management of the external borders, including as regards\nborder surveillance. The Agency is also responsible to assist Member States in\ncircumstances requiring increased technical assistance at the external borders,\ntaking into account that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies\nand rescue at sea. Specific rules with regard to border surveillance activities\ncarried out by maritime and aerial units of one Member State at the sea border\nof other Member States or on the high seas in the context of operational\ncooperation coordinated by the Agency are necessary to further strengthen such\ncooperation.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The establishment of the\nEuropean Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) established by Regulation (EU) No [\u2026/\u2026] of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of [\u2026] should\nstrengthen the information exchange and operational cooperation between Member\nStates and with the Agency. This ensures that the situational awareness and\nreaction capability of Member States improves considerably, also with the\nsupport of the Agency, for the purposes of detecting and preventing irregular\nmigration, for combating cross-border crime and for contributing to protect and\nsave the lives of migrants at their external borders. When coordinating border\nsurveillance operations, the Agency should provide Member States with\ninformation and analysis concerning these operations.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During border surveillance\noperations, Member States and the Agency should respect their obligations under\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International\nConvention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the International Convention on\nMaritime Search and Rescue, the United Nations Convention against Transnational\nOrganized Crime and its Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea\nand Air, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the European\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights, the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other\nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and\nother relevant international instruments. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with\nRegulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\nMarch 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of\npersons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)[14]\nand general principles of Union law, any measure taken in the course of a surveillance\noperation should be proportionate to the objectives pursued, non-discriminatory\nand it should fully respect human dignity, fundamental\nrights and the rights of refugees and asylum seekers,\nincluding the principle of non-refoulement.\nMember States and the Agency are bound by the provisions of the asylum acquis,\nand in particular of Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1\nDecember 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting\nand withdrawing refugee status[15] with regard to applications for asylum made in the territory,\nincluding at the border or in the transit zones of Member States.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The possible existence of\nan arrangement between a Member State and a third country cannot absolve Member\nStates from those obligations whenever they are aware or ought to be aware that\nsystemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions\nof asylum seekers in that third country amount to substantial grounds for\nbelieving that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to\ninhuman or degrading treatment or where they are aware or ought to be aware\nthat this third country is engaged in practices in contravention of the\nprinciple of non-refoulement.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During a border surveillance\noperation at sea, a situation may occur where it will be necessary to render\nassistance to persons found in distress. In accordance\nwith international law, every State must require the master of a ship flying\nits flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the\ncrew or the passengers, to render assistance to any person found at sea in\ndanger of being lost and to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of\npersons in distress. Such assistance should be provided\nregardless of the nationality or status of the persons to be assisted or of the\ncircumstances in which they are found. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That obligation should be\ncarried out by Member States in accordance with the applicable provisions of international\ninstruments governing search and rescue situations and in accordance with the\nrequirements concerning the protection of fundamental rights. This Regulation should\nnot affect the responsibilities of search and rescue authorities, including for\nensuring that coordination and cooperation is carried out in such a way that\nthe persons rescued can be delivered to a port or a place of safety.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to Regulation\n(EC) No 2007/2004, border surveillance operations\ncoordinated by the Agency are conducted in accordance with an operational plan.\nAccordingly, as regards sea operations, the operational\nplan should include specific information on the application of the relevant\njurisdiction and legislation in the geographical area where the joint operation\nor pilot project takes place, including references to international and Union\nlaw, regarding interception, rescue at sea and disembarkation. In turn, this\nRegulation governs the issues of interception, rescue at sea and disembarkation\nin the context of sea border surveillance operations coordinated by the Agency.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The practice under\nRegulation (EC) No 2007/2004 is that for each sea operation, a\ncoordination structure is established within the host Member State, composed of officers from the host Member State, guest officers and representatives of\nthe Agency, including the Coordinating Officer of the Agency. This coordination\nstructure, usually called International Coordination Centre, should be used as\na channel for communication between the officers involved in the sea operation\nand the authorities concerned.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation respects\nthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of\nFundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the\nright to life, human dignity, prohibition of torture and of inhuman or\ndegrading treatment or punishment, right to liberty and security, non-refoulement,\nnon-discrimination, the right to an effective remedy, the right to asylum and\nthe rights of the child. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the objectives of the\naction to be taken, namely the adoption of specific rules for the surveillance\nof the sea borders by border guards operating under the coordination of the\nAgency, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the\ndifferences in their laws and practices, and can therefore, by reason of the\nmultinational character of the operations, be better achieved at the level of\nthe Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the\nprinciple of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does\nnot go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the\nTreaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\n  Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not\nbound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds\nupon the Schengen acquis, under Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on\nthe Functioning of the European Union, Denmark shall, in accordance with\nArticle 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date\nof adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Iceland and\nNorway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions\nof the Schengen acquis within\nthe meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and\nthe Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of\nthose two States with the implementation, application and development of the\nSchengen acquis[16] which\nfall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision\n1999/437/EC[17]\non certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nregards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\nwithin the meaning of the Agreement between the\nEuropean Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning\nthe association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application\nand development of the Schengen acquis,[18] which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of\nDecision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision\n2008/146/EC of 28 January 2008 on the conclusion of that Agreement on behalf of\nthe European Community.[19]\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Liechtenstein,\nthis Regulation constitutes a\ndevelopment of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning\nof the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the\nSwiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of\nthe Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union,\nthe European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s\nassociation with the implementation, application and development of the\nSchengen acquis, which
