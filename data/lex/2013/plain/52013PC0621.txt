In April 2003, the \u2018old-for-new\u2019 rule was converted into\r\na standby mechanism to be activated in the event of a serious market\r\ndisturbance of the kind referred to in Directive 96/75/EC[2].\nIn line with their fleet capacity policies, Member\r\nStates with inland waterways linked to those of another Member State and total fleet\r\ntonnage of over 100 000 tonnes set up an Inland Waterway Fund (the \u2018Reserve\r\nFund\u2019) on the basis of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. \nThe Reserve Funds are financed from the\r\nsurplus funding from structural improvement schemes conducted up to 28 April\r\n1999 and the special contributions received under the \u2018old-for-new\u2019 rule. They consist\r\nsolely of financial contributions from the inland waterway transport industry\r\nand their cumulative value currently amount to around EUR 35 million.\nThe funds are administered by the competent\r\nauthorities of the Member States concerned under their national\r\nlegislation and with their own administrative resources.\r\nNational organisations representing inland waterway carriers are involved in\r\nthis administration in accordance with Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999.\r\n\nIn accordance with Article 3(4) and (5) of the\r\nregulation, the reserve funds may be used in only two situations[3]:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event of a \u2018serious market\r\ndisturbance\u2019 in the inland waterway transport market, as referred to in Article\r\n7 of Directive 96/75/EC, the Commission may, at the request of a Member\r\nState, take suitable measures, in particular measures designed to prevent any\r\nnew increase in the transport capacity on offer on the market in question.\nWithin the meaning of Article 6 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 718/1999, the suitable measures are to be understood as\r\nthe reactivation of the \u2018old for new\u2019 rule, for a limited period, possibly accompanied\r\nby structural improvement measures, e.g. the disbursement of premiums for the\r\nscrapping of vessels, paid from the reserve funds. \nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If unanimously requested by the\r\norganisations representing inland waterway transport. In such as case, any Member State may take the measures as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999.\nIn connection with the modernisation and\r\nrestructuring of the EU fleets, the measures available to create a context\r\nfavourable to the environment and safety are the following:\n\u2013                        \r\nmake it easier for inland waterway carriers\r\nleaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or to transfer to\r\nanother economic activity;\n\u2013                        \r\norganise vocational training or retraining\r\nschemes for workers leaving the industry;\n\u2013                        \r\nencourage private owner-operators to join trade\r\nassociations;\n\u2013                        \r\nencourage the adaptation of vessels to technical\r\nprogress in order to improve working conditions and promote technical safety\r\nrequirements; and\n\u2013                        \r\nimprove operators\u2019 skills in order to safeguard\r\nthe development and future of the trade.\nTo date, the capital in the reserve funds has\r\nnever been used. In 2009, the Netherlands informed the Commission about an\r\nalleged serious market disturbance in its inland waterway transport market and\r\nasked it to take suitable measures in accordance with Directive 96/75/EC\r\n(situation A). However, from the information provided, the Commission was unable\r\nto confirm the existence of a serious market disturbance within the meaning of the\r\nDirective.\nThe EU-level representative organisations approached\r\nthe Commission once, in 2003, to enquire about possibilities for using the funds\r\n(situation B). However, the envisaged measures were considered to be outside\r\nthe scope of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe Commission consulted the representative\r\norganisations on 11 April 2013 on the reasons for the reserve funds never\r\nhaving been used, even though the sector was experiencing a decline, and on\r\npossible solutions. They confirmed that the limited scope of Article 8 was a\r\nbarrier to triggering the use of the funds. They indicated that they would be in\r\nfavour of expanding the scope of the Article so as to apply the existing\r\nmeasures for vocational training or retraining schemes to all crew members\r\nleaving the sector. The wording of the current provision excludes\r\nowner-operators, thereby making a sizeable percentage of the sector ineligible\r\nto use the fund for this purpose, while training needs for workers are not\r\ndifferent from those of other crew members. Stakeholders also considered that\r\nmeasures should be taken to strengthen professional associations who can help\r\nto mitigate the fragmentation of the sector. Furthermore, they thought it would\r\nbe useful to add a measure aimed at innovating vessels and adapting them to technical\r\nprogress as regards the environment, which reflects the reality being faced by\r\nthe sector when comparing their environmental performance as regards emissions with\r\nother modes of transport.. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe measures referred to in Article 8 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 718/1999 are only covering social aspects. However, these measures\r\ncould be extended in particular to broaden the scope of training schemes, to strengthen\r\nthe organisation of the sector and to create a context favourable to innovation\r\nand improved environmental performance.\nIt is therefore proposed that the measures\r\nprovided for in Article 8 be extended as following:\n\u00b7                        \r\ngive the possibility to organise vocational\r\ntraining or retraining schemes for all crew members leaving the industry, not\r\nonly for employees (or workers); \n\u00b7                        \r\nallow support to strengthen professional associations\r\nat Union level; and \n\u00b7                        \r\nencourage the innovation of vessels and their adaptation\r\nto technical progress as regards the environment.\n2013/0303 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway\r\ntransport\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nCommittee of the Regions[5],\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n718/1999 establishes the Union fleet capacity policy for vessels used to carry\r\ngoods on inland waterways in the Member States.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In connection with the\r\nmodernisation and restructuring of the fleets, social measures should be\r\nenvisaged to help workers who wish to leave the inland waterway industry or to\r\nretrain for jobs in another sector, together with measures to encourage the\r\nestablishment of groupings of undertakings, improve operators\u2019 skills and\r\npromote the adaptation of vessels to technical progress.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To this end, the reserve\r\nfund set up in each Member State whose inland waterways are linked to those of\r\nanother Member State and the tonnage of whose fleet is above 100 000\r\ntonnes could be used if this is unanimously requested by the organisations\r\nrepresenting inland waterway transport.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reserve funds,\r\nconsisting solely of financial contributions from the industry, have never been\r\nused.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures in connection\r\nwith the modernisation of the EU fleet referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 718/1999 concern only social matters. Other types of support measure for\r\ncreating a context favourable to innovation and the environment are not\r\nprovided for.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures in Article 8 of\r\nRegulation (EC) No 718/1999 concerning vocational training or retraining\r\nschemes are relevant to all crew members leaving the sector, including\r\nowner-operators and not only to those who are qualified as workers. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 718/1999 provides for measures that encourage owner-operators to join trade\r\nassociations, but not for measures that strengthen the organisations\r\nrepresenting inland waterway transport at Union level, whereas stronger\r\nUnion-wide organisations can help to mitigate fragmentation in the sector. \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 8 of Regulation (EC)\r\nNo 718/1999 should therefore be complemented by measures aimed at establishing training\r\nor retraining schemes for crew other than those who qualify as\r\n\"workers\" leaving the industry, encouraging operators to join trade\r\nassociations, strengthening professional associations and encouraging the innovation\r\nof vessels and their adaptation to technical progress as regards the environment\r\nand be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nArticle 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 is\r\nreplaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 8\nWithout prejudice to Article 3(5), any Member State may take measures in particular to:\n\u2013                        \r\nmake it easier for inland waterway carriers\r\nleaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or to transfer to\r\nanother economic activity,\n\u2013                        \r\norganise vocational training or retraining\r\nschemes for crew members leaving the industry, \n\u2013                        \r\nimprove skills in inland navigation in order to\r\nsafeguard the development and future of the profession,\n\u2013                        \r\nencourage owner-operators to join trade\r\nassociations and strengthen the organisations representing inland waterway\r\ntransport at Union level, \n\u2013                        \r\nencourage adaptation of vessels to technical\r\nprogress in order to improve working conditions and promote safety,\n\u2013                        \r\nencourage innovation of vessels and their\r\nadaptation to technical progress as regards the environment.\u2019\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding\r\nin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, \nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nThe President\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 90, 2.4.1999 p. 1\u20135 \n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive 96/75/EC of 19 November 1996 on the\r\nsystems of chartering and pricing in national and international inland waterway\r\ntransport in the Community, OJ L 304, 27.11.1996, p. 12.\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Germany and the Netherlands, proceeds from the\r\nfunds are nevertheless used in support of inland waterway transport, in\r\nparticular to support innovation (NL) or to provide professional training to\r\ninland navigation workers on a training vessel (DE).
