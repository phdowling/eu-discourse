The\r\nConvention entered into force in 1992 and now binds 175 Parties. The EU is a\r\nParty to the Basel Convention.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The procedure for amending\r\nannexes of the Basel Convention is governed by Articles 17 and 18 of the\r\nConvention. Any proposed amendment must be made by a Party and communicated by\r\nthe Secretariat to all Parties at least six months before the meeting at which\r\nit is proposed for adoption. Any such amendment must be adopted at a meeting of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties and may become effective six months from the date\r\nof issuance of a circular notification by the Depositary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annex IX to the Basel\r\nConvention contains a list of waste. The waste listed will not be covered by\r\nArticle 1, paragraph 1(a) of the Convention and thus not considered as\r\n\"hazardous waste\" for the purposes of the Convention, unless they\r\ncontain Annex I material to an extent causing them to exhibit an Annex III\r\ncharacteristic. Annex I lists categories of waste to be controlled (waste\r\nstreams) and constituents of waste. Annex III contains a list of hazardous\r\ncharacteristics.\nThe\r\nfollowing five applications for new entries in Annex IX (List B) to the Basel\r\nConvention were submitted in January and February 2011:\n(a)\r\nNon-separable plastic fraction from the pre-treatment of used liquid packages;\r\n(b) Pressure sensitive adhesive label laminate waste containing raw materials\r\nused in label material production not covered by entry B3020 in Annex IX;\r\n(c) Non-separable plastic-aluminium fraction from the pre-treatment of used\r\nliquid packages; \r\n(d) Clean biodegradable waste from agriculture, horticulture, forestry,\r\ngardens, parks and cemeteries; \r\n(e) Composite packaging consisting of mainly paper and some plastic, not\r\ncontaining residues and not covered by entry B3020 in Annex IX.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above waste entries were\r\nadded to Annex IIIB of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament\r\nand of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste[1], on a provisional basis pending\r\na decision on their inclusion in Annex IX (List B) to the Basel Convention.
