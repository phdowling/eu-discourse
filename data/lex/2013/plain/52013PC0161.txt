Alongside and linked to the national trade\nmark systems, Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the\nCommunity trade mark, codified as Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 (hereinafter referred\nto as \u2018the Regulation\u2019), established a stand-alone system for the registration\nof unitary rights having equal effect throughout the EU. In that context the\nOffice for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) was set up to be\nresponsible for registering and administering Community trade marks. \nA trade mark serves to distinguish the\ngoods and services of a company. It is the mark through which a business can\nattract and retain customer loyalty, and create value and growth. The mark\nworks in this case as an engine of innovation: the necessity to keep it\nrelevant promotes investments in R & D, which leads in turn to a continuous\nprocess of product improvement and development. This dynamic process also has a\nfavourable impact on employment. In an increasingly competitive environment,\nthere has been a steady growth not only in the crucial role of trade marks for\nmarket success, but also in their commercial value and number. In 2012, a\nrecord number of Community trade mark applications were\nfiled (over 107,900, against 98,217 in 2010 and 49,503 a decade earlier). OHIM\nalso received its millionth application since starting operations in 1996\nduring 2011. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on\nthe part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark\nregistration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and\ntechnologically up-to-date. \nIn 2007, when addressing the issue of the\nfinancial perspectives of OHIM, the Council[1]\nemphasised that the establishment of OHIM had been a great success and that it\nhad contributed substantially to strengthening the competitiveness of the EU. It\nrecalled that the Community trade mark system had been designed to co-exist\nwith the national trade mark systems which continued to be necessary for those\nundertakings which did not want their trade marks protected at EU level. The\nCouncil further noted the importance of the complementary work of national\ntrade mark offices, and called on OHIM to expand its cooperation with them in\nthe interest of the overall functioning of the Community trade mark system. Last,\nit acknowledged that more than a decade had passed since the creation of the\nCommunity trade mark, and underlined the need for an overall assessment of the\nfunctioning of the Community trade mark system. It invited the Commission to\nstart work on a corresponding study, in particular, with a view to intensifying\nand broadening the existing instruments of cooperation between OHIM and\nnational trade mark offices. \nIn its 2008 Small Business Act[2] the Commission pledged to make\nthe Community trade mark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, the 2008\nCommunication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe[3] underlined the Commission\u2019s\ncommitment to effective and efficient trade mark protection and to a trade mark\nsystem of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation\nwhich could form the basis for a future review of the trade mark system in\nEurope and for the further improvement of cooperation between OHIM and National\nOffices. In 2010, in the Communication on Europe 2020, under the Flagship\nInitiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, the Commission undertook to modernise the\nframework of trade marks in order to improve framework conditions for business\nto innovate[4].\nFinally, in its 2011 IPR strategy for Europe[5],\nthe Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a\nview to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it\nmore effective, efficient and consistent overall. \n\n1.2.                \nAim of the proposal\n\nConsidered together as a package, the main common\nobjective of this initiative and of the parallel proposal for recast of the Directive\nis to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration\nsystems all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses in terms\nof lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and\nlegal security. These adjustments dovetail with efforts to ensure coexistence\nand complementarity between the Union and national trade mark systems. \nAs regards this initiative to revise the Regulation,\nthe Commission is not proposing a new system, but well-targeted modernisation\nof existing provisions, with these main aims:\n\u00b7              \nAdapting terminology to the Lisbon Treaty and\nprovisions to the Common Approach on decentralised agencies (see section 5.1);\n\u00b7              \nStreamlining procedures to apply for and\nregister a European trade mark (see section 5.2);\n\u00b7              \nIncreasing legal certainty by clarifying\nprovisions and removing ambiguities (see section 5.3);\n\u00b7              \nEstablishing an appropriate framework for\ncooperation between OHIM and national offices for the promoting convergence of\npractices and developing common tools (see section 5.4);\n\u00b7              \nAligning the framework to Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (see section 5.5).\n\n2.                      \nRESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT\n2.1.                \nPublic consultation\n\nThis initiative is based on an evaluation of\nthe way the trade mark system works in Europe as a whole and of extensive consultations\nwith all major stakeholders involved. \nThe main component of the evaluation was a\nstudy the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law undertook\non behalf of the Commission. The study was carried out between November 2009 and\nFebruary 2011[6].\nIn addition to expert analysis, the study involved consultations with various\nstakeholders. It included a survey among users of the Community trade mark\nsystem, contributions from organisations representing trade mark users at\nnational, European and international level and a hearing in June 2010 involving\nthese organisations. Lastly, the Institute consulted the National Offices of\nall the Member States and OHIM.\nThe Final Report concluded that the basics\nof the European trade mark system are solid. In particular, the procedures\nfollowed by OHIM generally met business needs and expectations. There was\nfurther consensus that the coexistence of Community and national trade mark\nrights is fundamental and necessary for the efficient functioning of a trade\nmark system that meets the requirements of companies of different sizes,\nmarkets and geographical needs. The Report nevertheless found that further\nconvergence of trade mark laws and practices in the EU was required. It\nconfirmed that many aspects of the current Community trade mark system were working\nwell, and made a large number of proposals for improvement. It identified specific\nareas in which the OHIM and National Offices could enhance their cooperation.\nResponding to the interim results of the\nstudy, the Council adopted Conclusions on 25 May 2010[7]. These endorsed the agreement\nreached in September 2008 within the OHIM governing bodies (Administrative\nBoard and Budget Committee) on a set of budgetary measures intended to better\nbalance OHIM's budget in the future. The Council agreed that these budgetary\nmeasures also contributed to modernising, streamlining, harmonising and\nstrengthening the trade mark system in Europe as a whole. It called on the\nCommission to include in the revision the introduction of a specific provision\nto define the framework for cooperation between OHIM and the National Offices.\nThis should make explicit that all EU trade mark offices should pursue harmonisation\nof practices and that the OHIM should facilitate their efforts to this end. It\nalso called for the creation of a legal basis for distributing an amount equal\nto 50% of OHIM\u2019s renewal fees to National Offices to be used for protecting,\npromoting and/or enforcing trade marks.\nAs a follow-up to the study, the Commission\nservices convened a hearing of user associations on 26 May 2011. The results\nshaped and confirmed the Commission\u2019s preliminary analysis. \n\n2.2.                \nImpact Assessment\n\nThe impact assessment identified one main\nproblem the revised Regulation needs to address: the low level of cooperation among\ntrade mark offices in Europe. As explained in the impact assessment, there are\nmany links between the Community trade mark and national trade mark regimes,\nwith direct consequences for both trade mark users and intellectaul property offices.\nThese require a certain level of complementarity between the two systems. To\nachieve and ensure this, OHIM and National Offices should cooperate closely. \nEfficient and effective cooperation between\ntrade mark offices in Europe is currently seriously hindered by a number of\nobstacles: \n\u00b7              \nLack of a clear legal basis for cooperation on\nEU trade mark legislation\n\u00b7              \nLack of technical facilities in National Offices\n\u00b7              \nLack of sustainable financing in the medium to\nlong term. \nThe following options were considered to\nsolve these problems and to achieve three corresponding objectives. \n1.                      \nProviding an adequate legal basis for\ncooperation:\n(a)         \nOption 1: No specific legal basis for\ncooperation between intellectual property offices in Europe;\n(b)         \nOption 2: Legal basis allowing\nNational Offices and OHIM to cooperate with one another (optional cooperation);\n(c)         \nOption 3: Legal basis obliging National Offices and OHIM to cooperate with one another (mandatory\ncooperation).\n2.                      \nTechnical capacity building at National Offices:\n(a)         \nOption 1: Each office to\nprocure and develop the required facilities and tools;\n(b)         \nOption 2: Optional access to tools: the required facilities and tools accessible to IP offices within a\nframework of voluntary cooperation;\n(c)         \nOption 3: Mandatory access to tools: the required facilities accessible through a compulsory cooperation\nframework. This option overlaps with option 3 above regarding an adequate legal\nbasis and option 3 below on long-term financing of cooperation activities.\n3.                      \nSecuring long-term financing for cooperation\nactivities:\n(a)         \nOption 1: Financing from Member States;\n(b)         \nOption 2: Financing from EU budget;\n(c)         \nOption 3: Financing from OHIM budget.\nThe impact assessment concluded that option\n3 would in all cases be proportionate and best suited to achieving the\nobjectives pursued.\n\n3.                      \nLEGAL BASIS AND SUBSIDIARITY\n\nIn the context of the establishment and\nfunctioning of the internal market, Article 118(1) TFEU provides for the\ncreation of European intellectual property rights to provide uniform protection\nfor these rights throughout the EU, including the setting up of centralised\nUnion-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements.\nThe Community trade mark is a self-standing\nEU intellectual property title created by an EU Regulation. The analysis\ncarried out as part of the impact assessment proved that parts of the\nRegulation need to be changed to improve and streamline the Community trade\nmark system. Only the EU legislator has the competence to make the amendments\nneeded.\n\n4.                      \nBUDGETARY IMPLICATION\n\nThe\nproposal will not have an impact on the European Union budget and is therefore\nnot accompanied by the financial statement required under Article 31 of the\nFinancial Regulation (Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable\nto the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC,\nEuratom) No 1605/2002).\n\n5.                      \nDETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSAL\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Regulation\nare presented according to the objectives set out in section 1.2 above.\n\n5.1.                \nAdaptation of terminology and Common\napproach on Union decentralised agencies\n\nAs a consequence of the entry into force of\nthe Lisbon Treaty, the terminology of the Regulation is updated. This means\nchanging \u2018Community trade mark\u2019 to \u2018European trade mark\u2019.\nThere is a range of measures to improve the\ngovernance and efficiency of existing agencies and agencies yet to be\nestablished in the common approach on decentralised agencies, agreed by the\nEuropean Parliament, the Council and the Commission in July 2012. The Regulation\nneeds to be adapted to take into account the common approach as regards its\nprovisions on OHIM. Regarding the name of the agency, it is proposed to rename it\nas the \u2018European Union Trade Marks and Designs Agency\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018the\nAgency\u2019), to enhance the functions of its Management Board, to align selection\nprocedures for senior officials and to provide for annual and multi-annual work\nprogrammes and regular evaluations. \n\n5.2.                \nStreamlining procedures\n\n- Filing of applications (Article 25)\nNational Offices hardly ever receive applications\nfor European trade marks any more. Almost all applications (96,3% in 2012) are\nnow directly filed through the OHIM\u2019s e-filing system. In the light of this\nsituation, given that applications can now easily be filed on line, the option\nfor filing these at National Offices should be abolished. \n- Filing date (Article 27)\nMost European trade mark applications are\nnowadays examined before the expiry of the one-month period before applicants\nhave to pay the application fee. This allows applicants to file \u2018test\napplications\u2019 and not to pay the fee if a deficiency or objection is raised by\nthe Agency. Payments via current accounts are deemed to be have been made on\nthe last day of the month, if applicants so wish. Article 27 is therefore\namended to abolish the one-month period and to link the \u2018obligation\u2019 to pay\nwith the filing of the application, so that applicants will have to provide\nevidence that they submitted or authorised their payment when they filed their\napplication. \n- Searches (Articles 38 and 155)\nThe present regimes on searches provide\nneither a reliable trade mark clearance tool, nor fully comprehensive monitoring\nof the Register. The weaknesses of national and EU searches have become more\nacute over time, while IT advances nowadays mean users can have access to\nbetter, faster and cheaper alternatives. Applicants now have very little interest\nin obtaining the results of national searches from National Offices taking part\nin the optional system. The Agency is in the process of developing, together\nwith National Offices, a number of promising tools that offer far better means\nof conducting priority searches and monitoring the registry for infringements. Current\nsearch regimes are therefore abolished.\n- Publication of the application (Article\n39)\nAbolishing the search system will also make\nit possible to abolish the current one-month period between the Agency notifying\nthe applicant of search reports and publication of the application. This will\nspeed up the registration procedure. \n- Observations by third parties (Article\n40)\nTo facilitate the submission of\nobservations by third parties, Article 40 is amended by extending the period over\nwhich observations can be filed. The reference to the publication date is to be\ndeleted, taking into account that European trade mark applications are already\nmade available to the public in the Agency\u2019s trade mark database \u2018CTM online\u2019 within\na few days of filing. To streamline proceedings, third parties will be given\nthe opportunity to file observations as soon as they become aware of an\napplication. The deadline for filing observations will be at the end of the\nopposition period or once opposition proceedings have concluded, following\ncurrent Agency practice. \n- Revision of decisions inter partes\n(Article 62)\nArticle 62 has turned out to be of no\npractical relevance. Not a single inter partes decision has been revised\nunder this provision to date. The main reason is that the other party has no\ninterest in giving the approval required by Article 62(2). Given that there are\nsufficient remedies to correct an erroneous inter partes decision, Article\n62 is deleted. \n- Continuation of proceedings (Article\n82)\nThe application of Article 82 has led to\nsome problems in practice and gave rise to a Communication of the President of\nthe Agency, No 06/05[8].\nArticle 82 is amended to streamline its application and to incorporate the\ncontents of that Communication. As both Article 25(3) and Article 62 are\ndeleted, all mentions of them are also deleted from the list of excluded time\nlimits. The mention of Article 42 is also deleted to enable all time limits in\nopposition proceedings to continue, with the exception of the opposition period\nlaid down in Article 41(1) and the period for payment of the opposition fee set\nout in Article 41(3). \n- Opposition\nperiod for International Registrations (Article 156)\nAs there is no need to maintain the six-month-long\nperiod currently provided for, Article 156 is amended to shorten the time\nbetween publication under Article 152(1) and the start of the opposition period\nfor international registrations to one month.\n\n5.3.                \nIncreasing legal certainty\n\n- Definition of a European trade mark\n(Article 4)\nArticle 4 is amended to remove the requirement\nof \u2018graphic representability\u2019. The prerequisite that it should be possible to\nproduce a graphic representation of the sign applied for is out of date. It creates\na great deal of legal uncertainty with regard to certain non-traditional marks,\nsuch as mere sounds. In the latter cases, representation by other than\ngraphical means (e.g. by a sound file) may even be preferable to graphic\nrepresentation, if it permits a more precise identification of the mark and\nthereby serves the aim of enhanced legal certainty. The proposed new definition\nleaves the door open to registering matter that can be represented by\ntechnological means offering satisfactory guarantees. The idea is not to go for\na boundless extension of the admissible ways to represent a sign but to provide\nfor more flexibility in that respect while ensuring greater legal certainty.\n- Protection of geographical indications\nand traditional terms (Article 7)\nArticle 7(1)(j) and (k) do not offer the\nsame degree of protection to geographical indications as provided in the\nfollowing:\n\u00b7              \nArticles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012\nof 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs[9];\n\u00b7              \nArticles 118l and 118m of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007\nof 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets\nand on specific provisions for certain agricultural products, as amended by\nRegulation (EC) No 491/2009 of 25 May 2009[10];\n\u00b7              \nArticle 16 of Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of 15\nJanuary 2008 on the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks[11]. \nTo ensure that EU law protecting\ngeographical indications is given full effect in proceedings relating to the\nregistration of European trade marks, the relevant absolute grounds for refusal\nare fully aligned with the EU law on geographical indications and streamlined in\nthe Regulation. Moreover, for reasons of coherence, grounds for refusal are extended\nto cover protected traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities\nguaranteed. \n- Rights conferred by a European trade\nmark (Articles 9 and 9a)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rights conferred without\nprejudice to prior rights\nNeither the Regulation nor the Directive contains\na clear rule stating that the trade mark proprietor cannot successfully invoke\nhis rights against the use of an identical or similar sign which is already the\nsubject of an earlier right. In line with Article 16(1) of the TRIPS Agreement[12], Article 9 of the Regulation\nis amended to clarify that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier\nrights.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cases of double identity\nThe recognition of additional trade mark\nfunctions under Article 5(1)(a) of the Directive (Article 9(1)(a) of the\nRegulation) has created legal uncertainty. In particular, the relationship\nbetween double identity cases and the extended protection afforded by Article\n5(2) of the Directive (Article 9(1)(c) of the Regulation) to trade marks having\na reputation has become unclear[13].\nIn the interest of legal certainty and consistency, it is clarified that in\ncases of both double identity under Article 9(1)(a) and similarity under\nArticle 9(1)(b) it is only the origin function which matters.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use as a trade or company name\nAccording to the Court of Justice[14], Article 5(1) of the Directive\nis applicable where the public considers the use of a company name as (also) relating\nto the goods or services offered by the company. It is therefore appropriate to\ntreat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the\nrequirements of use for goods or services are met.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use in comparative advertising\nDirective 2006/114/EC of 12 December 2006\nconcerning misleading and comparative advertising[15] regulates the conditions under\nwhich advertising, which explicitly or by implication identifies a competitor\nor goods or services offered by a competitor, is permissible. The relationship\nof this instrument to the legislation on trade marks has given rise to doubts. It\nis therefore appropriate to clarify that the trade mark owner may prevent the\nuse of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising\ndoes not satisfy the requirements of Article 4 of Directive 2006/114/EC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consignments from commercial\nsuppliers\nAmendments\nare proposed to clarify that goods may not be imported into the EU even if only\nthe consignor is acting for commercial purposes. This is to ensure that a trade\nmark owner has the right to prevent businesses (whether located in the EU or\nnot) from importing goods located outside the EU that have been sold, offered,\nadvertised or shipped to private consumers, and to discourage the ordering and\nsale of counterfeit goods over the internet. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Goods brought into the customs\nterritory\nAccording to the Court of Justice in the Philips/Nokia\njudgment[16],\nthe entry, presence and movement of non-EU goods in the customs territory of\nthe EU under a suspensive procedure does, under the existing acquis, not\ninfringe intellectual property rights as conferred by substantive law of the\nUnion and its Member States. Such goods can only be classified as counterfeit\nonce there is proof that they are subject of a commercial act directed at EU\nconsumers, such as sale, offer for sale or advertising. The implications of the\nPhilips/Nokia judgment have met with strong criticism from stakeholders\nas placing an inappropriately high burden of proof on rights holders, and\nhindering the fight against counterfeiting. It is evident that there is an\nurgent need to have in place a European legal framework enabling a more\neffective fight against the counterfeiting of goods as a fast-growing activity.\nIt is therefore proposed to fill the existing gap by entitling right holders to\nprevent third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing\nwithout authorization a trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade\nmark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the\nUnion, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preparatory acts\nNeither the Regulation nor the Directive\ncontains any provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale\nof labels and packaging or similar items which may subsequently be combined\nwith illicit products. Some national laws have explicit rules covering this\nactivity. Including a rule on this in the Regulation and the Directive is\nappropriate to provide another practical, relevant and efficient contribution\nto the combat against counterfeiting. \n- Limitation of the effects of a European\ntrade mark (Article 12)\nThe limitation in Article 12(1)(a) is restricted\nto cover the use of personal names only in accordance with the Joint Statement\nof the Council and the Commission[17].\nFor reasons of consistency, the limitation in Article 12(1)(b) is extended to\ncover the use of non-distinctive signs or indications. It is also considered appropriate\nto provide in Article 12(1)(c) an explicit limitation covering referential use\nin general. Finally, a separate paragraph clarifies the conditions under which use\nof a trade mark is not considered as complying with honest business practices.\n- Designation and classification of\ngoods and services (Article 28)\nArticle 28 is amended to provide essential\nrules concerning the designation and classification of goods and services in\nthe Regulation. These rules are introduced into the Directive. They follow the\nprinciples established by the Court of Justice[18]\naccording to which goods and services for which protection is sought need to be\nidentified by the applicant with sufficient clarity and precision to enable the\nrelevant authorities and businesses to determine the extent of protection the\ntrade mark confers. The general indications of the class heading of the Nice\nClassification may be used to identify goods or services provided that such\nidentifications are sufficiently clear and precise. The amendment clarifies\nthat the use of general terms has to be interpreted as including all goods or\nservices clearly covered by the literal meaning of the term. Finally, the\namendment allows proprietors of European trade marks which were filed before\nthe date of publication of the Agency\u2019s new classification practice[19] to adapt their specifications\nof goods and services in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice\nin order to ensure that the content of the register meets the requisite\nstandard of clarity and precision.\n- European certification marks (Articles\n74b - 74k)\nWhile various national systems offer protection\nfor certification marks, the European trade mark system currently provides only\nfor the registration of individual and collective marks. Some public and\nprivate bodies that do not meet the conditions to be eligible to obtain\ncollective trade mark protection also need a system for protection of\ncertification marks at EU level. Such a system would also remedy the current\nimbalance between national systems and the European trade mark system. It is proposed\nto add to the Regulation a specific set of rules covering the registration of European\ncertification marks.\n- Tasks\nof the Agency (Article 123b)\nTo ensure comprehensive cover, legal certainty\nand greater transparency, all the Agency\u2019s tasks are defined in the new Article\n123b, including those which stem from other legal acts and are not related to\nthe EU trade mark system. \n\n5.4.                \nFramework for cooperation (Article 123c)\n\nArticle 123c provides a clear framework for\nmandatory cooperation between the Agency and Member State intellectual property\noffices with the aim of promoting convergence of practices and the development\nof common tools. It states that the Agency and Member State offices are obliged\nto cooperate, and stipulates the main areas for cooperation and specific common\nprojects of Union interest the Agency will coordinate. It further sets up a\nfunding mechanism enabling the Agency to finance those common projects by means\nof grants. This funding scheme represents a legally and financially feasible\nalternative to the approach suggested by the Council in its May 2010\nConclusions.\n\n5.5.                \nAlignment to Article 290 TFEU \n\nThe Regulation confers powers on the\nCommission in order to adopt certain rules. Those rules are currently provided\nin the Commission Regulation (EC) No 2868/95 of 13 December 1995 implementing\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade mark[20], Commission Regulation (EC) No\n2869/95 of 13 December 1995 on the fees payable to the Office for Harmonisation\nin the Internal Market[21],\nand Commission Regulation (EC) No 216/96 of 5 February 1996 laying down the\nrules of procedure of the Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonization in\nthe Internal Market[22].\nThe entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty makes it necessary to align the\npowers conferred upon the Commission under the Regulation to Article 290 of the\nTreaty (new Articles 24a, 35a, 45a, 49a, 57a, 65a, 74a,\n74k, 93a, 114a, 144a and 161a).\n2013/0088 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\n207/2009 on the Community trade mark\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 118(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December\n1993 on the Community trade mark[23],\nin 2009 codified as Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on\nthe Community trade mark[24],\ncreated a system of trade mark protection specific for the European Union which\nprovided for the protection of trade marks at the level of the European Union,\nin parallel to the protection of trade marks available at the level of the\nMember States according to the national trade mark systems harmonized by Council\nDirective 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member\nStates relating to trade marks[25],\ncodified as Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 22 October 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to\ntrade marks[26].\n\n(2)              \nAs a consequence of the entry into force of the\nLisbon Treaty, the terminology of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 should be updated.\nThis implies the replacement of 'Community trade mark' by 'European trade mark'.\nIn line with the Common approach on decentralised Agencies, agreed in July 2012\nby the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the name 'Office\nfor Harmonisation in the Internal Market (trade marks and designs) ' should be\nreplaced by 'European Union Trade Marks and Designs Agency' (hereinafter 'the\nAgency').\n(3)              \nFurther to the Commission\u2019s Communication of 16\nJuly 2008 on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe[27], the Commission carried out a comprehensive\nevaluation of the overall functioning of the trade mark system in Europe as a\nwhole, covering Union and national levels and the interrelation between each\nother.\n(4)              \nIn its conclusions of 25 May 2010 on the future revision of the Trade Mark system in the European Union[28], the Council called on the\nCommission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009\nand Directive 2008/95/EC.\n(5)              \nThe experience acquired since the establishment\nof the Community trade mark system has shown that undertakings from within the\nUnion and from third countries have accepted the system, which has become a\nsuccessful and viable alternative to the protection of trade marks at the level\nof the Member States.\n(6)              \nNational trade marks continue nevertheless to be\nnecessary for those undertakings which do not want protection of their trade\nmarks at Union level or which are unable to obtain Union-wide protection while\nnational protection does not face any obstacles. It should be left to the\ndecision of each person seeking trade mark protection whether the protection is\nsought only as a national mark in one or more Member States, or only as a European\ntrade mark, or both.\n(7)              \nWhile the evaluation of the overall functioning of\nthe Community trade mark system confirmed that many aspects of that system,\nincluding the fundamental principles on which it is based, have stood the test\nof time and continue meeting business needs and expectations, the Commission concluded\nin its Communication \u2018A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights\u2019 of 24\nMay 2011[29]\nthat there is a necessity to modernise the trade mark system in the Union by\nmaking it more effective, efficient and consistent as a whole and adapting it\nto the Internet era. \n(8)              \nIn parallel to the improvements and amendments\nof the Community trade mark system, national trade mark laws and practices\nshould be further harmonised and brought in line with the Union trade mark\nsystem to the extent appropriate in order to create as far as possible equal\nconditions for the registration and protection of trade marks throughout the\nUnion.\n(9)              \nIn order to allow for more flexibility while\nensuring greater legal certainty with regard to the means of representation of\ntrade marks, the requirement of graphic representability should be deleted from\nthe definition of a European trade mark. A sign should be permitted to be\nrepresented in any appropriate form, and thus not necessarily by graphic means,\nas long as the representation enables the competent authorities and the public\nto determine with precision and clarity the precise subject matter of\nprotection.\n(10)          \nThe current provisions of Regulation (EC) No\n207/2009 fall short of offering the same degree of protection to designations\nof origin and geographical indications as other instruments of Union law. It is\ntherefore necessary to clarify the absolute grounds for refusal concerning\ndesignations of origin and geographical indications and to ensure full\nconsistency with relevant Union legislation providing for protection of those intellectual\nproperty titles. For reasons of coherence with other Union legislation, the\nscope of those absolute grounds should be extended to cover also protected traditional\nterms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed.\n(11)          \nTrade marks applied for in a script or language\nnot intelligible in the Union should not deserve protection if their\nregistration would have to be refused on absolute grounds when translated or\ntranscribed in any official language of the Member States.\n(12)          \nIt is appropriate to make the dishonest appropriation\nof trade marks more difficult by extending the possibilities to oppose European\ntrade mark applications filed in bad faith.\n(13)          \nWith the aim of maintaining strong protection of\nrights in designations of origin and geographical indications protected at Union\nlevel, it is necessary to clarify that those rights entitle to bring an\nopposition against the registration of a later European trade mark, regardless\nof whether or not they are also grounds for refusal to be taken into account ex\nofficio by the examiner.\n(14)          \nIn order to ensure legal certainty and full\nconsistency with the principle of priority, under which an earlier registered trade\nmark takes precedence over later registered trade marks, it is necessary to lay\ndown that the enforcement of rights conferred by a European trade mark should\nbe without prejudice to the rights of proprietors acquired prior to the filing\nor priority date of the European trade mark. This is in conformity with Article\n16(1) of the Agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights\nof 15 April 1994[30]. \n(15)          \nIn order to ensure legal certainty and clarity,\nit is necessary to clarify that not only in the case of similarity but also in\ncase of an identical sign being used for identical goods or services,\nprotection should be granted to a European trade mark only if and to the extent\nthat the main function of the European trade mark, which is to guarantee the\ncommercial origin of the goods or services, is adversely affected.\n(16)          \nConfusion as to the commercial source from which\nthe goods or services emanate may occur when a company uses the same or a\nsimilar sign as a trade name in a way that a link is established between the\ncompany bearing the name and the goods or services coming from that company. Infringement\nof a European trade mark should therefore also comprise the use of the sign as\na trade name or similar designation as long as the use is made for the purposes\nof distinguishing goods or services as to their commercial origin.\n(17)          \nIn order to ensure legal certainty and full consistency\nwith specific Union legislation, it is appropriate to provide that the\nproprietor of a European trade mark should be entitled to prohibit a third\nparty from using a sign in a comparative advertising where such comparative\nadvertising is contrary to Directive 2006/114/EC of the European Parliament and\nof the Council of 12 December 2006 concerning misleading and comparative advertising[31]. \n(18)          \nWith the aim of strengthening trade mark\nprotection and combatting counterfeiting more effectively, the proprietor of a\nEuropean trade mark should be entitled to prevent third parties from bringing\ngoods into the customs territory of the Union without being released for free\ncirculation there, where such goods come from third countries and bear without\nauthorization a trade mark which is essentially identical to the European trade\nmark registered in respect of such goods.\n(19)          \nIn order to more effectively prevent the entry of\ninfringing goods, particularly in the context of sales over the Internet, the proprietor\nshould be entitled to prohibit the importing of such goods into the Union,\nwhere it is only the consignor of the goods who acts for commercial purposes.\n(20)          \nIn order to enable proprietors of European trade\nmarks to fight counterfeiting more effectively, they should be entitled to\nprohibit the affixing of an infringing mark to goods and preparatory acts prior\nto the affixing.\n(21)          \nThe exclusive rights conferred by a European trade\nmark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or\nindications which are used fairly and in accordance with honest practices in\nindustrial and commercial matters. In order to create equal conditions for trade\nnames and trade marks in case of conflicts against the background that trade\nnames are regularly granted unrestricted protection against later trade marks,\nsuch use should be considered to include the use of one\u2019s own personal name only.\nIt should further include the use of descriptive or non-distinctive signs or\nindications in general. Moreover, the proprietor should not be entitled to\nprevent the general fair and honest use of the European trade mark for\nidentifying or referring to the goods or services as those of the proprietor.\n(22)          \nIn order to ensure legal certainty and safeguard\ntrade mark rights legitimately acquired, it is appropriate and necessary to lay\ndown, without affecting the principle that the later trade mark cannot be\nenforced against the earlier trade mark, that proprietors\nof European trade marks should not be entitled to oppose the use of a later\ntrade mark when the later trade mark was acquired at a time when the earlier\ntrade mark could not be enforced against the later trade mark.\n(23)          \nFor reasons of equity and legal certainty the use\nof a European trade mark in a form differing in elements which do not alter the\ndistinctive character of the mark in the form in which it is registered should be\nsufficient to preserve the rights conferred regardless of whether the trade\nmark in the form as used is also registered.\n(24)          \nRegulation (EC) No 207/2009 confers powers on\nthe Commission in order to adopt rules implementing that Regulation. As a\nconsequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred\nupon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 need to be aligned to\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(25)          \nIt is of particular importance that the\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,\nincluding at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.\n(26)          \nIn order to ensure the efficient registration of\nlegal acts concerning the European trade mark as object of property and ensure\nfull transparency of the register of European trade marks, the power to adopt\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of specifying certain obligations of the applicant\nregarding specific trade marks, the details on the procedures for entering the\ntransfer of European trade marks, the creation and transfer of a right in rem, the\nlevy of execution, the involvement in an insolvency procedure and the grant or\ntransfer of a licence in the Register and for cancelling or modifying relevant\nentries.\n(27)          \nIn view of the gradual decline and insignificant\nnumber of Community trade mark applications filed at the central intellectual\nproperty offices of the Member States ('the offices of the Member States'), it\nshould be only allowed to file a European trade mark application at the Agency.\n(28)          \nEuropean trade mark protection is granted in\nrelation to specific goods or services whose nature and number determine the\nextent of protection afforded to the trade mark owner. It is therefore essential\nto establish rules for the designation and classification of goods and services\nin Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and to ensure legal certainty and sound\nadministration by requiring that the goods and services for which trade mark\nprotection is sought are identified by the applicant with sufficient clarity\nand precision to enable the competent authorities and economic operators, on the\nbasis of the application alone, to determine the extent of the protection\napplied for. The use of general terms should be interpreted as including only all\ngoods and services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the term. Proprietors\nof European trade marks, which because of the previous practice of the Agency are\nregistered in respect of the entire heading of a class of the Nice\nClassification, should be given the possibility to adapt their specifications\nof goods and services in order to ensure that the content of the register meets\nthe requisite standard of clarity and precision in accordance with the case law\nof the Court of Justice of the European Union. \n(29)          \nIn order to provide for an effective and\nefficient regime for the filing of European trade mark applications including\npriority and seniority claims, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect\nof specifying the means and modalities of filing a European trade mark\napplication, the details regarding the formal conditions of a European trade\nmark application, the content of that application, the type of application fee,\nas well as the details on the procedures for ascertaining reciprocity, claiming\nthe priority of a previous application, an exhibition priority and the\nseniority of a national trade mark.\n(30)          \nThe current regime of European trade mark and\nnational searches is neither reliable nor efficient. It should therefore be replaced\nby the making available of all-encompassing, fast and powerful search engines\nfor the free use of the public within the context of cooperation between the Agency\nand the offices of the Member States.\n(31)          \nIn order to ensure an effective, efficient and expeditious\nexamination and registration of European trade mark applications by the Agency using\nprocedures which are transparent, thorough, fair and equitable, the power to\nadopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the\nprocedures related to the examination of compliance with the requirements on\nthe filing date and with the formal conditions of an application, the procedures\nfor verifying payment of class fees and the examination of absolute grounds for\nrefusal, the details concerning the publication of the application, the procedures\nfor correcting mistakes and errors in publications of applications, the details\non the procedures related to third party observations, the details on the opposition\nprocedure, the details on the procedures for filing and examining an opposition\nand those governing the amendment and division of the application, the\nparticulars to be recorded in the Register when registering a European trade\nmark, the modalities of publication of the registration and the content and\nmodalities of issue of a certificate of registration.\n(32)          \nIn order to allow European trade marks to be renewed\nin an effective and efficient manner and to safely apply the provisions on the\nalteration and the division of a European trade mark in practice without compromising\nlegal certainty, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of\nspecifying the modalities for the renewal of a European trade mark and\nprocedures governing the alteration and division of a European trade mark. \n(33)          \nIn order to permit the proprietor of a European\ntrade mark to easily surrender a European trade mark, while respecting the\nrights of third parties entered in the register in relation to that mark, and\nto ensure that a European trade mark can be revoked or declared invalid in an effective\nand efficient way by means of transparent, thorough, fair and equitable\nprocedures, and to take into account the principles laid down in this\nRegulation, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of\nthe Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the\nprocedure governing the surrender of a European trade mark as well as the\nprocedures for revocation and invalidity.\n(34)          \nIn order to allow for an effective, efficient\nand complete review of decisions of the Agency by the Boards of Appeal by means\nof a transparent, thorough, fair and equitable procedure which takes into\naccount the principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 207/2009, the power to\nadopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the content\nof the notice of appeal, the procedure for the filing and examination of an\nappeal, the content and form of the Board of Appeal's decisions and the\nreimbursement of the appeal fees.\n(35)          \nAs a complement to the existing provisions on\nCommunity collective marks and to remedy the current imbalance between national\nsystems and the European trade mark system, it is necessary to add a set of\nspecific provisions for the purpose of providing protection to European certification\nmarks which allow a certifying institution or organisation to permit adherents\nto the certification system to use the mark as a sign for goods or services\ncomplying with the certification requirements. \n(36)          \nIn order to allow for an effective and efficient\nuse of European collective and certification marks, the power to adopt delegated\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of specifying the periods for submitting the regulations\ngoverning the use of those marks and the content thereof.\n(37)          \nThe experience gained in the application of the\ncurrent system of Community trade marks revealed the potential for improvement\nof certain aspects of procedure. Consequently, certain measures should be taken\nto simplify and speed up procedures where appropriate and to enhance legal\ncertainty and predictability where required.\n(38)          \nIn order to ensure a smooth, effective and\nefficient operation of the European trade mark system, the power to adopt\ndelegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of specifying the requirements as to the form of\ndecisions, the details on oral proceedings and the modalities of taking of\nevidence, the modalities of notification, the procedure for the noting of loss\nof rights, the means of communication and the forms to be used by the parties\nto proceedings, the rules governing the calculation and duration of time\nlimits, the procedures for the revocation of a decision or for cancellation of\nan entry in the Register and for the correction of obvious errors in decisions\nand errors attributable to the Agency, the modalities of the interruption of\nproceedings and the procedures concerning the apportionment and fixing of costs,\nthe particulars to be entered in the Register, the details concerning the\ninspection and keeping of files, the modalities of publications in the European\nTrade Marks Bulletin and in the Official Journal of the Agency, the modalities of\nadministrative cooperation between the Agency and the authorities of Member\nStates, and the details on representation before the Agency. \n(39)          \nFor reasons of legal certainty and greater transparency,\nit is appropriate to clearly define all the tasks of the Agency including those\nwhich are not related to the management of the Union trade mark system.\n(40)          \nWith the aim of promoting convergence of practices\nand of developing common tools, it is necessary to establish an appropriate framework for cooperation between the Agency and the offices of the\nMember States, clearly defining the areas of cooperation and enabling the\nAgency to coordinate relevant common projects of Union interest and to finance,\nup to a maximum amount, those common projects by means of grants. Those\ncooperation activities should be beneficial for undertakings using trade mark\nsystems in Europe. For users of the Union regime laid down in this Regulation,\nthe common projects, particularly the databases for search and consultation\npurposes, should provide additional, inclusive, efficient and free of charge\ntools to comply with the specific requirements flowing from the unitary\ncharacter of the European trade mark.\n(41)          \nCertain principles regarding the governance of\nthe Agency should be adapted to the Common Approach on EU decentralised\nagencies adopted by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission in\nJuly 2012.\n(42)          \nIn the interest of greater legal certainty and\ntransparency, it is necessary to update some provisions concerning the\norganization and functioning of the Agency.\n(43)          \nIn the interest of sound financial\nmanagement, the accumulation of significant budgetary surpluses should be\navoided. This should be without prejudice to the Agency maintaining a financial\nreserve covering one year of its operational expenditure to ensure the\ncontinuity of its operations and the execution of its tasks.\n(44)          \nIn order to allow for an effective and efficient\nconversion of an application or registration of a European trade mark into a\nnational trade mark application while ensuring a thorough examination of the\nrelevant requirements, the power to adopt delegated\nacts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of specifying the formal conditions with which a request\nfor conversion must comply and the details of its examination and publication.\n(45)          \nIn order to ensure an effective and efficient method\nto resolve disputes, to ensure consistency with the language regime laid down\nin Regulation (EC) No 207/2009,\nthe expeditious delivery of decisions on a simple subject matter, and the\neffective and efficient organisation of the Boards of Appeal, and to guarantee an\nappropriate and realistic level of fees to be charged by the Agency, while complying\nwith the budgetary principles set out in Regulation (EC)\nNo 207/2009, the power\nto adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of specifying the details on the\nlanguages to be used before the Agency, the cases where opposition and\ncancellation decisions should be taken by a single member, the details on the\norganisation of the Boards of Appeal, the amounts of the fees to be paid to the\nAgency and details related to their payment.\n(46)          \nIn order to ensure the effective and efficient registration\nof international trade marks in full consistency with the rules of the Protocol\nrelating to the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of\nmarks, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect\nof specifying the details on the procedures concerning the international\nregistration of trade marks. \n(47)          \nRegulation (EC) No 207/2009 should therefore be\namended accordingly.\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation\n(EC) No 207/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1)                   \nIn the title, 'Community trade mark' is replaced\nby 'European trade mark';\n(2)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, the words 'Community\ntrade mark' are replaced by 'European trade mark' and any necessary grammatical\nchanges are made;\n(3)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, the words \u2018Community\ntrade mark court\u2019 are replaced by 'European trade mark court' and any necessary\ngrammatical changes are made;\n(4)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, the words 'Community\ncollective mark' are replaced by 'European collective mark' and any necessary\ngrammatical changes are made;\n(5)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, except in the cases\nreferred to in points (2), (3) and (4), the words 'Community', 'European\nCommunity' and 'European Communities' are replaced by \u2018Union\u2019 and any necessary\ngrammatical changes are made;\n(6)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, the word 'Office', insofar\nas it refers to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (trade\nmarks and designs) provided for in Article 2 of the Regulation, is replaced by\n'Agency' and any necessary grammatical changes are made;\n(7)                   \nThroughout the Regulation, the word 'President' is\nreplaced by 'Executive Director' and any necessary grammatical changes are\nmade;\n(8)                   \nArticle 2 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 2\nAgency\n1. A European Union Trade Marks and Designs Agency,\nhereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agency\u2019, is hereby established.\n2. All references in Union law to the Office\nfor Harmonisation in the Internal Market (trade marks and designs) shall be\nread as references to the Agency.';\n(9)                   \nArticle 4 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 4\nSigns of which a European trade mark may consist\nA European trade mark may consist of any signs,\nin particular words, including personal names, designs, letters, numerals,\ncolours as such, the shape of goods or of their packaging, or sounds, provided that\nsuch signs are capable of \n(a) distinguishing the goods or services of one\nundertaking from those of other undertakings;\n(b) being represented in a manner which enables\nthe competent authorities and the public to determine the precise subject of\nthe protection afforded to its proprietor.';\n(10)               \nArticle 7 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \nIn paragraph 1, points (j) and (k) are replaced\nby the following:\n'(j) trade marks which are excluded from\nregistration and shall not continue to be used pursuant to Union legislation or\ninternational agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection\nof designations of origin and geographical indications;\n(k) trade marks which are excluded from\nregistration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which\nthe Union is party, providing for protection of traditional terms for wine and\ntraditional specialities guaranteed;\n(l) trade marks which contain or consist of an\nearlier variety denomination registered in accordance with Council Regulation\n(EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994 on Community plant variety rights with respect\nto the same type of product.';\n(b)         \nparagraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n'2. Paragraph 1 shall apply notwithstanding\nthat the grounds of non-registrability obtain:\n(a) in only part of the Union;\n(b) only where a trade mark in a foreign\nlanguage or script is translated or transcribed in any script or official language\nof a Member State.';\n(11)               \nArticle 8 is amended as follows:\n(a)         \nparagraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n'3. Upon opposition by the proprietor of the\ntrade mark, a trade mark shall not be registered:\n(a) where an agent or representative of the\nproprietor of the trade mark applies for registration thereof in his own name\nwithout the proprietor's authorisation, unless the agent or representative\njustifies his action;\n(b) where the trade mark is liable to be\nconfused with an earlier trade mark protected outside the Union, provided that,\nat the date of the application, the earlier trade mark was still in genuine use\nand the applicant was acting in bad faith.'; \n(b)         \nin paragraph 4, the introductory phrase is\nreplaced by the following:\n'4. Upon opposition by the proprietor of a non-registered trade mark or of another sign\nused in the course of trade of more than mere local significance, the trade\nmark applied for shall not be registered where and to the extent that, pursuant\nto Union legislation providing for protection of designations of origin and geographical\nindications, or the law of the Member State governing that sign:'\n(c)         \nparagraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n'5. Upon opposition by the proprietor of an\nearlier registered trade mark within the meaning of paragraph 2, the trade mark\napplied for shall not be registered where it is identical with, or similar to, an\nearlier trade mark irrespective of whether the goods or services for which it\nis applied are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the\nearlier trade mark is registered, where, in the case of an earlier European\ntrade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Union or, in the case of an\nearlier national trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Member\nState concerned, and where the use without due cause of the trade mark applied\nfor would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive\ncharacter or the repute of the earlier trade mark.';\n(12)               \nArticle 9 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 9\nRights conferred by a European trade mark\n1.
