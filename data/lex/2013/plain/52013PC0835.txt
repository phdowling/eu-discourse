As a result of previous anti-circumvention investigations, the measures were extended to Malaysia on 25 July 2012[3] and to Taiwan and Thailand on 17 January 2013[4]. \n Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n Consultation of interested parties \n Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. \n Collection and use of expertise \n There was no need for external expertise. \n Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not provide for a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\n Summary of the proposed action The Commission has received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation which contained sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres imposed by the said Regulation (EU) No 791/2011 were being circumvented by means of transhipment via India and Indonesia. The request was lodged on 25 February 2013 by Saint Gobain Adfors CZ s.r.o., Tolnatext Fonalfeldolgozo es Muszakiszovet-gyarto Bt., Valmieras \"Stikla Skiedra\" AS and Vitrulan Technical Textiles GmbH, four Union producers of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres, representing more than 50% of the Union industry. On 10 April 2013 the Commission, by Regulation (EU) No 322/2013[5], initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 791/2011 on imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in the PRC by imports consigned from India and Indonesia, whether declared as originating in India and Indonesia or not. The measures in force appear to be circumvented by transhipment through India and Indonesia and/or by false declaration of origin of Chinese products, by declaring them as Indian or Indonesian products. The circumvention practices are also investigated by OLAF. The attached proposal for a Council Implementing Regulation is based on the findings of the investigation, which has confirmed the circumvention of the measures in force by transhipment of the product concerned via India and Indonesia or by false declaration of origin of the Chinese products. All other criteria for the establishment of circumvention as set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation are also met. It is therefore proposed to extend the anti-dumping measures in force on certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in the PRC to imports of the same product consigned from India and Indonesia. The duty corresponds to the country-wide duty on imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres from the PRC (62,9%). The duty shall be levied from the date of initiation of the investigation. Two companies in India requsted exemption under Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation. Only one of these companies produces the product under investigation, Montex Glass Fibre Industries Pvt.Ltd. The investigation confirmed that this company is a genuine producer and that it is not involved in circumvention practices. It is thus proposed to exempt this company from the extended duties. None of the companies in Indonesia came forward following the initiation, thus there are not any requests for exemption from any possible extension of the current measures in Indonesia. The relevant Council Regulation should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union no later than 9 January 2014. \n Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and in particular Article 13 thereof. \n Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \n Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: \n The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. \n Indication of how the financial and administrative burden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. \n Choice of instruments \n Proposed instruments: Regulation. \n Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not provide for alternative options. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the\nUnion budget.\n2013/0412 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nextending the definitive anti-dumping duty\nimposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 791/2011 on imports of\ncertain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in the People's Republic\nof China to imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres consigned from\nIndia and Indonesia, whether declared as originating in India and Indonesia or\nnot\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, \nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No\n1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from\ncountries not members of the European Community[6]\n(\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 13 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nWhereas:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Existing measures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 791/2011[7] (\u2018the\noriginal Regulation\u2019) the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of\n62,9% on imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018the PRC\u2019) for all other companies than the\nones mentioned in Article 1(2) and Annex 1 of that Regulation. These measures are the measures in force and the investigation that\nled to the measures is the original investigation.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures in force were\npreviously extended to Malaysia, by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No\n672/2012[8],\nand to Taiwan and Thailand, by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 21/2013[9].\n1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Request\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 25 February 2013, the\nEuropean Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) received a request under Articles 13(3)\nand 14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of\nthe anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain open mesh fabrics of\nglass fibres originating in the PRC and to make imports of certain open mesh\nfabrics of glass fibres consigned from India and Indonesia, whether declared as\noriginating in India and Indonesia or not, subject to registration.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was lodged by\nSaint-Gobain Adfors CZ s.r.o., Tolnatext Fonalfeldolgozo es Muszakiszovet-gyarto\nBt., Valmieras \"Stikla Skiedra\" AS and Vitrulan Technical Textiles\nGmbH, four Union producers of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request contained\nsufficient prima facie evidence that following the imposition of the\nmeasures in force, a significant change in the pattern of trade involving\nexports from the PRC, India and Indonesia to the Union occurred, for which\nthere was insufficient due cause or economic justification other than the\nimposition of the measures in force. This change in the pattern of trade\nstemmed allegedly from consignement of certain open mesh fabrics of glass\nfibres originating in the PRC via India and Indonesia and/or false declaration\nof origin of the Chinese products.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the evidence\npointed to the fact that the remedial effects of the measures in force were\nbeing undermined both in terms of quantity and price. The evidence showed that\nthese increased imports from India and Indonesia were made at prices below the\nnon-injurious price established in the original investigation.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there was\nevidence that prices of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres consigned\nfrom India and Indonesia were dumped in relation to the normal value\nestablished for the like product during the original investigation.\n1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiation\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having\ndetermined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima\nfacie evidence existed for the initiation of an investigation under\nArticles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission initiated an\ninvestigation by Commission Regulation (EU) No 322/2013[10] (\u2018the initiating Regulation\u2019). Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5)\nof the basic Regulation the Commission, by the initiating Regulation, also\ndirected the customs authorities to register imports of certain open mesh\nfabrics of glass fibres consigned from India and Indonesia.\n1.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission officially\nadvised the authorities of the PRC, India and Indonesia, the producers/exporters\nin these countries, the importers in the Union known to be concerned and the\nUnion industry of the initiation of the investigation. Questionnaires were sent\nto the producers/exporters in the PRC, India and Indonesia known to the\nCommission or which made themselves known within the deadlines specified in recital\n15 to the initiating Regulation. Questionnaires were also sent to importers in\nthe Union. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views\nknown in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the\ninitiating Regulation. All parties\nwere informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18\nof the basic Regulation and to findings being based on the facts available.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two exporting producers in India and one unrelated importer in the Union made themselves known and submitted replies to the\nquestionnaires. Later the Union importer informed the Commission that it\nimported other products and it did not import any product under investigation\nin the past. No exporting producer in Indonesia submitted a reply. The\nfollowing exporting producers in India submitted an exemption form reply:\n\u2013              \nMontex Glass Fibre Industries Pvt.Ltd.\n(\u2018Montex\u2019),\n\u2013              \nand Urja Products Pvt.Ltd.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, Urja Products\nPvt.Ltd. informed the Commission that it does not produce the product under\ninvestigation and its products have different technical characteristics and\ndifferent use (falling within other CN codes). Therefore, verification visit\nwas carried out only at the premises of Montex. \n1.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation period\ncovered the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2013 (\u2018the IP\u2019). Data were\ncollected for the IP to investigate, inter alia, the alleged change in\nthe pattern of trade. More detailed data were collected for the reporting\nperiod from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 (\u2018the RP\u2019) in order to examine the\npossible undermining of the remedial effect of the measures in force and\nexistence of dumping.\n2. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION\n2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General considerations\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Article\n13(1) of the basic Regulation, the assessment of the existence of circumvention\nwas made by analysing successively whether there was a change in the pattern of\ntrade between the PRC, India, Indonesia and the Union; if this change stemmed\nfrom a practice, process or work for which there was insufficient due cause or\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the duty; if there was\nevidence of injury or that the remedial effects of the duty were being\nundermined in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the product under\ninvestigation; and whether there was evidence of dumping in relation to the\nnormal values previously established for the product concerned, if necessary in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the basic Regulation.\n2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Product concerned and the\nproduct under investigation\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product concerned is as\ndefined in the original investigation: Open mesh fabrics of glass fibres, of a\ncell size of more than 1,8 mm both in length and in width and weighing more\nthan 35 g/m2, excluding fibreglass discs, originating in the\nPeople's Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes ex 7019 51 00 and\nex 7019 59 00.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The product under\ninvestigation is the same as that defined in the previous recital, but\nconsigned from India and Indonesia, whether declared as originating in India\nand Indonesia or not.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat open mesh fabrics of glass fibres, as defined above, exported from the PRC\nto the Union and those consigned from India and Indonesia to the Union have the\nsame basic physical and technical characteristics and have the same uses, and\nare therefore to be considered as like products within the meaning of Article\n1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Level of cooperation \n2.3.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 India\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital 10\nabove, only two Indian companies submitted an exemption form reply. As one of\nthem, Urja Products Pvt.Ltd., was found not to be a producer of the product\nunder investigation, there was only one cooperating company, Montex. The\ncompany represented only 1 % of the exports from India to the Union in the RP\nperiod of 2012/2013, compared to overall exports from India. This led to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and findings with\nregard to India were based on facts available.\n2.3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10),\nno Indonesian companies submitted a questionnaire reply. There was no\ncooperation from Indonesian companies. This led to the application of Article\n18 of the basic Regulation and findings with regard to Indonesia were based on facts available.\n2.3.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The PRC\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no cooperation\nfrom the Chinese exporting producers. This led to the application of Article 18\nof the basic Regulation and findings with regard to the PRC were based on facts\navailable.\n2.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change in the pattern of\ntrade\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To determine whether there\nwas a change in the pattern of trade, imports of the product under\ninvestigation from India and Indonesia into the Union and exports of the\nproduct under investigation from the PRC to India and Indonesia were assessed. These imports were established on the basis of facts available under\nArticle 18(1) of the basic Regulation given the relatively low or no\ncooperation of Indian, Indonesian and Chinese companies (see Section 2.3 above).\n\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To that end, COMEXT statistics[11], trade statistics from India and Indonesia received from the respective national authorities and Global Trade Information\nServices[12] statistics were used for the analysis. The\naccounting years starting 1 April finishing 31 March was used in order to use\n12-month periods.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The import volume recorded\nin COMEXT statistics covers a larger product group than the product concerned\nand the product under investigation. However, based on estimates provided by\nthe Union industry, it could be established that a significant part of this\nimport volume covered the product concerned and the product under\ninvestigation. Accordingly, these data could be used to establish a change in\nthe pattern of trade.\n2.4.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports into the Union\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COMEXT statistics show a\nsignificant change in the pattern of trade over the IP (see Table 1 below). \nTable 1\n Import volumes (millions of m2)[13] || April 2009/ March 2010   || April 2010/ March 2011 || April 2011/ March 2012 || April 2012/ March 2013 \n PRC || 288,40 || 385,85 || 110,30 || 85,93 \n India || 0,35 || 0,28 || 0,89 || 13,13 \n Indonesia || 0,004 || 0,16 || 3,22 || 33,31 \nSource: COMEXT\nstatistics\nImports from the PRC\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to COMEXT\nstatistics imports of the product concerned from the PRC to the Union dropped dramatically subsequent to the imposition of the provisional measures in\nFebruary 2011[14]\nand of the definitive measures in August 2011[15].\nTable 1 above shows that between 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 the imports to the Union from the PRC dropped from 385,85 million m\u00b2 to 110,30 million m\u00b2 (by approximately\n70%) and between 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 (by approximately 80 %) further to\n85,9 million m\u00b2. \nImports\nfrom India\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to COMEXT\nstatistics, in the financial year 2009/2010 the quantities imported from India\nto the Union accounted for 0,35 million m\u00b2, in the financial year 2010/2011 it\nwas 0,28 million m\u00b2 and it increased sharply between 2011/2012 and 2012/2013,\nreaching 13,13 million m\u00b2 in the financial year 2012/2013. \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital 17\nabove, the company Montex exported a very small quantity to Union of the\nproduct under investigation in the IP \u2013 compared to overall exports from India\nit represents 1 % of the exports from India to the Union in the period of\n2012/2013. It was found moreover that Montex exports the product under\ninvestigation under an incorrect CN code \u2013 70 19 52. Its exports had to be\ntherefore added to the COMEXT statistics as shown in Table 1 above.\nImports from Indonesia\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to COMEXT\nstatistics, in the financial year 2009/2010 the quantities imported from\nIndonesia to the Union market accounted for 0,004 million m\u00b2, in 2010/2011 it\namounted to 0,16 million m\u00b2 and it increased sharply between 2011/2012 and\n2012/2013, from 3,22 million m\u00b2 to 33,31 million m\u00b2 respectively. \n2.4.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exports from the PRC to India and Indonesia\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A dramatic increase of\nexports can also be observed from the PRC to India and Indonesia in the same period.\nTable 2\n Import volumes (millions of m2) || April 2009/ March 2010   || April 2010/ March 2011 || April 2011/ March 2012 || April 2012/ March 2013 \n India || 4,80 || 16,35 || 18,38 || 29,28 \n Indonesia || 5,78 || 4,01 || 8,94 || 11,54 \nSource: China customs Statistics\nExports from the PRC to India\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Chinese\ncustoms statistics, imports from the PRC to India of the product under\ninvestigation increased from 4,8 million m\u00b2 in the financial year 2009/2010 to\n29,3 million m\u00b2 in the financial year 2012/2013.\nExports from the PRC to Indonesia\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Chinese\ncustoms statistics, imports from the PRC to Indonesia of the product under\ninvestigation increased from 5,78 million m\u00b2 in the financial year 2009/2010 to\n11,54 million m\u00b2 in the financial year 2012/2013.\n2.4.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on the change in\nthe pattern of trade\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overall decrease of the\nexports from the PRC to the Union and the parallel increase of both exports\nfrom India and Indonesia to the Union and exports from the PRC to India and\nIndonesia, following the imposition of provisional measures in February 2011\nand of definitive measures in August 2011, constitutes a change in the pattern\nof trade between the above mentioned countries, on the one hand, and of the\nexports of these countries to the Union, on the other hand.\n2.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nature of the circumvention\npractice\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Article 13(1) of the basic\nRegulation requires that the change in the pattern of trade stems from a\npractice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or economic\njustification other than the imposition of the duty. The practice, process or\nwork includes, inter alia, the consignment of the product subject to\nmeasures in force via third countries in accordance with Article 13(2) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the investigation\nevidence was found of transhipment practices via Indonesia and India and/or incorrect certificates of origin. For instance, some of the imports of the\nproduct concerned to the Union were transhipped through Dubai or Singapore with certificates of origin of Indonesia/India and a part of the imports to the Union was transhipped through an Indian company which did not cooperate in the\ninvestigation. The lack of cooperation by any of the producers of the product\nunder investigation, except Montex, is also an indication that there is no\ngenuine production in Indonesia and India that could justify the export levels\nfrom Indonesia and India to the Union. It is reasonable to expect that if there\nare genuine producers, they would try to distinguish themselves from\ncircumvention practices by participating in this investigation in the first\nplace. In addition, the investigation did not revealevidence of genuine production\nin the two contries concerned, other than that of Montex. Furthermore, the\nsurge in imports from these two countries indicates that the Chinese products\nare transhipped to the Union through India and Indonesia and/or with incorrect\ncertificates of origin. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The existence of transhipment of Chinese-origin products\nvia India and Indonesia is therefore confirmed.\n2.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insufficient due cause or\neconomic justification other than the imposition of the anti-dumping duty\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation did not bring\nto light any other due cause or economic justification for the transhipment\nthan the avoidance of the measures in force on the product concerned. No\nelements were found, other than the duty, which could be considered as a\ncompensation for the costs of transhipment, in particular regarding transport\nand reloading, of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in the\nPRC from the PRC via India and Indonesia.\n2.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Undermining of the remedial\neffect of the anti-dumping duty\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, it was assessed\nwhether the imports of the product under investigation into the Union had undermined the remedial effects of the measures in force in terms of quantities\nand prices. COMEXT data was used as the best data available concerning\nquantities and prices of exports by the non-cooperating companies in India and Indonesia. The prices so determined were compared to the injury elimination level\nestablished for the Union industry in recital (74) to the original Regulation.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The increase of imports\nfrom India to the Union from 0,35 million m2 in 2009/2010 to 13,10\nmillion m2 in the RP 2012/2013 was significant in terms of\nquantities, compared to (very low) volumes of imports from India before the\nimposition of the provisional measures in 2009/2010. Also, the increase of\nimports from Indonesia to the Union from 0,04 m2 in 2009/2010 to\n33,31 million m2 in the RP 2012/2013 was considered to be\nsubstantial in terms of quantities, compared to (very low) volumes of imports\nfrom Indonesia before the imposition of the provisionnal measures in 2009/2010.\n\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To assess whether the\nremedial effects of the measures in force are undermined in terms of prices the\nprices of the imports from Indonesia and India were compared with the injury\nelimination level as established in the original Regulation. The injury\nelimination level as established in the original Regulation was adjusted for\ninflation. The weighted average export price of exports from India and Indonesia was adjusted for post importation costs and quality adjustments as established\nin the original investigation for imports from PRC. The comparison showed\nsignificantly lower export prices for exports from the countries concerned to\nthe Union. It was therefore concluded that the remedial effects of the measures\nin force are also being undermined in terms of both quantities and prices. \n2.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evidence of dumping \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in accordance with\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation it was examined whether there was\nevidence of dumping.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original Regulation\nthe normal value was established on the basis of prices in Canada, which in that investigation was found to be an appropriate market economy analogue\ncountry for the PRC. In line with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation the\nnormal value as established in the original investigation was used. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The export prices from India and Indonesia were based on facts available under Article 18 of the basic Regulation. The\nexport price was the average export price of certain open mesh fabrics of glass\nfibres from each of the two contries concerned during the RP as reported in\nCOMEXT. The exports of the Indian company Montex were not reflected in the\nstatistics due to the misclassification of their products (see recital 25\nabove), and were not used for the calculation of the dumping margin.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of a fair\ncomparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the\nform of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price\ncomparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.\nAccordingly, adjustments were made for differences in transport, insurance and\npacking costs. Given that data available did not allow to establish the level\nof the adjustments to be made, the adjustments had to be established on the basis\nof the best facts available. Thus, the adjustment for these allowances was\nbased on a percentage calculated as the proportion of the total transport,\ninsurance and packing costs over the value of the Union sales transactions with\nCIF delivery terms provided by the cooperating Chinese exporting producers in\nthe original investigation. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, dumping was calculated by comparing\nthe weighted average normal value as established in the original Regulation and\nthe corresponding weighted average export prices of the two countries concerned\nduring this investigation\u2019s RP, expressed as a percentage of the CIF price at\nthe Union frontier duty unpaid.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comparison of the\nweighted average normal value and the weighted average export price as\nestablished showed dumping.\n3. MEASURES\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, it is\nconcluded that the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain\nopen mesh fabrics of glass fibres originating in the PRC was circumvented by\ntranshipment via India and Indonesia within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the\nbasic Regulation.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the\nfirst sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the measures in force\non imports of the product concerned, should be extended to imports of the same\nproduct but consigned from India and Indonesia, whether declared as originating\nin India and Indonesia or not.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The measures to be extended\nshould be the measures established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No\n791/2011 for \"all other companies\", which is a definitive\nanti-dumping duty of 62,9% applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price,\nbefore duty.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Articles\n13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provides that any extended\nmeasure should apply to imports which entered the Union under registration\nimposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those\nregistered imports of certain open mesh fabrics of glass fibres consigned from India and Indonesia.\n4. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION\n4.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 India\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\ntwo exporting producers came forward following initiation and submitted\nquestionnaire replies and requested exemption in accordance with Article 13(4)\nof the basic Regulation \u2013 Montex and Urja Products. \n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in the recital\n(11), it was found that one of the two companies, Urja Products does not\nproduce the product under investigation. The exemption under Article 13(4) of\nthe basic Regulation is not applicable to this company. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montex was found not to be\nengaged in the circumvention practices subject to this investigation. The\ncompany demostrated that it is a genuine producer whose production capacity\nexceeds the volume of exports of the product under investigation to the Union. The company submitted a complete set of data and was verified on spot. The verified\ndata relating to setting up of the company, purchase of machinery, production\nprocess, capacity, stocks, purchases of raw material, cost of production\nsupport the conclusion. Furthermore, this producer could demonstrate that it is\nnot related to any of the Chinese producers/exporters subject to the existing\nmeasures or to companies involved in the circumvention practices. Therefore,\nthe exemption from the extended duties could be granted to this company.\n4.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indonesia\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated in recital (10)\nno exporting producer in Indonesia submitted a request for exemption under\nArticle 13(4) of the basic Regulation. The investigation did not reveal any\ngenuine producer of the product under investigation in Indonesia.\n4.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newcomers\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Producers in India and Indonesia which did not participate in this investigation and/or did not export the\nproduct under investigation to the Union in the RP may request an exemption\nfrom the extended anti-dumping duty under Articles 11(3), 11(4) and 13(4) of\nthe basic Regulation. They will be asked to complete a questionnaire in order\nto enable the Commission to determine whether an exemption may be warranted.\nSuch exemption may be granted after the assessment of the market situation of\nthe product concerned, production capacity and capacity utilisation,\nprocurement and sales and the likelihood of a continuation of practices for\nwhich there is insufficient due cause or economic justification and the\nevidence of dumping. The Commission would normally also carry out an\non-the-spot verification visit. The request should be addressed to the\nCommission, with all relevant information, in particular any modification in\nthe company\u2019s activities linked to the production and sales.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where an exemption is\nwarranted, the Commission will, after consultation of the Advisory Committee,\npropose the amendment of the extended measures in force accordingly.\nSubsequently, any exemption granted will be monitored to ensure compliance with\nthe conditions.\n5.
