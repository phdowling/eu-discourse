It has\r\nalso made strong progress on regulatory approximation leading to convergence\r\nwith EU laws and standards.\nIn the framework of these negotiations, the\r\nParties have proposed to fully liberalise the bilateral trade in wine.\nRecently Moldova is experiencing\r\ndifficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which\r\nthreaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously\r\npursued by the Moldovan government. The agricultural sector represents around\r\n40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it,\r\nproviding employment to some 300,000 people (one fourth of the working\r\npopulation), who are mainly living in rural areas and cultivating medium to\r\nsmaller family plots.\nTaking into consideration the above the\r\nEuropean Commission proposes to fully liberalise import of wine from Moldova into the EU without delay by amending Council Regulation (EC) 55/2008[1] and removing wine from\r\nTable 1 of Annex I thereof. \nCurrently the WTO waiver for the tariff\r\npreferences granted to Moldova does not cover the additional preferences for\r\nwine envisaged by the proposed regulation. Moreover, the waiver will expire on\r\n31 December 2013. Accordingly, the EU should request pursuant to paragraph 3 of\r\nArticle IX of the WTO Agreement the necessary extension and amendment of the\r\nscope of the existing waiver of its obligations under Article I and Article\r\nXIII of the GATT 1994 to the extent necessary to permit the EU to afford\r\nduty-free preferential treatment to wine originating in Moldova, without being\r\nrequired to extend the same duty-free treatment to like products of any other\r\nWTO Member. A Commission proposal to request the extension of the waiver is\r\nalready pending before the Council.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL BASIS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe legal basis for the proposal is Article\r\n207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe proposed Regulation does not incur\r\ncosts charged to the EU budget. As the general level of wine imports from\r\nMoldova is merely 0,6% of all EU wine imports further market opening is not expected\r\nto create negative effects for the EU.\n2013/0325 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Council Regulation (EC) No\r\n55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative\r\nprocedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)              \r\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 55/2008[2] established a specific\r\nscheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for the Republic of Moldova (hereinafter \"Moldova\"). That scheme gives all products originating in\r\nMoldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural\r\nproducts listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions\r\nhave been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within\r\nthe limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. \n(2)              \r\nIn the framework of the European Neighbourhood\r\nPolicy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with\r\nthe Union. Moldova has also already made strong progress on regulatory\r\napproximation leading to convergence with Union laws and standards.\n(3)              \r\nNegotiations on a new Association Agreement, including\r\nthe establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) between\r\nthe Union and Moldova started in January 2010 and were finalised in July 2013. This\r\nAgreement provides for the full liberalisation of the bilateral trade in wine.\n(4)              \r\nIn order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the ENP and the Eastern Partnership, and to provide an attractive and\r\nreliable market for its wine exports the import of wine from Moldova into the Union should be liberalised without delay.\n(5)              \r\nRegulation (EC) No 55/2008 should therefore be\r\namended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nIn the table in point 1 of Annex I to Regulation\r\n(EC) No 55/2008, the last row concerning order No 09.0514 \"Wine of fresh\r\ngrapes other than sparkling wine\" is deleted.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on\r\nthe seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of\r\nthe European Union.\nThis\r\nRegulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all\r\nMember States.\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the European Parliament\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\nthe\r\nPresident\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the President\n FINANCIAL STATEMENT || FinancSt/2013 JE/nh/3263078-Rev1 6.0.2013.1 \n   || DATE: 18/09/2013 \n 1. || BUDGET HEADING: Chapter 12 \u2013 Customs duties and other duties || APPROPRIATIONS: Amending Budget 1/2013: EUR 18 654.2 million \n 2. || TITLE: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova.   \n 3. || LEGAL BASIS: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular Article 207(2).   \n 4. || AIMS: To fully liberalise import of wine from Moldova into the EU.   \n 5. || FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS || 12 MONTH PERIOD (EUR million) || CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR 2013 (EUR million) || FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR 2014 (EUR million) \n 5.0 || EXPENDITURE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHARGED TO THE EC BUDGET (REFUNDS/INTERVENTIONS) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL AUTHORITIES -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OTHER || - || - || - \n 5.1 || REVENUE -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OWN RESOURCES OF THE EC (LEVIES/CUSTOMS DUTIES) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATIONAL || - || - || - \n   ||   || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 || 2018 \n 5.0.1 || ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE || - || - || - || - \n 5.1.1 || ESTIMATED REVENUE || - || - || - || - \n 5.2 || METHOD OF CALCULATION: - \n 6.0 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED FROM APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED IN THE RELEVANT CHAPTER OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || YES NO \n 6.1 || CAN THE PROJECT BE FINANCED BY TRANSFER BETWEEN CHAPTERS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET? || YES NO \n 6.2 || WILL A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET BE NECESSARY? || YES NO \n 6.3 || WILL APPROPRIATIONS NEED TO BE ENTERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS? || YES NO \n OBSERVATIONS : Imports from Moldova in recent years have not attained the annual duty free tariff quota quantities.
