Article 349 of the TFEU (formerly\r\nArticle 299(2) of the EC Treaty) provides, however, for the possibility of\r\nintroducing specific measures for those regions because of the permanent\r\nhandicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of the outermost\r\nregions.\nCouncil\r\nDecision 2002/546/EC of 20 June 2002[1],\r\nadopted on the basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, authorises Spain, up\r\nto 31 December 2011, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the \u2018Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercanc\u00edas en las Islas\r\nCanarias\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018AIEM\u2019) to certain products\r\nproduced locally in the Canary Islands. The Annex to that Decision contains a\r\nlist of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The\r\ndifference between the taxation of locally manufactured products and the\r\ntaxation of other products may not exceed 5, 15 or 25 percentage points,\r\ndepending on the product. \nDecision\r\n2002/546/EC sets out the reasons for adopting specific measures, which include\r\nisolation, raw material and energy dependence, the obligation to build up\r\nstocks, the small size of the local market and the low level of export\r\nactivity. The combination of these handicaps means that production costs, and\r\ntherefore the cost price of goods produced locally, are increased, so that\r\nwithout specific measures they would be less competitive than goods produced\r\nelsewhere, even taking into account the cost of transporting the latter to the\r\nCanary Islands. This would make it harder to maintain local production. The\r\nspecific measures covered by Decision 2002/546/EC were thus designed to\r\nstrengthen local industry by making it more competitive. \nThe AIEM is an indirect State tax levied in a\r\nsingle stage on the supplies of goods in the Canary Islands effected by the\r\nproducers of the goods and on the import into the territory of the Canary Islands of comparable goods or similar goods of the same type, irrespective of their\r\nplace of origin. The taxable base for the imported goods is based on the\r\ncustoms value, and that of the supplies of goods by producers in the Canary Islands is based on the total amount of the consideration. The specific measures\r\ncovered by Decision 2002/546/EC establish a form of differentiated\r\ntaxation, benefiting the local production of some products. This tax benefit\r\nconstitutes state aid that requires the approval of the Commission, which was granted by Decision on State Aid NN 22/2008.\nThe global\r\neconomic crisis of 2009, with its impact in the reduction of travelling, had\r\nsevere consequences on the economy of the Canary Islands, which is highly\r\ndependent on revenues from tourism. In particular, the reduction of working\r\nforce in the tourism sector has led to a major increase in the unemployment\r\nrate in the Canary Islands. The unemployment rate that in the period of\r\n2001-2007 had oscillated between 10.4% and 12%, rose to 17.3% in 2008 and to 26.2%\r\nin 2009. This evolution confirms the danger of an economy highly dependent on\r\ntourism and the need to promote a diversification in the economic activities.\nOn 16 November\r\n2010, Spain submitted a request to the Commission to extend the period of\r\napplication of Decision 2002/546/EC for two years, so that its expiry date\r\ncoincided with the one of the Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013[2].\nIn addition, Spain also introduced a request for the extension for two years of the period of\r\napplication of Decision on State Aid NN 22/2008, according to which the aid\r\ngiven by the Spanish authorities, in respect of the AIEM, was compatible with\r\nthe common market. The Commission authorized this extension for two years by\r\nmeans of its Decision on State Aid SA.31950 (N 544/2010)[3], which extended the period of Decision\r\non State Aid NN 22/2008 up to 31 December 2013. \nAs regard the\r\nrequest for the extension of the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC,\r\nthe Commission assessed it in light of the scale of the handicaps affecting the\r\n Canary Islands and came to the conclusion that it was justified to grant the\r\nrequested extension. \nIn fact, the\r\nreport from the Commission to the Council on the application of the special\r\narrangements concerning the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands, adopted\r\non 28 August 2008, confirmed that the AIEM was functioning in a satisfactory\r\nmanner and without the need to any amendments to the provisions of Decision\r\n2002/546/EC. \nTherefore, Council Decision 895/2011/EU of 19 December 2011[4] amended Decision 2002/546/EC,\r\nextending its period of application up to 31 December 2013.\nThe Spanish\r\nauthorities have requested the renewal of the special AIEM rules for goods\r\nproduced in the Canary Islands for the period 2014-2020, modifying the list of\r\nproducts and the maximimum rates applicable to some of them. The renewal needs\r\nto be approved both by a Council Decision under Article 349 TFEU and by a\r\nCommission Decision on State Aid.\nOn 28 June 2013\r\nthe Commission has adopted new\r\nregional aid guidelines for the period 2014-2020[5].\r\nThese Guidelines are part of a broader strategy to modernise state aid control,\r\naiming at fostering growth in the Single Market by encouraging more effective\r\naid measures and focusing the Commission\u2019s enforcement on cases with the\r\nbiggest impact on competition.\nConsidering\r\nthat these Guidelines will enter into force on 1 July 2014, it seems justified\r\nto extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by\r\nDecision 895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with\r\nthe date of entry into force of the Guidelines.\nDecision 2002/546/EC,\r\nas amended by Decision 895/2011/EU, should therefore be amended accordingly.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nThe relevant Directorates-General of the\r\nEuropean Commission were consulted on this proposal and the document was\r\nrevised to incorporate the suggestions made. \nAs the present proposal only proposes to\r\nextend the application of the existing Council Decision for a limited period of\r\ntime (six months), for the same products and with the same limits, an impact\r\nassessment does not appear necessary.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nSummary of\r\nthe proposed measures\nTo extend the\r\nperiod of application of Decision 2002/546/EC (as amended by Decision\r\n895/2011/EU), that authorises Spain to apply exemptions from or reductions in\r\nthe tax known as AIEM for certain products produced locally in the Canary\r\nIslands.\nLegal basis \nArticle 349\r\nTFEU.\nSubsidiarity\r\nprinciple\nOnly the\r\nCouncil is authorised, on the basis of Article 349 TFEU, to adopt specific\r\nmeasures in favour of the outermost regions to adjust the application of the\r\nTreaties to those regions, including the common policies, because of the\r\npermanent handicaps which affect the economic and social conditions of the\r\noutermost regions.\nThe proposal\r\ntherefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. \nProportionality\r\nprinciple\nThe proposal\r\ncomplies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:\nIts purpose is to\r\nextend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by\r\nDecision 895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with\r\nthe date of entry into force of the Guidelines on regional State aid for\r\n2014-2020. \nAny further\r\nextension will be authorised only following a fresh product-by-product\r\nanalysis. \nChoice of instrument\nProposed\r\ninstrument: Council Decision.\nOther\r\ninstruments would not have been appropriate for the following reason:\nThe text to be\r\namended is itself a Council Decision, adopted on the same legal basis (Article\r\n349 TFEU, former Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal\r\nhas no impact on the budget of the European Union.\n2013/0387 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DECISION\namending Decision 2002/546/EC as regards\r\nits period of application\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 (formerly\r\nArticle 299(2) of the EC Treaty) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Parliament[6],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n2002/546/EC of 20 June 2002[7],\r\nadopted on the basis of Article 299 of the EC Treaty, authorises Spain, up to\r\n31 December 2011, to apply exemptions from or reductions in the tax known as\r\n\u2018Arbitrio sobre Importaciones y Entregas de Mercanc\u00edas en las Islas Canarias\u2019\r\n(hereinafter \u2018AIEM\u2019) to certain products produced locally in the Canary\r\nIslands. The Annex to that Decision contains a list of products to which tax\r\nexemptions and reductions may be applied. The difference between the taxation\r\nof locally manufactured products and the taxation of other products may not\r\nexceed 5, 15 or 25 percentage points, depending on the product.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nexemptions from and reductions in the AIEM establish differentiated taxation,\r\nbenefiting the local production of some products. This constitutes state aid\r\nthat requires the approval of the Commission.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision\r\n895/2011/EU of 19 December 2011[8]\r\namended Decision 2002/546/EC, extending its period of application up to 31\r\nDecember 2013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 28 June 2013 the\r\nCommission has adopted its Guidelines on regional State aid for 2014-2020[9], setting out how Member States\r\ncan grant aid to companies in order to support the development of disadvantaged\r\nregions in Europe between 2014 and 2020. These Guidelines, which will enter\r\ninto force on 1 July 2014, form part of a broader strategy to modernise state\r\naid control, aiming at fostering growth in the Single Market by encouraging\r\nmore effective aid measures and focusing the Commission\u2019s enforcement on cases\r\nwith the biggest impact on competition[10].\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is justified to extend\r\nthe period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC, as amended by Decision\r\n895/2011/EU, for six months, so that its expiry date coincides with the date of\r\nentry into force of the Guidelines on regional State aid for 2014-2020.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decision 2002/546/EC, as\r\namended by Decision 895/2011/EU, should be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: \nArticle 1\nIn the first sentence of Article 1(1) of\r\nDecision 2002/546/EC, as amended by Decision 895/2011/EU, the date \u201c31 December\r\n2013\u201d is replaced by \u201c30 June 2014\u201d.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the\r\nday of its adoption.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.\nDone at Brussels,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nthe Council\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nPresident\n[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 179, 9.7.2002, p.22-27\n[2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 54, 4.3.2006, p. 13\n[3]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 237, 13.8.2011, p 1.\n[4]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 345, 29.12.2011, p. 17.\n[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C 209, 23.7.2013, p. 1.\n[6]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ C , , p. .\n[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 179,9.7.2001, p. 22.\n[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OJ L 345, 29.12.2011, p. 17.\n[9]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C (2013) 3769, 28.6.2013.\n[10]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 COM/2012/0209 final.\n\n\n\n\nTop  \n  "
