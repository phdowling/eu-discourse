The economy experienced a recession\r\nin 2011 and, despite the moderate economic recovery witnessed in 2012, when\r\ntourism and foreign direct investment (FDI) rebounded and economic activity\r\npicked up, the macroeconomic situation remains very vulnerable. In\r\nparticular, the fiscal and balance of payments situation has deteriorated quite\r\nmarkedly, generating important financing needs.\nAt the same time, following the ousting of\r\nPresident Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, the country is taking significant steps\r\ntowards the establishment of democratic mechanisms, including the organisation\r\nof free elections and the creation of a National Constituent Assembly. Although\r\nthe political transition has not been without difficulties and episodes of\r\ninstability, the process is expected to result in the approval of a new\r\nConstitution and the organisation of new elections in the first half of 2014.\nAgainst this\r\nbackground, the Tunisian authorities reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff on a 24-month Stand-By\r\nArrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion (400% of quota), which\r\nwas approved by the IMF Board in June. The aim of the SBA is to support the\r\ngovernment\u2019s economic reform programme, reduce economic vulnerabilities and\r\nfoster sustainable and inclusive growth.\nIn this\r\ncontext, the Tunisian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA)\r\nfrom the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million on 28 August 2013, with a\r\nportion in the form of a grant (see the request letter in Annex). The European\r\nCommission submits to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to\r\ngrant a MFA to the Republic of Tunisia amounting to a maximum of EUR 250 million.\r\nThe assistance would take the form of medium-term loans, with no\r\ngrant component being envisaged given that Tunisia does not meet the\r\neligibility criteria for the use of grants in MFA operations. \nThe proposed EU MFA\r\nwould help Tunisia cover part of its residual external financing needs for\r\nthe period 2014-15 in the context of the IMF programme, estimated at USD\r\n3.0 billion. It would reduce the economy\u2019s short-term balance of\r\npayments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the adjustment and reform\r\nprogramme agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the reforms agreed\r\nunder the EU\u2019s budgetary support operations, in particular the State Building\r\nContract Programme d\u2019Appui \u00e0 la Relance (PAR), which is financed in part\r\nby the EU\u2019s Support for Partnership Reform and Inclusive Growth (SPRING) programme.\nThe proposed MFA is\r\nin line with the aims of the G8\u2019s Deauville Partnership initiative and the\r\norientations of the new European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). It would signal to\r\nthe other countries in the region that the EU is ready to support countries\r\nembarking on political reforms, in moments of economic difficulties.\nIn this context, the\r\nCommission considers that the political and economic pre-conditions for a MFA\r\noperation of the proposed amount and nature are satisfied.\n\u00b7      General context\nAfter a severe\r\nrecession in 2011, when the economy contracted by 1.9% due to the domestic\r\npolitical unrest and the Libyan conflict, a moderate recovery started in 2012\r\ndespite an adverse international and domestic environment, with real GDP\r\ngrowth picking up to an estimated 3.6%, helped mainly by the rebound in\r\ntourism and FDI inflows. Despite the promising pick-up in manufacturing\r\nactivity and increase in tourism shown by mid-2013, the ongoing political stalemate,\r\nlower than expected growth in the EU (Tunisia\u2019s main trading partner) and\r\nemerging markets, and a bad harvest have slowed down economic activity. The IMF\r\nrecently revised its forecast for GDP growth in 2013 to 3% from 4%. The growth forecast\r\nfor 2014 has also been revised downwards from 4.5% to 3.7%, with risks strongly\r\ntilted to the downside reflecting the domestic political situation.\nUnemployment\r\nremains a key concern with an unemployment rate of 15.9%\r\nat end-June 2013 compared with 13.5% before the revolution, and is particularly\r\nhigh among young people and women. There have been\r\ninflationary pressures since early 2012, largely explained\r\nby increases in administered energy prices, and by higher food prices.. However,\r\ninflation has dropped back to 5.7% (and core inflation to 4.4%) by September and\r\nis expected to remain stable at around that level.\nMonetary\r\npolicy was accommodative during 2011 and the first\r\nmonths of 2012 in response to the existence of a large output gap and\r\nrelatively stable core inflation. However, as inflation started to accelerate\r\nand external and fiscal balances further deteriorated, the Central Bank of\r\nTunisia (CBT) took some tightening measures, increasing its benchmark policy\r\nrate by 50 bps since August 2012 (to 4%). \nRegarding the public\r\nfinances, the IMF programme envisaged a modest fiscal adjustment for 2013,\r\nwith the fiscal deficit targeted to increase to 7.3% of GDP, broadly reflecting\r\nthe cost of the planned recapitalisation of banks and the repayment of arrears.\r\nHowever, recent trends suggest that in the absence of new measures, there will\r\nbe a considerable fiscal slippage (the deficit is now projected to reach 8.4%\r\nof GDP unless corrective measures are taken). This fiscal deterioration in 2013\r\nis expected to be partially compensated, like last year, by a lower execution\r\nrate of public investments.\nFor 2014, the\r\nIMF is calling for an additional adjustment of about 2 percentage points of GDP\r\nin order to reach the programmed deficit target of 6.4% of GDP. Corrective\r\nmeasures are likely to include adjusting energy tariffs while developing a\r\nbetter targeted social safety net, increasing control over the public wage bill\r\n(which represents about 13% of GDP and 60% of revenues), increases in excises\r\nand measures to improve the efficiency of public expenditures. The\r\nrecapitalisation needs for the financial sector should also be properly\r\nbudgeted in the law. \nThe general government debt remained at 44% of GDP in 2012, but\r\nit is projected to increase slightly to 45.3% of GDP by the end of this year\r\nand to peak at 49.5% of GDP in 2014. Debt service remains at a manageable 6% of\r\ntotal budget expenditures.\nThe rebound in growth\r\nthroughout 2012 amid subdued world demand (particularly from the EU) and persistently\r\nhigh commodity prices contributed to a widening of the current account\r\ndeficit to 8.1% of GDP. The deficit has further increased in 2013, with the\r\nlatest projections indicating a worsening to around 8.3% of GDP compared with\r\nthe 7.5% of GDP targeted under the IMF programme. In addition, so far in 2013\r\nFDI inflows have been about 40% below those initially assumed in the IMF\r\nprogramme. Moreover, disbursements of official assistance are well below what\r\nhad been programmed. As a result of these shortfalls in financing and the\r\nhigher than programmed current account deficit, Tunisia faces a significant\r\nbalance of payments gap (of around USD 750 million) for 2013, although a\r\npotential loan from Qatar may contribute to reducing it. The IMF expects this shortfall\r\nto be covered by a decline of USD 600 million in foreign reserves compared to\r\nthe original programme targets and by a further compression in public\r\ninvestment (which has high import content).\nAfter\r\nrecovering partially in 2012, official foreign exchange reserves started to\r\ndecline rapidly in early 2013. By end-October 2013, reserves stood at USD\r\n6.9 billion, covering only 104 days of imports. They are expected to\r\nfinish 2013 at USD 7.5 billion, a decrease of USD 1.1 billion in 2013,\r\nwhich compares to an originally targeted increase of USD 400 million for\r\nthe year. The dinar has depreciated, in nominal effective terms, by around 12%\r\nsince the revolution, and by around 6% since the beginning of 2013.\nThe 2011 crisis had a negative impact on a\r\nnumber of key banks, notably the public ones, who were more exposed to the\r\nhard-hit tourism sector. This led the CBT to provide substantial liquidity to\r\nthe commercial banks during 2012 to help them cover their refinancing needs,\r\nalthough a gradual unwinding of liquidity injections has already been\r\ninitiated. Under the programme agreed with the IMF, the authorities intend to\r\nproceed with the recapitalisation and rehabilitation of the banks affected by\r\nthe crisis.\nIn addition to the need to restructure and\r\nstrengthen the banking system, other key structural reform challenges include\r\nreducing unemployment while raising participation rates (notably among women),\r\nreducing income and regional disparities, reducing the excessive reliance on\r\nthe development of a low value-added export industry located in the coastline,\r\nand reforming the inefficient price subsidy system while strengthening the\r\nsocial safety net.\nOn 7 June 2013 the IMF Board approved, as\r\nnoted, an USD 1.75 billion (400% of the Tunisian quota), two-year, SBA. The main objectives of the\r\nIMF programme are: i) to maintain macroeconomic\r\nstability, partly through the implementation of structural reforms and the\r\nselective recapitalisation of banks; ii) to support inclusive growth;\r\niii) to reduce external vulnerabilities; and iv) to strengthen\r\ninvestor and donor confidence. \nRevised\r\nprojections point towards significant balance of\r\npayments needs for the 2014-2015 period, with the overall external financing\r\ngap estimated at USD 4.4 billion. This financing gap is broadly attributed\r\nto two factors; a persistently large current account deficit and the need to\r\nbuild up foreign exchange reserves over the period 2014-2015. Net of\r\ndisbursements under the SBA and the World Bank's Development Policy Loan (DPL),\r\nTunisia faces a residual external financing gap of USD 3.0 billion over this\r\nperiod. The proposed EU MFA would contribute to cover some 10.8% of the\r\nresidual financing gap for the 2014-2015 period.\n\u00b7      Existing provisions in the area of the proposal\nNone\n\u00b7      Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union\nThe EU seeks to\r\ndevelop a close relationship to Tunisia and to support Tunisia\u2019s economic and\r\npolitical reforms. In 1995, Tunisia became the first country in the Southern\r\nMediterranean to sign an Association Agreement with the EU. This agreement\r\ncontinues to be the legal basis for bilateral cooperation. Bilateral relations\r\nhave been further reinforced under the EU\u2019s ENP, including through the adoption\r\nof five-year ENP Action Plans establishing strategic objectives for this\r\ncooperation, the latest of which covers 2013-2017. Tunisia is also a member of\r\nthe Union for the Mediterranean. Economic ties with the EU are important. Tunisia\r\nconducts the largest share of its trade with the EU. In 2012, the EU was the\r\nsource of 59.3% of Tunisia\u2019s imports and the destination of 68.1% of its exports.\r\nTunisia has also a high dependence on the EU in terms of FDI and other\r\nfinancial flows, remittances and tourism inflows. Tunisia finalized the\r\ndismantling of tariffs for industrial products in 2008, thus becoming the first\r\nMediterranean country to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU. The EU\r\nhas offered Tunisia to negotiate a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement\r\nwith the goal to allowing the full access of Tunisia to the EU\u2019s single market,\r\nalthough negotiations have not yet started. \nThe EU MFA would\r\ncomplement the total EUR 445 million in grants mobilised under the ENPI and the\r\nSPRING Programme, and in particular the conditionalities envisaged under the\r\nPAR III package in which the EU is participating. Close coordination will be\r\nensured in the implementation of these two programmes, since both are\r\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. While the envisaged MFA will provide\r\nshort term balance of payments support the state building contract will support\r\nthe completion of the democratic transition process through economic and\r\npolitical governance measures. By supporting the adoption by the Tunisian\r\nauthorities of an appropriate framework for macroeconomic policy and structural\r\nreforms, the EU\u2019s MFA would enhance the added value and effectiveness of the\r\nEU's involvement through other financial instruments. In addition, it would\r\ncomplement the resources made available by the international financial\r\ninstitutions, bilateral donors and other EU financial institutions, thus\r\ncontributing to the overall effectiveness of the package of financial support\r\nagreed by the international donor community in the aftermath of the crisis.\nIn sum, while\r\nTunisia\u2019s road to full democracy is not without difficulties and significant\r\nuncertainties remain, the country has taken significant steps towards political\r\nreform, with the aim of strengthening democratic institutions and mechanisms,\r\nincluding a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and the respect\r\nfor human rights. The country is also envisaging an economic reform programme\r\naimed at laying the ground for a sustainable, employment generating and\r\nequitable growth model. \nThe MFA proposal is\r\nconsistent with the EU's commitment to support Tunisia's economic and political\r\ntransition. It is also consistent with the wording of two MFA decisions on the\r\nKyrgyz Republic and Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan[1].\r\nIn particular, and as explained in more detail in the accompanying Staff\r\nWorking Document, the Commission's proposal is consistent with the following\r\nprinciples: exceptional character, political preconditions, complementarity,\r\nconditionality and financial discipline. \nThe Commission will\r\ncontinue to monitor and assess during the life of the MFA operation\r\nsatisfaction of these criteria. Regarding the assessment of the political\r\npreconditions, Commission services will work in close liaison with the European\r\nExternal Action Service.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\u00b7      Consultation of interested parties\nMFA is provided as an integral part of the\r\ninternational support to the economic stabilisation of Tunisia. In the\r\npreparation of this proposal for MFA, the Commission services have consulted\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have already put\r\nin place sizeable financing programs. The Commission has also been in regular\r\ncontact with the Tunisian authorities.\n\u00b7      Collection and use of expertise\nAn Operational Assessment verifying the\r\nquality and reliability of Tunisia's public financial circuits and\r\nadministrative procedures will be carried out by the Commission with the\r\nassistance of external experts during the month of December 2013.\n\u00b7      Impact assessment\nThe MFA and the economic adjustment and\r\nreform programme attached to it will help alleviate Tunisia's short-term\r\nfinancing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening the\r\nbalance of payments and fiscal positions and raising sustainable growth, as\r\nagreed with the IMF. It will notably help improve the efficiency and\r\ntransparency of public finance management; promote fiscal reforms to increase\r\ntax collections and improve the progressivity of the tax system; support\r\nexisting efforts to strengthen the social safety net; promote labour market\r\nreforms (to reduce unemployment and raise participation rates, notably among\r\nwomen); and facilitate the adoption of measures to improve the regulatory\r\nframework for trade and investment.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\n\u00b7      Summary of the proposed action\nThe European Union shall make available to\r\nTunisia MFA for a total maximum amount of \u00a0EUR 250 million, provided in the\r\nform of a medium term loan. The objetives of the assistance will be to: (i)\r\ncontribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2014-15, as\r\nidentified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF; (ii) support\r\nthe fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of\r\nthe IMF programme; (iii) facilitate and encourage efforts of the authorities of\r\nTunisia to implement measures identified under the EU-Tunisia ENP Action Plan,\r\nand; (iv) support structural reform efforts aimed at improving the overall\r\nmacroeconomic management, strenghening economic governance and transparency,\r\nand improving conditions for sustainable growth.\nThe assistance is planned to be disbursed\r\nin three loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment (EUR 90\r\nmillion) is expected to take place in mid-2014. The second instalment (EUR 80\r\nmillion), conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed towards\r\nthe end of 2014. The third and last instalment (EUR 80 million) could be made\r\navailable, provided the policy measures are met, during the first half of 2015.\r\nThe assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the\r\nprevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial\r\nRegulation, are applicable. \nAs usual with the MFA instrument, the\r\ndisbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the\r\nIMF's financial arrangement (the SBA). In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian\r\nauthorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum\r\nof Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at\r\nimproving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for\r\nsustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public\r\nfinance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety\r\nnet; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for\r\ntrade and investment).\nThe decision to disburse the full MFA in the form of loans is\r\njustified by Tunisia's level of development (as measured by its per-capita\r\nincome) and debt indicators. It is also consistent with the treatment given to Tunisia\r\nby the World Bank and the IMF. Indeed, Tunisia is not eligible for concessional financing from\r\neither the IDA or the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust.\n\u00b7      Legal basis\nThe\r\nlegal basis for this proposal is Article 212 of the TFEU. \n\u00b7      Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies to the\r\nextent that the objectives of restoring short-term macroeconomic stability in Tunisia\r\ncannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore be\r\nbetter achieved by the European Union. The main reasons are the budgetary\r\nconstraints faced at the national level and the need for strong donor\r\ncoordination in order to maximise the scale and effectivenes of the assistance.\r\n\n\u00b7      Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the\r\nproportionality principle: it confines itself to the minimum required in order\r\nto achieve the objectives of short-term macroeconomic stability and does not go\r\nbeyond what is necessary for that purpose. \nAs identified by the Commission based on\r\nthe estimates of the IMF in the context of the SBA, the amount of the\r\nassistance corresponds to 10.8% of the residual financing gap for the period\r\n2014-2015. Given the assistance pledged to Tunisia by other bilateral and\r\nmultilateral donors and creditors, it is deemed an appropriate level of\r\nburden-sharing for the EU.\n\u00b7      Choice of instruments\nProject finance or technical assistance\r\nwould not be suitable or sufficient to address these macroeconomic objectives.\r\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be\r\nto alleviate the external financial constraint and to help create a stable\r\nmacroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable balance of\r\npayments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for structural\r\nreforms. By helping to put in place an appropriate overall framework for\r\nmacroeconomic and structural policies, MFA can increase the effectiveness of\r\nthe actions financed in Tunisia under other, more narrowly focused EU financial\r\ninstruments.\nThe proposed programme will also strengthen\r\nthe government's reform commitment and its aspiration towards closer relations\r\nwith the EU. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate\r\nconditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the\r\nprogramme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU is ready\r\nto support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in times\r\nof economic difficulties.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\nThe\r\nplanned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be\r\nfinanced through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on\r\nbehalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the\r\nprovisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund\r\nfor external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"the\r\nprovisioning of the Guarantee Fund\")[2]. Assuming that the\r\nfirst and second loan disbursements will be made in 2014 for a total amount of\r\nEUR 170 million and the third loan disbursement in 2015 for the amount of EUR 80\r\nmillion, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the\r\nprovisioning will take place in the 2016-17 budgets.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7      Review/revision/sunset clause\nThe proposal includes a sunset clause. The\r\nproposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from\r\nthe first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding.\n2013/0416 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\nproviding macro-financial assistance to\r\nthe Republic of Tunisia\nTHE\r\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 212\r\nthereof,\nHaving regard to\r\nthe proposal from the European Commission[3],\r\n\nAfter transmission\r\nof the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in\r\naccordance with the ordinary legislative procedure[4],\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relations between the\r\nEuropean Union ('the Union') and the Republic of Tunisia ('Tunisia') are\r\ndeveloping within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The\r\nEuro-Med Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member\r\nStates, on the one hand, and Tunisia, on the other hand, came into force on 1\r\nMarch 1998. Under this Association Agreement, Tunisia finalized dismantling\r\ntariffs for industrial products in 2008, thus making Tunisia the first\r\nMediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with the Union. Bilateral\r\npolitical dialogue and economic cooperation have been further developed within\r\nthe framework of ENP Action Plans, of which the most recent under discussion\r\nwould cover the period 2013-2017.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tunisia's economy has been\r\nsignificantly affected by domestic events related to the events in the Southern\r\nMediterranean since the end of 2010, known as the \"Arab Spring\", and\r\nby the regional unrest that followed, notably in neighbouring Libya. These\r\nevents and the weak global economic environment, in particular the recession in\r\nthe euro area (Tunisia's main trading and financial partner), has had a very\r\nnegative impact on the Tunisian economy, leading to a slowdown in growth and\r\ngenerating large external and budgetary financing gaps.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the ousting of\r\nPresident Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, Tunisia\u2019s first free and democratic\r\nelections took place on 23 October 2011. A National Constituent Assembly has\r\nbeen in place since then, and although the political transition has not been\r\nwithout difficulties, there are concerted efforts from the main political\r\nactors to proceed with reforms towards a fully-fledged democratic system. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the Arab Spring\r\nbegan, the Union has declared on various occasions its commitment to support\r\nTunisia in its economic and political reform process. This commitment was\r\nreaffirmed in the conclusions of the meeting of the Association Council between\r\nthe Union and Tunisia in November 2012. Financial support from the Union to\r\nTunisia's reform process is consistent with the Union's policy towards the\r\nSouthern Mediterranean region, as set out in the context of the\r\nENP.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union macro-financial\r\nassistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and\r\nundesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at restoring a\r\nbeneficiary's sustainable external finance situation and should underpin the\r\nimplementation of a policy programme containing strong adjustment and\r\nstructural reform measures designed to improve the balance of payment position,\r\nin particular over the programme period, and reinforce the implementation of\r\nrelevant agreements and programmes with the Union. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April 2013, the Tunisian\r\nauthorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on a\r\nnon-precautionary three-year Stand-By-Arrangement ('IMF programme') of SDR 1,150\r\nmillion (Special Drawing Rights) in support of Tunisia's economic adjustment\r\nand reform programme. The objectives of the IMF programme are consistent with\r\nthe purpose of the Union macro-financial assistance, namely to alleviate\r\nshort-term balance of payment difficulties, and the implementation of strong\r\nadjustment measures consistent with the aim of Union macro-financial\r\nassistance. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union has made available\r\nEUR 290 million in grants for the period 2011-13 under its regular cooperation\r\nprogramme in support of Tunisia's economic and political reform agenda. In\r\naddition, EUR 155 million has been allocated to Tunisia in 2011-2013 under the\r\n\"Support for partnership, reforms and inclusive growth\" (SPRING)\r\nprogramme.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In August 2013, in view of\r\nthe worsening economic situation and outlook, Tunisia requested Union\r\nmacro-financial assistance.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that Tunisia is a\r\ncountry covered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive\r\nUnion macro-financial assistance.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that there is still a\r\nsignificant residual external financing gap in Tunisia's balance of payments\r\nover and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral\r\ninstitutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Tunisia\r\n(\"the Union's macro-financial assistance\") is, under the current\r\nexceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Tunisia's\r\nrequest to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF\r\nprogramme. The Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic\r\nstabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Tunisia, supplementing\r\nresources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external\r\nfinancing situation for Tunisia thereby supporting its economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The determination of the\r\namount of the Union's macro-financial assistance is based on a complete\r\nquantitative assessment of Tunisia's residual external financing needs, and\r\ntakes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in\r\nparticular the international reserves at its disposal. The Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources\r\nprovided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the\r\nassistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from\r\nmultilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the\r\nUnion and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's\r\nother external financing instruments in Tunisia and the added value of the\r\noverall Union involvement. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should\r\nensure that the Union's macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially\r\nin line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the\r\ndifferent areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support the Union's external policy towards Tunisia.\r\nCommission services and the European External Action Service should work\r\nclosely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order\r\nto coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should support Tunisia's commitment to values shared with the Union,\r\nincluding democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human\r\nrights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its\r\ncommitment to the principles of open, rule-based and fair trade.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pre-condition for\r\ngranting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Tunisia respects\r\neffective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system\r\nand the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the\r\nspecific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen\r\nthe efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance\r\nmanagement systems in Tunisia and to promote structural reforms aimed at\r\nsupporting sustainable and inclusive growth, employment creation and fiscal\r\nconsolidation. Both fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of\r\nthose objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission.\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\r\nUnion\u2019s financial interests linked to the Union\u2019s macro-financial assistance\r\nare protected efficiently, Tunisia should take appropriate measures relating to\r\nthe prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other\r\nirregularities linked to the assistance. In addition, provision should be made\r\nfor the Commission to carry out checks and for the European Court of Auditors\r\nto carry out audits.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Release of the Union's\r\nmacro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the European\r\nParliament and the Council. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amounts of the\r\nprovision required for macro-financial assistance should be consistent with the\r\nbudgetary appropriations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the\r\nEuropean Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of\r\nthis Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments\r\nrelating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\r\nconditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should\r\nbe conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance\r\nwith Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[5].\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance should be subject to economic policy conditions, to be laid down in\r\na Memorandum of Understanding. In order to ensure uniform conditions of\r\nimplementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be\r\nempowered to negotiate such conditions with the Tunisian authorities under the\r\nsupervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in\r\naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the\r\nadvisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as\r\nprovided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact\r\nof assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the\r\nexamination procedure be used for operations above that threshold. Considering\r\nthe amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance to Tunisia, the\r\nexamination procedure should apply to the adoption of the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding, and to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the\r\nassistance,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Union shall make macro-financial\r\nassistance available to Tunisia (\"the Union's macro-financial\r\nassistance\") of a maximum amount of EUR 250 million, with a view to\r\nsupporting Tunisia's economic stabilisation and reforms.

Commission's\r\nmultiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative \n\"To promote prosperity beyond the EU\"\nThe major area of DG ECFIN related activity\r\npertains to: \n1. Fostering the implementation of the European\r\nNeighbourhood Policy by deepening economic analysis and strengthening policy\r\ndialogue and advice on the economic aspects of the Action Plans.\n2. Developing, monitoring and implementing\r\nmacro-financial assistance for partner third countries, in co-operation with\r\nthe relevant international financial institutions. \n1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific objective(s) and\r\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned\nSpecific objective No 1: \"Providing macro-financial assistance to third countries in\r\nresolving their balance of payment crises and restoring external debt\r\nsustainability\"\nABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned: International Economic and Financial Relations, global governance. \n1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expected result(s) and\r\nimpact\nThe proposed assistance consists of an EU loan\r\nof EUR 250 million to the Republic of Tunisia ('Tunisia'), with a view to\r\ncontributing to a more sustainable balance of payments situation. The assistance,\r\nto be disbursed in three instalments, will help the country overcome the\r\neconomic and social hardships endured as a result of the domestic and regional\r\nunrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable\r\neconomic growth and improving public finance management. \n1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indicators of results and\r\nimpact \nThe authorities will be required to report on a\r\nset of indicators to the Commission services on a regular basis and provide a\r\ncomprehensive report on the compliance with the agreed policy conditions ahead\r\nof the disbursement of the second and third instalments of the assistance. \nThe Commission services will continue to\r\nmonitor public finance management, following the operational assessment of the\r\nfinancial circuits and administrative procedures in Tunisia that will be\r\ncarried out in preparation of this operation. The EU Delegation in Tunisia will\r\nalso provide regular reporting on issues relevant for the monitoring of the\r\nassistance. The Commission services will remain in close contact with the IMF\r\nand the World Bank to benefit from their insights from their on-going\r\nactivities in Tunisia. \nAn annual report to the Council and European\r\nParliament is foreseen in the proposed legislative decision, comprising an\r\nassessment of the implementation of this operation. An independent ex-post\r\nevaluation of the assistance will be carried out within two years after the\r\nexpiry of the implementation period.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grounds for the\r\nproposal/initiative \n1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requirement(s) to be met in\r\nthe short or long term \nThe disbursement of the assistance will be\r\nconditional upon a satisfactory track record in the implementation of the\r\nStand-By Arrangement (SBA) between Tunisia and the IMF. In addition, the\r\nCommission shall agree with the Tunisian authorities on specific policy\r\nconditions, listed in a Memorandum of Understanding, to be met before the\r\nsecond and third instalments are released by the Commission. \n1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Added value of EU\r\ninvolvement\nBy helping the country overcome the economic\r\nshock caused by the domestic and regional unrest, the proposed MFA will\r\ncontribute to promoting macroeconomic stability, economic reforms and political\r\nprogress in the country. By complementing the resources made available by the\r\ninternational financial institutions, the EU and other donors, it will contribute\r\nto the overall effectiveness of the package of financial support agreed by the\r\ninternational donor community in the aftermath of the crisis. \nThe proposed programme will also strengthen the\r\ngovernment's reform commitment and its aspiration towards closer relations with\r\nthe EU. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate\r\nconditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the\r\nprogramme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU is ready\r\nto support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in times\r\nof economic difficulties.\n1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lessons learned from\r\nsimilar experiences in the past\nSince 2004, a total of fifteen ex-post\r\nevaluations have been carried out on macro-financial assistance operations.\r\nThese evaluations conclude that MFA operations do contribute, albeit sometimes\r\nmodestly and indirectly, to the improvement of the external sustainability, the\r\nmacroeconomic stability and the achievement of structural reforms in the\r\nrecipient country. In most cases, MFA operations had a positive effect on the\r\nbalance of payments of the beneficiary country and helped to relax their\r\nbudgetary constraints. They also led to a somewhat higher economic growth.\n1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compatibility and possible\r\nsynergy with other appropriate instruments\nThe EU is among the major donors of Tunisia. The EU has made available EUR 290 million in grants for the period\r\n2011-13 under its regular cooperation, in support of Tunisia's\r\npolitical and economic reform agenda. In addition, EUR 140 million has been\r\nallocated to Tunisia in the period 2011-13 under the SPRING programme.\nThe key value added of the MFA in comparison to\r\nother EU instruments would be to help create a stable macroeconomic framework,\r\nincluding by promoting a sustainable balance of payments and budgetary\r\nsituation, and an appropriate framework for structural reforms. MFA does not\r\nprovide a regular financial support nor is meant to support the economic and\r\nsocial development of the recipient countries. The MFA is to be discontinued as\r\nsoon as the country's external financial situation has been brought back into a\r\nsustainable path. Afterwards, regular EU cooperation assistance instruments are\r\nmeant to take over.\nMFA is also meant to be complementary to\r\ninterventions by the international financial institutions, in particular the\r\nadjustment and reform programme supported by the IMF's SBA and the Development\r\nPolicy Loan of the World Bank.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Duration and financial\r\nimpact \nX Proposal/initiative of limited\r\nduration \nX Proposal/initiative in effect for 2.5 years\r\nfrom the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding, as stated in\r\nArticle (1.4) of the Decision \nX Financial impact from 2014 to 2017 \n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management mode(s)\r\nenvisaged[14] \nX Centralised direct management by the\r\nCommission \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitoring and reporting\r\nrules \nThis assistance is of macroeconomic nature and\r\nits design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The\r\nmonitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the\r\nbasis of progress in the implementation of the SBA and specific reform measures\r\nto be agreed with the Tunisian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding\r\n(see also point 1.4.4). \n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management and control system\r\n\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk(s) identified \nThere are fiduciary, policy and political risks\r\nrelated to the proposed MFA operation. \nThere is a risk that the macro-financial\r\nassistance, which is not dedicated to specific expenses, could be used in a\r\nfraudulent way. In general terms, this risk is related to factors such as the\r\nquality of management systems in the central bank and the ministry of finance and\r\nthe appropriatedness of internal and external audit capabilities. \nAnother key risk to the operation stems from the\r\nregional economic and political uncertainty, notably in Libya, which has direct\r\nimplications for the Tunisian economy. On the domestic front, the main risk is\r\ninstability related to difficulties in the political and economic reform\r\nprocess. The full implementation of the stabilisation and reform measures\r\nsupported by the international community, including the proposed MFA operation,\r\nmight be undermined by social dissatisfaction. \nFinally, there are risks stemming from a\r\npossible weakening of the European and global economic environment and an\r\nincrease in international energy and food prices. \n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control method(s) envisaged\r\n\nThe macro-financial assistance will be liable\r\nto verification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of\r\nthe Commission, including the European Antifraud Office (OLAF), and by the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors. \n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and benefits of\r\ncontrols and probable non-compliance rate\nThe basic costs for the Commission related to\r\nthe methods of verification and control, as well as the cost of the Operational\r\nAssessment of financial and administrative circuits conducted prior to the\r\noperation, are described in Table 3.2.1. In addition, there are costs for the\r\nEuropean Court of Auditors and of possible interventions of the OLAF. The\r\nOperational Assessment not only helps assess risks of misuse of the funds but,\r\nas a collateral benefit, it provides useful information on the necessary\r\nreforms in the area of public finance management, which are reflected in the\r\npolicy conditionality of the operation. Regarding the probable non-compliance\r\nrate, the risk of non-compliance (in the form of non-repayment of the loan or misuse\r\nof the funds) is judged to be low, based on the experience with the MFA\r\ninstrument since its creation. \n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measures to prevent fraud\r\nand irregularities \nTo mitigate the risks of fraudulent use several\r\nmeasures will be taken: \nFirst, the proposed legal basis for\r\nmacro-financial assistance to Tunisia includes a provision on fraud prevention\r\nmeasures. These measures will be elaborated further in the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding and the Loan Agreement, envisaging a set of provisions on\r\ninspection, fraud prevention, audits, and recovery of funds in case of fraud or\r\ncorruption. It is further envisaged that a number of specific policy conditions\r\nwill be attached to the assistance, mainly in the area of public finance\r\nmanagement, with a view to strengthening efficiency, transparency and\r\naccountability. \nSecond, before the agreement on the Memorandum\r\nof Understanding is reached, the Commission services, with the support of duly\r\nmandated external experts, will carry out an Operational Assessment of the\r\nfinancial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance and\r\nthe Central Bank of Tunisia, in order to fulfil the requirements of the\r\nFinancial Regulation applicable to the General Budget of the European\r\nCommunities. This review will determine\r\nwhether the framework for sound financial management of macro-financial\r\nassistance is sufficiently effective in Tunisia by covering areas such\r\nas management structure and organisation, management and control of funds,\r\nsecurity of IT systems, internal and external audit capacity as well as the\r\nindependence of the central bank. In the light of this assessment, specific\r\nmechanisms applying to the management of the funds by the beneficiaries may be\r\nintroduced in agreement with the national authorities. Also, the assistance\r\nwill be paid to a dedicated account at the Central Bank of Tunisia.\nFinally, the\r\nassistance will be liable to verification, control and auditing procedures\r\nunder the responsibility of the Commission, including OLAF, and the European\r\nCourt of Auditors.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESTIMATED FINANCIAL\r\nIMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heading(s) of the\r\nmultiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected \n\u00b7      Existing budget lines\n01 03 02: Macro-financial assistance\n01 03 06\u2013 Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund[15]\nIn order of\r\nmultiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.\n Heading of multiannual financial framework || Budget line || Type of expenditure || Contribution \n Number [Description\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.] || Diff./non-diff.
