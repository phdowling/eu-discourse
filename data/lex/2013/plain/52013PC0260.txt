This concern stems from the public health, food safety and food\nsecurity aspects, which are related to animal health but also from the economic\ncosts that animal disease outbreaks can trigger and the animal welfare\nconsiderations, including the implications of disease control measures on\nanimal welfare. \nAt the same time, this proposal reflects the\npriorities of Smart Regulation[1] by aiming to simplify the\nexisting legal framework while reflecting stakeholders' expectations in\nreducing administrative burdens. \nAnd finally, it reflects Commission priorities\nsuch as the smart growth objective of the Europe 2020 strategy[2]\nby helping the sector to become more resilient due to active prevention\nmeasures and more flexible risk management.\nProblem analysis\nThe current EU animal health legislative\nframework involves almost 50 basic directives and regulations and some 400\npieces of secondary legislation, some of them adopted as early as 1964. \nThe Commission launched an external evaluation\nin 2004 to thoroughly review the outcomes of EU action of animal health,\nleading to a new Animal Health Strategy in 2007. A combination of circumstances\nmade it imperative to re-evaluate our policy: \n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main elements of the existing policy were drawn up\nlargely between 1988 and 1995 when we were still a Community of twelve Member\nStates;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New challenges have emerged. Diseases which were unknown a\ndecade ago have appeared, while others, such as foot and mouth disease,\nbluetongue and avian flu, have recently presented new challenges, reminding us\nthat they remain very serious risks;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trading conditions have also changed radically with the\nvolume of trade in animals and animal products increasing greatly, both within\nthe EU and with third countries; and \n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Science, technology and our institutional framework have\nevolved substantially.\nA number of problems have been identified in\nrespect of the existing legislation. Some relate to the general policy approach,\nnamely: \n\u2013              \nThe high complexity of the current Community\nAnimal Health Policy (CAHP)\n\u2013              \nThe lack of an overall strategy\n\u2013              \nAn insufficient focus on disease prevention,\nwith a particular focus on the need for increased biosecurity.\nOthers were related to specific problems with\nthe functioning of existing legislation, particularly: \n\u2013              \nIssues related to intra-Union trade in live\nanimals.\nBoth general and specific problems are either\nrectified in this law, or will be rectified in its delegated and implementing\nacts. \nObjectives of the\nproposal\nThe Animal Health Law is\nthe legal framework to support the Animal Health Strategy for the EU, published\nin 2007. The general objectives as outlined in the Strategy are: \n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to ensure a high level of public health\nand food safety by minimising the incidence of biological and chemical risks to\nhumans;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to promote animal health by\npreventing/reducing the incidence of animal diseases, and in this way to\nsupport farming and the rural economy;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to improve economic growth/cohesion/competitiveness\nassuring free circulation of goods and proportionate animal movements;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to promote farming practices and animal\nwelfare which prevent animal health related threats and minimise environmental\nimpacts in support of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. \nThe specific objectives of\nthis Animal Health Law are:\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to establish a single, simplified,\ntransparent and clear regulatory framework that sets out systematically the\nobjectives, scope and principles of regulatory intervention; based on good\ngovernance and compliant with international (e.g. OIE) standards; focusing on\nlong-term preventative measures and working together with all relevant\nstakeholders;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to introduce overarching general\nprinciples allowing a simplified legal framework in order to be prepared for\nthe new challenges, i.e. to enable quick reaction in case of emerging diseases;\nwhilst ensuring the same quality of reaction as provided for in current\nlegislation;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to ensure consistency amongst the\nhorizontal principles of the legislation in the field of animal health, animal\nwelfare and food safety policies as well as broader EU policies on climate\nchange, common agricultural policy and sustainability;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to reduce the impact of animal diseases\non animal and public health, animal welfare, economy and society as far as\npossible by enhancing disease awareness, preparedness, surveillance and\nemergency response systems at national and EU level; \n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to ensure the smooth functioning of the\ninternal market of animals and animal products, with a high level of protection\nof animal health and public health and supporting the objectives of Europe\n2020.\nThe operational objectives\nof this Animal Health Law are: \n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to integrate the new prevention-driven\nand incentive-oriented approach into the core of animal health policy;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to provide for a clear and balanced\ndistribution of roles and responsibilities between competent authorities, EU\ninstitutions, the farming sector, animal owners and others;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to introduce disease categorization as\nthe basis for EU intervention;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to provide for effective mechanisms for\na rapid response to disease events, including new challenges, such as emerging\ndiseases;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to ensure effective emergency\npreparedness and early response to animal diseases and zoonoses, including use\nof vaccines as appropriate;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to introduce simplified procedures,\nwherever possible for technical and other reasons, taking into account the\nspecificity of small farmers and micro businesses and releasing unjustified\nadministrative burdens and costs, wherever possible;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to ensure that the new legal framework\nprovides enough flexibility to adapt smoothly to future scientific and\ntechnological developments;\n\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to reduce the risk of trade disruption\nby seeking an appropriate level of convergence with relevant international\nstandards, while ensuring a firm commitment to high standards of animal health.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL CONTEXT\nLegal Basis\nArticles 43, 114 and 168 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide the legal basis for the EU\nlegislative measures on animal health, as they are an essential part of EU\nagricultural, public health and consumer protection, trade and single market\npolicy. \n\u2013              \nArticle 43 provides the basis for the EU\nlegislative measures on the Common Agricultural Policy. This article also\nbecame the basis for veterinary legislation as the CAHP is considered from a\nlegal perspective to be part of the Common Agricultural Policy, so adopting the\nsame legislative and administrative procedures. \n\u2013              \nArticle 114 provides the legal basis for the\nestablishment and functioning of the internal market and the approximation of\nprovisions laid down by the law, regulation or administrative actions in this\nrespect. \n\u2013              \nArticle 168 on health protection refers to the\nprotection of human health from all causes that may damage it, including those\nrelated to animal health. Veterinary measures directly aimed at protecting\npublic health were also\nadopted under the co-decision procedure as a result of this\narticle.\". \nConsistency with other Union policies\nThis set of animal health legislation interacts\nwith the legal framework on animal welfare, food safety, public health, animal\nnutrition, veterinary medicinal products, environmental protection, official\ncontrols, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Common Agricultural Policy\n(CAP). \nRelationship to other proposals in the\npackage\nThe proposal is part of a package of four\nreviews relating to animal health, health of plants, quality of plant\nreproductive material and official controls of plants, animals, food and feed. \nThe revision of the\nofficial controls regulation enables official controls to be more consistently\napplied for the purposes of protection of animal health and links more\ncoherently with animal health regulation. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUBSIDIARITY\nAND PROPORTIONALITY\nSubsidiarity\nGood animal health generates not only private\nbenefits but is a public good with wider societal benefits. The transmissible\nnature of many animal diseases means that a common approach, rather than a\nseries of individual actions, will have the greatest overall benefits. \nThe value of the harmonised EU approach is\nwidely accepted and has helped to reduce the administrative burden for\noperators, traders, veterinarians and veterinary-related industries. It has\nplayed a key role in the establishment of the single market, facilitating\nintra-EU trade in animals and animal products (meat, milk, etc.) by setting up\nharmonised animal health conditions and promoting the success of the CAP. \nThe benefits of harmonised rules for the\nprevention, notification, control and eradication of animal diseases at EU\nlevel have been demonstrated during animal disease outbreaks in recent times.\nThe response to these crises showed the EU's capability to react quickly,\nlimiting the spread of diseases and minimising their impacts. This was largely\ndue to the harmonised approach to disease control, including providing\nfinancial compensation for the losses on farms due to disease eradication\nmeasures. Also, taking into account the single market dimension, the failure to\ncontrol a disease in one Member State, may severely affect the health status of\nthe Union and jeopardise its export potential. In light of these different\nelements, EU action is justified, as it is clear that MS cannot achieve this\nsatisfactorily acting alone and that the EU would achieve a consistent approach\nmore effectively and efficiently.\nProportionality \nThe Animal Health Law establishes a general\nframework for the prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases. This\nframework is built on outcome-based rules, avoiding over-prescriptiveness, and\nleaving room for MS to regulate or set more detailed legislation when\nnecessary, so providing for the flexibility to adapt the rules to national,\nregional or local circumstances. On the other hand, rules on trade must\nnecessarily have a certain level of detail and precision to reduce the risk of\ndifferent implementation practices by operators and competent authorities and\nsubsequent distortion of competition and possible reduction in the coherence of\nthe approach to tackling disease. Therefore the Animal Health Law tries to\nachieve the balance of proportional but necessary action. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONSULTATIONS WITH\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation process\nThis Animal Health Law is the result of a long\nseries of considered analyses. \nIn 2004, the Commission launched an independent\nevaluation to assess the performance of the Community Animal Health Policy\n(CAHP)[3] over the previous decade\nand its coherence with other EU policy interventions. The aim was to identify\nelements of the CAHP which could be further improved and to propose options to\nachieve these improvements. \nAmong other things, the CAHP evaluation\nrecommended that a single strategy for animal health be developed to prevent\npiecemeal and crisis-driven development of policy. The EU Animal Health\nStrategy 2007-2013 (AHS) \"Prevention is better than cure\" was the\nresult[4].\nThe AHS provides for the adoption of a\n\"single regulatory framework for animal health with a greater focus on\nincentives than penalties, consistent with other EU policies and converging to\ninternational standards\" and which will \"define and integrate common\nprinciples and requirements of existing legislation\". In their reaction to\nthe Commission Communication on the new Strategy, the European Parliament[5],\nthe Council[6] and the European Economic\nand Social Committee[7] welcomed this initiative.\nSubsequently, the Action Plan for the implementation of the Strategy[8]\nconfirmed that \"the main objective of the Strategy is the development of\nan EU Animal Health Law\".\nFrom the very start of the process, key\nstakeholders, Member States (MS), Competent Authorities (CA), international\norganisations and trading partners have been closely involved and have played a\ncrucial role in the discussion. In addition, economic and social stakeholders\nsuch as European associations with an interest in animal health and welfare and\nthe interested public have been consulted on a number of occasions in\naccordance with the Commission\u2019s standards for consultation. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nPart I: General Rules\nThe Animal Health Law sets out general\nprinciples for good animal health in EU legislation. It brings together animal\nhealth measures for terrestrial and aquatic animals. \nPart I also provides for the prioritisation and\nlisting of diseases which are likely to have a significant impact. For the\nfirst time, this will enable Union resources to be systematically prioritised\non a scientific and evidential basis. \nThe responsibilities of all the different actors\nhaving a key role in the safeguarding of animal health, such as operators,\nveterinarians, and pet keepers, are explicitly laid down for the first time. In\nparticular, operators and animal professionals are now required to acquire a\nbasic knowledge of animal health and related matters. \nPart II: Notification, Surveillance,\nEradication Programmes, Disease Freedom\nPart II clarifies the responsibilities for\nnotification and surveillance including animal health visits. It clarifies the\nroles of operators, competent authorities and others as regards surveillance of\nthe animal health situation in the Union. The new system allows for better use\nof the synergies between surveillance undertaken by the different actors in the\nfield to ensure the most effective and cost efficient use of surveillance\nresources.\nAnother main change here is that compartments,\npermitted only for Avian Influenza related measures and in aquaculture at\npresent, can now be used more widely. This introduces more flexibility into\ndisease control measures, introducing the possibility of continuing movements\nand trade under certain circumstances, considered from a risk-based perspective.\n\nPart III: Disease Preparedness, Awareness and Control\nPart III continues to require MSs to draw up contingency plans for\ndealing with certain diseases, and to practise their implementation. \nThe regulatory framework for vaccination is now\nexplicitly and coherently provided for. \nThe rules for the use of antigen, vaccine and\nreagent banks are laid down. \nRules on control measures to be taken in the\ncase of suspicion of or confirmed disease outbreaks of certain diseases are\nlaid down, with little change to the existing system, which is considered to\nwork well. \nPart IV: Requirements Concerning\nRegistration, Approval, Traceability and Movements\nPart IV is split into three titles, with\ndistinct rules for terrestrial, aquatic, and other animals. It is necessary to\nconsider them separately because of their different production methods and\nepidemiology. The titles dealing with aquatic and terrestrial animals lay down\nmeasures which help to identify and trace animals and establishments. The\ntraceability of animals is of crucial importance during a disease outbreak so\nthat the epidemiology of the disease is understood and can be better\ncontrolled. These titles also introduce the possibility for more animals to be\nregistered and traced through electronic means, promoting simplicity and better\nregulation, and reducing administrative burden through the use of technology. A\nthird title on other animals is introduced only for possible future provision,\nshould new threats emerge in relation to these animals. \nPart V: Entry into the Union and Export\nPart V sets the standards and requirements for\nthird countries sending animals, germinal products, products of animal origin\nand other material that may transmit animal diseases into the Union, in order\nto prevent diseases being introduced. It also sets out requirements for export.\nNo practical changes are envisaged from existing legislation, which is\nconsidered to function well. \nPart VI: Emergency Measures\nEmergency measures are a crucial part of\ndisease management. Part VI lays down the procedures to be followed in case of\nemergency, ensuring a rapid and consistent Union response. Only a few practical\nchanges are envisaged from existing legislation, which is considered to\nfunction very well.\nPart VII: Final and Transitional Provisions\nThe final and transitional provisions set out\nthe national provisions, the conditions for adopting delegated acts, repeals,\nand other necessary legal provisions. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY\nIMPLICATIONS\nThis proposal does not imply expenditures which are not already included\nin the financial statement of the common financial framework for food chain,\nanimal health and welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive\nmaterial.\n2013/0136 (COD)\nProposal for a\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\non Animal Health\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2), Article\n114(3) and Article 168(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[9], \nHaving regard to the opinion of the\nCommittee of the Regions[10], \nActing in accordance with the ordinary\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of\ntransmissible animal diseases and the measures necessary to control these\ndiseases can be devastating for individual animals, animal populations, animal\nkeepers and the economy. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As recent experiences have\ndemonstrated, transmissible animal diseases may also have a significant impact\non public health, as for example in the case of avian influenza and salmonella.\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, adverse\ninteractive effects can be observed with regard to biodiversity, climate change\nand other environmental aspects. Climate change may influence the emergence of\nnew diseases, the prevalence of existing diseases and the geographic\ndistribution of disease agents and vectors, including those affecting wildlife.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure high\nstandards of animal and public health in the Union, the rational development of\nthe agriculture and aquaculture sectors and to increase productivity, animal\nhealth rules should be laid down at Union level. These rules are necessary,\ninter alia, to contribute to the completion of the internal market, and to avoid\nthe spread of infectious diseases. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current Union animal\nhealth legislation consists of a series of linked and interrelated basic acts\nthat lay down rules on animal health applying to intra-Union trade, entry into\nthe Union of animals and products, disease eradication, veterinary controls,\nnotification of diseases and financial support in relation to different animal\nspecies, but an overarching legal framework, providing harmonised principles\nacross the sector is missing. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Animal Health Strategy\nfor the Union (2007\u2013 2013) proposes that \u2018Prevention is better than cure\u2019 and\nwas adopted by the Commission in its Communication of 19 September 2007 to the\nEuropean Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee\nand the Committee of the Regions[11]. It aims to put greater\nfocus on preventive measures, disease surveillance, disease control and\nresearch, in order to reduce the incidence of animal diseases and minimise the\nimpact of outbreaks when they do occur. It proposes the adoption of a \u201csingle\nand simplified regulatory framework for animal health\u201d seeking convergence to\ninternational standards while ensuring a firm commitment to high standards of\nanimal health.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The aim of this Regulation\nis to implement the commitments and visions provided for in that Animal Health\nStrategy, including the \"One health\" principle, and to consolidate\nthe legal framework for a common Union animal health policy through a single,\nsimplified, and flexible regulatory framework for animal health.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals may suffer from a\nbroad range of infectious or non-infectious diseases. Many diseases can be\ntreated, have an impact only on the individual animal concerned or do not\nspread to other animals or to humans. On the other hand, transmissible diseases\nmay have a broader impact on animal or public health with effects felt on a\npopulation level. The animal health rules laid down in this Regulation should\nonly be limited to those latter diseases.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In laying down those animal\nhealth rules, it is essential that considerations are given to the link between\nanimal health and public health, the environment, food and feed safety, animal\nwelfare, food security, economic, social and cultural aspects.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994\nconcerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards\nmatters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round\nmultilateral negotiations (1986-1994)[12] approved on behalf of\nthe then European Community, with regard to that portion of those matters which\nfalls within its competence the Agreement establishing the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), and also the Agreements set out in Annexes 1, 2 and 3 to\nthat Agreement which include the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and\nPhytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The SPS Agreement regulates the use of\nmeasures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health so that\nthey do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between WTO members. If\ninternational standards exist, they are required to be used as a basis.\nHowever, the members have the right to set their own relevant standards\nprovided that such standards are based on scientific evidence. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards animal health\nthe SPS Agreement refers to the standards of the World Organisation for Animal\nHealth (OIE) as regards animal health conditions for international trade. In\norder to reduce the risk of trade disruption, EU measures on animal health\nshould aim for an appropriate level of convergence with OIE standards.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In specific circumstances\nwhere a significant animal or public health risk exists but scientific\nuncertainty persists, Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement which has been\ninterpreted for the Union in the Communication from the Commission of 2\nFebruary 2000 on the precautionary principle[13] allows a\nMember of that agreement to adopt provisional measures on the basis of\navailable pertinent information. In such circumstances, the WTO Member is\nrequired to obtain the additional information necessary for a more objective\nassessment of risk and review the measure accordingly within a reasonable\nperiod of time. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk assessment, on the\nbasis of which the measures under this Regulation are taken, should be based on\nthe available scientific evidence and undertaken in an independent, objective\nand transparent manner. Due account should also be taken of the opinions of the\nEuropean Food Safety Authority established by Article 22(1) of Regulation (EC)\nNo 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002\nlaying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing\nthe European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of\nfood safety[14].\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regulation (EC) No\n1069/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council of 21 October 2009\nlaying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not\nintended for human consumption and repealing Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002\n(Animal by-products Regulation)[15] lays down both public\nand animal health rules for certain animal by-products and derived products in\norder to prevent and minimise risks to public and animal health arising from\nthose products, and in particular to protect the safety of the food and feed\nchain. In order to avoid any overlap of Union legislation, this Regulation\nshould therefore only apply to animal by-products and derived products where\nspecific rules are not laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, and where an\nanimal health risk is involved. For instance, Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 does\nnot regulate how to handle animal by-products and derived products in the\ncontext of disease control measures, and so these issues are duly covered by\nthis Regulation. \n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, specific rules\non transmissible animal diseases including those transmissible to humans (\"zoonoses\")\nare already laid down in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control\nand eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies[16],\nDirective 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17\nNovember 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending\nCouncil Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC[17]\nand Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne\nzoonotic agents[18], and specific rules on communicable\ndiseases in humans in Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological\nsurveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community[19].\nThose acts should remain in force following the adoption of this Regulation. Accordingly,\nin order to avoid any overlap of Union legislation, this Regulation should only\napply to zoonoses to the extent that specific rules are not already laid down\nin those other Union acts.\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diseases occurring in wild\nanimal populations may have a detrimental effect on the agriculture and\naquaculture sectors, on public health, the environment and biodiversity. It is\ntherefore appropriate that the scope of this Regulation should, in such cases,\ncover wild animals, both as potential victims of those diseases and as their\nvectors. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animal diseases are not\nonly transmitted through direct contact between animals or between animals and\nhumans. They are also carried further afield through water and air systems,\nvectors such as insects, or the semen, ova and embryos used in artificial\ninsemination, ovum donation or embryo transfer. Disease agents may also be\ncontained in food and other products of animal origin such as leather, fur,\nfeathers, horn and any other material derived from the body of an animal. Moreover various other objects such as transport\nvehicles, equipment, fodder and hay and straw may diffuse disease agents.\nTherefore, effective animal health rules need to cover all paths of infection\nand material involved therein.\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animal diseases may have\ndetrimental effects on the distribution of animal species in the wild, and thus\naffect biodiversity. Microorganisms causing animal diseases can therefore fall\nwithin the definition of invasive alien species of the United Nations\nConvention on Biological Diversity. The measures provided for in this\nRegulation also take account of biodiversity and thus this Regulation should cover\nanimal species and disease agents, including those defined as invasive animal\nspecies, which play a role in the transmission of, or are affected by, diseases\ncovered by this Regulation. \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Union legislation\nadopted prior to this Regulation separate animal health rules are laid down for\nterrestrial and aquatic animals. Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October\n2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products\nthereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic\nanimals[20] lays down specific rules\nfor aquatic animals. Yet in most cases, the main principles for good animal\nhealth governance are applicable to both groups of animal species. Accordingly,\nthe scope of this Regulation should cover both terrestrial and aquatic animals\nand aligns those animal health rules where applicable. However, for certain\naspects, in particular the registration and approval of establishments and the traceability\nand movements of animals within the Union, this Regulation adheres to the\napproach adopted in the past, which was to lay down different sets of animal\nhealth rules for terrestrial and aquatic animals due to their different environments\nand accordingly different requirements to safeguard health.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union legislation adopted\nprior to this Regulation and in particular Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13\nJuly 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports\ninto the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal\nhealth requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex\nA (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC[21] also lays down basic\nanimal health rules for other animal species not regulated in other Union acts,\nsuch as reptiles, amphibians, marine mammals, and others which are not aquatic\nor terrestrial animals as defined in this Regulation. Usually, such species do not\nrepresent a significant health risk for humans or other animals and therefore\nonly a few animal health rules, if any, apply. In order to avoid unnecessary\nadministrative burdens and costs, this Regulation should adhere to the approach\nadopted in the past, namely to provide the legal framework for detailed animal\nhealth rules for movements of such animals and their products to be laid down if\nthe risks involved so require.\n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The keeping of pet animals,\nincluding ornamental aquatic animals in households and non-commercial\nornamental aquaria, both indoors and outdoors, generally represents a lower\nhealth risk compared to other ways of keeping or moving animals on a broader\nscale, such as those common in agriculture. Therefore, it is not appropriate\nthat the general requirements concerning registration, record keeping and\nmovements within the Union apply to such animals, as this would represent an\nunjustified administrative burden and cost. Registration and record keeping\nrequirements should therefore not apply to pet keepers. In addition, specific rules\nshould be laid down for non-commercial movements of pet animals within the\nUnion.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some defined groups of\nanimals, for which special animal health rules exist in this Regulation, need\nto be listed as species in an Annex, due to the broad scope of the group. This\nis the case for the group of hoofed mammals classified as ungulates. This list\nmay need to be changed in the future due to reasons of changed taxonomy,\nscientific development or technical updates justified by science. Similarly,\nthe list of species of pet animals may need to be adjusted due to developments\nin society, or changed habits of keeping pet animals, in particular where these\nanimals transmit diseases. Therefore, in order to take account of such changes,\nthe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of the lists of pet animals and ungulates set out in Annexes I and II\nto this Regulation. \n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not all transmissible\nanimal diseases can or should be prevented and controlled through regulatory\nmeasures, for example, if the disease is too widespread, diagnostic tools are\nnot available, or if the private sector can take measures to control the\ndisease by itself. Regulatory measures to prevent and control transmissible animal\ndiseases may have important economic consequences for the relevant sectors and\ndisrupt trade. It is therefore essential that such measures are only applied\nwhen proportionate and necessary, such as when a disease presents or is\nsuspected to present a significant risk to animal or public health. \n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, the preventive\nand control measures for each transmissible animal disease should be\n\"tailor-made\" in order to address its unique epidemiological profile\nand its consequences. The preventive and control rules applying to each of them\nshould therefore be disease specific.\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For transmissible animal diseases\na disease condition is usually associated with clinical or pathological\nmanifestation of the infection. However, for the purpose of this Regulation,\nwhich aims to control the spread of and eradicate certain transmissible animal diseases,\nthe disease definition should be wider in order to include other carriers of\nthe disease agent.\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some transmissible animal diseases\ndo not easily spread to other animals or to humans and thus do not cause\neconomic or biodiversity damage on a wide scale. Therefore, they do not\nrepresent a serious threat to animal or public health in the Union and can\nthus, if desired, be addressed by national rules. \n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For transmissible animal diseases\nthat are not subject to measures laid down at Union level, but which are of some\neconomic importance for the private sector at a local level, the latter should,\nwith the assistance of the competent authorities of the Member States, take\nactions to prevent or control such diseases, for instance through\nself-regulatory measures or the development of codes of practice.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast to the transmissible\nanimal diseases described in recitals 26 and 27, highly transmissible animal diseases\nmay easily spread across borders and, if they are also a zoonosis, they may\nalso have an impact on public health and food safety. Hence highly transmissible\nanimal diseases and zoonoses should be covered by this Regulation. \n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action No. 5 of the\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council \u2013\nAction plan against the rising threats from Antimicrobial Resistance[22]\nemphasises the preventive role of this Regulation and the consequent expected reduction\nof the use of antibiotics in animals. Resistance of microorganisms to\nantimicrobials to which they were previously responsive is increasing. This resistance\ncomplicates the treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals. As a\nresult, microorganisms that have developed resistance to antimicrobials should\nbe treated as if they were transmissible diseases, and thus covered by the\nscope of this Regulation.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New hazards associated with\ncertain diseases or species may develop in particular due to changes in the\nenvironment, the climate, animal husbandry, farming traditions but also through\nsocial changes. Scientific progress may also lead to new knowledge and\nincreased awareness concerning existing diseases. Furthermore, diseases and\nspecies that are important today may be marginalised in the future. Therefore\nthe scope of this Regulation should be broad and the rules laid down should be\nfocused on diseases with high public relevance. The OIE has, with the support\nof the European Commission, developed a system of disease prioritisation and\ncategorisation, by producing a study on the \"Listing and categorisation of\npriority animal diseases, including those transmissible to humans\"[23]\nand a tool for such an exercise. This Regulation should introduce such an\napproach in Union legislation. \n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform conditions\nfor the implementation of this Regulation in relation to transmissible animal diseases\nat Union level, it is necessary to establish a harmonised list of transmissible\nanimal diseases ('listed diseases'). Thus implementing powers to lay down such\na list should be conferred on the Commission. \n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Emerging diseases with the\npotential to cause serious public or animal health risks and impacts on health,\nthe economy or the environment may appear in the future. Following the\nassessment of such diseases and after adopting temporary emergency measures,\nwhen relevant, a quick reaction and insertion of such diseases in the list of listed\ndiseases may be necessary. Therefore the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nthe urgency procedure should be delegated to the Commission in these duly\njustified cases of risks to public or animal health.\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Listed diseases will\nrequire different management approaches. Some highly contagious diseases which\nare currently not present in the Union require stringent measures to\nimmediately eradicate them as soon as they occur. For other diseases that might\nalready be present in parts of the Union, compulsory or voluntary eradication is\nrequired. In both cases, it is appropriate to put in place restrictions on\nmovements of animals and products, such as a prohibition of movements to and\nfrom affected areas, or simply testing prior to dispatch. In other instances it\nmight be appropriate only to implement surveillance of the disease's\ndistribution, without taking further measures. This would be the case, in\nparticular, in the event of an emerging disease for which there is limited\ninformation. \n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criteria should be laid\ndown to ensure that all relevant aspects are considered when determining which transmissible\nanimal diseases should be listed for the purposes of this Regulation and to\ndetermine the applicability of disease prevention and control rules of the\nRegulation to the different listed diseases to ensure coherence and\nconsistency. In order to ensure that technical and scientific progress and\ndevelopments of relevant international standards are taken into account, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission with respect\nto the possible amendments of those criteria. \n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prevention and control rules\nof this Regulation for a specific transmissible animal disease should apply to\nspecies of animals which can transmit the disease in question, by being\nsusceptible to it or by acting as its vector. In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, it is necessary to\nestablish a harmonised list of species to which the measures for specific listed\ndiseases should apply at Union level ('listed species') and thus implementing\npowers to lay down such a list should be conferred on the Commission.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the importance and\nthe level of impact of a listed disease, its distribution, prevalence and\nincidence in the Union and the availability of disease prevention and control\nmeasures in respect of that listed disease, a different category of specific disease\nprevention and control rules provided for in this Regulation should apply coherently\nand consistently to each listed disease. \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of this Regulation in relation to the disease\nprevention and control measures applicable to listed diseases, it is necessary\nto determine the application of the rules, provided for in this Regulation, to\nlisted diseases at Union level. Thus implementing powers to lay down which\nlisted diseases are to be subject to which rules, should be conferred on the\nCommission. \n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operators, animal\nprofessionals and pet keepers working with animals are in the best position to\nobserve and ensure the health of the animals and products under their\nresponsibility. They should therefore hold primary responsibility for carrying out\nmeasures for the prevention and control of the spread of diseases among animals\nand products under their responsibility. \n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Biosecurity is one of the\nkey prevention tools at the disposal of operators, and others working with\nanimals to prevent the introduction, development and spread of transmissible\nanimal diseases to, from and within an animal population. The role of\nbiosecurity is also recognised in the Impact Assessment for the adoption of the\nEU Animal Health Law and possible impacts are specifically assessed. In order\nto ensure that the biosecurity measures applied by operators, animal\nprofessionals and pet keepers are sufficiently flexible, that they are adjusted\nto suit the type of production and the species or categories of animals\ninvolved and that they take account of the local circumstances and technical\ndevelopments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission with\nrespect to supplementary and more detailed biosecurity requirements. \n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Biocidal products, such as\ndisinfectants for veterinary hygiene or food and feed areas, insecticides,\nrepellents or rodenticides play an important role in biosecurity strategies,\nboth at farm level as well as during animal transport. They should therefore be\nconsidered a part of biosecurity. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowledge of animal health,\nincluding of disease symptoms, consequences of diseases and possible means of\nprevention including biosecurity, treatment and control is a prerequisite for\nefficient animal health management and essential in ensuring the early\ndetection of animal diseases. Operators and other animal professionals should\ntherefore acquire such knowledge as appropriate. That knowledge may be acquired\nby different means, for example formal education, but also through the Farm\nAdvisory System existing in the agricultural sector or by informal training to\nwhich national and European farmer organisations and other organisations may be\nvaluable contributors. Those alternative means of acquiring such knowledge should\nalso be recognised by this Regulation.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Veterinarians and aquatic\nanimal health professionals play a crucial role in all aspects of animal health\nmanagement, and general rules concerning their roles and responsibilities\nshould be laid down in this Regulation. \n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Veterinarians have the\neducation and the professional qualifications which ensure that they have\nacquired the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary, inter alia, to\ndiagnose diseases and treat animals. In addition, in some Member States for\nhistorical reasons, or due to the lack of veterinarians dealing with aquatic\ndiseases, there exists a specialised profession called \"aquatic animal\nhealth professionals\". These professionals are traditionally not\nveterinarians but they practice aquatic animal medicine. This Regulation should\ntherefore respect the decision of those Member States who recognise that profession.\nIn those cases, aquatic animal health professionals should have the same\nresponsibilities and obligations as veterinarians concerning their specific\narea of work. This approach is in line with the Aquatic Animal Health Code of\nthe OIE.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nveterinarians and aquatic animal health professionals who undertake activities that\nfall within the scope of this Regulation are adequately qualified and receive\nappropriate training, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect to their qualification and training.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States and in\nparticular the competent authority thereof responsible for animal health are amongst\nthe key actors in the prevention and control of transmissible animal diseases. The\ncompetent authority for animal health plays an important role in relation to\nsurveillance, eradication, disease control measures, contingency planning,\nraising disease awareness, and in the facilitation of animal movements and in international\ntrade by the issuing of animal health certificates. To be able to perform their\nduties under this Regulation, Member States depend on having access to adequate\nfinancial, infrastructural and personnel resources throughout their\nterritories, including laboratory capacity and scientific and other relevant\nknow-how. \n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority\ncannot always perform all the activities required to be carried out by it under\nthis Regulation due to the limited resources. For that reason it is necessary\nto provide a legal basis for the delegation of the performance of those\nactivities to veterinarians. In order to ensure that the necessary conditions\nare laid down for the general application of disease prevention and control\nmeasures across the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect to the delegation of the performance of those activities\nto veterinarians and their appropriate training.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optimal animal health\nmanagement can only be achieved in cooperation with animal keepers, operators,\nother stakeholders and trading partners. To secure their support it is\nnecessary to organise decision making procedures and the application of the measures\nprovided for in this Regulation in a clear and transparent manner. Therefore the\ncompetent authority should take appropriate steps to keep the public informed,\nespecially when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that animals or\nproducts may present a risk for animal or public health and when a case is of\npublic interest. \n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid the release of\ndisease agents from laboratories, institutes and other facilities handling diseases\nagents it is vital that they take appropriate biosecurity, biosafety and bio-containment\nmeasures. This Regulation should therefore provide for safety measures to be\nobserved while handling or transporting such disease agents, vaccines and other\nbiological products. This obligation should also apply to any legal or natural\nperson, who is involved in such an activity. In order to ensure that safety\nstandards are respected when handling highly contagious biological agents,\nvaccines and other biological products, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission in respect of the safety measures in those\nlaboratories, institutes and facilities and for movements of diseases agents.\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early detection and a clear\nchain of disease notification and reporting are crucial for effective disease\ncontrol. In order to achieve an efficient and quick response any suspicion or\nconfirmation of an outbreak of certain listed diseases should be immediately notified\nto the competent authority. Those notification obligations should be applicable\nto any natural and legal person in order to ensure that no disease outbreaks\nremain unnoticed.\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Veterinarians are key\nactors in the investigation of diseases and a key link between operators and\nthe competent authority. Therefore, they should be notified by the operator in\ncases of abnormal mortalities, other serious disease problems or significantly\ndecreased production rates with an undetermined cause. \n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the effective\nand efficient notification and to clarify different circumstances related to\nabnormal mortalities and other serious diseases signs, the power to adopt acts\nin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of criteria to determine\nwhen relevant circumstances for the notification occur and the rules for further\ninvestigation, where this is relevant.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For certain listed diseases\nit is vital that the Commission and the other Member States are immediately notified\nabout diseases. Such Union notification will enable neighbouring or other\naffected Member States to take precautionary measures when so warranted. In\norder to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of such Union notification,\nimplementing powers shall be conferred on the Commission.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, for some\ndiseases immediate notification and action are not necessary. In those cases\nthe gathering of information and reporting in relation to the occurrence of\nthose diseases is essential to control the disease situation and where\nnecessary to take disease prevention and control measures. This reporting\nrequirement may also apply to diseases which are subject to Union notification\nbut where additional information is needed for the implementation of effective\ndisease prevention and control measures. In order to ensure that the correct\ninformation and data, which are necessary to prevent the spread or to control\neach particular disease, are collected in the right timeframe, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning\nof the European Union should be delegated to the Commission concerning the matters\nto be reported.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A key purpose of disease\nnotification and reporting is to generate reliable, transparent and accessible\nepidemiological data. A computerised information system for the effective\ncollection and management of surveillance data should be established at Union\nlevel for listed diseases and, when relevant, for emerging diseases or\nantimicrobial resistant pathogens. That system should promote optimal data\navailability, facilitation of data exchange, and reduction of administrative\nburden for the competent authorities of the Member States by merging disease\nnotification and reporting within the Union and at international level into one\nprocess (that is the WAHIS/WAHID database of the OIE). Consistency with the\nexchange of information in accordance with Directive 2003/99/EC[24]\nshould also be ensured. \n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform conditions\nfor the implementation of the Union disease notification and reporting rules,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a list\nof diseases which are subject to Union notification and Union reporting rules\nprovided for in this Regulation and to establish the necessary procedures,\nformats, data and information exchanges regarding disease notification and\nreporting.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surveillance is a key\nelement of disease control policy. It should provide for the early detection of\ntransmissible animal diseases and efficient notification, thereby enabling the\nsector and the competent authority to implement, where feasible, timely disease\nprevention and control measures, and the eradication of a disease. Furthermore,\nit should supply information on the animal health status of each Member State\nand the Union, thereby substantiating disease freedom and facilitating trade\nwith third countries.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operators observe their\nanimals on a regular basis and are best positioned to detect abnormal\nmortalities or other serious disease symptoms. Operators are therefore the\ncornerstone of any surveillance and essential for the surveillance undertaken\nby the competent authority. \n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure close\ncollaboration and exchange of information between operators and veterinarians\nor aquatic animal health professionals and to supplement the surveillance\nundertaken by operators, establishments should, as appropriate for the type of\nproduction and other relevant factors, be subject to animal health visits. In\norder to ensure a proportionate level of surveillance to the risks involved in\ndifferent types of establishments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission concerning the criteria and the content of such\nanimal health visits in different types of establishments.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential that the\ncompetent authority has in place a system of surveillance for the listed diseases\nwhich are subject to surveillance. This should also apply to emerging diseases,\nwhere the potential health risks of that disease should be assessed and\nepidemiological data collected for that assessment. To ensure the best use of\nresources information should be collected, shared and used in the most\neffective and efficient manner possible.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The surveillance\nmethodology, frequency and intensity should be adapted to each specific disease\nand take into account the specific purpose of the surveillance, the animal\nhealth status in the region concerned and any additional surveillance conducted\nby operators. \n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some cases, and\ndepending on the epidemiological profile of a disease and relevant risk\nfactors, a structured surveillance programme may need to be put in place. In that\ncase it is appropriate that Member States develop epidemiologically based surveillance\nprogrammes. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission concerning the surveillance design, the criteria for official\nconfirmation of outbreaks and the case definitions of those diseases and\nrequirements for surveillance programmes in relation to their contents,\ninformation to be included and the period of application. \n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To promote coordination\nbetween the Member States and ensure that those surveillance programmes are\nconsistent with Union objectives, they should be submitted to the Commission and\nother Member States for information. Furthermore, the Member State implementing\nthe surveillance programme should also submit regular reports on the results of\nthat surveillance programme to the Commission. In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of surveillance programmes, implementing\npowers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a list of diseases\nsubject to surveillance programmes and to set up harmonised procedures,\nformats, data and information exchange.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States that are not\nfree or are not known to be free from listed diseases which are subject to\neradication measures as provided for in this Regulation, should be required to\nestablish compulsory eradication programmes to eradicate those diseases where\nthe eradication is compulsory in the Union, or have the possibility to establish\nvoluntary eradication programmes, to eradicate those diseases where the\neradication is envisaged in the Union, but is not compulsory. To ensure uniform\nconditions of general application throughout the Union, it is necessary to lay\ndown harmonised requirements for such compulsory or voluntary eradication programmes.\nIn order to ensure effective disease eradication, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the objectives of\ndisease control strategies, disease control measures under the compulsory or\nvoluntary eradication programmes and requirements of such programmes.\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of disease eradication programmes,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down the\nprocedures for the submission of such programmes, performance indicators, and\nreporting.\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Member States\nshould have the possibility of declaring the whole of their territories, zones\nor compartments thereof free of one or more of listed diseases, which are\nsubject to rules on compulsory or voluntary eradication programmes, in order to\nbe protected against the introduction of such listed diseases from other parts\nof the Union or from third countries or territories. A clear harmonised\nprocedure, including the necessary criteria for disease-free status, should be\nestablished for that purpose. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the\nimplementation of the recognition of disease-free status within the Union it is\nnecessary that such a disease-free status is officially approved and thus\nimplementing powers to approve such status should be conferred on the\nCommission.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The OIE has introduced the\nconcept of compartmentalisation in the framework of the Terrestrial and Aquatic\nAnimal Health Codes (the OIE Codes). In Union legislation adopted prior to this\nRegulation, that concept is only recognised for particular animal species and\ndiseases, specified in specific Union legislation, namely for avian influenza\nand aquatic animal diseases. This Regulation should establish the possibility\nof using the compartment system for other animal species and diseases. In order\nto lay down the detailed conditions for the recognition, rules for approval and\nthe requirements for compartments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should make\ntheir disease-free territory, zones and compartments thereof publicly known for\nthe purpose of informing trading partners and facilitating trade. \n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to lay down the\ndetailed conditions for the recognition of disease-free status, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the\ncriteria for obtaining such status, the evidence needed to substantiate freedom\nfrom disease, special disease prevention and control measures, restrictions,\ninformation to be provided, derogations, and conditions for the maintenance,\nsuspension, withdrawal or restoration of disease-free status.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of procedures to obtain disease free status,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish the\nlisted diseases which may be subject to compartmentalisation and lay down detailed\nrules on formats for the submission of applications and information exchange.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The presence of an entirely\nnon-immune population of animals, susceptible to certain listed diseases,\nrequires permanent disease awareness and preparedness. Contingency plans have\nproved to be a crucial tool for the successful control of disease emergencies\nin the past. In order to ensure this effective and efficient tool for the\ncontrol of disease emergencies, which is flexible to adjust to the emergency\nsituations, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission in respect of the detailed requirements and conditions for\ncontingency plans.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Past animal health crises\nhave shown the benefits of having specific, detailed and rapid management\nprocedures for disease emergencies. Those organisational procedures should\nensure a rapid and effective response and improve coordination of efforts of\nall involved parties, and in particular the competent authorities and the\nstakeholders.\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the applicability\nof contingency plans in real emergency situations, it is essential to practise\nand test that the systems are working. For that purpose the competent\nauthorities of the Member States should carry out simulation exercises, in\ncooperation with the competent authorities of the neighbouring Member States\nand third countries and territories, where feasible and relevant.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of contingency plans and simulation exercises,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down rules for\nthe practical implementation of those plans and exercises.\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Veterinary medicinal\nproducts such as vaccines, hyper immune sera and antimicrobials play an\nimportant role in the prevention and control of transmissible animal diseases.\nThe Impact Assessment for the adoption of the EU Animal Health Law highlights\nin particular the importance of vaccines as a tool in the prevention, control\nand eradication of animal diseases. \n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, control strategies\nfor some transmissible animal diseases require prohibition or restriction of the\nuse of certain veterinary medicinal products, as their use would hamper the\neffectiveness of those strategies. For example, hyper immune sera or\nantimicrobial agents may mask the expression of a disease, make the detection\nof a disease agent impossible or render a swift and differential diagnosis\ndifficult and thus endanger the correct detection of disease.\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, those control strategies\nmay substantially vary between different listed diseases. Thus this Regulation\nshould provide for rules on the use of veterinary medicinal products for the\nprevention and control of listed diseases and for harmonised criteria for\nconsideration when determining whether or not to use and how to use vaccines,\nhyper-immune sera and antimicrobials. In order to ensure a flexible approach\nand to address the specificities of different listed diseases and the availability\nof the effective treatments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated\nto the Commission in respect of the restrictions, prohibitions or obligations\nto use certain veterinary medicinal products in the framework of the control of\ncertain listed diseases. In the case of urgency and in order to address\nemerging risks with possible devastating implications for animal or public health,\neconomy, society or environment, it should be possible for these measures to be\nadopted by the urgency procedure. \n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the conclusions\nof the Expert opinion on vaccine and/or diagnostic banks for major animal\ndiseases[25] it should also be made\npossible for the Union and the Member States to establish reserves of antigens,\nvaccines and diagnostic reagents for listed diseases that represent a serious\nthreat for animal or public health. The establishment of a Union antigen,\nvaccine and diagnostic reagent bank would promote the Union's animal health\nobjectives by enabling a quick and effective response when its resources are\nrequired and represents an efficient use of limited resources. \n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure such a\nquick and effective response, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission, in respect of the establishment and the management\nof such banks, and safety standards and requirements for the operation of\nthose. However, this Regulation should not provide for the rules on the\nfinancing of the disease preventive and control measures, including\nvaccination.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criteria for priority\naccess to the Union antigen, vaccine and diagnostic reagent banks' resources\nshould be established in order to ensure their effective distribution in\nemergencies. \n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons of security in\nrelation to bio-terrorism and agro-terrorism, certain detailed information\nconcerning the Union antigen, vaccine and diagnostic reagent banks should be\ntreated as classified information and its publication should be prohibited.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the management of the Union antigen, vaccine and diagnostic\nreagent banks, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay\ndown detailed rules concerning which biological products are to be included in\nthose banks and for which diseases, and detailed rules on the supply, quantities,\nstorage, delivery, procedural and technical requirements for vaccines, antigens\nand diagnostic reagents and the frequency and content of submissions of\ninformation to the Commission.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event of an outbreak\nof a listed disease considered to represent a high risk to animal or public\nhealth in the Union, it is necessary to take immediate disease control measures\nto eradicate that listed disease in order to protect animal and public health\nand the relevant sectors.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operators, animal\nprofessionals and pet keepers should have the primary responsibility for\ncontrolling and preventing the spread of transmissible animal diseases. They\nshould take immediate action in case of suspicion or confirmation of highly\ncontagious diseases. \n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority should\nbe responsible for initiating the first investigations to confirm or rule out\nan outbreak of a highly contagious listed disease, considered to represent a\nhigh risk to animal or public health in the Union. \n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The competent authority should\nput in place preliminary disease control measures to prevent the possible\nspread of the listed disease and undertake an epidemiological enquiry.\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As soon as a listed disease\nis confirmed the competent authority should take the necessary disease control\nmeasures, if necessary including the establishment of restricted zones, to\neradicate and prevent the further spread of that disease.\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The occurrence of a listed\ndisease in wild animals may pose a risk to public health and the health of kept\nanimals. Special rules should therefore be laid down for disease control and\neradication measures in wild animals where needed. \n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For listed diseases, which\nare not highly contagious, and which are subject to compulsory eradication, the\ndisease control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of those listed\ndiseases, in particular to non-infected areas. However, those measures may be\nmore limited or different comparing to those applicable for the most dangerous\nlisted diseases. This Regulation should therefore provide for special rules for\nthose diseases. Member States that have a voluntary eradication programme in\nplace, should also implement such disease control measures. However, the level\nand intensity of disease control measures should be proportionate and take into\naccount the characteristics of the listed disease in question, its distribution\nand its significance for the Member State concerned by it and the Union as a\nwhole. \n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\neffective application of the disease control measures provided for in this\nRegulation by operators, pet keepers and the competent authorities and taking\ninto account the specificities of the disease control measures for particular listed\ndiseases and the risk factors involved, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should\nbe delegated to the Commission, in respect of the detailed disease control\nmeasures in the event of suspicion or confirmation of a listed disease in\nestablishments, other locations and restricted zones.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide for the\npossibility for special disease control measures to be adopted by the\nCommission on a temporary basis in the event that the disease control measures laid\ndown in this Regulation are not sufficient or appropriate to address that risk,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission concerning the laying\ndown of special disease control measures for a limited period of time.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The registration of certain\ntransporters and establishments keeping terrestrial animals or handling\ngerminal products or transporting them is necessary to allow the competent authorities\nto perform adequate surveillance and to prevent, control and eradicate transmissible\nanimal diseases. \n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a certain type of\nestablishment keeping terrestrial animals or handling or storing germinal\nproducts poses a particular animal health risk, it should be subject to\napproval by the competent authority. \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid unjustified\nadministrative burdens and costs, particularly to small and medium size\nenterprises (SMEs), flexibility should be given to the Member States to adapt\nthe system of registration and approval to local and regional conditions and\nproduction patterns.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the interest of reducing\nadministrative burdens, registration and approvals should, where possible, be\nintegrated into a registration or approval system which Member State may\nalready have established for other purposes. \n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operators have first-hand\nknowledge of the animals under their care. They should therefore maintain\nup-to-date records of information which are relevant for assessing the animal\nhealth status, for traceability and for an epidemiological enquiry in the event\nof the occurrence of a listed disease. Those records should be easily\naccessible to the competent authority. \n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\npublic availability of up-to-date information concerning the registered establishments\nand transporters and approved establishments the competent authority should\nestablish and keep a register of such establishments and transporters. The\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission, in\nrespect of the information to be contained in the register of establishments\nand transporters and the record keeping requirements, as regards the\ninformation to be recorded, derogations from the record keeping requirements\nand the specific additional requirements for germinal products.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of the requirements laid down in this\nregulation on the registration and approval of establishments and on the record\nkeeping and registers, implementing powers should be conferred to the\nCommission to lay down rules concerning the information obligations, exemptions\nand other rules, the formats and operational specifications of the registers\nand records.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Efficient traceability is a\nkey element of disease control policy. Identification and registration\nrequirements specific for the different species of kept terrestrial animals and\ngerminal products should be in place in order to facilitate the effective\napplication of the disease prevention and control rules provided for in this\nregulation. In addition, it is important to provide for the possibility of\nestablishing an identification and registration system for species for which\nsuch arrangements do not exist at present, or when changing circumstances and\nrisks so warrant.\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nsmooth operation of the identification and registration system and ensure\ntraceability, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission, in respect of the obligations concerning databases, designation of the\ncompetent authority, detailed identification and registration requirements for\ndifferent animal species and documents. \n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to reduce administrative\nburdens and costs and provide for flexibility of the system in circumstances\nwhere the traceability requirements can be achieved by means other than those\nset out in this Regulation. The Commission should therefore be empowered to\nadopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union concerning the derogations from the\nidentification and registration requirements.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of the identification and registration system\nand traceability, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to\nlay down rules concerning the technical specifications for databases, means of\nidentification, documents and formats, the deadlines, and criteria for derogations\nfrom such systems.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 An important tool for\npreventing the introduction and spread of a transmissible animal disease is the\nuse of restrictions on movements of animals and products that may transmit that\ndisease. However, restricting the movement of animals and products may have a severe\neconomic impact and interfere with the operation of the internal market. Such\nrestrictions should therefore only be applied where necessary and proportionate\nto the risks involved. This approach is in line with the principles laid down\nin the SPS Agreement and the OIE international standards.\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 The general requirements\nlaid down in this Regulation should apply to all animal movements, such as the\nprohibition of movement of animals from an establishment where there are\nabnormal mortalities or other disease symptoms with an undetermined cause or\ndisease prevention requirements during transport. \n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 The legal framework,\ncurrently laid down in Union legislation for the movement of terrestrial\nanimals lays down harmonised rules primarily for the movement of terrestrial\nanimals and products between Member States, while leaving it up to the Member\nStates to determine the necessary movement requirements within their territory.\nA comparison of the current situation with an option where rules for movements\nwithin Member States would also be harmonised at Union level, was extensively\nelaborated in the Impact Assessment on the EU Animal Health Law. It has been\nconcluded that the current approach should be maintained, as complete\nharmonisation of all movements would be very complex and the benefits in terms\nof the facilitation of movements between Member States do not outweigh the\nnegative impact this could have on the ability to control diseases. \n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 For animals that are moved\nbetween Member States a set of basic animal health requirements apply. In\nparticular, animals may not be moved from establishments with abnormal\nmortalities or signs of disease of unknown cause. However, mortalities, even if\nabnormal, which are linked to scientific procedures authorised under Directive\n2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September\n2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes[26]\nand which are not of infectious origin related to listed diseases, should not\nbe a reason to prevent the movements of animals intended for scientific\npurposes. \n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 However, this Regulation\nshould provide for flexibility to facilitate the movement of species and\ncategories of terrestrial animals, which represent a low risk for spreading listed\ndiseases between Member States. In addition, further possibilities for\nderogations should be provided for in cases where Member States or operators\nsuccessfully put in place alternative risk mitigating measures such as high\nlevels of biosecurity and effective surveillance systems.\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Ungulates and poultry are groups\nof animal species of high economic significance and are subject to specific movement\nrequirements under Union legislation adopted prior to this Regulation, namely Council\nDirective 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting\nintra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine[27],\nCouncil Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions\ngoverning intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals[28],\nCouncil Directive 2009/156/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions\ngoverning the movement and importation from third countries of equidae[29],\nCouncil Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions\ngoverning intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of,\npoultry and hatching eggs[30] and partially Council\nDirective 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements\ngoverning trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and\nembryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific\nCommunity rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC[31].\nThe main rules for the movement of those species should be laid down in this\nRegulation. The detailed requirements which largely depend on the diseases that\nmay be transmitted by different species or categories of animals should be\nregulated in subsequent Commission acts, taking into account the specificities\nof the diseases, species and categories of animals in question.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 As assembly operations for\nungulates and poultry represent a particularly high disease risk, it is\nappropriate to lay down specific rules in this Regulation to protect the health\nof the animals involved and prevent the spread of transmissible animal diseases.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 Depending on the listed\ndiseases and listed species, it is necessary to lay down specific animal health\nrequirements for certain animal species other than kept ungulates and poultry. Rules\nfor these species were also laid down in the legal framework applicable prior\nto this Regulation and in particular in Directive 92/65/EEC. That Directive\nlays down specific movement rules for animal species including bees, bumble\nbees, apes, dogs and cats etc. and this Regulation should therefore provide a\nlegal basis for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts laying down specific\nmovement rules for those animal species. \n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Confined establishments, usually\nused for the keeping of laboratory animals or zoo animals, normally involve a\nhigh level of biosecurity, a favourable and well controlled health status and are\nsubject to fewer movements or movements solely within the closed circuits of those\nestablishments. The status of confined establishments, for which the operators may\napply for on a voluntary basis, was first introduced in Directive 92/65/EEC,\nwhere rules and requirements for approval and movement requirements for\napproved bodies, institutes and centres are laid down. That system enables\nthose establishments to exchange animals amongst themselves with fewer movement\nrequirements and at the same time providing health guarantees within the\ncircuit of confined establishments. Therefore it has been broadly accepted by\nthe operators, and used as a voluntary option. It is therefore appropriate to preserve\nthe concept of confined establishments and also to lay down rules for movement between\nthose establishments in this Regulation. \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 For scientific purposes,\nsuch as research or diagnostic purposes, and in particular those authorised in\naccordance with Directive 2010/63/EU, it may be necessary to move animals which\ndo not comply with the general animal health requirements laid down in this\nRegulation and represent a higher animal health risk. Those kinds of movements\nshould not be prohibited or unduly restricted by the provisions of this\nRegulation, as this could impede otherwise authorised research activities and\ndelay scientific progress. Nonetheless, it is essential that rules are laid down\nin this Regulation to ensure that movements of those animals take place in a\nsafe manner.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Movement patterns of circus\nanimals, animals kept in zoos, animals intended for exhibition and certain\nother animals often deviate from the movement patterns of other kept species.\nSpecific consideration should be taken in adapting Union rules on movement to\nsuch animals, taking into account specific risks and alternative risk\nmitigation measures. \n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the\nobjectives of recitals 102 to 112 of this Regulation are achieved, the power to\nadopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe European Union should be delegated to the Commission, concerning the\ndisease preventive measures in transport, specific rules for movement of\ncertain animal species and special circumstances, such as assembly operations or\nrejected consignments, and special requirements or derogations for other types\nof movements, such as movement for scientific purposes.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the possibility\nfor special rules for movements, where the movement rules are not sufficient or\nappropriate to limit the spread of a certain disease, implementing powers\nshould be conferred on the Commission to lay down special movement rules for a\nlimited period of time.\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Kept terrestrial animals\nthat are moved between Member States should comply with the requirements for\nsuch movements. In the case of species presenting a health risk and of greater economic\nimportance, they should be accompanied by an animal health certificate issued\nby the competent authority.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent technically,\npractically and financially feasible, technological developments should be\navailed of to reduce the administrative burdens on operators and the competent authority\nin relation to certification and notification by using information technology to\nreplace the paper documentation and facilitate notification procedures and using\nthem as far as possible for multiple purposes. \n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 In cases where an animal\nhealth certificate issued by the competent authority is not required, an\noperator who moves animals to another Member State should issue a\nself-declaration document which confirms that the animals meet the movement\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation. \n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the achievement\nof the objectives referred to in recitals 115, 116 and 117 of this Regulation the\npowers to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission, concerning\nrules on the content, information obligations, and derogations from the animal\nhealth certification requirements, specific certification rules and the\nobligations of official veterinarians to conduct appropriate checks before the signing\nthe animal health certificate. \n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Notification of movements of\nanimals and germinal products between Member States and in some cases within\nthe national territories of Member States is essential to ensure traceability\nof animals and those germinal products, where these movements may be linked to\na risk of spreading transmissible animal diseases. Therefore, such movements should\nbe notified and registered. The IMSOC system provided for in Article 130(1) of\nthe Regulation (EU) No xxx/xxx of the European Parliament and of the Council on\nofficial controls and other official activities performed to ensure the\napplication of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant\nhealth and plant reproductive material, plant protection products and amending\nRegulations (EC) No 999/2001, 1829/2003, 1831/2003, 1/2005, 396/2005, 834/2007,\n1099/2009, 1069/2009, 1107/2009, Regulations (EU) No 1151/2012, [\u2026.]/2013, and\nDirectives 98/58/EC, 1999/74/EC, 2007/43/EC, 2008/119/EC, 2008/120/EC and\n2009/128/EC (Official controls Regulation)[32] [Publication\noffice] should be used for that purpose.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of the rules laid down in this Regulation on animal\nhealth certification and movement notification, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission to lay down rules concerning the model animal\nhealth certificates, self-declaration documents, formats and deadlines for\nmovement notification for both terrestrial and aquatic animals, germinal\nproducts and where also relevant, products of animal origin. \n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 The specific nature of\nmovements of pet animals represents an animal health risk which deviates significantly\nfrom that of other kept animals. Specific rules for such movements should\ntherefore be laid down in this Regulation. In order to ensure that pet animals\ndo not pose a significant risk for the spread of transmissible animal diseases,\nthe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in\nrespect of the detailed rules for movements of those animals. In order to\nensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the animal health\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation concerning the movements of pet\nanimals, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down rules\nconcerning the disease prevention and control measures to be taken for such\nmovements. \n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Wild animals may for various\nreasons represent an animal and public health risk, for example, if they are\nmoved into an establishment or from one environment to another environment.\nAppropriate preventive measures for movement of those animals may need to be\ntaken to avoid the spread of transmissible animal diseases. In order to ensure\nthat wild animals do not pose a significant risk for the spread of\ntransmissible animal diseases the power to adopt acts in accordance with\nArticle 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be\ndelegated to the Commission, concerning the additional requirements for\nmovements of wild terrestrial animals.\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Germinal products can\nrepresent a similar risk of spreading transmissible animal diseases to live\nanimals. In addition, there are specificities in their production, which are\nrelated to high health demands for breeding animals and which call for stricter\nor particular animal health requirements concerning the donor animals. In order\nto ensure safe movements of germinal products, their expected high health\nstandard and to take into account some specific uses, the power to adopt acts in\naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion should be delegated to the Commission, concerning the detailed requirements\nfor movement of germinal products of certain animal species, special\nrequirements, such as for example their movement for scientific purposes, and\nderogations from the animal health certification obligation. \n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 Products of animal origin\ncan represent a risk for the spreading of transmissible animal diseases. Food\nsafety requirements for products of animal origin laid down in Union\nlegislation ensure good hygiene practices and reduce the animal health risks of\nsuch products. However, for certain cases specific animal health measures, such\nas disease control and emergency measures should be laid down in this\nRegulation to ensure that products of animal origin do not spread animal\ndiseases. In order to ensure safe movements of products of animal origin in\nthese particular cases, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the\nCommission, concerning detailed rules for movements of products of animal\norigin in relation to disease control measures taken, the obligations for\nanimal health certification and derogations from those rules, where the risk\ninvolved with such movements and the risk mitigating measures in place permit\nso. . \n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 When Member States take national\nmeasures concerning movements of animals and germinal products or decide to\ntake national measures to limit the impact of transmissible animal diseases\nother than listed diseases within their territory, those national measures\nshould not interfere with the rules on the internal market laid down in Union\nlegislation. Therefore, it is appropriate to set the framework for such national\nmeasures and ensure that they remain within the limits permitted under Union\nlaw. \n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 The registration and\napproval of aquaculture establishments is necessary to allow the competent\nauthorities to perform adequate surveillance and to prevent, control and\neradicate transmissible animal diseases. Directive 2006/88/EC requires all\nestablishments which move aquatic animals to be authorised. That system of\nauthorisation should be maintained under this Regulation, notwithstanding that\nfact that in some official EU languages, different terms are used for this\nsystem of authorisation in this Regulation as compared to Directive 2006/88/EC.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 The slaughter and processing\nof aquaculture animals which are subject to disease control measures may spread\ntransmissible animal disease, for example as a result of effluents containing\npathogens being discharged from processing establishments. It is therefore\nnecessary to approve processing establishments which fulfil the risk mitigation\nmeasures to undertake such slaughter and processing. Therefore, this Regulation\nshould provide for the approval of disease control aquatic food establishments.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\npublic availability of up-to-date information concerning registered and\napproved establishments the competent authority should establish and keep such\na register. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty\non the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission,\nconcerning the information to be included in register of aquaculture establishments\nand the record keeping requirements for aquaculture establishments and\ntransporters.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of the rules laid down in this Regulation for\nthe registration and approval of aquaculture establishments and disease control\naquatic food establishments, record keeping and registers of establishments,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down rules\nconcerning the information obligations, derogations and other implementing\nrules, and the format and operational specifications of the registers and\nrecords.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 As it is not feasible in\nmost cases to individually identify aquatic animals, the keeping of records at\naquaculture establishments, disease control aquatic food establishments and by\ntransporters is an essential tool in ensuring the traceability of aquatic animals.\nRecords are also valuable for the surveillance of the health situation of\nestablishments.\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly to terrestrial\nanimals, it is necessary to lay down harmonised rules on the movement of\naquatic animals, including rules on animal health certification and movement notification.\n\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2006/88/EC lays\ndown rules for movements of aquatic animals, which apply equally to movements\nwithin and between Member States. The key determining factor for movement rules\nfor aquatic animals is the health status as regards the listed diseases of the\nMember State, zones and compartments of destination.\n(133)\u00a0\u00a0 The same system should also be\nprovided for in this Regulation. However, to encourage Member States to enhance\nthe health status of their aquatic populations, some adjustments and added\nflexibility should be introduced. \n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure movement\ncontrol for aquatic animals, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\n290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated\nto the Commission, concerning the disease preventive measures applicable to transport,\nspecific rules for movements of certain categories of aquatic animals for\ndifferent purposes, specific requirements or derogations for certain types of\nmovements, such as movement for scientific purposes and additional requirements\nfor movement of wild aquatic animals.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the possibility\nof temporary derogations and specific requirements for movements of aquatic\nanimals, where the movement rules laid down in this Regulation are not\nsufficient or appropriate to limit the spread of a certain listed disease,\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission for laying down special\nmovement rules or derogations for a limited period of time.\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 Union aquaculture production\nis extremely diverse as regards species and production systems and this\ndiversification is rapidly increasing. This may warrant that national measures concerning\ndiseases other than those that are regarded as listed diseases in accordance\nwith this Regulation are taken at Member State level. However, such national\nmeasures should be justified, necessary and proportionate to the goals to be\nachieved. Furthermore, they should not affect movements between Member States unless\nit is necessary in order to prevent the introduction of or to control the spread\nof disease. National measures affecting trade between Member States should be\napproved and regularly reviewed at Union level.\n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, listed diseases\nconcern animal species other than those defined as terrestrial and aquatic by\nthis Regulation, such as reptiles, amphibians, insects and others only to a\nvery limited extent. It is therefore not appropriate to require that all the\nprovisions of this Regulation apply to those animals. However, if a disease\nwhich concerns species other than terrestrial and aquatic should become listed,\nthe relevant animal health requirements of this Regulation should apply to those\nspecies to ensure that adequate and proportionate disease prevention and\ncontrol measures may be taken.\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\npossibility of laying down movement rules for those animals that are not\ndefined as terrestrial and aquatic animals by this Regulation, and germinal\nproducts and products of animal origin from them, when a risk so warrants, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission, concerning\nthe registration and approval of establishments, record keeping and registers,\nidentification and registration and traceability movement requirements, animal\nhealth certification and self-declaration and movement notification obligations\nfor animals, germinal products and products of animal origin of those species. \n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 When necessary to ensure\nuniform conditions for the implementation of the animal health requirements for\nthose other animal species and germinal products and products of animal origin\nfrom them, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay\ndown detailed rules concerning those requirements. \n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 To prevent the introduction\nof listed diseases and emerging diseases into the Union, it is necessary to\nhave in place efficient rules on the entry into the Union of animals, germinal\nproducts and products of animal origin that may transmit such diseases. \n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements for entry\nof animals and products into the Union should mirror the requirements for\nmovements of animal and products of the same category, species and intended use\nwithin the Union.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that animals,\ngerminal products and products of animal origin from third countries or\nterritories comply with the animal health requirements that provide guarantees\nthat are equivalent to those provided for in Union legislation, it is essential\nthat they are subject to appropriate controls by the competent authority of the\nthird countries or territories exporting to the Union. Where relevant, the\nhealth status of a third country or territory of origin should be verified\nprior to accepting the entry of such animals, germinal products and products of\nanimal origin. Consequently, only third countries and territories which can\ndemonstrate that they meet the animal health standards for entry of the animals\nand products into the Union should be eligible to export them to the Union and\nbe listed for that purpose. \n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 For some species and\ncategories of animals, germinal products and products of animal origin the\nUnion lists of third countries and territories from which entry into the Union\nis permitted have not been established in Union acts adopted prior to the date\nof adoption of this Regulation. In those cases and pending the adoption of\nrules pursuant to Regulation, Member States should be permitted to determine\nfrom which countries and territories those animals, germinal products and\nproducts of animal origin may be permitted to enter their territory. In so determining,\nMember States should take into account the criteria laid down in this\nRegulation for the Union lists of third countries and territories.\n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that the animal\nhealth requirements for the entry into the Union provided for in this\nRegulation are complied with and are in line with the principles of the OIE\nAnimal Health Codes, all animals, germinal products and products of animal\norigin entering the Union should be accompanied by an animal health certificate\nissued by the competent authority of the third country or territory of origin\nconfirming that all the animal health requirements for entry into the Union are\ncomplied with. However, deviation from this rule for commodities which pose a\nlow animal health risk should be permitted. \n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 Animal health certificates may\nstand on their own, but certification is often required in Union legislation for\nother purposes, for example to certify that public health or animal welfare\nrequirements of animals or products have been complied with. This has to be\ntaken into account. In order to minimise administrative burdens and costs those\nanimal health certificates should also be permitted to include information\nrequired under other Union food and feed safety legislation.\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 Diseases may be spread by\nmeans other than animals, germinal products, products of animal origin and\nanimal by-products and derived products. For instance, vehicles, transport\ncontainers, hay, straw, plant products, materials that may have been in contact\nwith infected animals and equipment may also spread disease. Where necessary,\nmeasures should be taken to prevent these routes of disease transmission by\nthose means. \n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure the\nappropriate level of detail for the requirements for entry into the Union, the\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission, to\nsupplement and amend the criteria for the listing of third countries and\nterritories, criteria for the suspension or withdrawal from that list, supplementing\nthe rules for the approval of establishments in third countries and territories\nand derogations, animal health requirements for the entry into the Union of\nconsignments from third countries and territories, contents of animal health\ncertificates, and the animal health requirements for disease agents, other\nmaterials, means of transport and equipment, which may transmit animal\ndiseases.\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure uniform\nconditions for the implementation of the animal health requirements for the entry\ninto the Union of consignments of animals, germinal products and products of\nanimal origin, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay\ndown rules on, inter alia the list of third countries and territories from which\nthe entry into the Union of animals, germinal products and products of animal\norigin is allowed and model animal health certificates.\n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 Past experience has shown that\nwhen an outbreak of a serious disease occurs in Member States or in third\ncountries or territories from which animals or products enter the Union,\ndisease prevention and control measures have to be taken immediately to limit\nits introduction and spread. Such an emergency may involve listed diseases,\nemerging diseases or other animal health hazards. In that context, it should be\nmade clear which sets of disease prevention and control measures laid down in\nthis Regulation may be used in the event of the occurrence of a listed or\nemerging disease or hazard. In all these cases it is essential that measures\ncan be taken at very short notice and without any delay. As such measures would\nrestrict movement within or into the Union they should be implemented at Union\nlevel whenever possible. \n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure an\neffective and quick reaction to emerging risks, implementing powers should be\nconferred on the Commission to lay down emergency measures.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 The Commission should adopt\nimmediately applicable implementing acts in duly justified cases relating to inter\nalia the listing of diseases and species, the listed diseases that are to be\nsubject to the sets of disease prevention and control rules, the stocking,\nsupply, storage, delivery and other procedures of Union antigen, vaccine and\ndiagnostic reagent banks, the laying down of special disease control measures\nand derogations for a limited period of time, the special movement rules for\nterrestrial and aquatic animals for a limited period of time, the emergency\nmeasures, and the listing of third countries and territories for entry into the\nUnion.\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down\ngeneral and specific rules for the prevention and control of transmissible animal\ndiseases and ensures a harmonised approach to animal health across the Union. In\nsome areas, such as general responsibilities for animal health, notification,\nsurveillance, registration and approval or traceability, the Member States should\nbe allowed or encouraged to apply additional or more stringent national measures.\nHowever, such national measures should be permitted only if they do not\ncompromise the animal health objectives of this Regulation, and if they are not\nin contradiction with the rules laid down therein and provided that they do not\nhinder movements of animals and products between Member States, unless it is\nnecessary in order to prevent the introduction of or to control the spread of disease.\n\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 The national measures\nreferred to in recital 152 should be subject to a simplified notification\nprocedure in order to reduce the administrative burden. Experience has shown\nthat the general notification procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure\nfor the provision of information in the field of technical standards and\nregulations and of rules on Information Society services[33],\nhas been an important tool for guiding and improving the quality of national\ntechnical regulations \u2013 in terms of increased transparency, readibility and\neffectiveness, in non-harmonised or partly harmonised areas. It is therefore\nappropriate that this general notification procedure laid down in Directive\n98/34/EC applies.\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, Union rules on\nanimal health are laid down in the following acts of the European Parliament\nand of the Council and in subsequent Commission acts adopted pursuant to them: \n\u2013              \nCouncil Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964

to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation. Accordingly, those\nlegislative acts should be repealed. However, to ensure legal clarity and avoid\na legal vacuum, the repeal should only take effect when the relevant delegated\nand implementing acts are adopted pursuant to this Regulation. It is therefore\nnecessary to provide the Commission with the empowerment to determine the dates\nwhen the repeal of those legislative acts should take effect. \n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 The following Council acts\nin the area of animal health are obsolete and should be expressly repealed in\nthe interests of clarity of Union legislation: Council Decision 78/642/EEC of\n25 July 1978 on health protection measures in respect of the Republic of\nBotswana[65]; Council Directive\n79/110/EEC of 24 January 1979 authorizing the Italian Republic to postpone the\nnotification and implementation of its national plans for the accelerated\neradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle[66];\nCouncil Directive 81/6/EEC of 1 January 1981 authorizing the Hellenic\nRepublic to communicate and to implement its national plans for the accelerated\neradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle[67];\nCouncil Decision 89/455/EEC of 24 July 1989 introducing Community measures to\nset up pilot projects for the control of rabies with a view to its eradication\nor prevention[68]; Council Directive\n90/423/EEC of 26 June 1990 amending Directive 85/511/EEC introducing Community\nmeasures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease[69];\nCouncil Decision 90/678/EEC of 13 December 1990 recognizing certain parts of\nthe territory of the Community as being either officially swine fever free or\nswine fever free[70].\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements of this\nRegulation should not apply until all the delegated and implementing acts to be\nadopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation, have applied. It is appropriate\nto provide for at least 36 months to elapse between the date of entry into\nforce of this Regulation and the date of application of the new rules, to allow\nthe operators affected sufficient time to adapt.\n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure legal\ncertainty as regards the application of rules for identification and\nregistration of animals, disease control measures for certain zoonoses and\nnon-commercial movements of pet animals, the power to adopt acts in accordance\nwith Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should\nbe delegated to the Commission in respect of the date on which Regulations (EC)\nNo 1760/2000, (EU) No XXX/XXX [Ex-998/2003] and (EC) No 21/2004 and Directives 92/66/EEC, 2000/75/EC, 2001/89/EC, 2002/60/EC,\n2003/85/EC, 2005/94/EC and 2008/71/EC cease to apply.\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The implementing powers provided\nfor in this Regulation should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down\nthe rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the\nMember States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[71].\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 It is of particular\nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its\npreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and\ndrawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate\ntransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the\nCouncil.\n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation should not\ncreate a disproportionate administrative burden or economic impact for small\nand medium sized enterprises. Under this Regulation, based on consultation with\nstakeholders, the special situation of small and medium sized enterprises has\nbeen taken into account. A potential universal derogation from\nthe requirements of this Regulation for such enterprises has not been\nconsidered, in view of the public policy objectives to protect animal health\nand public health. However, a number of derogations for such enterprises should\nbe provided for in relation to the different requirements of this Regulation,\ntaking into account the risks involved. \n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 The objectives of this\nRegulation, namely to lay down animal health rules for animals, germinal\nproducts, products of animal origin, animal by-products and derived products to\nthe extent that they are not covered by specific rules in other Union\nlegislation and other material that can be involved in the spread of transmissible\nanimal diseases, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States, and can\nbe more efficiently achieved at Union level through a common and coordinated\nlegal framework for animal health. This Regulation is therefore in line with\nthe principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out\nin that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order\nto achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nPART I \nGENERAL RULES\nChapter 1\nSubject matter, scope and definitions \nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Regulation lays down rules\nfor the prevention and control of animal diseases, which are transmissible to animals\nor to humans.\nThose rules provide for: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the prioritisation and categorisation\nof diseases of Union concern and for establishing responsibilities for animal\nhealth in Part I;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the early detection, notification and\nreporting of diseases, surveillance, eradication programmes and disease-free\nstatus in Part II;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 disease awareness, preparedness and\ncontrol in Part III;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the registration and approval of\nestablishments and transporters, movements and traceability of consignments of\nanimals, germinal products and products of animal origin within the Union in\nPart IV;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the entry of consignments of animals,\ngerminal products, and products of animal origin into the Union and the export\nof such consignments from the Union in Part V;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the emergency measures to be taken in\nthe event of a disease emergency situation in Part VI. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules referred to in paragraph\n1:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensure\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a sustainable agricultural and\naquaculture production in the Union;
