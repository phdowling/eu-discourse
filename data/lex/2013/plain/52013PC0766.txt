It is foreseen\r\nthat the new Protocol will be provisionally applied from the date of the expiry\r\nof the previous Protocol. In order to ensure the continuity of fishing\r\noperations, a specific legislative procedure for a Council Decision regarding\r\nthe signature and Provisional application of the Protocol is being launched in\r\nparallel to this procedure.\nThe new\r\nProtocol will provide a legal structure for the EU fleet's fishing activities\r\nin the Seychelles EEZ, and enable the European shipowners to request fishing\r\nauthorisations which will enable them to fish in the Seychelles EEZ, which is\r\nthe main fishery within the Indian Ocean for the EU fleet. Furthermore, the new\r\nProtocol further re-inforces the co-operation between the EU and the Seychelles and particularly as regards the development of a sustainable fisheries policy.\r\nIt also foresees the use of VMS and the introduction of an Electronic Reporting\r\nSystem (ERS), which will improve the regularity and reliability of catch\r\nreporting. Sectoral support has been further strengthened to provide for\r\nimproved surveillance and control, notably as regards IUU, in the Seychelles national fisheries policy strategy. \n\u2013                        \r\nAdded value of EU involvement\nHad the EU\r\nnot negotiated a new Protocol, this would have left the opportunity for private\r\nagreements to be directly negotiated between the shipowners and the Seychelles authorities, which would not necessarily guarantee a sustainable fishery. The EU\r\nis furthermore looking to improve the effective co-operation on a bilateral\r\nlevel with the Seychelles but also to extend this co-operation on a regional\r\nlevel through the appropriate Regional Fisheries Management Organisation. \n\u2013                        \r\nLessons learned from similar experiences in the\r\npast\nInformation\r\nprovided by the independent, EU financed, evaluation report concludes that the\r\nfishing opportunities should take into consideration the past utilisation of\r\nopportunities, whist taking into account the possibility of EU vessels\r\nreturning to the fishery following their migration to other areas as a result\r\nof piracy in the region. The sectoral support provided for the development of\r\nthe Seychelles fishing industry has been maintain and increased to take into\r\naccount the continued development of the port infrastructure that will\r\nultimately benefit the EU fleet, and finance the priorities identified by the\r\nnational policy strategy regarding fisheries in terms of capacity building in\r\nthe Seychelles administration. \n\u2013                        \r\nCompatibility and possible synergy with other\r\nappropriate instruments\nThe\r\nfinancial contributions provided under the FPAs are considered as fungible\r\nresources in the budgets of the third country partners. Nonetheless, a part of\r\nthe funds are directed to the implementation of actions foreseen in the\r\nframework of sectoral support for the partner country and is a condition for\r\nthe conclusion and implementation of the FPAs.
