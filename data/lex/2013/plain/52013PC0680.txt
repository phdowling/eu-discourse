These new rules are essential in order to ensure a\r\nsafe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products\r\nand support the real economy through long-term investments and additional\r\nstability. \nDirective 2011/89/EU (Ficod1) amends certain\r\ndirectives including Solvency II as regards the supplementary supervision of\r\nfinancial entities in a financial conglomerate. \nOn 19 January 2011 the Commission adopted a\r\nproposal to amend Directive 2009/138/EC in order to take into account the new\r\nsupervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting up of the\r\nEuropean Insurance and Occupational Pensions Agency (EIOPA) on 1 January 2011\r\n(COM (2011) 8, COD 2011/0006)(Omnibus II) and the entry into force of the Lisbon\r\nTreaty which required the adjustment of empowerments for the Commission to\r\nadopt implementing measures to empowerments for the Commission to adopt\r\nimplementing and delegated acts according to Article 290 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union. The proposal also included provisions to\r\nextend the transposition, repeal and application dates in Directive\r\n2009/138/EC. These rules are important in order to ensure a smooth transition\r\nto the new regime. In addition and in order to become fully operational, the\r\nSolvency II regime also requires a high number of delegated and implementing\r\nacts by the Commission, providing important details on different technical\r\nmatters. Many of these so-called \"level 2\" rules are closely linked\r\nto Omnibus II and cannot be presented by the Commission before the publication\r\nof Omnibus II, which will also clarify the scope of many delegated and\r\nimplementing act empowerments. \nThe deadline for transposition and application\r\nof Directive 2009/138/EC was initially 31 October 2012 and 1 November 2012\r\nrespectively, but pending the outcome of the on-going legislative negotiations\r\non Omnibus II, Directive 2012/23/EU (Quick Fix) postponed these dates to 30\r\nJune 2013 and 1 January 2014 respectively. \nDirective 2012/23/EU also postpones the date when\r\nthe existing insurance and reinsurance directives (Directives 64/225/EEC,\r\n73/239/EEC, 73/240/EEC, 76/580/EEC, 78/473/EEC, 84/641/EEC, 87/344/EEC,\r\n88/357/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 98/78/EC, 2001/17/EC, 2002/83/EC and 2005/68/EC, as\r\namended by the acts listed in Part A of Annex VI) that are collectively\r\nreferred to as Solvency I will be repealed. Instead of 1 November 2012, those\r\ndirectives will now be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.\nThe most controversial issue in the on-going\r\nlegislative negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the\r\nCommission is the introduction of measures on the treatment of insurance\r\nproducts with long-term guarantees under the new Solvency II insurance\r\nregulatory regime (\u201cLong-term guarantee package\u201d or LTG package). Since no\r\nagreement on the LTG package could be achieved in September 2012, negotiations\r\nwere suspended. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission then\r\nmandated the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to carry\r\nout a technical assessment of the measures, in order to provide a technical\r\nbasis for a political agreement on Omnibus II.\nOn 14 June 2013 EIOPA published its technical\r\nfindings on the long-term guarantees assessment. These technical findings confirm firstly the importance of\r\nlong term guarantee measures for many Member States in periods of financial\r\nstress such as those experienced in 2011 and secondly that a package of\r\ndifferent measures is needed to cater for the different insurance products\r\noffered in Member States.The EIOPA findings propose a\r\nnumber of measures intended to facilitate the provision of insurance products\r\nwith long-term guarantees against artificial financial market volatility. \nThese findings constitute the parameters for a\r\npolitical agreement on Omnibus II. According to the Commission report on 27\r\nJune 2013, it should be possible to find a compromise\r\nwithin the scope of the measures that EIOPA recommends. Although legislative\r\nnegotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission\r\nresumed on 10 July 2013, it is very unlikely that the negotiations on Omnibus\r\nII will be concluded in time to publish the Omnibus II Directive in the\r\nOfficial Journal before the date of application of Directive 2009/138/EC, as\r\namended by Directive 2012/23/EU. Leaving that date unchanged would result in\r\nDirective 2009/138/EC being implemented before the entry into force of the\r\ntransitional rules and relevant adaptations provided for by the Omnibus II\r\nproposal. \nIn view of the fact that the negotiations on\r\nOmnibus II have not yet been finalised the date of transposition of 30 June\r\n2013, which has already elapsed, should be extended one last time. Leaving the\r\ndates unchanged would imply that Solvency II needs to be implemented without\r\nthe transitional rules and other important adaptations foreseen in Omnibus II.\r\nIn order to avoid continued legal uncertainty and ensure the legal continuity\r\nof the current Solvency provisions (Solvency I) until the complete Solvency II package\r\nis in place, it is proposed that the relevant transposition date in Directive\r\n2009/138/EC is extended one last time to 31 January 2015. \nIt is important to allow supervisors and\r\ninsurance and reinsurance undertakings some time to prepare for the application\r\nof Solvency II. It is therefore proposed to extend the date for first\r\napplication of Solvency II one last time to 1 January 2016. This will make it\r\npossible to start the supervisory approval procedures e.g. for internal models\r\nand undertaking specific parameters. The parties to the on-going legislative\r\nnegotiations have agreed that there should be no further changes to either the\r\ntransposition or application dates during the Omnibus II negotiations in order\r\nto ensure legal clarity for insurance and reinsurance undertakings supervisory\r\nauthorities during their preparations.\nIt is evident from the chronological order of\r\nevents that the postponed dates for transposition and application of Directive\r\n2009/138/EC also apply to the amendments to Articles 212 to 216, 219, 226, 231,\r\n233, 235, 243 to 247, 249, 256, 257, 258, 262 and 263 of that Directive which\r\nwere made by Directive 2011/89/EC.\nThe date of repeal of Solvency I should be\r\namended accordingly.\nIn view of the above and given the very short\r\nperiod of time left before 1 January 2014, this Directive should be adopted by\r\nthe European Parliament and the Council as a matter of urgency and enter into\r\nforce without delay.\nThis Directive is necessary in order to prevent\r\na legal vacuum arising after 1 January 2014.\nThe absence of this Directive would result in a\r\ngap between the EU legal system (Solvency II) and that of Member States (where\r\nSolvency I as transposed would remain in force). This would lead to legal\r\nuncertainty for supervisory authorities, undertakings and Member States. \n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency\r\nII)\nThis Directive establishes a new and modern\r\nsolvency regime for insurers and reinsurers in the European Union. It provides\r\nfor an economic, risk-based approach which provides incentives for insurance\r\nand reinsurance undertakings to properly measure and manage their risks.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/89/EC\r\n(Ficod1)\nThis Directive amends certain directives\r\nincluding Directive 2009/138/EC as regards the supplementary supervision of\r\nfinancial entities in a financial conglomerate. Article 4 of Directive 2011/89/EC\r\namends the Articles 212 - 216, 219, 226, 231, 233, 235, 243 \u2013 247, 249, 256,\r\n257 258, 262 and 263 of Directive 2009/138/EC and Article 6 of Directive\r\n2011/89/EC prescribes that Member States shall be in compliance with these new\r\nprovisions from 10 June 2013.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2012/23/EU (Quick Fix)\nThis Directive amends Directive 2009/138/EC and\r\npostpones the date for its transposition from 31 October 2012 to 30 June 2013, inserts\r\nthe date of its application from 1 January 2014 and\r\npostpones the date of repeal of Solvency I from 1 November 2012 to 1 January\r\n2014.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposal COM (2011) 8 (the\r\nOmnibus II Directive)\nThis proposal aims to amend Directive\r\n2009/138/EC in order to adapt Solvency II to the new supervisory architecture\r\nfor insurance and namely the setting-up of the European Insurance and\r\nOccupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) on 1 January 2011 (COM (2011) 8, COD\r\n2011/0006). It proposes to postpone the transposition deadline of Solvency II\r\nto 31 December 2012.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE\r\nINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transmission of this\r\nproposal to the national parliaments\nDraft legislative acts, including proposals\r\nfrom the Commission, sent to the European Parliament and to the Council must be\r\nforwarded to national parliaments in accordance with the Protocol (No 1) on the\r\nrole of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaties.\nAccording to Article 4 of the Protocol, an\r\neight-week period must elapse between a draft legislative act being made\r\navailable to national parliaments and the date when it is placed on a\r\nprovisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a\r\nposition under a legislative procedure.\nHowever, exceptions are possible under Article\r\n4 in cases of urgency, the reasons for which must be stated in the act or\r\nposition of the Council. The Commission invites the European Parliament and the\r\nCouncil to consider this proposal as a case of absolute urgency for the reasons\r\nexplained above.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact assessment\nThis proposal is not accompanied by a separate\r\nImpact Assessment as an impact assessment for the Solvency II Directive has\r\nalready been undertaken and this proposal only aims at addressing the fact that\r\nthe publication of Omnibus II in the Official Journal of the European Union\r\nwill be later than the application date of 1 January 2014.\nDoing nothing at this stage would create a very\r\nuncertain legal situation after 1 January 2014. A gap would exist between the\r\nEU legal system (Solvency II) and that of Member States (where Solvency I as\r\ntransposed would remain in force). This would lead to legal uncertainty for\r\nsupervisory authorities, undertakings and Member States.\nThe Framework Directive would need to be\r\nimplemented without the transitional rules and other important adaptations\r\nforeseen in Omnibus II. Consequently, supervisory authorities, undertakings and\r\nMember States would have to proceed with implementing a regime that would need\r\nto be revised again in the very near future, which would not be efficient. \nThe proposed amendment affects only the\r\nobligation on Member States to transpose by the Directive by 30 June 2013,\r\nextending it to 31 December 2014. It also foresees the extension of the application\r\nof the Solvency II Directive from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2016 (and the\r\nsame extension for the date of repeal of Solvency I). It does not alter the\r\nsubstance of the Directive in question and does not therefore impose any\r\nadditional obligations on businesses.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Summary of the proposed measures\nThe proposal amends Article 309(1) of Directive\r\n2009/138/EC by setting up later dates for its transposition (31 January 2015)\r\nand its application (1 January 2016). It also amends Articles 310 and 311\r\naccordingly by setting-up a new date for the repeal of Solvency I (1 January\r\n2016).\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basis\nArticles 53 (1) and 62 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsidiarity principle\nThe subsidiarity principle applies as the\r\nproposal concerns a field which does not fall within the exclusive competence\r\nof the European Union.\nThe objectives of the proposal cannot be\r\nachieved sufficiently by the Member States, as the provisions of directives\r\ncannot be amended or repealed at national level.\nThe objectives of the proposal can be achieved\r\nonly by EU action, as this proposal amends an act of EU law which is in force,\r\nand this is something which cannot be done by the Member States themselves.\nThe principle of subsidiarity is complied with\r\nin that the proposal amends existing EU legislation.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\r\nprinciple for the following reason.\nIt does not alter the substance of the current\r\nEU legislation: it is restricted to postponing the date of transposition of\r\nDirective 2009/138/EC until 31 January 2015; in order to avoid continued legal\r\nuncertainty now that the current deadline for transposition (30 June 2013) has\r\nexpired. It also provides for a new, later application date for Solvency II and\r\nconsequent repeal of Solvency I (1 January 2016).\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of instruments\nProposed instrument(s): directive.\nNo other instrument would have been suitable.\r\nAs this is an amended directive, the only way forward is to adopt another\r\ndirective.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThe proposal has no implication for the EU\r\nbudget.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OPTIONAL ELEMENTS\n\u00b7              \r\nSimplification\nThe new proposal as such contains no\r\nsimplification elements. It is aimed solely at postponing the date for transposition\r\nof Directive 2009/138/EC to 31 January 2015 and providing for a new application\r\ndate of 1 January 2016.\n\u00b7              \r\nRepeal of existing legislation\nThe adoption of the proposal will not in itself\r\nentail the repeal of existing legislation; it merely adjusts the date of the\r\nrepeal already foreseen in Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\u00b7              \r\nEuropean Economic Area\nThis draft instrument is concerned with a\r\nsubject covered by the EEA Agreement and must therefore be extended to cover\r\nthe European Economic Area.\n\u00b7              \r\nDetailed explanation of the proposal by\r\nchapter or by article\nThis proposal postpones the date of transposition\r\nof Directive 2009/138/EC to 31 January 2015.\nArticle 1(1) of the proposal amends Article\r\n309(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC accordingly. It also provides for a new, later\r\ndate of application of Solvency II (1 January 2016). \nArticle 1(2) amends the date of repeal of\r\nSolvency I (from 1 January 2016) in Article 310 and Article 1(3) provides for\r\nthe same date as date of application of the provisions of Solvency I re-casted\r\nby Solvency II in Article 311.\n2013/0327 (COD)\nProposal for a\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\r\nAND OF THE COUNCIL\namending Directive 2009/138/EC on the\r\ntaking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency\r\nII) as regards the dates of transposition and application and the date of\r\nrepeal of certain Directives\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE\r\nCOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) and\r\nArticle 62 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European\r\nCommission,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[1] provides a modern, risk-based\r\nsystem for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance\r\nundertakings. These new rules are essential in order to ensure a safe and solid\r\ninsurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support\r\nthe real economy through long-term investments and additional stability.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[2] introduces\r\nsome changes to Articles 212 to 262 of Directive\r\n2009/138/EC to be introduced from 10 June 2013. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive\r\n2012/23/EU of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council[3]\r\npostpones the date for transposition of Directive 2009/138/EC from 31 October\r\n2012 to 30 June 2013, the date of\r\napplication from 1 November 2012 to 1 January 2014 and the date of repeal of\r\nthe existing insurance and reinsurance Directives, namely Council Directive\r\n64/225/EEC[4],\r\nFirst Council Directive 73/239/EEC[5],\r\nCouncil Directive 73/240/EEC[6],\r\nCouncil Directive 76/580/EEC[7],\r\nCouncil Directive 78/473/EEC[8],\r\nCouncil Directive 84/641/EEC[9],\r\nCouncil Directive 87/344/EEC[10],\r\nSecond Council Directive 88/357/EEC[11],\r\nCouncil Directive 92/49/EEC[12],\r\nDirective 98/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[13], Directive 2001/17/EC of the\r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council[14],\r\nDirective 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[15] and Directive 2005/68/EC of\r\nthe European Parliament and of the Council [16] (collectively referred to as 'Solvency I') from 1 November 2012 to 1\r\nJanuary 2014.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On\r\n19 January 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a\r\nDirective of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives\r\n2003/71/EC and 2009/138/EC (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as the 'Omnibus II proposal')[17] in order to take into account\r\nthe new supervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting-up of the European Supervisory Authority\r\n(European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The Omnibus II proposal also\r\nserves as\r\na means to adapt Directive 2009/138/EC to the entry into force of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union by adjusting the empowerments for the\r\nCommission to adopt implementing measures to empowerments for the Commission to\r\nadopt implementing and delegated acts.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\r\nis a clear risk that there is not enough time to adopt the\r\nOmnibus II proposal and publish it in the Official Journal of the European Union before\r\nthe relevant Articles of Directive\r\n2009/138/EC are to apply. Leaving the dates for transposition, application and repeal unchanged\r\nwould result in Directive 2009/138/EC being implemented before the entry into\r\nforce of the transitional rules and of relevant adaptations, including further\r\nclarification of delegated and implementing act empowerments, provided for by the Omnibus II proposal. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\norder to avoid overly burdensome legislative obligations for Member States\r\nunder Directive 2009/138/EC and later on under the new framework envisaged by the Omnibus II proposal, it is\r\nappropriate to postpone the dates for transposition and application of\r\nDirective 2009/138/EC and allowing supervisors and insurance and reinsurance\r\nundertakings sufficient time for the introduction of the new architecture. \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is evident from the\r\nchronological order of events that the postponed dates for transposition and\r\napplication of Directive 2009/138/EC also apply to the amendments to Articles\r\n212 to 216, 219, 226, 231, 233, 235, 243 to 247, 249, 256, 257, 258, 262 and\r\n263 of that Directive which were made by Directive 2011/89/EC.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For\r\nreasons of legal certainty, the date of repeal of Directives 64/225/EEC, 73/239/EEC, 73/240/EEC 76/580/EEC, 78/473/EEC, 84/641/EEC,\r\n87/344/EEC, 88/357/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 98/78/EC, 2001/17/EC, 2002/83/EC and\r\n2005/68/EC should be postponed accordingly.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given\r\nthe very short period of time left before the expiry of the deadlines laid down\r\nin Directive 2009/138/EC, this Directive should enter into force without delay.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\r\nit is also justified to apply the exception for urgent cases provided for in\r\nArticle 4 of Protocol (No 1) on the role of national Parliaments in the\r\nEuropean Union in this case as regards the transmission to national Parliaments\r\nof the proposal for this Directive,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 2009/138/EC is amended
