This Regulation\nwas subsequently amended by Commission Regulation No 748/2013 of 2 August 2013.\nBy Decision 2013/423/EU of 2 August 2013, the\nCommission accepted an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping\nproceeding concerning imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and\nkey components (i.e. cells and wafers) originating in or consigned from the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \nConsistency with other policies and\nobjectives of the Union\nNot applicable.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nConsultation of interested parties\nInterested parties concerned by the proceeding\nhave had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in\nline with the provisions of the basic Regulation.\nCollection and use of expertise\nThere was no need for external expertise.\nImpact assessment\nThis proposal is the result of the\nimplementation of the basic Regulation.\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for a\ngeneral impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that\nhave to be assessed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\nPROPOSAL\nSummary of the proposed action\nThe Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping\nduties on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key\ncomponents (i.e. cells and wafers) originating in or consigned from the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and subsequently accepted an undertaking offered in\nconnection with these imports.\nThe attached proposal for a Council Regulation\nis based on the definitive findings which have confirmed the existence of\ndumping causing injury, and the fact that the imposition of measures is not\nagainst the overall Union interest. Although the product scope has been amended\nat the definitive stage (by excluding wafers from the product scope) and the\nfinal duty rates have been slightly revised, the provisional findings were overall\nconfirmed. The undertaking is foreseen to apply during the period of validity\nof provisional and definitive measures.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Council adopts\nthe attached proposal for a Regulation which should be published no later than\n5 December 2013.\nLegal basis\nThis proposal concerns the application of\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against\ndumped imports from countries not members of the European Community.\nSubsidiarity principle\nThe proposal falls under the exclusive\ncompetence of the European Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not\napply.\nProportionality principle\nThe proposal complies with the proportionality\nprinciple for the following reasons:\nThe form of action is described in the\nabove-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision.\nIndication of how financial and administrative\nburden falling upon the Union, national governments, regional and local\nauthorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to\nthe objective of the proposal is not applicable.\nChoice of instruments\nProposed instruments: regulation.\nOther means would not be adequate for the\nfollowing reason:\nThe basic Regulation does not provide for\nalternative options.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION \nThe proposal has no implication for the Union\nbudget.\n2013/0369 (NLE)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION\nimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty\nand collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of\ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components (i.e. cells)\noriginating in or consigned from the People's Republic of China\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of\nthe European Community[1] (\u2018the basic Regulation\u2019), and in particular Article 9(4) and 14(1)\nthereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission,\nafter consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PROCEDURE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provisional\nMeasures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nEuropean Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) by Regulation (EU) No 513/2013[2] (\u2018the provisional Regulation\u2019) imposed a provisional anti-dumping\nduty on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components\n(i.e. cells and wafers) originating in or consigned from the People's Republic\nof China (\u2018the PRC\u2019 or the \u2018country concerned\u2019). \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation was\ninitiated following a complaint lodged on 25 July 2012 by EU ProSun (\u2018the\ncomplainant\u2019) on behalf of producers representing more than 25 % of the total\nUnion production of crystalline silicon photovoltaic ('PV') modules and key\ncomponents. The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of the said\nproduct and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered\nsufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Registration\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned in recital (3) to the provisional Regulation, following a request by\nthe complainant supported by the required evidence the Commission adopted on 1 March\n2013 Regulation (EU) No 182/2013[3] making\nimports of crystalline silicon PV modules and key components (i.e. cells and\nwafers) originating in or consigned from the People\u2019s Republic of China subject\nto registration as of 6 March 2013. The provisional Regulation ceased the\nregistration of imports for the purpose of the anti-dumping investigation in\naccordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation since a provisional\nanti-dumping duty provided protection against dumped imports. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nclaimed that the decision for registration of imports was unfounded, as the\nconditions were not met pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.\nHowever, these claims were not substantiated or based on factual evidence. At\nthe time the decision was taken to register imports the Commission had\nsufficient prima facie evidence justifying the need to register imports,\nin particular a sharp increase both in terms of absolute imports and in terms\nof market share. The claims in this regard had therefore to be rejected.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance\nof an Undertaking with regards to provisional duties\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By Commission Decision\n2013/423/EU of 2 August 2013[4], the Commission has accepted an undertaking offered by exporting\nproducers together with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of\nMachinery and Electronic Products ('CCCME').\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nProcedure\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to the\ndisclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it\nwas decided to impose provisional anti-dumping measures (\u2018the provisional\ndisclosure\u2019), the Government of China ('GOC') and several interested parties\nmade written submissions making known their views on the provisional findings.\nThe parties who so requested were granted the opportunity to be heard. The\nAssociation for Affordable Solar Energy (\u2018AFASE\u2019), representing importers,\ndownstream and upstream operators and one importer requested and were afforded\nhearings in the presence of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for\nTrade.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission continued to seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for\nits definitive findings. The oral and written comments submitted by the interested\nparties were considered and, where appropriate, the provisional findings were\nmodified accordingly.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following\ncompanies:\n(i) Downstream operators\n\u2013              \nJayme de la Costa, Pedroso, Portugal \n\u2013              \nSunedison Spain Construction, Madrid, Spain\n(ii) Independent consultant\n\u2013              \nEuropressedienst, Bonn, Germany\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AFASE\nquestioned the legal basis for the visit carried out at the premises of\nEuropressedienst, as it is not an interested party in this investigation and\ndoes therefore not fall under Article 16 of the basic Regulation. Europressedienst,\nas mentioned in recitals (99) and (120) to the provisional Regulation has\nprovided information on macroeconomic indicators. It is clarified that the Commission\ncarried out an on-the-spot verification at the premises of Europressedienst for\nthe sake of the principle of good administration to verify the reliability and\ncorrectness of data on which the Commission based its findings. \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC reiterated the\nclaim that its rights of defence in relation to access to the files open for\ninspection by interested parties were violated because (i) information was\nmissing from the non-confidential files without \u201cgood cause\u201d being shown or\nproviding sufficiently detailed summaries, or exceptionally, the reasons for\nthe failure to provide the non-confidential summary, (ii) the non-confidential\nversion of an entire questionnaire response of a Union producer was missing and\n(iii) the delays to make non-confidential versions of the Union producers\u2019\nquestionnaire responses available for interested parties were excessive.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i) Regarding the claim\nthat information was missing from the open file, the interested party did not\nspecify to which information it was referring to. (ii) Its claim that the\nnon-confidential version of an entire questionnaire response has not been made\navailable was incorrect. (iii) As to the delays in making available the\nnon-confidential replies of the questionnaires of the sampled Union producers,\nit had been explained to the party concerned that the questionnaires were only\nadded to the non-confidential file after having been checked as to their\ncompleteness and reasonableness of the summaries. In order to ensure the Union\nproducers\u2019 right to anonymity, it was also ascertained that the\nnon-confidential versions of the questionnaires did indeed not reveal the\nidentity of the Union producer concerned. In some cases, the non-confidential\nversions needed therefore to be corrected accordingly by the party submitting\nit before they could be made available for other interested parties. \n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, it is\nconsidered that this did in no way affect the interested parties\u2019 rights of\ndefence. The Commission has given all the interested parties the opportunity to\nrespond to the information included in the file open for inspection in time so\nthat their comments could be taken into consideration, when substantiated and\nwarranted before any conclusions were made in the investigation. The interested\nparty had every opportunity to comment on the questionnaires from sampled Union\nproducers also following the provisional and the final disclosure. Therefore,\neven if the disclosures and the access to the file open for inspection by\ninterested parties are based on different legal provisions, it should be noted\nthat there were ample opportunities for the interested parties to comment on\nall information made available by any party to the investigation. Therefore, this\nclaim had to be rejected. \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All interested parties were\ninformed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was\nintended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on\nimports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and key components (i.e.\ncells) originating in or consigned from the People's Republic of China and the\ndefinitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duty (\u2018the\nfinal disclosure\u2019). All parties were granted a period within which they could\nmake comments on the final disclosure. \n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The comments submitted by\nthe interested parties were considered and taken into account where\nappropriate. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acceptance of an\nundertaking in view of definitive duties\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\nthe Commission received an amended offer for an undertaking by exporting\nproducers together with the CCCME, which covers also the parallel anti-subsidy\ninvestigation. By Commission Decision 2013/XXX/EU of XX December 2013, the\nCommission has confirmed the acceptance of that undertaking. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parties concerned by the\nproceeding\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling\nof Union producers\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of\nprovisional measures, some interested parties reiterated the argument that\nexcessive use of confidentiality prevented them from commenting on the\nselection of the sample of Union producers and thus from the proper exercise of\ntheir rights of defence. The Commission already addressed this issue in recital\n(9) to the provisional Regulation. As no new information was provided in this\nrespect, the conclusions in recital (9) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed. \n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC reiterated its\nclaim that the use of confidentiality of the names of the complainants and\nsampled Union producers is not warranted. As already stated in recital (9) to\nthe provisional Regulation, the Union producers requested that their names be\nkept confidential due to the risk of retaliation. The Commission considered\nthat these requests were sufficiently substantiated to be granted. The\ninformation that has been provided to the Commission in order to substantiate\nthe risk of retaliation cannot be disclosed to third parties, as such\ndisclosure would defeat the purpose of the request for confidentiality.\nMoreover, in a case, where, as reported by the GOC, a Union producer\nre-evaluated its position and revealed its identity by filing an application\nfor a Court case against the provisional Regulation, there is no longer ground\nto disclose information on the basis of which anonymity was granted, as the\nidentity has been revealed. \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further to the provisional\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated that the information on which the\nselection of the sample was based was not reliable, without, however, providing\nany new evidence in this regard. This claim was therefore rejected.\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the CCCME reiterated the arguments about the method used for the\nselection of the provisional sample of the Union producers. It claims in\nparticular that the Institutions have not taken into account 120 producers. The\nCommission already addressed this issue in recital (9) to the provisional\nRegulation. Moreover, the Institutions have verified the activities of the\ncompanies provided on that list. It turned out that that list mostly includes\ninstallers, distributors, related importers and exporting producer in China,\nTaiwan, and India. It therefore was not apt to demonstrate that the\nInstitutions had overlooked a significant number of Union producers. Moreover,\nthe CCCME has not contested the total Union production by providing alternative\nfigures, nor has it put forward any evidence that the representativity of the\nsample could have been affected, as none of the alleged additional Union\nproducers would have been selected into the sample, had it been known to the\nCommission.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the exclusion of\nwafers from the definition of the product concerned, and thus from the scope of\nthis investigation as cited in recital (32) below, the final sample consisted\nof eight Union producers. In the absence of any further comments with regard to\nthe sampling of Union producers, the findings in recitals (7) to (10) to the\nprovisional Regulation are herewith confirmed, as amended above.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling of unrelated importers \n(21)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the imposition of provisional measures, as\nmentioned in recital (12) to the provisional Regulation, the Commission contacted\nadditional importers that had already cooperated in the investigation at\nthe initiation stage by providing basic information on their activities related\nto the product under investigation during the investigation period, as\nspecified in the Notice of Initiation. The purpose was to determine whether the\nsize of the sample of unrelated importers could be increased. Six companies, qualifying as unrelated\nimporters trading the product concerned (i.e. purchasing and reselling it), came\nforward and were willing to cooperate further in the investigation. Out of\nthese six, five replied within the deadline. Out of the five replies received,\nonly three were sufficiently complete and allowed for a meaningful assessment. On\nthis basis, the sample of the unrelated importers was enlarged and consisted of\nfour importers for modules, representing around 2 % - 5 % of the total imports\nfrom the country concerned. Given the structure of the\nunrelated importers, which were mostly small and medium-sized companies, it was\nnot possible to have a sample representing a larger share, given the limited\nresources at the disposal of the Institutions.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments with regard to the sampling of unrelated importers, recitals (11)\nand (12) to the provisional Regulation, as amended above are confirmed.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sampling of exporting producers\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, a number of non-sampled companies submitted comments arguing that\ntheir situation is different from the sampled companies. They argued that, as a\nconsequence, they should benefit from an individual duty rate pursuant to\nArticle 17(3) of the basic Regulation. However, due to the high number of co-operating\ncompanies (often groups of companies), it was not possible to individually\ninvestigate all companies. Therefore, pursuant to Article 9(6), these companies\nare subject to the weighted average duty of the sampled companies.\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any further\ncomments with regard to the sampling of exporting producers recitals (13) and (14)\nto the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigation period and\nperiod considered \n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recital (19) to\nthe provisional Regulation, the investigation of dumping and injury covered the\nperiod from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 ('the investigation period' or\n'IP'). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered\nthe period from 2009 to the end of the investigation period ('the period\nconsidered').\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As set out in recitals (20) to (49) to the provisional Regulation,\nthe product concerned as provisionally defined is crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels and cells and wafers of the type used in crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels, originating in or consigned from the PRC. The\ncells and wafers have a thickness not exceeding 400 micrometers. This product is currently falling within CN codes ex 3818 00 10, ex\n8501 31 00, ex 8501 32 00, ex 8501 33 00, ex 8501 34 00, ex 8501 61 20, ex 8501\n61 80, ex 8501 62 00, ex 8501 63 00, ex 8501 64 00 and ex 8541 40 90 (\u2018the\nproduct concerned\u2019).\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following product types\nare excluded from the definition of the product concerned:\n\u2013              \nsolar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells, are portable and supply electricity to devices or charge batteries\n\u2013              \nthin film PV products\n\u2013              \ncrystalline silicon PV products that are\npermanently integrated into electrical goods, where the function of the\nelectrical goods is other than power generation, and where these electrical\ngoods consume the electricity generated by the integrated crystalline silicon\nPV cell(s).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claims\nregarding the product scope\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exclusion\nof wafers\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure, interested parties claimed that wafers should be\nremoved from the product scope since wafers do not share the same basic\nphysical, chemical and technical characteristics as cells and modules. In\naddition to the arguments brought forward at the provisional stage, two additional\narguments were brought forward in this respect after the provisional\ndisclosure.\n(29)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, interested parties\nclaimed that wafers can be used for other purposes than for the production of\ncells, notably the production of integrated circuits and other micro devices.\nIn this respect, it is noted that not all wafers are included in the product\nscope of this investigation, which is limited to \"wafers of the type\nused in crystalline silicon PV modules or panels\", and that those wafers\nhave \u201ca thickness not exceeding 400 micrometres\". While wafers\ncertainly do exist in other applications, the investigation never covered wafers\nwhich are used in the production of other products such as integrated circuits.\nIn addition, no producers, importers or users involved in the market for these other\ntypes of wafers came forward alleging that their wafers would be subject to\nregistration or provisional anti-dumping duties. It is therefore confirmed that\nthese other types of wafers are not subject to the product scope of this\ninvestigation. At the same time, this shows that wafers do not necessarily have\nthe same end use as cells and modules.\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, interested\nparties claimed that unprocessed wafers possess none of the essential electric\nproperties which distinguish solar cells and modules from other products. In\nparticular, wafers lack the ability to generate electricity from sunlight,\nwhich is the key function of crystalline photovoltaic cells and modules.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\nclaim can be accepted. Indeed after further verification and contrary to what\nis stated in recital (36) to the provisional Regulation that \"modules,\ncells and wafers have the same end use, converting sunlight into electricity\",\nonly once the wafer is transformed into a cell, does it obtain the functionality\nto generate electricity from sunlight.\n(32)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due\nto the different basic physical and technical characteristics, defined during\nthe investigation inter alia as the functionality to generate electricity\nfrom sunlight, it is concluded on balance that wafers should be excluded from\nthe definition of the product concerned, and thus from the scope of this\ninvestigation.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Separate\ninvestigations for cells and modules\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties reiterated\nthat cells and modules are not a single product, and should therefore be\nassessed separately, mainly repeating arguments already addressed in recitals\n(27) to (39) to the provisional Regulation. Unlike wafers, however, cells and\nmodules do share the same basic property, i.e. the ability to generate electricity\nfrom sunlight. These arguments were therefore rejected.\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none exporter argued that cells by themselves cannot produce electricity.\nAllegedly, they need to be integrated into modules to do so. However, each cell\nby itself has a capacity to generate electricity from sunlight of typically\naround 4W. While this power may be insufficient for most applications which\nrequire an assembly of multiple cells into modules, this does not mean that a\ncell by itself does not already have the capacity to generate electricity.\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none exporter argued that the impossibility to establish a Normal Value for\nmodules on the basis of the Normal Value for cells, as described in recital (100)\nbelow, demonstrates that modules and cells should not be considered a single\nproduct.\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nnoted that in the majority of anti-dumping investigations, including the\npresent investigation, a comparison between Normal Values and export prices is\nmade on the basis of product types. This is done since often a very broad range\nof product types share the same basic physical, technical and/or chemical\ncharacteristics, which often leads to a situation where product types with\nsubstantially different costs and prices fall under the definition of the\n\"product concerned\". The mere fact that it is not possible to\nestablish a Normal Value for a certain product type on the basis of the Normal\nValue of another product type does not in itself mean that these product types\ncannot be considered a single product. As described in recital (32) above, both\ncells and modules do share the same basic physical and technical\ncharacteristics, inter alia the functionality to generate electricity\nfrom sunlight.\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is further argued that\nif cells and modules were one single product with minor differences, adjusting\nthe prices of cells to establish a price of modules should not be difficult. In\nthis respect it is noted that there is no requirement that there are only minor\ndifferences between the different types of the product concerned. To the\ncontrary, it is sufficient that the different types of the product concerned\nshare the same basic physical, technical and/or chemical characteristics. In\nthe present case, this is the case for modules and cells, inter alia the\nfunctionality to generate electricity from sunlight.\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party further\nargued that cells are not just another type of module, but an entirely\ndifferent product. In effect, a cell is the key component of a module. As a key\ncomponent, a cell is clearly not \"an entirely different product\", as\nmodules and cells share the same basic characteristics of generating\nelectricity from sunlight, as indicated in recital (32) above.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same party argued in\naddition that when the samples for Union producers and Chinese exporters were\nselected, the difference between cells and modules was taken into account.\nTherefore, different duty rates for modules and cells should have been\nestablished. In this respect, it is confirmed that the difference between\nmodules and cells was indeed taken into account when sampling Union producers\nand Chinese exporters, as indicated in recitals (10) and (14) to the\nprovisional Regulation. This, however, was only done to ensure that the sample\nis representative and does as such not mean that cells and modules should not\nbe considered a single product concerned, or that separate duty rates should be\nestablished for cells and modules. Indeed, in order to ensure that the sample\nwas representative for all product types, it was important to distinguish\nbetween cells and modules when selecting the sample. Furthermore, as there was\na certain degree of uncertainty with regards to the question as to whether\ncells and modules were to be regarded as one product or as two separate\nproducts, it was necessary to ensure representativity for both possible\noutcomes.\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it is argued\nthat recital (100) below stating that the processing costs for modules are\nsignificant is in contradiction with recital (32) to the provisional\nRegulation, which states that the value added is not concentrated in a\nparticular stage of the production process. In this respect, it is recalled\nthat recital (100) also clarifies that the cost difference between cells and\nmodules is 34%, which means that 66% of the value of a modules stems from the\ncell. It is therefore concluded that the value added is not concentrated in a\nparticular stage of the production process. \n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exporting producers claimed\nthat the fact that the undertaking imposes different minimum import prices and\nvolumes for cells and modules allegedly confirms that modules and cells are\ndistinct products requiring two distinct investigations. The different minimum\nimport prices, however, are merely an indication that cells and modules are\ndifferent groups of product types which are sold at different prices.\nTherefore, it is necessary to define different prices to make the minimum\nimport prices meaningful.\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the fact that cells\nand modules are distinct groups of product types is not as such relevant for\nthe definition of the product concerned. For the definition of the product\nconcerned, it is sufficient that the products share the same basic\ncharacteristics and end uses, which is the case for modules and cells as described\nin recitals (32) and (48) respectively.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that the\nassessment whether cells and modules are a single product concerned does not\naddress a number of criteria defined by the Appelate Body in EC \u2013 Asbestos[5]. However, these criteria are used for the definition of the\n\"like product\", not the product concerned. In other words, these\ncriteria have to be used to define the like product, for example the like\nproduct produced by Union Industry, which is then compared with the product\nconcerned exported by the Chinese exporting producers. These criteria are not\npertinent when defining the product concerned. In any event, the Institutions\nobserve that the application of the criteria used in EC \u2013 Asbestos to\nthe definition of the product concerned in the present case would not lead to a\ndifferent outcome. The first and the second criteria (properties, nature and\nquality respectively end-uses) are identical to the criteria physical, chemical\nand technical properties and end-uses used in the preceeding recitals. The\nthird criterion (consumers taste and habits) is not really useful for the\npresent case, as cells are the key component of modules; as regards the fourth\ncriterion, tariff classification, it is noted that both cells and modules can\nbe declared under customs heading 8541 40 90, while the customs headings under\nheading 8501 are for electric generators in general and not in particular for\nsolar products.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other interested parties\nargued that an objective application of the criteria developed by the Court of\nJustice in previous cases[6] allegedly leads to the conclusion that modules and cells are\ndifferent products. In this respect, it is noted that the court only indicated\na number of criteria which may be taken into account \u2011 there is no obligation\nto use all criteria in all cases, since not all of them may be relevant. These\ncriteria were assessed in recitals (27) to (39) to the provisional Regulation,\nwhere it was found that a number of criteria are not relevant in the present\ncase. In the Brosmann case the assessment whether different types of\nshoes belong to the \"product concerned\" was also made on the basis of\nonly three criteria which were found to be relevant. As the interested parties\ndid not provide any reasoning why an objective application of the criteria\nleads one to conclude that modules and cells are distinct products, the\nargument cannot be accepted.\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it is recalled\nthat cells and modules have the same basic end uses, i.e. they are sold for\nintegration into PV solar systems. The modules performance is directly linked\nto the performance of the cells, as indicated in recital (28) to the\nprovisional Regulation.\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat with the exclusion of wafers from the product scope, and due to the\nsignificant processing involved to make modules from cells, the argument that\ncells and modules have the same end uses also stands refuted. It is also argued\nthat the assessment that modules and cells have the same end uses is based on\nthe assumption that wafers, modules and cells have the same production process.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, the conclusion\nthat the assessment that modules and cells have the same end uses is based on\nthe production process is wrong. While both statements are indeed in the same\nrecital (36) to the provisional Regulation, this does not mean that one\nconclusion is based on the other assumption. The word \"moreover\"\nseparating the two statements makes it clear that the second statement is not\nbased on the first. In addition, the two statements are made to address\nseparate issues under the heading \"End use and interchangeability\".\nThe first statement concerning the production process addresses\ninterchangeability, while the second statement addresses end use. The\nunderlying assumption that the assessment that modules and cells have the same\nend uses is based on the assumption that wafers, modules and cells have the\nsame production process is therefore incorrect.\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nto the actual end use of cells and modules, it is not disputed by interested parties\nthat modules and cells are sold for integration into PV solar systems. The\nconclusion that modules and cells have the same end use is therefore confirmed.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mono\nand multi-crystalline cells\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that there was no production of mono crystalline cells in the Union,\nand that their exports of mono crystalline cells were not competing with the Union\nindustry. The investigation showed however that there was indeed production of\nmono crystalline cells in the Union. This argument was therefore rejected. In\nany event, the General Court held in Brosmann that the absence of Community\nproduction of a particular product type is not decisive.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Consigned\nfrom\" clause\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties argued\nthat the extension of the scope of the investigation was to products\n\"consigned from\" the PRC, while the investigation was initiated only\nagainst products originating in the PRC was unjustified.\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\ngoods consigned from the PRC were already covered at the initiation stage. In point\n5 of the Notice of Initiation[7] it is\nstated that \"companies which ship the product concerned from the\nPeople's Republic of China but consider that part or even all of those exports\ndo not have their customs origin in the People's Republic of China are invited\nto come forward in the investigation and to furnish all relevant information\".\nIt is therefore clear that all companies consigning goods from the PRC had the\nopportunity to co-operate in this investigation. Furthermore, since the product\nunder investigation frequently incorporates components and parts from different\ncountries, it was also announced in point 5 of the Notice of Initiation that\n\"special provisions may be adopted\" to address this issue.\n(52)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore considered that\nall economic operators affected were duly informed of the possibility that special\nprovisions in respect of goods consigned from the PRC may be adopted, if\nappropriate, and were invited to co-operate in the investigation. Thus the\nscope of the investigation was not extended to products \"consigned from\nthe PRC\", since these were covered from the outset.\n(53)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure,\ninterested parties argued that irrespective of the provisions in the Notice of\nInitiation referred to in recital (51) above, the investigation was limited to\ngoods originating in the PRC and did not assess the impact of goods consigned\nfrom the PRC.\n(54)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nnoted that the following steps were taken to ensure that all goods consigned\nfrom the PRC were assessed during the investigation, and not only goods\noriginating in the PRC:\n\u00b7              \nAll companies which ship the product concerned\nfrom the PRC were invited to come forward in the investigation irrespective of\nthe origin of the goods.\n\u00b7              \nIn Annex A of the Notice of initiation,\nexporters were asked to report information for all products manufactured by the\ncompany. This information was not limited to goods originating in the PRC.\n\u00b7              \nOn the basis of this information, which\ncontained all exports to the EU irrespective of the origin of the goods, a\nrepresentative sample was selected.\n\u00b7              \nThe sampled producers received a questionnaire\nfor \"producers exporting to the European Union\", and the PRC was\nreferred to as \"country concerned\", not country of origin. It was\ntherefore clear that all goods irrespective of the origin of the goods were\ninvestigated.\n(55)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, it is\nconcluded that the investigation covered all goods originating in or consigned\nfrom the PRC, and that the findings of the investigation, including dumping and\ninjury, cover all goods originating in or consigned from the PRC.\n(56)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\ninterested parites argued that the complaint contained only prima facie\nevidence concerning imports of solar panels originating in the PRC, not goods\nconsigned from the PRC. In this respect, it needs to be clarified that the\ncomplaint indeed covered goods \"from the PRC\", which can be seen from\nthe cover page submitted by the applicant bearing the stamp. Before this page,\nthere is another page on the file which indeed uses the wording\n\"originating in the People's Republic of China\". But this case was\nnot part of the document submitted by the complainant, but added as a cover\npage by the Commission Services, using the name of the investigation rather\nthan repeating the title of the complaint. It is therefore considered that the\ncomplaint covered all goods from the PRC, whether originating in the PRC or\nnot.\n(57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese exporting producers\nfurther argued that exporting producers in third countries cannot reasonably be\nexpected to have known that their products could also be targeted by the\ninvestigation. In this respect it is noted that the measures do not apply to\ngoods which are in transit in the sense of Article V GATT. Therefore, exporting\nproducers which have no operations in the PRC are not affected by the measures.\nFurthermore, no exporting producers in third countries came forward raising the\nissue that the products they export are subject to the anti-dumping duty.\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same exporting\nproducers argued that exporting producers in third countries were not asked to\ncome forward, and not given the opportunity to show that their products are not\ndumped. The Institutions consider that those exporting producers without any\noperations in the PRC are not affected by the measures, as their goods, if\nconsigned from the PRC, will have been in transit. All other exporting\nproducers were informed by the Notice of Initiation that their operations are\npart of the investigation.\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC argued that while\nArticle 1(3) of the basic Regulation allows deviating from the principle that\nthe exporting country is the country of origin, this Article cannot be used in\nthe present case. In support of this claim they argue that no complete analysis\nwhether the exporting country may be an intermediary country. The Institutions\ndisagree with this interpretation of Article 1 (3) of the basic Regulation. No\nparty contests that there is significant production in the PRC. Whether or not\nthe PRC is the country of origin of the finished goods depends on several\nfactors. The analysis of dumping, injury, causation and Union interest carried\nout by the Institutions refers to that production, irrespective of the question\nwhether the finished exported good has its customs origin in the PRC. As there\nwere strong indications that not all products which were at least partially\nproduced in the PRC would be considered to have their customs origin in the\nPRC, the Institutions decided that it was necessary to cover also products for\nwhich the PRC is only an intermediary country.\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC further argued that\nsince no Chinese exporter has been granted MET, there is no comparable price\nfor solar panels in ine PRC, and as a consequence the PRC cannot be used as an\nintermediate country. However, in this respect it is noted that the three\nconditions of Article 1(3) of the basic Regulation are given as examples only,\nand not all conditions may be relevant in all cases. In the present case, since\nno Chinese exporter has been granted MET, the comparable price had to be\nestablished in the analogue country \u2013 and this comparable price is the same\nirrespective of whether The PRC is considered the country of origin or the\nintermediate country. Therefore, the issue whether there is a comparable price \"in\nthat country\" is irrelevant, as in the present case the comparable price\nis not established \"in that country\", but in the analogue country.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Solar\nchargers\n(61)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, interested parties claimed that the definition of \"solar\nchargers that consist of less than six cells\" is too narrow, and should be\nextended to products with a similar function which are not covered by this\ndefinition such as products with a similar size using a larger number of\nsmaller cells.\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, interested\nparties claimed that the definition of \"silicon PV products that are\npermanently integrated into electrical goods\" is too narrow, as only the\ncomplete electrical good is excluded, while solar components for integration\ninto the electrical goods are not necessarily excluded.\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, an analysis of the above\narguments showed that it is more appropriate to add to the exclusion of such\nproducts a criterion on the basis of a technical standard. In particular, it\nwas established that the definitions of the following standard more\nappropriately define the products which should be excluded from the scope of\nthe measures: international Standard IEC 61730-1,\nApplication Classes, Class C: Limited Voltage, limited power applications (p.\n13)[8].\n(64)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\ndefinitive disclosure, comments were received concerning the exclusion based on\nthe international standard mentioned above. It was argued that rather than\nreferring to the standard, it would be more appropriate to define the exclusion\non the basis of the output voltage and the power output as \"modules or\npanels with a output voltage not exceeding 50 V DC and a power output not\nexceeding 50 W solely for direct use as battery chargers in systems with the\nsame voltage and power characteristics\". This claim could be accepted,\nand the exclusion is finally determined according to this definition.\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roof-integrated\nsolar modules\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that roof-integrated solar modules should be excluded from the product\nscope of the investigation, since they combine the functionality of a solar\nmodule with that of a roof tile or slate. Therefore, they would not be directly\ninterchangeable with a standard solar module.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation, however, showed that both standard modules and the\nroof-integrated solar modules have to comply with the same electrical\nstandards. In addition while the roof-integrated solar module cannot be simply\nreplaced with a standard module, it can be replaced by a standard module plus\nroof tiles or slate. These products therefore have the same basic technical\nproperty of generating electricity from sunlight. The added functionality\n(which is otherwise provided by roofing material) was not considered\nsubstantial and does not warrant an exclusion of roof-integrated solar modules\nfrom the product scope.\n(67)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following definitive\ndisclosure, the same interested party argued that the absence of\ndual-interchangeability between roof-integrated solar modules and standard\nsolar modules is an indication that roof-integrated solar modules should be\nexcluded from the scope of the measures, referring to the footware[9] case in general and special technology\nathletics footwear 'STAF' in particular. However, the reasons for the exclusion\nof STAF were numerous, and the absence of dual interchangeability by itself was\nnot considered a sufficient ground by the General Court in the Brosmann[10] case, which confirmed that very different product such as city\ntrotters and hiking boots can indeed be considered product concerned in a\nsingle anti-dumping investigation despite their differences.\n(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the interested\nparty argued that due to the absence of production in the Union and the fact\nthat the interested party holds intellectual property rights is allegedly a\nconfirmation that roof-integrated solar modules are innovative and different\nfrom any other product. However, referring again to the footwear case\nmentioned by the interested party, the General Court held in Brosmann that \u201cthe\nabsence of Community production of that type of footwear and the existence of a\npatent are not conclusive.\"[11]. As a\nresult, patented technology footwear was considered product concerned in that\ncase.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interested party also\nargued that roof-integrated solar modules should be excluded from the\ndefinition of the product concerned, since they are sold at substantially\nhigher prices than standard modules. Also, in the footwear case STAF\nabove a certain price were excluded from the definition of the product\nconcerned. In this respect, it is noted that a roof-integrated solar module does\ncombine the functionality of a solar module and roof tile or slate, as\nindicated in recital (66) above. A direct comparison of prices is therefore not\nmeaningful, as the added functionality naturally leads to higher prices.\n(70)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to this argument,\nthe interested party argued that on the basis of this argumentation, it would\nbe impossible to ever invoke price differences as an additional indicator\nwarranting the exclusion from the product scope. However, this interpretation\nis too far-reaching. What is said in the previous recital is merely that in\nthis particular case where the roof-integrated modules combine the\nfunctionality of the product concerned plus another product (in this case roof\ntile or slate), the price is naturally not meaningful. This in no way means\nthat in other cases the price difference cannot be a useful indicator to\nestablish whether a product should be excluded from the definition of the\nproduct concerned.\n(71)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, the interested\nparty argued that its supplier of roof-integrated solar modules should be\ngranted access to the minimum price undertaking. However, it appears that the\nChinese exporter concerned did not co-operate in the investigation, and as a\nnon-cooperating party is not eligible to participate in the undertaking. These\nrequest can therefore not be accepted.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\n(72)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nview of the above, the product scope is definitively defined as crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels and cells of the type used in crystalline silicon\nPV modules or panels, originating in or consigned from the PRC unless they are\nin transit in the sense of Article V GATT. The cells have a thickness not\nexceeding 400 micrometres. This product is currently falling within CN codes ex\n8501 31 00, ex 8501 32 00, ex 8501 33 00, ex 8501 34 00, ex 8501 61 20, ex 8501\n61 80, ex 8501 62 00, ex 8501 63 00, ex 8501 64 00 and ex 8541 40 90.\n(73)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nfollowing product types are excluded from the definition of the product\nconcerned:\n\u2013              \nsolar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells, are portable and supply electricity to devices or charge batteries,\n\u2013              \nthin film photovoltaic products,\n\u2013              \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic products that\nare permanently integrated into electrical goods, where the function of the\nelectrical goods is other than power generation, and where these electrical\ngoods consume the electricity generated by the integrated crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic cell(s).\n\u2013              \nmodules or panels with a output voltage not\nexceeding 50 V DC and a power output not exceeding 50 W solely for direct use\nas battery chargers in systems with the same voltage and power characteristics.\n\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe exclusion of wafers, the analysis has been revised by excluding the data and\nanalysis related to wafers, unless otherwise indicated. Given that wafers\nrepresented only a small percentage of imports of the product concerned in the Union\n(around 2 % in value) during the IP, the exclusion of wafers is considered to\nhave a negligible impact if any on the findings. All comments by interested\nparties have been addressed but any reference to wafers even if raised has been\nexcluded. As a consequence all references and related data concerning wafers\nreported in the recitals to the provisional Regulation are no longer applicable,\neven when relevant recitals are confirmed by this Regulation.\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently,\nthe provisional conclusions, modified as set out under recitals (26) to (74)\nabove, were definitively confirmed. For the purposes of this proceeding and in\naccordance with consistent practice, it was therefore considered that all types\nof the product concerned should be regarded as forming one single product.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUMPING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nPRC\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market\nEconomy Treatment (MET)\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure, interested parties claimed that the MET\ndetermination was made out of time, i.e. after the three-month period laid down\nin Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation and that the investigation therefore\nshould be terminated without delay.\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, these parties argued that the amendment of the basic Regulation[12] purportedly extending the deadline to make the MET determination to\neight months only entered into force after the expiry of previously applicable\nthree months deadline. The amendment would apply only to future investigations\nand to pending investigations where the deadline for making the MET\ndetermination had not yet lapsed at that time.\n(78)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Article 2 of the amendment of the basic Regulation clearly\nstates that \"this Regulation shall apply to all new and to all pending\ninvestigations as from 15 December 2012\". This Article, or indeed the\nwhole Regulation, does not contain any reference to the restriction \"where\nthe deadline for making the MET determination had not yet lapsed\" claimed\nby the interested parties. Therefore, this argument cannot be accepted.\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, several interested parties re-iterated their argument that\nthe MET determination was made out of time, without challenging the fact that\nthe amendment of the basic Regulation referred to in recital (78) above applies\nto \"all pending investigations\", which includes the present\ninvestigation. It is therefore finally concluded that the MET determination was\nnot made out of time.\n(80)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, one exporter claimed that MET should not have been denied\nbecause three companies which ceased operations during 2011 did not have one\nclear set of basic accounting records. In particular, it was questioned\npursuant to which accounting standard a company which ceased operations should\nnevertheless prepare such accounting records.\n(81)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect it is noted that the accounting standards do not define which\ncompanies are required to prepare financial statements - accounting standards\ndefine how these statements have to be prepared. In the case of The PRC, it is\nthe \"Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises: Basic Standard\"\nwhich defines in its Article 4 that \"an enterprise shall prepare financial\nreports\". This is a mandatory obligation, and there is no exemption for\ncompanies which ceased operation.\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\neven though these companies ceased operation, they still owned assets\n(including land, buildings, machinery and stocks) and liabilities and did exist\nas legal entities at least until early 2013. It is therefore considered that\nthese companies were obliged to publish accounting records for the year 2011,\nand the lack of these accounting records constitutes a violation of criterion\n2.\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, exporters also claimed that the benefits received from\npreferential tax regime(s) and grants do not represent a significant proportion\nof their turnover, which is allegedly confirmed by the parallel anti-subsidy\ninvestigation.\n(84)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it is recalled that this argument was already addressed in\nrecital (65) to the provisional Regulation. It was stressed that in particular\ndue to the nature of this advantage, the absolute benefit received during the\nIP is irrelevant for assessing whether the distortion is 'significant'. This\nclaim is therefore rejected.\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments regarding the Market Economy Treatment, all determinations in recitals\n(50) to (69) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Individual\nexamination\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated in recital\n(70) to the provisional Regulation, 18 cooperating exporting producers or\ngroups of exporting producers not selected in the sample submitted claims for\nindividual examination pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation. In\nthe present case, the sample already consisted of seven groups of companies,\nwhich typically consist of a number of exporting producers, related traders and\nrelated importers in the Union and third countries. An individual examination\nof 18 additional (groups of) exporting producers, in addition to the seven\ngroups of exporting producers included in the sample, would be unduly\nburdensome and would prevent completion of the investigation in good time\n(87)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of other comments regarding individual examination, all\ndeterminations in recitals (70) to (71) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analogue\nCountry\n(88)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties noted\nthat India is not a suitable analogue country due to local content provisions\nfor projects of the \"Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission\"\n('JNNSM'). One party alleged that a 75% local content is required, while\nanother party alleged that Indian producers can charge higher prices for 100%\ndomestically produced modules. They further alleged that such requirements\nsignificantly increase prices of local products. In support of this claim, an\nIndian press article was submitted[13]. However,\nthis Article was published almost one year after the end of the IP, and no\nproof for its impact during the IP has been provided.\n(89)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the same press\narticle reported that the Indian solar industry faces \"stiff competition\nfrom western and Chinese manufacturers\". This is supported by the steady\nincrease of imports into India, as stated in recital (92) below. While the\nlocal content requirements may indeed have a certain impact on the Indian domestic\nmarket, a clear conclusion can nevertheless be drawn that the Indian market is\na competitive one, where numerous Indian and foreign companies effectively\ncompete with each other.\n(90)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, according to information published by the JRC[14], the majority of the JNNSM projects will come on-line from 2015\nonwards. Indeed, the target for grid-connected PV systems under the JNNSM for\n2012 was only 50 MW compared to a total grid-connected capacity in India\nexceeding 1 GW already in June 2012. This shows that during the IP the\nimportance of the JNNSM on total solar installations in India was below 5% and\ntherefore the impact of the JNNSM and its local content requirements, if they\nalready existed during the IP, a fact that has not been established by the\ninterested parties, was at best very limited. The majority of the installations\nduring the IP were in the state of Gujarat (about 65%), driven by state support\npolicies.\n(91)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interested\nparties claimed that the Indian market was de facto protected during the\nIP from imports from a variety of sources, including the PRC, because the\ninitiation of an anti-dumping investigation was looming since the beginning of\n2012. Indeed, India initiated an anti-dumping investigation against imports of\nsolar cells and modules from the PRC, Malaysia, Taiwan and the USA on 23 November\n2012, i.e. only almost five months after the end of the IP.\n(92)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nthis allegation is not supported by the development of imports of solar cells\nand modules reported by the Indian trade statistics[15]:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Values in million USD || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 2010 \u2011 March 2011 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 2011 \u2011 March 2012 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 2012 \u2011 March 2013 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRC || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,33 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 577,24 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 371,72 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 746 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 481 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Total || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 252,63 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 348,48 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 827,07 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 534 || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 327 \n(93)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The table above shows that\nimports of solar cells and modules dramatically increased by more than 600 %\nfor the PRC and more than 400 % overall between 2010/11 and 2011/12.\nSubsequently, the import values somewhat decreased, but so did prices for solar\ncells and modules. Indeed, the drop in import values between 2011/12 and\n2012/13 is in line with the price decrease reported by specialized\nconsultancies such as pvXchange for the same period, leading to the conclusion\nthat the import volumes remained rather stable between 2011/12 and 2012/13. It\nis therefore concluded that the Indian market was not de facto protected\nduring the IP from imports from a variety of sources, including the PRC.\n(94)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\nthe Government of China argued that the USA have requested consultations with\nIndia under the WTO dispute settlement procedures concerning the local content\nrequirements of the JNNSM on 6 February 2013. The effect of these local content\nrules, in combination with the anti-dumping investigation mentioned in (91)\nabove, allegedly led to a decrease of 38% in value terms in April 2012 \u2013\nMarch 2013 compared to the previous year, in contrast to the increase in\nprevious years.\n(95)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is noted\nthat the decrease in value terms is due to a decrease in prices rather than\nimport volumes. Following definitive disclosure, an interested party provided\ninformation on the development of imports of solar cells and modules on the\nIndian market in terms of volume between 2010 and March 2013. This data shows a\nsteady increase if imports of solar modules and cells into the Indian market in\nterms of volume. It is therefore concluded that the Indian market was not de\nfacto protected due to a looming anti-dumping investigation, and the claimed,\nbut not proven, in any event at the very best minor effects of the local\ncontent requirements under the JNNSM mentioned in recital (90) above did not\nprevent a steady increase in imports in terms of volume.\n(96)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, it is pointed\nout that the period of April 2012 \u2013 March 2013 showing the alleged effects of\nthe JNNSM on imports into India is predominantly after the IP. Any possible\nimpact of this alleged decrease on the IP can therefore only be minor.\n(97)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nalleged that Tata Power Solar ('Tata') only recently entered the market, and is\ntherefore not a suitable analogue country producer. In this respect, it is\nnoted that the company, previously \"Tata BP Solar\", is producing\nsolar modules since 1989 and can therefore not be considered having entered the\nmarket only recently. Indeed, according to information provided by another\ninterested party, Tata entered the market significantly earlier than the five\nlargest sampled Chinese exporters.\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nclaimed that Taiwan would be a more suitable analogue country than India, since\nthe size of the Taiwanese companies is more comparable to the size of the\nChinese exporters, and there is also co-operation from Taiwanese producers.\nAlso, other interested parties questioned whether India would be a reasonable\nanalogue country given the comparably small size of Tata without proposing a\nmore suitable alternative.\n(99)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, Taiwanese companies\nco-operated. One company fully co-operated, while another company only\nco-operated partially. The sole fully co-operating Taiwanese company is however\nsmaller than Tata, in particular in terms of sales and production of modules\nwhich account for around 90% of the sales of the product concerned, where Tata\nsells substantially more than the Taiwanese company who only has insignificant\nsales in this respect, as mentioned in recital (76) to the provisional\nRegulation. Following definitive disclosure, one exporter asked whether the\npartially co-operating Taiwanese company was contacted to furnish the missing\ninformation. In this respect it is referred to recital (76) to the provisional\nRegulation, which clarifies that Taiwan could not be used as analogue country\nsince the co-operating Taiwanese companies almost exclusively produced cells,\nwhile the Chinese exports are mainly in the form of modules. This also applies\nto the partly co-operating Taiwanese producer. Since this producer was already\nconsidered unsuitable for this reason, it was not considered appropriate to\nrequest additional information from this company.\n(100)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nsame interested party claimed that the almost complete lack of sales of modules\ndoes not disqualify Taiwan as analogue country per se, since the\nprocessing costs from making cells into modules can be established without much\ndifficulty. This is, however, not supported by the facts of the investigation.\nProducing a module from cells requires multiple steps of production, during\nwhich a significant part of the value added of the module is created. As\nindicated in recital (137) to the provisional Regulation, during the IP the\naverage price difference between cells and modules was EUR 555,92 or 54%,\nwhile the average cost difference amounted to EUR 377,99 or 34%. This would\nmean that a significant share of a possible Taiwanese Normal Value for modules\nwould have to be based on adjustments for processing costs, which cannot be\nconsidered more reasonable than a country where the Normal Value can be based\non domestic sales prices for most of the product concerned. It is therefore\nconsidered that India has been selected as analogue country in a reasonable\nmanner, taking account of the available reliable information.\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nargued that no reasons were given why the USA was not considered an appropriate\nanalogue country. In this respect reference is made to recital (74) to the\nprovisional Regulation, where it is clearly stated \"that the USA would\nnot be a suitable analogue country, mainly due to the fact that the US market\nwas protected from Chinese imports during part of the IP by anti-dumping and\nanti-subsidy measures.\" Since no comments on the protection of the US\nmarket as such were received, the position in this respect remains unchanged.\n(102)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties argued\nthat the result of the dumping calculation is distorted due to differences in\neconomies of scale between the Chinese producers and the Indian producer. It\nwas therefore checked whether a correlation between a company's production\nvolume and its dumping margin indeed exists.\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0 Of the seven company groups\nincluded in the sample, there are two medium sized company groups (Jinzhou\nYangguang and Delsolar) and five large company groups (JingAo, LDK, Suntech,\nTrina and Yingli). Of the medium sized companies, Jinzhou Yangguang has the\nlowest margin, while Delsolar has the highest margin. The five larger companies\nare in-between. This clearly demonstrates the absence of any correlation\nbetween economies of scale and dumping margins. Therefore, it is considered\nthat the dumping calculation is not distorted due to differences in economies\nof scale between the Chinese producers and the Indian producer.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0 Following definitive\ndisclosure, interested parties claimed that the absence of any correlation\nbetween economies of scale and dumping margins does not show that there is no\nimpact of economies of scale and the comparability of prices. In a situation\nwhere the dumping margin is based on an identical Normal Value for all\nexporters as in the present case, the dumping margin is mainly driven by the\nexport prices. The absence of any correlation between economies of scale and\ndumping margin therefore equally demonstrates the absence of any correlation\nbetween economies of scale and sales prices. It is therefore concluded that\ndifferences in economies of scale do not affect the comparability of prices in\nthe present case.\n(105)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the analogue country producer had extremely high domestic sales prices,\nwhich allegedly are significantly higher than the sales prices of the Union\nindustry, since the dumping margin significantly exceeds the undercutting\nmargin. This claim was made by comparing Indian Normal Values with the sales\nprices of the Union industry. This comparison is, however, flawed since the\nIndian Normal Value is based on the profitable sales only. Especially in a situation\nwhere the Union industry is loss-making, it is not surprising that profitable\nprices in India exceed the average Union industry price. Therefore, the fact\nthat the Indian Normal Value exceeds average Union industry prices does not\ndemonstrate that the choice of India as analogue country is unreasonable.\n(106)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat Tata's prices are distorted, since it is related to Tata Power, a utility\ncompany. This allegedly allows Tata to charge higher prices in the areas served\nby Tata Power. However, no supporting evidence was provided, and no\nquantification of this alleged effect was provided either. This claim could\ntherefore not be accepted.\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0 Following definitive\ndisclosure, one exporter argued that Tata is an uncompetitive company with high\nproduction costs and sales prices, which was allegedly the reason why BP Solar\nwithdrew from the joint venture in December 2011. In support of this, a press\narticle is quoted, stating that \"BP's exit from the solar industry after some four\ndecades shows how competitive and crowded the solar market has become.\" However, this article did not single out\nTata as an uncompetitive company, it addressed the situation on the market for\nsolar panels in general, speaking about \"cutthroat competition that\nmarks an industry\", and that \"many companies worldwide have\nclosed factories, laid off hundreds of workers and filed for\nbankruptcies\". This press article can therefore not demonstrate that\nTata is an uncompetitive company with high production costs and sales prices.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one exporter\nargued that Tata was not included as part of the Indian domestic industry in\nthe on-going Indian anti-dumping investigation mentioned in recital (91) above,\ndue to its significant imports of cells. While it is confirmed that Tata is\nindeed not part of the Indian domestic industry in the on-going Indian\nanti-dumping investigation, this does not automatically mean than Tata is not a\nsuitable analogue country producer. The Normal Value was based exclusively on cells\nand modules produced by Tata in India, and not on imported goods. The fact that\nimported components were used in the production of some of the products does\nnot mean that the resulting Normal Value is not representative for India, even\nmore so since it is predominantly based on sales prices and not on costs.\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0 The Government of China\nargued that Tata's sales of modules allegedly only represent only 0,3% of the\nChinese exports to the EU and cannot be considered representative, referring to\nthe Detlef N\u00f6lle[16] judgment of the Court. In that case, the Court considered that when\nthe total production in a country is only 1,25% of the export volume to the EU,\nthis amounts to an indication that the market considered is not very\nrepresentative. In the present case, the Government of China did not compare\nthe total production in India with the total Chinese exports, but only the\nproduction of one Indian company with the total exports of all Chinese\nexporters. This comparison is however flawed, since in a competitive market\nwith multiple players the quantities relating to only one producer are not\nindicative of the representativity of the market as a whole. In addition, it is\nnot the comparison which was made in the Detlef N\u00f6lle case either, where\nthe total production of the country was compared with total exports. According\nto information provided by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export\nof Machinery ('CCCME'), production in India was forecasted to exceed 2 GW\nbefore the end of 2012, i.e. shortly after the end of the IP. Such a production\nwould be equal to 14% of Chinese exports to the EU, well above the 5% indicative\nthreshold mentioned in the Detlef N\u00f6lle judgment.\n(110)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one\ninterested party referred to the fact that Tata lacks upstream integration and\nhas to source wafers from third parties. Allegedly, this lack of upstream\nvertical integration leads to an increase of costs compared to vertically\nintegrated Chinese producers. This claim was however not substantiated. In\nparticular, the total cost of Tata would only be higher if their purchase price\nfor wafers would exceed the cost of production of a wafer, which is uncertain\nsince many companies in the solar business have been loss-making during the IP.\nFurthermore, even large vertically integrated Chinese producers often purchased\nsignificant quantities of wafers from independent suppliers, which supports the\nconclusion that the lack of vertical integration into wafers does not\nnecessarily lead to higher costs for modules and cells. \n(111)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the analogue country is uncompetitive. This claim is supported by the fact\nthat the production of solar cells in India is at a 5-year low in 2013. The\nreport quoted by that interested party however showed during the IP the Indian\ncell production was still at a high level close to the peak reported. The\nsignificant decrease in production occurred after the IP, and therefore had no\nimpact on the results of the investigation.\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0 Another argument brought\nforward to support the claim that the analogue country is uncompetitive is the\nanti-dumping investigation mentioned in recital (91) above. The Institutions\nobserve that that investigation is still on-going, and that therefore, no\nconclusions can be drawn from it. In general, anti-dumping investigations are\nnot an indication for a lack of competitiveness, but an indication that the\ndomestic industry considers that it is subject to unfair trade practices from\ncompetitors located in third countries.\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0 On balance, the Commission\nconsiders that the choice of India as an analogue country is not unreasonable.\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments regarding the Analogue Country, all determinations in recitals (72) to\n(77) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal\nValue\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, one interested party commented that the Indian companies mainly\nsold off-grid modules, which have higher prices and costs than the\ngrid-connected modules sold by the Chinese exporters. It was further claimed\nthat off-grid modules typically have a lower power output than grid-connected\nmodules.\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is noted\nthat different Normal Values were established for \"standard-sized\"\nmodules with more than 36 cells which are typically grid connected and smaller\nmodules with 36 cells or less which are typically used off-grid. It is\ntherefore considered that an appropriate Normal Value is established for all\nproduct types, including off-grid modules and grid-connected modules.\n(117)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nstated that Tata is also active as a project developer, and the sales of this\ncompany are therefore not comparable with sales of modules only by Chinese\nexporting producers. In this respect it is noted that the comparison between domestic\nIndian prices and Chinese export prices were exclusively made for sales of\nmodules, and sales of complete projects or integrated solutions were not used\nto establish Normal Value as they were not considered to be comparable.\n(118)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments regarding Normal Value, all determinations in recitals (78) to (86) to\nthe provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export\nprice\n(119)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, some of the sampled exporters commented on minor issues concerning\nthe export price used to establish the dumping margin. Where warranted, the\ncomments were taken into account and led to a slight revision of the dumping\nmargin of the companies concerned.\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments regarding export price, all determinations in recitals (87) to (89) to\nthe provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparison\n(121)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, some of the sampled exporters commented on minor issues concerning\nthe allowances used to compare export prices. Where warranted, the comments\nwere taken into account and led to a slight revision of the dumping margin of\nthe companies concerned.\n(122)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, a clerical error resulting in an incorrect adjustment to Normal\nValue for domestic freight was discovered. This error was corrected and led to\na slight decrease in dumping margins.\n(123)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, one\ninterested party claimed that an adjustment for level of trade may be\nwarranted, since the party does not sell directly to installers, but to\nresellers and distributors. The party requested detailed information on the\nsales channels of the analogue country producer, which could not be provided to\nprotect confidential information. As an alternative, the customer base of the\nanalogue country producer was categorized into different categories according\nto sales volume, which showed that a level of trade adjustment was not\nwarranted.\n(124)\u00a0\u00a0 In response to this\nanalysis, the interested party admitted that a difference in sales quantities\nwould result in price differences, but maintained their argument that they\nwould allegedly charge higher prices to installers than distributors/resellers\neven if the installer would buy a similar quantity than the\ndistributor/reseller. However, this claim was not substantied and could\ntherefore not be taken into account.\n(125)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomment regarding export price, all determinations in recitals (90) to (92) to\nthe provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping\nmargins\n(126)\u00a0\u00a0 One\nsampled exporting producer requested a full disclosure of its dumping\ncalculations, claiming that it could otherwise not comment on the accuracy\nthereof. As this company was not granted MET, its\nnormal value was based on data from India as analogue country. Given that only\none producer in the analogue country fully co-operated in the investigation,\ninformation from the analogue country cannot be disclosed on a product type\nlevel in order to protect confidential information. Therefore, the claim needs\nto be rejected.\n(127)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe sampled companies, the weighted average normal value of each type of the\nlike product established for the analogue country was compared with the\nweighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned,\nas provided for in Article 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation.\n(128)\u00a0\u00a0 The weighted average dumping\nmargin of the cooperating exporting producers not included in the sample was\ncalculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(6) of the basic\nRegulation. Accordingly, that margin was established on the basis of the\nmargins established for the sampled exporting producers.\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0 On that basis, the\ndefinitive dumping margin for the cooperating companies not included in the\nsample was established at 88,1 %.\n(130)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to all other\nexporting producers in the PRC, the dumping margins were established on the\nbasis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic\nRegulation. To that end the level of cooperation was first established by\ncomparing the volume of exports to the Union reported by the cooperating\nexporting producers with the volume of Chinese exports, as established in\nrecital (167).\n(131)\u00a0\u00a0 As the cooperation accounted\nfor more than 80 % of total Chinese exports to the Union, the level of\ncooperation can be considered high. Since there was no reason to believe that\nany exporting producer deliberately abstained from cooperating, the residual\ndumping margin was set at the level of the sampled company with the highest\ndumping margin. This was considered appropriate since there were no indications\nthat the non- cooperating companies were dumping at a lower level, and in order\nto ensure the effectiveness of any measure.\n(132)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis the definitive\ndumping margins expressed as a percentage of the CIF Union frontier price, duty\nunpaid, are as follows:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Company || \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dumping Margin \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co.

The Institutions have verified claims by interested parties that\nthere was a higher number; this verification has revealed that the alleged\nadditional producers were in reality mostly exporting producers, importers\nrelated to those, distributors and installers. \n(134)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure, several parties contested the fact that data\nprovided by Europressedienst, an independent consultancy firm ('the\nconsultant'), were used to determine, inter alia, Union production, Union\nproduction capacity as well as other macroeconomic injury indicators concerning\nthe Union industry and import data. These parties questioned the independence\nof the consultant alleging that it was linked to the complainant. They also\nrequested clarifications on what basis the consultant was selected by the\nCommission and questioned its expertise in collecting economic data related to\nthe PV sector. In this regard, it was claimed that the Commission should have\nbased its findings on data from other available sources, in particular known research\ninstitutes. Lastly, a reference to Best Practices\nfor the submission of economic evidence and data collection in cases concerning\nthe application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and in merger cases was made by\nAFASE to contest the reliability of the data submitted by the consultant.\n(135)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged links\nbetween the consultant and the complainant, the relevant interested parties did\nnot submit any evidence showing the existence of such links. Likewise, the\ninvestigation did not bring into light any evidence of a relationship going\nbeyond purely commercial character. Following final disclosure one interested\nparty claimed that there were indications that the prima facie evidence\nprovided by the complainant Union industry in the complaint were based on data\nprovided by the same consultant. Even though it is acknowledged that findings\nfor some indicators were indeed similar to the evidence provided in the\ncomplaint that does not necessarily mean that they were established on the\nbasis of one source only. In this regard, the complaint provides the various\nsources used. \n(136)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nexplained in recital (99) to the provisional Regulation, the Commission\nconsidered it appropriate to make use of this consultancy in the current\ninvestigation, due to the unavailability from other public sources of the\nnecessary macro-economic data covering the total Union market as well as import\ndata. Prior to selecting Europressedienst the Commission assessed the\nmethodology used by the consultant for the collection of the relevant data as\nwell as the consultant\u2019s ability to provide the necessary data separately for\nall product types and for the entire period considered. \n(137)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nduring the investigation, data provided by the consultant were counter checked\nwhen possible with other available sources and were confirmed. In this respect,\nit is noted that several research companies specialised in collecting PV\nstatistics exist on the market and the figures reported are almost never\nidentical. This is due to the fact that precise figures are difficult to derive\nfor any research institute and therefore the reported PV market indicators will\nalways be based on estimates, independently of the provider of such figure. In\nthis context, the cross-checking exercise carried out by the Commission\nconsisted of comparing the trends of the data received from the consultant with\nthe trends of the same data published by other research companies, the\nCommission's Joint Research Center ('JRC') and the European Photovoltaic\nIndustry Association ('EPIA') on the same topics, when available. No\nsignificant differences were noticed as a result of the cross-checking exercise\nas the trends of the indicators for which the cross-checking was done were\nsimilar. Provisional findings were therefore not solely based on data provided\nby the consultant but also on the Commission\u2019s own analysis and assessment of\nthese data. In addition, as mentioned above in recital (9), after the\nimposition of provisional measures a verification visit took place at the\npremises of the consultant. The Commission carried out the on-the-spot check at\nthe consultant\u2019s premises to verify the reliability of the methodology and data\nsupplied. The on-the-spot check was carried out as a follow-up of the\ncross-checking of the data by the Commission and to obtain further assurance as\nregards the reliability and quality of the data and related methodology. The\non-the-spot verification was considered appropriate in application of the\nprinciple of good administration, even if those data were not provided by an\ninterested party but by a consultant. As a result, the Commission was further\nreassured of the reliability of the data provided by the consultant.\n(138)\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that the\nmethodology of cross checking used by the Commission was not explained in\nsufficient detail and requested that the other sources used for the cross\nchecking should be disclosed. This party argued further that the methodology\nused was in any event invalid insofar that only trends of various sources were\ncompared and not absolut values. \n(139)\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the other sources\nused to cross check the data provided by the consultant are concerned, they\nwere the reports published by the 'JRC and EPIA on the same topics. As for the\ncomparison of data with other sources it is noted that they showed not only\nsimilar trends but also similar magnitudes. Therefore, it was concluded that\nthe methodology used was appropriate and the claims in this regard were\nrejected.\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nto expertise of the consultant, it is noted that its main activity is\ncollecting data linked to the PV sector and developing an up-to-date database\nof companies active in the PV market. These data are published in specialised\nphotovoltaic magazines and also used by individual companies for which it carries\nout specialised research. The database developed by Europressedienst is\nregularly up-dated and re-published. In addition, the consultant has several\nyears of experience in this sector. More precisely, the methodology of the\nconsultant is to collect, cross-check and agglomerate information using various\nsources available in the market. To this end, it collects the data via standard\nquestionnaires sent to the companies listed in the database or via phone,\nespecially from the Union producers, or during the specialised fairs, notably\nfrom producers in third countries. When the information cannot be obtained\nthrough the channels just mentioned, Europressedienst checks the financial\nreports of companies in the photovoltaic sector or co-operates on a freely\nbasis with other research institutes with a view to obtaining or cross-checking\nthe data. It was verified and indeed confirmed that these sources were used by\nthe consultant in its daily activity. In the light of the above, it was\nconsidered appropriate to make use of Europressedienst\u2019s services in the\npresent investigation and the parties\u2019 claims in this respect were therefore\nrejected.\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the Best\nPractices for the submission of economic evidence issued by the competent\nservice of the Commission (\u2018the Best Practices\u2019), the following remarks should\nbe made. First of all, it is a document that cannot engage the Commission, as\nit has not been adopted by the College, but published by the competent service\nwith the purpose of providing recommendations to parties as to how to present\neconomic evidence. Secondly, the Best Practices concern the submission of\neconomic analysis and data used in some competition investigations, pursuant to\nArticle 101 and 102 TFEU and in merger cases. The applicable rules, standards\nof proof and investigating powers of the Commission in those competition cases\ncannot be compared to trade defence investigations, to which an entirely\ndifferent set of rules applies.\n(142)\u00a0\u00a0 After the provisional\ndisclosure, several parties contested the methodology used by the consultant claiming\nthat it would not reach recognised scientific standards. However, as mentioned\nabove in recital (137), the methodology was assessed and the resulting data\nwere cross-checked and verified and as a result were considered in line with\nother published data and therefore reasonably reliable. Specific\npoints raised by the interested parties, mainly AFASE were clarified and made\navailable in the open file of the investigation for inspection by interested parties.\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0 The CCCME argued that the\nmethodology of data aggregation was not clarified. This claim was rejected as\nthe relevant information was made available to all interested parties in the\ninvestigation file open for inspection by interested parties. \n(144)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties reiterated their concerns on the selection of the consultant by\nthe Commission and on the quality of the data supplied. In this respect it was\nclaimed that the consultant\u2019s data can be ordered and purchased on an ad hoc\nbasis to meet the specifically identified requests of potential clients and may therefore not be objective. In addition, CCCME\ncontested that the data collected by the consultant can be considered as\npositive evidence within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation\nsince the data was to a large extent based on assumptions and estimations.\nFurthermore, it was claimed that the data supplied were not sufficiently\nsupported by evidence in the file and that they were not of an affirmative,\nobjective and verifiable character.\n(145)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of these claims,\nreference is made to the recitals (136) to (137) above where additional\ninformation was provided regarding the selection of the consultant. In\naddition, it is noted that the Commission hired the consultant on the basis of\nthe best available information at that moment in time and in full compliance\nwith the Commission Financial Regulation applicable to the procedure.\nFurthermore, it is recalled that the consultant\u2019s capacity to provide all the\nneeded data in due time was of great importance since the Commission was bound\nto statutory deadlines for the publication of the provisional findings in the\non-going investigation. \n(146)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the quality of\nthe data supplied and whether it can be considered as positive evidence in\naccordance with Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation, as mentioned above in\nrecital (137), the consultant\u2019s methodology for collecting the data was\nexamined and it was assessed that it was of satisfactory quality. In addition,\nas also mentioned above in the same recital, the data supplied by the\nconsultant were cross-checked when possible with other sources and found to be\nreasonably accurate. Finally, it is noted that the consultant has one database\nwhich is up-dated on a regular basis, independently of the clients\u2019 needs and\nrequests. The same database is used to aggregate and deliver PV statistics to\nvarious clients, and therefore the allegation that data were not objective had\nto be rejected. \n(147)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\ninterested party claimed that the Commission had not disclosed the sources, the\nmethodology used and the companies with which the consultant co-operated to\ncompile the macroeconomic data supplied. Another interested party reiterated\nthat the methodology applied by the consultant suggests inaccurate results.\nSeveral interested parties requested further information concerning the\nmethodology used by the consultant such as the average response rates to the\nquestionnaires/interviews, the percentage of data collected through each\nchannel, how these were verified, the approximations/assumptions used to\ngenerate the data, the number of companies for which approximations were made,\nand at least a range of the number of employees of the consultant.\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of these claims,\nit is noted that subsequently to the imposition of the provisional findings,\nthe Commission provided interested parties with the methodology and with the\nsources used by the consultant in aggregating the data and addressed specific\nquestions of the interested parties in this regard following the provisional\ndisclosure. The additional requests for information of the interested parties\nconcerned following final disclosure are considered to be covered by the\ninformation made available after the imposition of provisional duties to the\nextent that the confidentiality limitations allowed it. In addition, it is\nunderlined that the Commission verified on-the-spot the way the data had been\ncollected and aggregated by the consultant and the relevant underlying\nassumptions for aggregating the data. The results of the verification were\nsatisfactory and the Commission was reassured of the reasonableness of the\nunderlying assumptions and of the quality of the data supplied by the\nconsultant. Furthermore, the parties did not contest the data as such. \n(149)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nfinal disclosure, another party requested clarifications with regard to the\nnumber of Union producers considered by the consultant in its data collection\nand the overlap between these and the around 215 Union producers known to the\nCommission. In this respect, it is clarified that the Union producers\nconsidered by the consultant are largely the same than the ones known to\nrepresent the Union industry in this investigation mentioned in recital (133)\nabove. \n(150)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that the Commission has conducted the injury analysis in an\ninconsistent manner since it was done separately for modules and cells while\nthe injury and dumping margin calculations had been established as a weighted\naverage for modules and cells together. In this respect, it is noted that while\nindicators were shown separately for each product type, the conclusions reached\nfor each indicator refer to the product under investigation as a whole. It is\nalso recalled that modules and cells are one single product and therefore the\ndumping margins and the injury elimination level were established on this\nbasis. Therefore, the claim was rejected.\n(151)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, another party\nclaimed that the calculation of the values of macroeconomic indicators during\nthe IP was wrongly based on a simple average of the years 2011 and 2012 as such\nmethodology would not be objective and would not lead to results reflecting the\nreality during the IP. It is clarified that a simple average of the data was\nonly used in case where there were similar trends in the periods concerned. In\ncase trends were different, the methodology was adapted accordingly by taking\ninto consideration market reality. The party concerned did not develop to what\nextend the results of the methodology used would not reflect market reality.\nThese claimes were therefore rejected.\n(152)\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above, and in absence of any other\ncomments in this respect, the findings in recitals (98) to (101) to the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determination of the\nrelevant Union market\n(153)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties argued that\nthe injury should have been assessed separately for the captive market and for\nthe free market. One party argued that data relating to cells destined for\ncaptive use should have been excluded from the injury assessment on the grounds\nthat they were not affected by the dumped imports. \n(154)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\n(105) to the provisional Regulation consumption, sales volume, production,\nproduction capacity, capacity utilisation, growth, investments, stocks,\nemployment, productivity, cash flow, return on investment, ability to raise\ncapital and magnitude of the dumping margin should be examined referring to the\ntotal activity of the Union industry, i.e. including captive use, as the\nproduction destined for the captive market was equally affected by the\ncompetition of imports from the country concerned. \n(155)\u00a0\u00a0 Thus,\nthe investigation has shown that vertically integrated Union producers were\nforced to import dumped products (cells) and to cease production of these\nproducts at cost above the import price, as a consequence of the price pressure\nexerted by the dumped imports. Furthermore, the investigation also revealed\nthat the free market and the captive market displayed similar trends in prices,\nwhich also showed that they were equally affected by the imports concerned. \n(156)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties reiterated that the Commission failed to provide an adequate\nand reasoned analysis of the captive market or why a separate analysis had not\nbeen carried out. One party claimed that no information was provided about the\nsignificance of the Union production destined for captive use. In addition, it\nwas claimed that recital (106) to the provisional Regulation concluding that\nprices in the captive market did not always reflect market prices, contradicted\nthe conclusions set out in recital (155) above that the free market and captive\nmarket displayed similar trends in prices.\n(157)\u00a0\u00a0 It is firstly noted that\nrecital (105) to the provisional Regulation sets out the reasons as to why it\nwas considered appropriate to examine injury indicators (except for\nprofitability) referring to the total activity of the Union industry including\ncaptive use. In this regard it is recalled, as set out in the same recital,\nthat the investigation revealed that the production destined for captive use\nwas equally affected by the competition of the imports from the PRC, which as\nsuch was not contested by the interested parties concerned. Therefore, the\nclaim that no explanations were given as to why no separate analysis took place\nhad to be rejected. Likewise, as it follows from this conclusion, it had also\nto be rejected that such separate analysis of the captive market should have\ntaken place. \n(158)\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, while on the basis\nof the above the significance of the Union production destined for captive use\nwas not considered an essential element, it is noted that the Union production\nof cells destined for captive use represented about half of the total\nproduction in the IP. Finally, it is clarified that the fact that prices in the\ncaptive market do not reflect the prices in the free market is not necessarily\ncontradicting the fact that both prices followed the same trends, as they may\nstill be at different levels or price movements may be at a higher or lower\ndegree and thus depicting a different picture. On the basis of the above, the\nclaims concerning the captive market were rejected.\n(159)\u00a0\u00a0 The parties concerned did\nnot provide any information which could have devaluated the findings concerning\nthe determination of the Union market. On these grounds, the claims in this\nrespect were rejected and the findings as set out in recitals (102) to (106) to\nthe provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Union consumption\n(160)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat data concerning the Union consumption of the product under investigation\nvary significantly, depending on the source used. This party argued that\nreliable data can only be established on the basis of the information gathered\nfrom specialised institutions or research centres. In view of the explanations\nand conclusions reached in the recitals (134) to (152) above, concerning the\nreliability of the data provided by the consultant used in the investigation,\nthis argument was rejected. \n(161)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party argued that\nUnion consumption should not be established by merely adding up available\nmodule production capacities in the Union and that the module consumption of\nthe Union industry\u2019s own projects should be deducted therefrom. This argument\nwas rejected, as consumption of modules was established on the basis of newly\ninstalled capacities in the Union. This is a common practice for determining\nthe module consumption. For cells the consumption was determined on the basis\nof the Union production of modules. \n(162)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party argued that\nthat the methodology described by the consultant admits the difficulty to\nestablish reliable consumption figures. It was further argued that import data\nas well as export sales from the Union industry were either based on\nunverifiable estimations or incomplete data and that the cross checking of the\nCommission was not sufficient to allow the conclusion that those data were\nindeed reliable and accurate. \n(163)\u00a0\u00a0 As already mentioned above\nin rectials (136) and (137) above the quality of the data and the methodologies\nused to collect them were verified by the Commission during an on-spot visit on\nthe basis of which it was considered that the methodologies used were\nappropriate and the results accurate and reasonably reliable. This claim was\ntherefore rejected. \n(164)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, and in the\nabsence of any other comments with respect to the Union consumption, recitals\n(107) to (109) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from the country\nconcerned\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volume and market share of\nthe imports from the country concerned\n(165)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat data concerning import volumes of the product under investigation vary\nsignificantly, depending the source used. This party argued that reliable data\ncan only be established on the basis of the information gathered from\nspecialised institutions or research centres. In view of the explanations and\nconclusions reached in the recitals (134) to (152) above, concerning the\nreliability of the data provided by the consultant used in the investigation,\nthis argument was rejected.\n(166)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\ninterested party contested the methodology to determine the total import value from\nthe PRC claiming that it had been based on transactions made at CIF level duty\nunpaid and it is therefore doubtful whether these transactions had been\ndestined for Union consumption. In respect of this claim, it is clarified that\nthe total import value from PRC as provided by the consultant had not been used\nin the provisional and definitive findings and that only import volumes and\nimport prices were determined during the investigation as shown in recitals\n(110) to (113) to the provisional Regulation. As the methodology to determine\nimport prices was not contested as such by the interested party concerned\nreference is made to the relevant findings in recital (113) to (117) to the\nprovisional Regulation and recitals (168) to (176) below. Therefore, the above\nclaim was rejected. \n(167)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis, and in the absence of any other comments with respect to imports of\nthe product concerned from the PRC, recitals (110) to (112) to the provisional\nRegulation are confirmed.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices of imports and price\nundercutting\n(168)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ncooperating unrelated importer claimed that import prices should have been\nestablished on the basis of its imports of the product concerned in the Union.\nHowever, the data provided by this importer during the investigation only\nrepresented a fraction of the total imports in the Union and no meaningful\nconclusions could be drawn as to the average import price of all imports from\nthe PRC during the whole period under consideration covering several years.\nTherefore, this claim was rejected. \n(169)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe methodology to determine the prices was not explained, in particular as to\nhow the data of various sources had been merged and reconciled. In addition it\nwas argued that importation costs should have been based on the verified\ninformation collected during the investigation rather than on estimates. \n(170)\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that the\nmethodology made available to interested parties is sufficiently complete to\nunderstand as to how figures were established. As far as \u2018importation\u2019 cost is\nconcerned, it is clarified that an adjustment was made to on-the-spot-prices to\narrive to CIF prices. The estimation made was confirmed with the data collected\nduring the investigation.\n(171)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, several interested parties requested more details on the price\nundercutting calculations than those already provided in recital (116) to the\nprovisional Regulation. Insofar as the sensitive nature of this information and\nthe fact that the Union producers had been granted anonymity would allow it,\nadditional information was provided in bilateral disclosures. \n(172)\u00a0\u00a0 In line with the decision to\nexclude wafers from the product scope (see recitals (28) to (32) above), these\nproducts were also excluded from the calculation of the price undercutting.\nMoreover, there were some corrections on the CIF prices provided by the\ninterested parties. As the sample of unrelated importers was revised for the\nreasons explained in recital (21) the average post-importation costs of the new\nsample of importers was used, when data was available and complete.\n(173)\u00a0\u00a0 The revised price comparison\nwas made on a type-per-type basis for transactions at the same level of trade,\nduly adjusted where necessary, and after deduction of rebates and discounts.\nThe result of the comparison, when expressed as a percentage of the sampled\nUnion producers\u2019 turnover during the IP showed weighted average undercutting\nmargins within the ranges of 19,8% - 32,1% for modules, 4% - 28,5% for cells\nand 8% - 29% in overall terms for the product concerned.\n(174)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that for\none sampled exporting producer, a negative price undercutting for cells was\nestablished. However, the exported quantities were not significant and can thus\nnot be considered representative. \n(175)\u00a0\u00a0 One sampled exporting\nproducer contested the source for the adjustment for mono cells to multi cells,\nwithout however substantiating the argument. Indeed no new information or\nevidence was provided and this claim was therefore rejected. \n(176)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthe absence of any other comments with respect to the prices of imports from\nPRC and on the price undercutting calculations, recitals (113) to (117) to the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed as amended above.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic situation of the\nUnion industry\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\n(177)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties questioned the\noverall reliability of the macroeconomic injury indicators used by the\nCommission for the purpose of this investigation. They argued that the trends\nestablished for a number of these indicators diverged from the trends for the\nsame indicators established for the sampled Union producers. Particular\nreference was made to Union production, productivity, sales, average labour\ncosts and employment. \n(178)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\n(121) to the provisional Regulation the macroeconomic indicators were\nestablished in relation to all producers in the Union. In case the same data\nare compiled in relation to individual Union producers or a group of Union producers\n(i.e. the sampled Union producers), the trends are not necessarily identical,\nas e.g. the weight of each company considered is not taken into consideration\nin such comparison. Therefore, the results of the exercise of comparing the\nmacroeconomic indicators for all Union producers and those for sampled Union\nproducers are not necessarily meaningful and do not allow for the conclusion\nthat the one or the other set of data is unreliable. In any event, when\ncomparing the trends of the macroeconomic indicators of the Union industry with\nthe consolidated same indicators of the sampled Union producers, differences in\ntrends can be noted for several indicators, such as the production, production\ncapacity, sales volumes, employment and productivity of the Union industry\nbetween 2011 and the IP. For all these indicators, the sampled Union producers\nperformed better than the overall Union industry. The reason behind is that in\nthe IP many Union producers, not included in the sample, stopped their\nproduction or became insolvent, thus having a negative impact on the\nmacroeconomic indicator calculated at the Union level. These claims were\ntherefore rejected. \n(179)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the conclusion as set out in recital (153) to the provisional Regulation\nthat the analysis of the situation of the Union industry showed a clear\ndownward trend of all main injury indicators was based on data provided by the\nconsultant. In this respect, it is clarified that, on the one hand, the macroeconomic\nindicators, as listed in Tables 4-a to 6-c to the provisional Regulation, were\nbased on data obtained from the consultant and cross-checked when possible with\nother available sources. On the other hand, the microeconomic indicators, as\nlisted in the Tables 7-a to 11-c to the provisional Regulation, were based on\ndata collected from the sampled Union producers and verified on-the-spot by the\nCommission. It should also be noted that determinant factors for the injurious\nsituation of the Union industry such as the profitability levels of the Union\nindustry, the average sales price in the Union as well as price undercutting\ncalculations were based on data collected from the sampled Union producers and exporting\nproducers as verified on-the-spot. The above claim was therefore rejected.\n(180)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments regarding the general methodology of the assessment of the economic\nsituation of the Union industry, recitals (118) to (123) to the provisional\nRegulation are confirmed.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macroeconomic indicators\n5.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production, production\ncapacity and capacity utilisation\n(181)\u00a0\u00a0 AFASE\nclaimed that the production volume established for modules in recital (124) to\nthe provisional Regulation and the production capacity of the Union industry established\nfor modules and cells in the same recital were overestimated and provided data\nfrom other sources (i.e. EPIA, IMS and BNEF) showing lower volumes.\n(182)\u00a0\u00a0 The production volume established in recital (124) to the\nprovisional Regulation is based on information covering both publicly listed\ncompanies and non-listed companies. The development of the Union production as\nestablished in recital (124) to the provisional Regulation is in line with the\ndevelopment of Union consumption established in recital (108) to the\nprovisional Regulation. To the contrary the data provided by AFASE on production\nvolumes showed different trends with the Union consumption as established in\nrecital (108) to the provisional Regulation and with the statistics of Union\nconsumption published by the EPIA. \n(183)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nfar as production capacity is concerned, the investigation revealed that the\nfindings as set out in recital (124) to the provisional Regulation included the\nproduction capacities of companies that filed for insolvency or stopped\nproduction during the IP, while they had not sold their production plants and\nmachinery and thus were able to resume production very quickly. Likewise, as\nmentioned above in recital (182), the figures in recital (124) to the\nprovisional Regulation included data from non-listed companies. \n(184)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, as mentioned above\nin recital (137) above, the data provided by the independent consultant were\nverified and found to be reasonably accurate. On the basis of the above, the\ndata provided by AFASE based on other available sources were not found to be\nnecessarily in contradiction with the provisional findings. \n(185)\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, accepting the\nfigures provided by AFASE would not have an impact on the overall finding that\nthe Union industry suffered material injury as the negative trend of these indicators,\ni.e. Union production and Union production capacity would be even more\npronounced.\n(186)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating unrelated\nimporter argued that production volume, production capacity and capacity\nutilisation should have been established on the basis of the data of the\nsampled Union producers only. However as these are macroeconomic indicators\nthey should be established at the level of all Union producers in order to\nestablish a meaningful and complete picture of the situation of the Union\nindustry. This claim was therefore rejected.\n(187)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty requested the Commission to clarify how the annual Union production had\nbeen calculated by the consultant. Another party requested the Commission to\ngive further explanations concerning the reconciliation of the different data\navailable related to the total Union production capacity. Another party\nsuggested that the total Union production and production capacity should have\nbeen obtained from the Union producers selected in the sample as this would\nhave given a more reliable result. In this regard, it was alleged that publicly\navailable data were imprecise due to the confidential character of these data\nand that any research centre or consultant had to base its analysis on a number\nof estimations and assumptions.\n(188)\u00a0\u00a0 It is clarified that the\nannual Union production was calculated on the basis of the figures reported by\nthe Union producers to the consultant. When the annual production of a certain\nUnion producer could not be obtained for a specific year, this was estimated by\napplying the capacity utilisation rate from the previous year to the new\nproduction capacity of that year. The Institutions have also compared the\nfigure obtained by the consultant with the figures reported in the replies of\nthe Union industry to the standing questionnaires prior to initiation. Both\nfigures are similar.\n(189)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the request to\nprovide further explanations concerning the reconciliation of the different\ndata available for Union production capacity, it is noted that this information\nhad already been provided in the open file open for inspection to the\ninterested parties. Therefore, this request was rejected.\n(190)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the Union\nproduction and production capacity are macroeconomic indicators and therefore have\nto be established at the level of the entire Union industry rather than on the\nlevel of the sampled Union producers. \n(191)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty argued that the methodology used to collect production data (mainly\ninterviews and visits of production sites) did not allow for reliable results\ndue to the confidential character of these data and as a consequence the\nreluctance of companies to disclose them. Such methodology cannot therefore be\nconsidered as adequate. This was allegedly confirmed by the fact that although\na much higher number of Union producers was used by the consultant than the one\ntaken into account by the Commission during the examination of standing at\nintiation stage, the total production volume established by the consultant is\nlower than the total production volume established by the Commission for the\npurpose of the examination of the standing. This party further claimed that\nconsequently the information related to this injury idicator cannot be\nconsidered as positive evidence within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic\nRegulation. \n(192)\u00a0\u00a0 It\nis first clarified that the number of producers taken into consideration by the\nconsultant on the one hand and the Commission on the other hand was largely the\nsame and that the argument that results were inconsisntent had therefore to be\nrejected. It is further recalled that the data collected by the consultant were\ncross checked with other sources wherever possible and it was found that the\nestimations were sufficiently reliable. It is therefore confirmed that the information\non production data provided by the consultant was considered as positive\nevidence within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. \n(193)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments regarding production, production capacity and capacity utilisation,\nrecitals (124) to (128) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n5.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sales volumes and market\nshare \n(194)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the market share of the Union industry for modules was already only 19% in\n2009 and that a decrease by 6 percentage points during the period considered\ncannot be considered as injury. \n(195)\u00a0\u00a0 The decrease in market share\nby 6 percentage points over the period considered has to be seen against the\nbackground of an increase of the Union consumption for modules by over 200%\nover the same period. The Union industry could not benefit from the increased\nconsumption; to the contrary, even under the scenario of an increased\nconsumption it could not increase its sales volume accordingly and suffered\nlosses in market share. This argument had therefore to be rejected.\n(196)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\nmethodology used to collect sales data (mainly interviews and visits of\nproduction sites) did not allow for reliable results due to the confidential\ncharacter of these data and as a consequence the reluctance of companies to\ndisclose them. Such methodology cannot therefore be considered as adequate.\nLikewise, they cannot be considered as positive evidence within the meaning of\nArticle 3(2) of the basic Regulation. As mentioned above in recital (137) above\nthe data collected by the consultant were cross checked with other sources wherever\npossible and it was found that the estimations were sufficiently reliable. It\nis therefore confirmed that the information on sales data provided by the\nconsultant was considered as positive evidence within the meaning of Article\n3(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(197)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other comments\non the Union industry\u2019s sales volume and its market shares, recitals (129) to\n(131) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n5.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employment and productivity \n(198)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure,\none party claimed that the methodology to establish total employment in the\nUnion during the period considered was incorrect. This party alleged that wherever\nthe employment rate of a specific Union producer was not available, the average\nemployment of those Union producers for which this information was available\nwas taken into consideration instead. This had to be rejected as the\nmethodology to establish total employment was different, i.e. in case\nemployment data for a certain Union producer was not available, this figure was\nestimated on the basis of data of that same company from the previous year(s).\nAs mentioned above in recital (137) this methodology was verified and found\nreasonable. Therefore, the claim was rejected.\n(199)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning the level of Union industry\u2019s employment and productivity,\nrecitals (132) to (134) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n5.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magnitude of the dumping\nmargin and recovery from past dumping\n(200)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments in this respect, recitals (135) to (136) to the provisional Regulation\nare confirmed. \n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microeconomic indicators\n5.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices and factors affecting\nprices\n(201)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\ncontested the findings that the decrease of the average sales prices had a\ndevastating effect on the profitability of the Union industry. It claimed that\nthe average cost of the Union industry decreased equally and that therefore a\ndecrease in price is natural. However, as described in recital (138) to the\nprovisional Regulation, the investigation established that the Union industry\nsales price decreased even more than its average cost of production and\ntherefore such decrease in costs was not reflected in the Union industry\u2019\nprofitability. It is therefore confirmed that the decrease in sales price of\nthe Union industry had a devastating effect on the profitability of the Union\nindustry and the claims in this regard were rejected. \n(202)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party contested the\nconclusion in recital (138) to the provisional Regulation that prices were at\nunsustainable levels in the IP, claiming that this would be for market forces\nto decide. The same party also objected to the conclusion in the same recital\nthat the Union industry was not able to benefit from cost decreases due to the\nprice pressure of the dumped imports. In this regard, the Institutions observe\nthe following: \"unsustainable level\" refers to the fact that the\nUnion industry was selling at loss, and therefore could not survive in the long\nterm. The question whether the price level is sustainable is therefore only a\nquestion of the relationship between production costs and prices. By \"not\nbeing able to benefit from cost decreases\", it is referred to the fact\nthat costs fell less quickly than prices. Both those statements are backed up\nwith evidence in recital (138) to the provisional Regulation. Therefore, this\nargument had to be rejected.\n(203)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any further\ncomments concerning the Union industry\u2019s average sales prices recitals (137)\nand (138) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n5.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Labour costs\n(204)\u00a0\u00a0 The same interested party\nclaimed that in contrast to what is stated in recital (140) to the provisional Regulation,\nthere has not been any inflation during the period considered and that\ntherefore the overall increase of labour costs could not have been caused by\nthis factor. \n(205)\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast to what was\nclaimed by the party concerned, the investigation revealed that there has been\ninflation during the period considered and that the increase in labour cost, limited\nto modules, can be explained by inflation and increase in productivity. \n(206)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the injurious situation of the Union industry was caused by the increase\nin labour costs and the parallel decrease in productivity. However, first it\nshould be noted that labour cost remained stable in case of cells, while\nproductivity increased both for cells and modules. Therefore, the increase of\nthe latter can be explained by increased productivity. Moreover the\ninvestigation has shown that labour costs do not represent a significant part\nof the cost of production, as already cited in recital (203) to the provisional\nRegulation. Therefore, this argument had to be rejected. \n(207)\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis, the findings\nin recitals (139) and (140) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n5.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inventories\n(208)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat, the increase in stock levels over the period considered, when expressed\nas a percentage of the total production, would be insignificant and cannot\ntherefore be seen as evidence for injury. This party argued further that the\npresentation of the stock values in recital (141) to the provisional Regulation\nis misleading as stocks were expressed in kW rather than MW unlike the Union\nindustry\u2019s production volume. \n(209)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is noted\nthat recital (143) to the provisional Regulation shall be amended and should\nread \u2018\u2026 the increase in stocks for the like product over the period considered\nis not a relevant factor in establishing if the Union industry suffered\nmaterial injury\u2019. The existence of a clerical error becomes clear from the\npreceding sentence which concludes that the Union producers tend to hold\nlimited stocks as their production is based on orders. \n(210)\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, whether stocks are\nexpressed in kW or in MW as such was considered irrelevant in the determination\nwhether or not the Union industry suffered material injury. \n(211)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure,\nseveral parties claimed that stocks should have been determined for the whole\nUnion industry and that the figures of only ten Union producers were not\nrepresentative. It is clarified that the stocks were considered as a\nmicroeconomic indicator and should therefore be established on the basis of the\ninformation collected on a per company basis, in this case from the sample of\nUnion producers considered as representative for the whole Union industry. The\nabove claim was therefore rejected.\n(212)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments concerning inventories, recitals (141) to (143) to the provisional\nRegulation are confirmed.\n5.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Profitability, cash flow,\ninvestments and return on investments, ability to raise capital\n(213)\u00a0\u00a0 Following a comment by an interested\nparty it is clarified that the statement that cash flows followed a\n\u201cprogressively negative trend\u201d between 2009 and the IP in recital (148) to the\nprovisional Regulation was wrong as cash flows for modules, while decreasing\nbetween 2009 and 2010, were in fact increasing in 2011 and decreasing again in\nthe IP. \n(214)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party alleged that\ninvestment figures as shown in recital (149) to the provisional Regulation were\ntoo low when compared to the production capacity of the Union industry as shown\nin recital (124) to the provisional Regulation. In support of this claim the\nparty submitted to be aware of the investment made by one Union producer in\ncapacity increases which was at a much higher cost. The party concerned\nconcluded that therefore the established production capacity of the Union\nindustry must have been overestimated. It is noted that this claim was not\nsupported by any evidence, in particular as regards the investment made by the\nUnion producer in question. In contrast, the investment figures in the\nprovisional Regulation were based on actual and verified information from the\nsampled Union producers. It should be noted that this claim was also based on\nthe comparison between the total investments of the sampled Union producers and\nthe total production capacity of the whole Union industry, which cannot be\nconsidered an appropriate basis for comparison as not the total investments of\nthe whole Union industry were taken into consideration. Therefore, this\nargument had to be rejected. \n(215)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other comments\nconcerning profitability, cash flow, investments and return on investments,\nability to raise capital recitals (144) to (152) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed.\n5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusions\n(216)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the foregoing\nthe conclusions set out in recitals (153) to (158) to the provisional\nRegulation, i.e. that the Union industry suffered material injury within the\nmeaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, are confirmed. \nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CAUSATION\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction\n(217)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nthe provisional disclosure, several interested parties claimed that the\ncausation analysis conducted did not separate, distinguish and quantify the\ninjurious effects of the dumped imports from the effects of other known factors\nwhich at the same time are injuring the Union industry. Moreover, it was\nclaimed that the Commission failed to undertake a collective analysis of these\nother known factors. \n(218)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to this claim it\nshould be noted that the Commission, as per established practice, first examined\nwhether there is a causal link between the dumped imports and the injury\nsuffered by the Union industry and secondly examined whether any of the other\nknown factors had broken the causal link established between the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry and the dumped imports. In this analysis,\nthe effects of the other known factors on the situation of the Union industry were\nassessed, distinguished and separated from the injurious effects of the dumped\nimports to ensure that injuries caused by these factors were not attributed to\nthe dumped imports. It was found that none of them had a significant impact, if\nany, on the situation of the industry that could reverse the fact that the\nmaterial injury assessed must be attributed to the dumped imports. On these\ngrounds the argument was dismissed. \n(219)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, several interested parties reiterated the above arguments. In this\nregard it was claimed that the Commission should establish explicitly, through\na reasoned and adequate explanation, that the injury caused by factors other\nthan the dumped imports is not attributed to these imports. \n(220)\u00a0\u00a0 In this investigation, it\nwas concluded, after examining all the facts, that the dumped imports taken in\nisolation have caused material injury to the Union industry. In this respect, quantifying\nthe effects of other known factors was not possible and therefore a qualitative\nassessment was carried out as set out in recitals (164) to (222) to the\nprovisional Regulation. In conclusion, it was confirmed that the material\ninjury of the Union industry was caused by the dumped imports. Indeed the\neffects of other factors on the Union\u2019s industry\u2019s negative development were\nconsidered to be limited. It should be noted that, under Article 3(6) and (7)\nof the basic Regulation, no obligation is imposed as to the form of the\nattribution and non attribution\nanalyses which should be carried out. On the contrary, under Article 3(6) and\n(7) of the basic Regulation, those analyses must be carried out in such a way\nas to enable the injurious effects of the dumped imports to be separated and\ndistinguished from the injurious effects caused by other factors. The\ninvestigation did not reveal any evidence that all other known factors which\nmay have contributed to the injury suffered, together or in isolation, broke\nthe causal link between the dumped imports and the material injury suffered by\nthe Union industry. Given the above analysis, it was confirmed that other known\nfactors were not such as to reverse the finding that the material injury\nsuffered by the Union industry must be attributed to the dumped imports. On\nthese grounds these arguments were dismissed. \n(221)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nthe provisional disclosure some interested parties objected to the finding in\nrecital (160) to the provisional Regulation. They reiterated that market\nconditions of the product under investigation differ per Member State and that\ntherefore the causation analysis should be made at the level of each Member\nState separately. In addition, these parties argued that the national support\nschemes, the sun exposure and the electricity prices (including regulatory\ncharges) differ per Member State and that furthermore there are different\nmarket segments in each market (the residential- installations of less than 40 kW,\ncommercial and industrial- installations between 40 kW and 1MW and the utility\nmarket segment- installations between 1 MW and 10 MW). In view of this they\nclaimed that the causation analysis should be conducted separately for each\nMember State on the one hand and for the large-scale and the residential\nsegments on the other hand.\n(222)\u00a0\u00a0 After the final disclosure\nsome interested parties reiterated their claim that the causation analysis\nshould be conducted on a per Member State basis, without however providing\nfurther arguments or new evidence in this respect. \n(223)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation has shown that sales and import prices are similar across the\nUnion. It can therefore be considered that there is indeed one market for the\nproduct under investigation. The investigation did also not reveal that\nproducers in each Member State or region concentrated their activities in this\nspecific market or that the dumped imports concentrated in one Member State or\nregion. Moreover, none of the interested parties argued that dumping and injury\nshould be analysed on a per Member States basis which would however be a\npre-condition for conducting a separate causation analysis per Member State.\nThe investigation did not reveal any evidence that this would have been an appropriate\napproach, in particular given that there were similar prices across the Union\nof the product under consideration at Union level. Moreover, it is noted that\nthe sun exposure can be different in different regions of the same Member\nStates, e.g. Southern France has more sun exposure than Northern France, or\ndifferent regions within one Member State can have different support schemes\n(e.g. Belgium) and that therefore the impact of these factors on the demand may\nvary from one region to another within the same Member State. However, the\ndifferences in the regulatory framework of each Member State and/or region and\nthe differences in conditions such as sun exposure do not warrant a separate\ncausation analysis, and thus separate injury and dumping analysis. Therefore,\nthese arguments had to be rejected. \n(224)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nargued that while other factors are relevant, the national support schemes\nremain the main factor in determining the demand. The same party also contested\nthat grid parity was already reached in some locations arguing that prices of\nmodules increased since the IP while electricity prices decreased. It further\nargued that, in any event, at least in certain Member States, the regulatory,\neconomic and technical conditions do not allow for the connection to the grid\nand for those Member States it was therefore irrelevant whether or not grid\nparity was reached. This party however did not provide any supporting evidence\nfor the above allegations. In any event the above arguments confirm that the\nsituation with regard to national support schemes as well as grid parity may be\ndifferent to a certain extent between Member States. However, none of the\ninformation submitted was of such a nature as to show that an analysis\nseparately per Member State would be warranted.\n(225)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party reiterated the claim and provided some\ninformation allegedly showing the different market conditions per Member State\nand per segment. However, the information submitted could not be considered as\nconclusive as it consisted of a power point presentation without any supporting\nevidence, and therefore, did not show that an analysis separately per Member\nState would be warranted. The claim of this party was therefore rejected.\n(226)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthis basis, it was concluded that an analysis of the causation per Member State\nand/or region and per segment would not correspond to market reality. In\nabsence of any other comment in this regard the findings made in recitals (159)\nand (160) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n(227)\u00a0\u00a0 The GOC claimed that the\nCommission has conducted the causation analysis in an inconsistent manner as\nthe injury analysis was done separately for modules and cells, while the\ncausation analysis did not separate between product types. In this respect, it\nis noted that while the injury indicators were indeed shown separately for each\nproduct type, the conclusions reached for each indicator refer to the product\nunder investigation as a whole. It is also recalled that modules and cells are\none single product and therefore the causation analysis was conducted on this\nbasis. Therefore, the claim was rejected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of dumped imports \n(228)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\ncontested that there was a sufficient correlation between the dumped imports of\nthe product concerned from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the\nUnion industry. It was argued that this would be supported, on the one hand, by\nthe fact that from 2009 to 2010 the Union industry\u2019s profit margin for cells\nsignificantly increased (from loss making to 12% profit) while Chinese imports\nwere 36% lower priced than Union industry\u2019s prices and doubled their market\nshare during the same period. On the other hand, between 2010 and 2011 Chinese\nimports only gained 6 percentage points of market share, even though\nconsumption increased much more during the same period, while the Union\nindustry realised nonetheless a loss of 36%. This party argued further that as\nregards the IP, imports of cells from other third countries were at the same\nprice level as Chinese imports but gained more market share corresponding to\nthe loss of market share of the Union industry. \n(229)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nthat there was a constant increase of Chinese market share for all product\ntypes over the period considered (17 percentage points for modules, 17\npercentage points for cells). Dumped imports from the PRC increased by more\nthan 300 % for modules and by 482 % for cells. At the same time there was a\nconsiderable and constant decrease of the Chinese import prices (64 % for\nmodules and, 42 % for cells during the period considered) and in the IP they\nwere significantly undercutting the Union industry\u2019s prices. In parallel, the\nUnion industry lost market share over the period considered and as described in\nrecitals (153) and (154) to the provisional Regulation all main injury\nindicators showed a negative trend. Therefore it is confirmed that there is a\nclear coincidence in time between the increase in dumped imports and the loss\nof market share of the Union industry. \n(230)\u00a0\u00a0 As shown in recitals (161)\nand (162) to the provisional Regulation, this correlation in time was\nestablished for all product types separately. In addition, the analysis of the\nimpact of the imports on the Union industry\u2019s profit margin separately for each\nyear of the period considered does not lead to meaningful results as the\nexistence of dumping and material injury as well as a causal link between them\ndoes not need to be established for each year separately. The correlation\nbetween the dumped imports and the material injury is sufficiently demonstrated\nwhen analysing the developments over the whole period considered. \n(231)\u00a0\u00a0 It is also noted that the\nprofitability of the Union industry is one of the factors mentioned in Article\n3(5) of the basic Regulation which should be investigated when examining the\nimpact of the dumped imports on the Union industry\u2019s situation. The fact alone\nthat the Union industry was profitable during a specific year does not\nnecessarily mean that it did not suffer any material injury. Moreover, the loss\nof the market share of the Union industry does not need to correspond exactly to\nthe increase of the market share of the dumped imports in order to establish a\ncausal link between the injury and the dumped imports. Finally, other factors\n(e.g. imports of other third countries or development of the consumption) which\ncould have had an impact on the injurious situation of the Union industry were\nexamined and addressed separately in recitals (164) to (224) to the provisional\nRegulation. \n(232)\u00a0\u00a0 The coincidence in time of\nincreasing dumped imports in significant quantities, which undercut prices of\nthe Union industry and the increasingly precarious situation of the Union\nindustry is a clear indicator of causation in the present case, as established\nin recitals (161) to (163) to the provisional Regulation. The claims with\nregard to the lack of any correlation between the dumped imports and the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry were therefore rejected. \n(233)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party continued to contest the causation\nanalysis as the profitability of the Union industry was not analysed\nspecifically in relation to certain years (in particular 2010), but for the\nwhole period considered. \n(234)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it should be\nnoted that no valid conclusions can be drawn concerning causality by isolating\none specific year of the period considered while ignoring the development of\nthe Union industry during the entire period considered and its correlations\nwith the development of the dumped imports. Such analysis can only lead to a\npartial picture and no sound conclusions can be drawn therefrom. Thus, the\nprofitability rates that drove also other financial indicators that the Union\nindustry achieved during 2010, was high because of the particularly strong jump\nin Union consumption, driven by very generous support schemes, that allowed\nUnion industry to have their strongest sales improvement that same year, but\nonly of a temporary nature and in any event not sustainable for this type of\nindustry. Therefore, this argument had to be rejected.\n(235)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of further\ncomments concerning the effect of dumped imports, the findings in recitals\n(159) to (163) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effect of other factors \n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imports from other third\ncountries \n(236)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nmade comments following the provisional disclosure with regard to the findings\nconcerning imports from other third countries and reiterated them following the\nfinal disclosure. However, these parties did not bring into light new\ninformation and supporting evidence which could have altered the relevant\nprovisional findings. \n(237)\u00a0\u00a0 Those parties underlined in\nparticular the volume of imports of cells from Taiwan. However, the absolute\nvolume of imports of the product concerned from Taiwan (1132 MW) represents\nonly a very small share (less than 5%) of the overall Union consumption (21559\nMW) and compared to imports from the PRC (15005 MW). Therefore, imports from\nTaiwan have, if at all, only marginally contributed to injury of the Union\nindustry, and not broken the causal link.\n(238)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments with regard to imports from other third countries, the findings in\nrecital (164) to (167) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of the Union\nconsumption \n(239)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the Commission failed to analyse the impact of the development in\nconsumption. In this regard, it was argued that the imports from the PRC did\nnot capture the entire increase in consumption and that, while in the case of\nmodules the Union industry lost market share between 2009 and 2010, it still\nincreased its profitability during the same period. Furthermore, it was argued\nthat in 2009 when imports of cells from PRC had only 8% market share, the Union\nindustry still suffered 8% loss. \n(240)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\n(168) to the provisional Regulation, despite the decrease in Union consumption\nin the IP, the dumped imports from the PRC either maintained their market share\n(modules) or increased it (cells) to the detriment of the Union industry over\nthe period considered. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the decrease in\nconsumption was such as to break the causal link between the dumped imports and\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry. Moreover, the investigation showed\nthat as the capacity of the Union industry was in any event much lower than the\nlevels of consumption, the shrinking consumption in the IP could not have had\nan impact on the injurious situation of the Union industry. Therefore, this\nclaim was rejected. \n(241)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\ncontested that the demand in the Union will continue to exist even in the\nabsence of the national support schemes. This party argued that there is a\ncorrelation between demand and support schemes and that in the absence of such\nschemes projects in the PV sector would not be profitable anymore and therefore\nthe demand for solar panels will disappear as well.\n(242)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital\n(169) to the provisional Regulation, during the investigation some indications\nwere collected that even in the absence of support schemes demand still existed\nand will continue to exist in the Union. The party did not provide any evidence\nwhich could have devaluated these findings. In the absence of any new\ninformation in this regard, the findings set out in recital (169) to the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed and the claim made in this regard was\nrejected.\n(243)\u00a0\u00a0 Following final disclosure, the\nGOC argued that the fact that the Union industry\u2019s capacity did in any event\nnot meet the Union demand is irrelevant since the sales volume of modules of\nthe Union industry decreased in line with the decrease in consumption and\nreiterated that the decrease in consumption between 2011 and the IP caused the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry. While indeed between 2011 and\nthe IP the Union consumption decrease and the sales volume of modules decreased\nwith a similar trend, this has to be seen in relation to the development of the\nChinese dumped prices, significantly undercutting the Union industry prices,\nthus forcing the Union industry selling at losses. In this regard it is\nrecalled, as mentioned in recital (111) to the provisional Regulation, that the\ndumped imports from the PRC either maintained their market share (modules) or\nincreased it (cells) when the consumption was decreasing. At the same time\nChinese import prices decreased significantly and substantially undercut the\nUnion industry\u2019s sales prices. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n(244)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other\ncomments with regard to the development of Union consumption, the findings in\nrecitals (168) and (169) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feed-in-tariffs ('FITs') as\nthe main example of support schemes\n(245)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure several parties reiterated that the injury suffered\nby the Union industry was caused by the development of the feed-in-tariffs (\u2018FITs\u2019).\nThey claimed that the FIT developments exercised a strong downward pressure on\nprices and therefore on the profitability of the Union industry. One interested\nparty claimed that only the impact of the development of FITs on the demand was\nexamined, while the impact on prices should also have been analysed. In the\nsame context, several interested parties argued that most of the Member States\nimplemented major cutbacks already in 2010 thus putting a downward pressure on\nthe module prices.\n(246)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nrespect of this claim it should be noted that the Member States implemented FIT\ncutbacks at different moments in time and at different speeds and that drawing\na general picture for the entire Union is rather difficult. Irrespective of the\nmoment when the FIT rates reached very low levels, the significant decrease in\nthe Union prices and profitability during the period considered cannot be\nsolely or mainly explained by the reduction of FITs. First, on the basis of the\ninformation collected for Germany and Italy that represented together around\n75% of the Union market in 2011, the drop in the average sales price was more\npronounced than the decrease in the FIT rates during the IP. Second, the\nevidence collected shows that, for some countries such as Italy, even in the\ncontext of very generous FIT rates, the Union industry had to decrease\nsignificantly their prices. Finally, during the IP, the Union producers had to\nsell at prices below their cost of production, which was mainly a consequence\nof the fact that the Chinese exporting producers had 80% of the Union market\nand therefore the power to influence the price-setting mechanism. \n(247)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation further established that up to 2011 the higher FIT rates together\nwith the decrease in the prices of modules in the Union rendered the\ninvestments in solar energy extremely attractive as investors were earning very\nhigh rates on return. Therefore, this resulted in a high number of investments\nand consequently high demand of solar panels. As a consequence of the increased\ndemand, the total amount of FITs paid increased significantly and most Member\nStates revised the existing FIT schemes downwards to avoid inter alia an\nincrease of electricity costs. This shows that FIT cutbacks may also have been\nthe result of the decreasing prices and not vice versa.\n(248)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure one\nparty claimed that there was a contradiction between the recital (246) above, that an assessment of the demand for the\nUnion as a whole is difficult, and the recital (223) above stating that a causation\nanalysis per Member State would not lead to meaningful results. In this\nrespect, it is clarified that in the assessment made in recital (246) above,\nreference is made to the difficulty to draw a general picture of the FIT\ndevelopments for the entire Union and not to the Union demand as claimed by the\ninterested party. As a consequence, it follows that no contradiction exists\nbetween the two recitals and therefore the claim was rejected.\n(249)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that even in the context of high FIT rates, the module price may\ndecrease significantly due to technological development, economies of scale,\ncost reductions and growing global production capacity. In respect of this\nclaim, it is noted that the evidence collected shows that the Italian producers\nhad to reduce their prices below the cost of production even when FIT rates\nwere high. While the factors mentioned above may indeed have had an impact on\nthe average costs they cannot explain why Union producers had to reduce their\nprices below their cost of production. Therefore, it is concluded that it was\nmainly the dumped imports from the PRC that pushed the prices to unsustainable\nlevels and this claim was rejected.\n(250)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty claimed that the conclusion drawn in recital (247) above, that FIT\ncutbacks may have also been the result of the decreasing prices and not vice\nversa, is not supported by any evidence.\n(251)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that the\nconclusions drawn in recital (247) above were based on the information\navailable during the investigation and the scenario described was indeed\nconsidered as reasonable given the circumstances in this specific market.\nTherefore, this argument was rejected.\n(252)\u00a0\u00a0 After final disclosure, one\nparty reiterated that it disagreed with the conclusion that the downward price\npressure on Union producers was mainly exerted by the dumped imports and\nclaimed that, to the contrary, it was the FIT cutbacks that forced the Union\nproducers to reduce their prices. The same party reiterated that when FITs were\nreduced, the PV system prices decreased in line with the decrease in FITs so\nthat costs for project developers do not increase, which ultimately caused the\nprice pressure on the Union producers. \n(253)\u00a0\u00a0 Since no conclusive evidence\nwas brought in support of these claims, the Commission maintained its analysis\nand conclusions as stated in recitals (246) to (247) above. \n(254)\u00a0\u00a0 The same party claimed that\nmarkets are driven by the development of FITs and provided information showing\nthe number of PV installations for the years 2012 and 2013 in the UK. The\ninformation provided by this party was a publication of the UK government based\non the weekly registrations in the UK Central FiT Register (CFR). It is noted\nthat this information related mostly to a period outside the IP and referred\nonly to one Member State, while the current investigation focused on the\nsituation of the Union market as a whole. In any event, it is not contested\nthat FIT levels influence demand, as the profitability of investments in\nlocations with less solar radiation depends on the FIT level. However, in order\nto show that the level at which FIT were set during the IP has caused the\ninjury, interested parties would have had to show that a price increase of the\nUnion producers to the non-injurious level would have meant that the Union\nproducers would not have been able to sell the product concerned because\ninvestments into PV systems would not have been viable at those price levels.\nNo such evidence has been provided. This argument was therefore rejected.\n(255)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the argument that\nthe reductions in FITs broke the causal link between the dumped imports and the\nmaterial injury suffered by the Union industry was rejected. \n(256)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure one party reiterated that FIT developments rendered the solar\ninvestment opportunities unattractive for investors and thus lowered the demand\nfor the product. Another party claimed that the findings set out in recital (173)\nto the provisional Regulation that investments are still being made in Spain\ndespite the suspension of the FIT schemes was incorrect. \n(257)\u00a0\u00a0 The impact of FITs on demand\nwas addressed in recital (173) to the provisional Regulation. As no new\narguments were brought forward in this respect, the above claim that demand\ndecreased due to the FIT developments was rejected. Regarding the investments\nin Spain, it is clarified that the findings in recital (177) to the provisional\nRegulation are based on information obtained during the investigation and\nverified during an on-spot investigation. As the party concerned did not\nprovide any new information or evidence in this respect, this claim had to be\nrejected.\n(258)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure several parties claimed that in the context of the\nlow FIT rates, investments in PV projects were economically viable only when\nsupplied with the lower priced solar panels imported from the PRC. Therefore,\nit was argued that the FIT cutbacks caused the material injury to the Union\nindustry. Another party argued that the level of the FIT rate influences the\nprice setting mechanism for modules.\n(259)\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that the cost\nof a module at which a project would still be economically viable varies by\nMember State or by region in function of numerous factors such as FITs, other\nregulatory incentives, solar exposure, conventional electricity prices, etc. \n(260)\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition, the investigation showed that current installations depend less and\nless on the FITs as PV grid parity is likely to have been reached for certain\ntypes of installations in several regions in Europe, such as a large portion of\nItaly, Spain, Portugal, southern France and Greece.\n(261)\u00a0\u00a0 On the above grounds, the\nclaims made in this regard were rejected.\n(262)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the Commission did not investigate whether the Union industry failed to\nanticipate that government support schemes would be abruptly withdrawn or\ndecreased. No arguments were brought in support of this claim. However, it\nshould be noted that, based on the evidence collected, there is no information\nindicating that the Union industry responded to the market signals (i.e.\ndevelopment in consumption) and other available information (i.e. reduction in\nsupport schemes) in an unreasonable way. Therefore, this claim was rejected. \n(263)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party argued that the FIT cutbacks caused the Union industry\u2019s sales\ndecline because investments had been viable only at the affordable Chinese\nprices. The evidence collected in fact shows only a slight decrease in the\nsales of the Union industry during the IP, in contrast to what it would be\nexpected had the PV projects been feasible only with Chinese modules. On the\ncontrary, the sales of modules of the Union industry increased until 2011 and\nthen slightly decreased in the IP, following the same trend as of the\nconsumption. Therefore, this claim was rejected.\n(264)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nargued that the findings as set out in recitals (174) and (175) to the\nprovisional Regulation that the FIT changes did not break the causal link has\nno factual or legal basis and is inconsistent with Article 3(7) of the basic\nRegulation because the Commission failed to assess the level of injury caused\nby the FIT reductions and because it considered that the significant drop in\nthe Union industry\u2019s price had been a consequence only of the dumped Chinese\nimports. The same party argued that the decrease in the price of modules, cells\nand wafers was a global phenomenon and not due to the pressure of the Chinese\nimports.\n(265)\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of the claim that\nthe Commission failed to assess the level of injury caused by the FIT cutbacks,\nreference is made to recitals (174), (175) and (182) to the provisional\nRegulation and recitals (245) to (263) above, where the Commission concluded that\nneither the decrease in demand nor the impact of FITs on Union prices were as\nsuch as to break the causal link between the injury suffered by the Union\nindustry and the dumped imports from the PRC, irrespective of whether and to\nwhich extent they were possibly caused by the FIT cutbacks. Therefore, the\nclaim that the Commission\u2019s findings have no factual basis was rejected. As\nregards the claim that the decrease in the price of modules and cells was a\nglobal phenomenon, reference is made to the recitals (164) to (167) to the\nprovisional Regulation where import volumes and prices from other countries\nthan the PRC into the Union are assessed. While indeed there was a global\ndownward trend in the prices of modules and cells, the dumped import prices\nfrom the PRC have exacerbated the downward trend to loss making levels. On the\nbasis of the above, this claim was rejected.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other financial support\ngranted to the Union industry\n(266)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\ncomments concerning other financial support schemes granted to the Union\nindustry, the findings in recitals (184) and (185) to the provisional\nRegulation are confirmed.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overcapacity\n(267)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nreiterated the claim that the overcapacity in the global as well as in the\nUnion market caused the material injury rather than the imports from the PRC. In\nthis regard it was argued that the Union industry over-expanded its capacities\nas evidenced by the low capacity utilisation rate and that therefore any injury\nwas self-inflicted. The alleged impact of the overcapacity in the Union and\nworld-wide was already addressed in recitals (185) to (190) to the provisional\nRegulation and therefore in the absence of any new element the claim had to be\nrejected.\n(268)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the overcapacity led to price rationalization. In this regard, it\nshould be noted, on the one hand, that the overcapacity led in fact to a \u2018race\nto the bottom\u2019 and the suppression of the prices of Union industry, which on\naverage exceeded the reduction of the costs of production. On the other hand,\nas outlined in recital (186) to the provisional Regulation, the capacity\nincreases by the Union industry followed the market developments and were\nconsidered reasonable. Moreover, the increase in production capacity of cells\nwas at a lower level than modules. The party concerned did not submit any new\ninformation or evidence in this respect and the claims in this regard had\ntherefore to be rejected. \n(269)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the injury suffered by the Union industry is due to the Union\nindustry\u2019s focus only on specialized investments and its failure to make the\nnecessary investments in capacity additions and cost reductions. Likewise, this\nclaim could not be confirmed by the findings of the investigation which showed\nthat the Union industry increased its production capacity and efficiency during\nthe period considered (recitals (124) and (187) to the provisional Regulation. This\nclaim was therefore rejected.\n(270)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, an interested\nparty claimed that the Union industry increased its production capacity in\nspite of already low capacity utilisation rates, thus resulting in\nself-inflicted injury. This claim was based on the comparison between the trend\nof investments of the sampled Union producers and the trend of the capacity\nutilisation of the whole Union industry, which is not an appropriate basis for comparison.\nFurthermore, the investigation showed that the Union industry had not expanded\nits production capacities on a scale which exceeded the development of Union consumption,\ntherefore this argument was rejected. \n(271)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the evidence\ncollected indicates that through investments in new machinery, the Union\nindustry could reduce its cost of production and become more cost competitive. Therefore,\nthis argument had to be rejected. \n(272)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party alleged\nthat the conclusions in recital (189) to the provisional Regulation\ncontradicted the findings made in recitals (124) and (186) to the provisional\nRegulation without however giving any further explanations specifying the\nnature or extend of the alleged contradictions. This claim had therefore to be\nrejected.\n(273)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, some interested parties contested that the capacity additions of\nthe Union industry were reasonable and followed market developments and in\nparticular the development of the Union consumption. However, as far as modules\nare concerned the production capacity increased by 106%, while the Union\nconsumption increased by 221% over the period considered, i.e. more than\ndouble. Likewise, as far as cells are concerned, the production capacity\nincreased by 39%, while the Union consumption increased by 87% during the\nperiod considered. This shows that the increase in capacity was substantially\nbelow the increase in consumption and can therefore not be considered as\nunreasonable given that there never was overcapacity in the Union. Moreover,\nthe analysis whether the capacity additions were reasonable should not be based\non a year to year analysis, but should take into consideration the trend during\nthe whole period considered. Thus, capacity additions will typically only\nbecome fully operational after a certain period of time after the investment\nmade and the isolated analysis of one year may lead to a distorted picture.\nThis argument was therefore rejected.\n(274)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments regarding the Union\u2019s industry overcapacity, the findings in recitals (185)\nto (190) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Impact of raw material prices\n\n(275)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nreiterated that the Union industry or at least part of it could not benefit\nfrom the decrease in prices of polysilicon, during the IP, because of long term\ncontracts for raw material. With reference to the findings in recital (193) to\nthe provisional Regulation stating that the Union industry was able to\nrenegotiate its long term contracts with its suppliers (including wafers\nproducers) and therefore could benefit from lower prices, these parties claimed\nthat the renegotiations or termination of long term contracts of polysilicon\nand/or wafers resulted in penalties. To support this argument, these parties\nprovided press articles reporting that some Union producers were facing\nlitigation or that they terminated their contracts. Some parties provided\ninformation allegedly confirming that the long term contracts could not be\nre-negotiated. \n(276)\u00a0\u00a0 Polysilicon\nis the main raw material for the wafers producers. The investigation revealed\nthat polysilicon prices increased in 2008 when they reached their peak at\naround 500$/kg, but decreased again in 2009 reaching about 50-55 $/kg at the\nend of 2009 with only a slight upwards trend in 2010 and early 2011. Prices\ndropped significantly during the IP resulting in the 30$/kg (JRC Scientific and\nPolicy Reports, PV Status Report 2012). It should be noted that the impact of\npolysilicon prices on the Union industry could only be rather marginal as any\neffect on the cost of production of cells and modules was diluted through the\nvalue chain. Moreover, the above mentioned press articles referred to post-IP\ndevelopments, which did not affect the situation of the Union producers\nconcerned during the IP, and cannot therefore be taken into account. This\nmatter was further investigated after the imposition of provisional measures\nand, as a result, it can be confirmed that the Union industry was indeed able\nto renegotiate not only the prices of the long-term contracts but also any\ncontractual penalties relating to these long-term contracts. \n(277)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the above interested\nparties argued further that it is sufficient that only some Union producers\nhave been affected by the long term contracts and that the situation of the\noverall Union industry is irrelevant. It claimed that higher costs do not necessarily\nhave to affect all operators in the same way. This argument ignores the finding\nthat overall, for the Union industry, the average polysilicon prices were in\nmany cases not found to be higher than the market prices or than the spot\nprices and that therefore the issue whether higher costs affect all or only few\noperators was not considered pertinent. This argument was therefore rejected.\n(278)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nrequested that the Commission separate, distinguish and quantify the effects of\neach factor having an impact on the situation of the Union industry; in\nparticular the effect of the significant drop in polysilicon prices should be\nconsidered separately. In this regard, it was argued that it was the decrease\nin the polysilicon prices rather than the price pressure from the Chinese\nimports that caused the decrease in sales prices. As far as the Union industry\nis concerned it should be noted that the average selling prices decreased much\nfurther than the decrease of the average cost of production, on which the\ndecline of raw material prices could have an impact. This argument was\ntherefore rejected.\n(279)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, some interested parties reiterated that the impact of the decrease\nof polysilicon prices on the Union industry\u2019s cost was not limited or diluted\nthrough the value chain as concluded in the investigation. However, as already\nmentioned in recital (276) above, polysilicon is the main raw material for\nwafers producers, thus any impact on the production cost of cells or modules\nwas found to be diluted in the value chain. The interested parties did not\nprovide any evidence which could have devaluated this finding. Moreover, the\ninvestigation showed that the decrease of polysilicon prices over the period\nconsidered was reflected in the average cost of production of cells and modules\nof the sampled Union industry which decreased to a similar degree than the\npolysilicon prices. One interested party questioned the impact of alleged\npenalties that the Union industry had to pay due to the re-negotiation of the\nsupplier contracts. In this regard, it cannot be excluded that a limited number\nof producers may have had to pay penalties for the cancellation of wafers\nsupply contracts during the period considered. However, the Commission did not\nfind any evidence that these penalties could have had an effect on the\nsituation of the Union industry as a whole or would be representative. Such\nevidence was also not provided by the interested party in question. While it\ncan therefore not be completely excluded that penalties could have had a\ncertain negative impact on a limited number of Union producers, the overall\nimpact on the Union industry is at best marginal and hence could not break the\ncausal link between the dumped imports and the material injury suffered by the\nwhole Union industry. Therefore, these arguments had to be rejected.\n(280)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another\ninterested party claimed that the decrease of sales prices of the product under\ninvestigation in the Union is partly due to the reduction in the price of\npolysilicon. However, in this regard, it should be noted that the investigation\nshowed that the imports from the PRC were dumped and substantially undercutting\nthe prices of the Union industry. The price decrease therefore goes beyond the\nreduction in production costs that can be explained by the decrease in the raw\nmaterial prices. If the price decrease was merely the effect of the decrease of\nthe raw material prices, the Union industry would not have been forced to\ndecrease their sales prices below their cost of production. Therefore, this\nclaim has to be rejected. \n(281)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another\ninterested party reiterated that the litigation of one Union producer after the\nIP may has affected the situation of at least this Union producer already\nduring the IP. This party did not explain however how and to what extend such\nevent that occurred after the IP could indeed have had an effect on this\nproducer\u2019s situation during the IP. Likewise, the investigation did not reveal\nany evidence showing such effects. Therefore this claim had to be rejected.\n(282)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same\ninterested party questioned the above mentioned findings, as allegedly no\nevidence was shown. However, the findings of the investigation were based on\nfacts and positive evidence, non-confidential versions of which were available\nto all interested parties. \n(283)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments with regard to the impact of the raw material prices, the findings in\nrecitals (191) to (194) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Self-inflicted injury:\nimpact of automation, size, economies of scale, consolidation, innovation, cost\nefficiency, imports of the Union industry\n(284)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure, certain interested parties reiterated the claim\nthat the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the Union industry\u2019s\nlack of sufficient economies of scale. It was reiterated that small-scale\nproducers had a disadvantage compared to larger vertically integrated producers\nand therefore any injury suffered by small scale producers cannot be attributed\nto the dumped imports. Another interested party argued that the automation of\nthe production process is costly and that therefore economies of scale are even\nmore important to reduce the cost of production.\n(285)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that the Union industry, even the larger and vertically\nintegrated ones, due to the dumped imports, could not fully benefit from high\ncapacity utilization rates to achieve economies of scale. In any event, the\ninvestigation did not reveal any correlation between size, vertical integration\nand better profitability rates, as the high price pressure from dumped imports has\naltered this correlation. The investigation has showed that the benefit of\neconomies of scale no longer existed in a market where the utilization rates\nwere low, which was also true for the Chinese producers. Therefore, these\narguments were rejected. \n(286)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, one interested\nparty claimed that investors and banks would not finance projects if the module\nmanufacturer is too small, as larger producers provide better guarantees and\nare more \u2018bankable\u2019. In other terms, investors and banks are reluctant to\nfinance PV related projects using modules produced in the Union. However, the\ninvestigation showed that any possible preference of investors and banks to\nfinance Chinese producers which have larger production capacities is the result\nof the distortion that dumped imports have created on the Union market. As\nmentioned above in recital (285), the size of the production lines does not\nplay a role if utilisation rates remain low. Therefore, this argument was\ndismissed.\n(287)\u00a0\u00a0 One\ninterested party reiterated that the Union industry had an unfavourable cost\nstructure compared to its Chinese competitors, as the latter enjoyed lower labour,\nelectricity and depreciation cost, and in addition had the newest equipment. However,\nthe party concerned was unable to provide new information or supporting\nevidence that could reverse the findings of this investigation in this regard.\nIn particular, the claim that the Chinese producers were using the newest\nequipment was addressed in recital (203) to the provisional Regulation, stating\nthat the exporting producers in the PRC did not enjoy any comparative\nadvantage, in particular because machinery and equipment was imported from the\nEuropean Union. The above claims were therefore rejected.\n(288)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe Chinese enjoyed a comparative advantage with regard to polysilicon prices\nand to economies of scales which resulted in lower cost of the machinery. This\nparty did not provide any new information or supporting evidence in this regard\nthat could reverse the findings as set out in recitals (195) and (196) as well\nas (203) to the provisional Regulation. The claim of this party had therefore\nto be rejected. \n(289)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that as set\nout in recital (203) to the provisional Regulation and mentioned also in\nrecital (287) above the exporting producers in the PRC do not enjoy any\ncomparative advantage with regard to raw materials and the machinery used as\nboth were mostly imported from the Union. One interested party contested the\nabove, without however providing any evidence. As far as labour and overhead\ncosts, including depreciation costs are concerned, they represented on average less\nthan 10 % of the total cost of a module in the IP and are not considered to\nhave played any significant role. As far as electricity costs are concerned,\nthey represented on average less than 1 % of the total cost of a module in the\nIP and are not considered to have played any significant role. Moreover, the\nclaim that the Chinese were using the newest equipment was not substantiated.\n(290)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, one interested\nparty reiterated that some Union producers sourced cells and/or modules from\nthe country concerned, and re-sold those products on the Union market as their\nown. It requested that injury resulting from these transactions is not\nattributed to the dumped imports. However, the investigation revealed that\nimports from the Union industry of the product concerned were complementary in\nnature as well as limited in terms of volume when compared to the total Union\nproduction and therefore their effect, if any, would only be marginal and could\nnot be considered as breaking the causal link between the dumped imports and\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry. \n(291)\u00a0\u00a0 One unrelated importer\nargued that the fact that the number of employees increased over the period\nconsidered was not sufficiently addressed in the provisional Regulation. In\nrespect of this claim, it is noted that employment increased between 2009 and\n2011 for modules and then decreased during the IP. For cells, the employment\nincreased until 2010 and then decreased in 2011 and further decreased in the\nIP. It is noted that for modules, employment followed the trend of the Union\nproduction. For cells, as the Chinese imports increased their market share\nduring the entire period the Union industry could not benefit from the growing\nconsumption as expected. Therefore, the employment decrease in 2011 and in the\nIP corresponds to companies that either had become insolvent or stopped their\ncell production.\n(292)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure one interested party reiterated that the injury suffered by the\nUnion industry was due to the small scale and the lack of economies of scale.\nAs already explained in the recital (285) above and in recitals (195) and (196)\nto the provisional Regulation, even in the global market, the size and\ntherefore the benefit of economies of scale cannot longer exist where the\nutilization rates were generally low, and where enormous overcapacities existed\nworld-wide. Therefore this claim had to be rejected. \n(293)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the same party\nreiterated that the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the\ninability of the Union industry to realize any cost advantage. This party\nclaimed that this was in particular due the fact that most of the Union\nproducers were vertically integrated. However, this party did not provide any\nfurther information to what extend the fact that producers are vertically\nintegrated could have had a negative impact on their cost structure. Therefore\nthis claim had to be rejected.\n(294)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments in this regard recitals (195) to (206) to the provisional Regulation\nare confirmed. \n3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competition from thin film\nPV products and other PV technologies\n(295)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated the claim that the injury suffered\nby the Union industry was caused by the competition from thin film PV products\nand other PV technologies, as these technologies were competing with the\nproduct under investigation especially for ground-mounted and\ncommercial/industrial rooftop systems, which constitute a substantial part of\nthe total Union PV market. \n(296)\u00a0\u00a0 The\ninvestigation showed that although thin film PV products are less expensive\nthan the product under investigation, they only capture a limited market share\nof the total Union solar market as they have much lower conversion efficiencies\nand a lower wattage output than crystalline silicon modules. According to the\ninformation available, the market share of thin film products was not\nsignificant comparing to the total Union solar market during the IP. Therefore,\nthe findings in recital (208) to the provisional Regulation, that although\nthere may be some competition between the thin film products and the product under\nconsideration, this competition is considered to be marginal, are confirmed. On\nthese grounds, the arguments brought forward in this regard had to be rejected. \n(297)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated that the competition from thin film\nproducts likely caused the material injury suffered by the Union industry. In\nthis regard, the party submitted that in Germany the market share of thin film\nproducts in the total solar market was substantial during most of the IP and\nonly declined towards the beginning of 2012.\n(298)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation showed\nindeed that the average prices of thin film products were at lower levels than\nthe average price levels of the product under investigation. \n(299)\u00a0\u00a0 However, as set out in\nrecital (296) above thin film products have much lower conversion efficiencies\nand a lower wattage output than crystalline silicon modules and therefore\ncompetition between these product, if any, could not contribute to the injury\nof the Union industry, as crystalline silicon modules are the dominant\ntechnology in the Union solar market. The JRC PV Status Report 2012 states that\nas a consequence of the drop in polysilicon prices, thin film has in the last\nyears lost market share to crystalline silicon modules. \n(300)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments in this regard, the findings of recitals (207) to (210) to the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial crisis and its\neffects on access to finance\n(301)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure it was claimed that the injurious effects of the financial crisis\nand of its effects on access to finance should be separated and distinguished\nand not attributed to the dumped imports. \n(302)\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard reference is\nmade to recital (212) to the provisional Regulation where the effects of the financial\ncrisis and the economic recession on the situation of the Union industry were\nspecifically addressed. This recital sets out in detail the reasoning behind\nthe finding that the financial crisis, although having had an impact on the\nsituation of the Union industry, did not break the causal link between the\ndumped imports and the material injury suffered by the Union industry. This\nspecific reasoning has not been contested by the interested parties nor did\nthey provide any new information or evidence which could have devaluated the\nfindings set out in this recital. The claims made in this regard were therefore\nrejected. \n(303)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover it was claimed that\nthe injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the Union\u2019s industry\nfailure to seek appropriate financing and that the Commission should\ninvestigate whether the Union industry requested financing while they were\nprofitable. The investigation in fact showed that in 2010, when Union industry\nwas still profitable, the level of investment increased for modules and for\ncells respectively by 315% and 10% as compared to 2009. As the PV industry is\ncapital intensive, it is expected that the Union industry is continuously\nseeking appropriate financing in order to improve its cost efficiency and\ncompete with the unfair dumped imports. Therefore, it is concluded that the\nlack of access to finance was a result of the distorted situation caused by\ndumped imports and not its cause. The above claim was therefore rejected. \n(304)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, one interested party reiterated that the injurious effects of the\nfinancial crisis should be separated and distinguished and not be attributed to\nthe dumped imports. This party referred to publicly available information\nindicating that at least one Union producer perceived the financial crisis as\nthe main cause for its injurious situation. The current investigation based its\nfindings on specific company data which go significantly beyond publicly\navailable statements of specific companies. Therefore, the publicly available\nstatement to which reference was made cannot devaluate the findings made in recital\n(212) to the provisional Regulation, where it was concluded that while the\nfinancial crisis had a certain impact on the situation of the Union industry,\nit could not break the causal link between the dumped imports and the material\ninjury suffered by the Union industry. Therefore, this claim had to be rejected.\n(305)\u00a0\u00a0 Another interested party\nclaimed that the different access to financing between the Union industry as\ncompared to the Chinese exporting producers should be taken into consideration.\nThis party claimed that this was one of the main factors which caused the\nmaterial injury to the Union industry and not the dumped imports. However, the\npreferential access to financing of a number of Chinese exporting producers has\nbeen found to distort the market and may well be one of the main reasons\nallowing Chinese exporting producers to export the product concerned at dumped\nprices. This factor can therefore not break the causal link between the dumped\nimports and the material injury suffered by the Union industry. This claim was\ntherefore rejected.\n(306)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any other\ncomments regarding the effects of the financial crisis, the findings of recitals\n(211) and (212) to the provisional Regulation are confirmed. \n3.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Export performance of the\nUnion industry\n(307)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any comments brought\nforward to reconsider the findings set out in recitals (213) and (215) to the\nprovisional Regulation, they are confirmed. \n3.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The discovery of shale gas\ndeposits in the Union\n(308)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any comments brought\nforward to reconsider the findings set out in recitals (215) to (217) to the\nprovisional Regulation, they are confirmed.\n3.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union\u2019s\nEmissions Trading Scheme (ETS)\n(309)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any comments brought\nforward to reconsider the findings set out in recitals (218) and (219) to the\nprovisional Regulation, they are confirmed. \n3.13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management decisions\n(310)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\nreiterated the claim raised in the recital (220) to the provisional Regulation\nthat the material injury suffered by at least one of the Union producers was\ncaused by wrong management decisions. These parties provided further\ninformation in the form of a press article. However, the information provided\ncould not be verified and could not reverse the findings of this investigation that\nthe management decisions of the company concerned were normal and prudent or\nhad no impact on the entire Union industry. Therefore, the above claims were\nrejected. \n(311)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any other arguments\nin this respect, the findings as set out in recitals (220) and (221) to the\nprovisional Regulation are confirmed.\n3.14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other government policies\n(312)\u00a0\u00a0 In absence of any comments\nto reconsider the findings set out in recital (222) to the provisional\nRegulation, they are confirmed.\n3.15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(313)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party claimed\nthat the injury suffered by the Union industry was due to the forerunner\ndisadvantage and the lack of political support from the European Commission in\nprevious years. This party also claimed that apart from the national support\nschemes, also population, GDP, electricity consumption, financing opportunities\nand connectability to the grid are important factors in each market. However,\nthe above party was not able to substantiate its claims which were therefore\nrejected. \n(314)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the same interested party reiterated that the injury suffered by\nthe Union industry was due to the forerunner disadvantage. However, the claim\nwas neither analysed nor substantiated; therefore it had to be rejected.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cumulative assessment of\nthose other factors that have been found to contribute to injury\n(315)\u00a0\u00a0 The investigation has shown\nthat the following other factors may have contributed to injury: Imports of the\nproduct concerned from Taiwan; Reduction in the level of FIT; Long-term\npolysilicon contracts of limited number of Union producers; the financial and\neconomic crisis.\n(316)\u00a0\u00a0 As has been shown above in\nsections 3.1 respectively 3.6, the possible contribution of imports from Taiwan\nand of long-term polysilicon contracts of a limited number of Union producers\nare, at best, marginal, because any impact was further diluted through the\nvalue chain. \n(317)\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to the economic\nand financial crisis, the investigation has shown that the main reason for\ndifficulties of the Union industry in accessing the capital needed for\ninvestments were the dumped imports, which prevented the Union industry from\nselling its products at profitable prices when the Union market showed strong\ngrowth rates (2009-2011).\n(318)\u00a0\u00a0 With regards to FIT, third\nparties have not been able to demonstrate that FIT levels during the IP would\nhave been so low that they would have prevented Union producers from selling\nthe product concerned at non-injurious prices. The Institutions take the view\nthat reductions in FIT levels may explain reduced demand, as investments in\ncertain locations were no longer viable. They cannot, however, break the causal\nlink, even taken together with the other factors that have been found to\ncontribute to injury, because they were still at a level at which, absent the\ndumped imports, the Union producers could have sold their products at\nnon-injurious prices.\n(319)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, even if the\ncumulative effect of the four other factors possibly contributing to injury is\nassessed, the causal link between dumping and injury is not broken. \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on causation \n(320)\u00a0\u00a0 All the effects of the\ninjury factors other than the dumped imports have been individually and\ncollectively analysed. Therefore, it is concluded that the collective\nassessment of all the factors that may have had an impact on the injurious\nsituation of the Union industry (i.e. imports of third countries, FITs, impact\nof raw material prices, financial crisis) collectively fail to explain the\ninjury suffered by the Union industry in particular in terms of low prices and\nfinancial losses due to the penetration of low priced imports in significant\nquantities of the product concerned from the PRC. Based on the above, the\nprovisional findings as set out in recitals (223) to (224) to the provisional\nRegulation that the dumped imports from the PRC caused material injury to the\nUnion industry within the meaning of Article 3 (6) of the basic Regulation is\nconfirmed. \nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UNION INTEREST\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary remarks \n(321)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nthe provisional disclosure, one interested party claimed that the assessment of\nthe Union interest was not based on a representative number of operators. \n(322)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission has contacted the different operators in the following manner.\n(323)\u00a0\u00a0 Unrelated importers: as\nmentioned in recital (12) to the provisional Regulation, the Commission\ncontacted all the 250 unrelated importers made known by the complainant and\nselected a provisional sample in accordance with Article 17 of the basic\nRegulation to cover the largest representative volume of imports which can\nreasonably be investigated within the time available. However, as set out in\nrecital (12) and (232) to the provisional Regulation, only one of the companies\nprovisionally selected was indeed, after verification, confirmed to be an\nunrelated importer. After publication of the provisional Regulation, fifteen further\nunrelated importers, which had initially submitted a sampling form at the\ninitiation stage but were not sampled, were invited to cooperate further with\nthe investigation. Six of them agreed and received a questionnaire, and five\nsubmitted a reply out of which three were considered to be sufficiently\ncomplete. The definitive sample of unrelated importers therefore comprises four\nunrelated importers, representing a range of 2 % to 5 % of the imports of the\nproduct concerned. With regards to that low percentage, it has to be kept in\nmind that the majority of imports of the product concerned into the Union does\nnot take place via unrelated importers, as explained in recital (12) to the\nprovisional Regulation. \n(324)\u00a0\u00a0 Operators\nother than unrelated importers (upstream and downstream operators): as\nmentioned in recital (226) to the provisional Regulation, the Commission also sent\nspecific questionnaires to about 150 operators including those unrelated\nimporters that had come forward after the initiation of the investigation,\nwhich had therefore the opportunity to provide the relevant data to the\nCommission. Moreover, not only the replies to the questionnaires but also\nverifiable and duly substantiated comments and submissions provided by\ninterested parties within the deadlines were taken into consideration in the\ninvestigation, irrespective of whether or not these parties had replied to the\nquestionnaire. In particular, AFASE has transmitted to the Commission comments\non behalf of its members - PV operators that were also analysed.\n(325)\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the above, sufficient\nelements were gathered allowing a meaningful assessment of the Union interest.\nOn these grounds, the argument was rejected. \n(326)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nrequested the Commission to clarify how the Commission handled the importers\nquestionnaires which it considered to have been submitted by downstream\noperators. \n(327)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to this request, it\nis clarified that the 36 replies indicated in recital (241) to the provisional\nRegulation concerned replies to the Annex B of the Notice of initiation, the\npurpose of which was to sample unrelated importers if appropriate. \n(328)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the replies to\nthe questionnaires of the two operators indicated in recital (12) to the\nprovisional Regulation one was taken into account in the relevant analysis of\nthe downstream operators. The second operator submitted additional information\nwhich revealed that, contrary to what was stated in recital (12) to the\nprovisional Regulation, it was indeed an importer of modules but not an\nimporter of cells. Nevertheless, the information provided in its reply to the\nquestionnaire was not sufficient to include it in the analysis of unrelated\nimporters due to the fact that the replies provided were incomplete.\n(329)\u00a0\u00a0 After\nthe imposition of provisional measures, further verification visits were\ncarried out at the premises of to two project developers (see above recital (8).\nIn addition, the six replies to the specific questionnaires (see recital (324) by\nservice providers also active in the PV sector (logistics, transport, public\nrelations, etc.), which were deemed initially to be insufficiently complete\n(see recital (241) to the provisional Regulation) were analysed and taken into\naccount for the purpose of this investigation (see recitals (369) to (371)\nbelow). \n(330)\u00a0\u00a0 To\nsum up, for the analysis of Union interest, the following information has been\nrelied on: \n\u2013              \nthe questionnaire replies received from eight\nsampled Union producers and four sampled unrelated importers as well as the\nreplies to the specific questionnaire received from eight upstream and thirteen\ndownstream operators (seven project developers/installers; six service\nproviders also active in the PV sector) out of 150 operators that had come\nforward after the initiation and received the specific questionnaires; \n\u2013              \nthe data verified during the on-site\nverifications at the premises of eight Union producers, one unrelated importer,\ntwo upstream operators, four downstream operators (project\ndevelopers/installers) and one association (see recital (17) to the provisional\nRegulation and recital (8) above)\n\u2013              \nthe data on Union interest submitted by other\ninterested parties, including associations, as well as publicly available data\non the evolution of the PV market in Europe, in particular: EPIA\u2019s Global\nMarket Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the Union\nindustry\n(331)\u00a0\u00a0 Some interested parties\ncontested that the Union industry would be able to benefit from any measures\narguing that (i) the measures will lower the demand for PV products in the\nUnion and therefore the Union industry will not be able to increase their\nsales, (ii) the Union industry has small production facilities and is therefore\nnot able to meet the demand of certain types of installations such as\ncommercial rooftop and large ground-mounted installations, (iii) the Union\nproducers are not \u2018bankable\u2019\u2019 (iv) the imposition of duties on cells will de\nfacto increase the cost of production of the Union producers of modules and\nmake them less attractive for consumers, (v) in case of significant drop of\nChinese imports, the producers from other third countries will most likely take\nadvantage of the fewer imports from the PRC.\n(332)\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the claim that\nmeasures will lower the demand for PV products in the Union and therefore the\nUnion industry will not be able to increase their sales, it is noted that the\nparties were unable to provide any verifiable evidence of the existence of a\ndirect link between the imposition of measures and the decrease in demand for\nPV products which proved to be influenced over the years by several factors. \n(333)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the claim that\nthe Union industry has small production facilities and is therefore not able to\nmeet the demand of certain types of installations such as commercial rooftop\nand large ground-mounted installations, it should be noted that the\ninvestigation has showed that the Union industry has the capacity to supply\nboth the commercial and industrial installations (between 40 KW and 1MW) and\nthe utility market segment installations (1 MW and 10 MW). Moreover, the\ninvestigation did not reveal any evidence that products supplied by different\nmanufacturers could not be used in the same project. This claim was therefore\nrejected. \n(334)\u00a0\u00a0 The argument that the Union\nindustry would not benefit from the measures because Union producers are not \u2018bankable\u2019\nand that investments funds would not accept to finance projects using EU-made\nmodules was not substantiated. In any event, it is expected that the imposition\nof measures will restore fair market conditions which should reassure investors,\nincluding from the banking sector, as to the ability of Union producers to\ndevelop viable projects. On these grounds, this argument was rejected. \n(335)\u00a0\u00a0 With\nreference to the claim that the imposition of duties on cells will de facto\nincrease the cost of production of the Union producers of modules and make them\nless attractive for consumers, while it is not excluded that a certain increase\nin prices could occur further to the imposition of duties, it should also be\nconsidered that public available sources indicate that the price trend of\nmodules and cells is downward. Thus, even if the cost of cells might increase\nas a result of measures, the overall decreasing trend of prices should result in\ndecreasing costs of modules. The producers in question may also decide to\nsource their cells in the Union, and no longer from the PRC. Finally, it is expected\nthat the imposition of measures will increase the capacity utilization of cells\nproducers in the Union thus increasing their economy of scale and as a\nconsequence reduce costs. This claim was therefore rejected. \n(336)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nargument that in case of a significant drop of Chinese imports further to the\nimposition of measures, the other third countries will most likely take\nadvantage of this rather than the Union industry was not confirmed by the\ninvestigation. The investigation did not reveal any clear indications that the\nother third countries would direct their exports massively to the Union market,\nin particular taking into account the likely expansion of other third country markets,\nnotably in Asia, as forecasted by publicly available sources. Finally, there is\nno indication that even if imports from other third countries would increase as\na result of a drop of Chinese imports, the Union industry will not be able to\ncompete with imports from these countries.\n(337)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the final disclosure some parties argued that it is unrealistic to\nexpect the emergence of a sustainable Union industry manufacturing modules and cells\nbecause there is no rational investor that would invest in the Union producers\nthat allegedly suffer from an unfavourable cost structure and can therefore not\nproduce at competitive prices. The investigation did not confirm that the Union\nindustry is suffering from an unfavourable costs structure, as explained in\nrecitals (202) and (203) to the provisional Regulation. Therefore, absent\ndumped imports and utilising the production capacities to a larger extent\nshould bring economies of scale and allow for the emergence of a sustainable\nUnion industry. In view of the above the argument was rejected. \n(338)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that the\ndemand in the Union is driven by the development of FITs and the expected\nreturn on investment by the investors is linked to this development. In\nparticular, it claimed that, if prices increase in the Union, as a consequence\nof the duties, and FITs do not follow this increase accordingly, demand will\ndecrease and the Union industry will not benefit from the duties imposed. \n(339)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the above claim,\nit is noted that despite the correlation between the level of FITs and the\ndemand for PV installations, the evidence collected during the investigation\nindicates that future demand will be less and less dependent on FITs and other\nsupport schemes as PV grid parity is likely to have been reached by certain\ntypes of installations in several places in the Union (see recital (260)above).\nFurthermore, the expected return on investment should be based on fair market\nprices. Finally as mentioned in recital (335) above, while it is not excluded\nthat a certain increase in prices may occur further to the imposition of measures,\nit should be noted that public available sources indicate that the overall\nprice trend is downward. The argument was therefore rejected.\n(340)\u00a0\u00a0 Interested parties have\npointed out that because demand for solar panels is driven by support schemes,\nin particular FIT, and by the level of electricity prices for the final\nconsumer (which determine grid parity), price elasticity of demand can be very\nhigh. Whereas it is correct that an important increase in prices may lead to an\nimportant reduction of demand because of the particular nature of the market\npointed out by those interested parties, the argument has to be rejected\nbecause it is very unlikely that price increases caused by the measures will be\nimportant, for the following reasons. First of all, all available sources\nconfirm that the important decrease in prices for the product concerned\nthroughout the IP and since the IP until today will continue. Secondly, the\neconomic effect of the undertaking that has been accepted by the Commission is\nthat Chinese exporting producers will supply the product concerned at a minimum\nimport price of less than 60 c/W, which is far below the price that has been\nobserved during the IP, at a volume that corresponds roughly to their current\nmarket share. At this price level, demand is very unlikely to drop in a\nsignificant manner, as that price level ensures sufficient demand both under\nthe current level of support provided by support schemes and under the current\nlevels of grid parity. Furthermore, the price of electricity for final\nconsumers is expected to increase, whereas the price of the product concerned\nis expected to decrease. Through an indexation formula, the undertaking ensures\nthat further price decreases of the product concerned are taken into account\nfor the minimum import price. Therefore, those arguments have to be rejected.\n(341)\u00a0\u00a0 Several interested parties\nreiterated the allegation that the interest of the Union industry is not significant\nsince the value added created by the upstream and downstream industries is far\nmore significant than the value added created by the Union industry in the PV\nvalue chain. The argument that the various segments in the PV sector have a\ndifferent added value is not disputed. As mentioned in recital (228) to the\nprovisional Regulation, the investigation established that the Union industry\nhas suffered material injury caused by unfair trade practices. Indeed some\nUnion producers have already been forced to close down and in the absence of\nmeasures, a further deterioration appears certain. As all segments in the PV\nsector are closely interrelated, the disappearance of the Union production\nwould be detrimental to the whole PV sector making it fully dependent on\noutsourced supply. Therefore, also for reasons of security of supply, the argument\nwas therefore rejected.\n(342)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nreply to the final disclosure, one interested party reiterated the claim that the\nhigher value-added created by the upstream and downstream industry, as compared\nto the Union industry of the product concerned, is relevant to whether\nanti-dumping duties should be imposed. In this respect, it is confirmed that in\nassessing the Union interest the Institutions did balance the positive and\nnegative consequences the duties may have on the various economic operators. Whereas\nthe impact on the upstream and downstream industry is limited, the measures\nwill afford the Union industry the possibility to recover from injurious\ndumping.\n(343)\u00a0\u00a0 One party contested the\nnumber of jobs that would be secured by the imposition of measures. It claimed\nthat the Union industry employs about 6 000 people, and not 25 000 as reported in\nrecital (229) to the provisional Regulation. \n(344)\u00a0\u00a0 No\nevidence was however provided to support the above claim and therefore it was\ndismissed. It is clarified that in view of the exclusion of wafers from the\nproduct scope, the employment in the Union industry amounted to around 21 000\nemployees during the IP. Interested parties did not provide any proof that the\nnumber of employees in the Union industry has changed significantly post-IP.\n(345)\u00a0\u00a0 In conclusion, the\ninvestigation proved that the Union industry suffered material injury from the\ndumped imports from the PRC, being unable to recoup the investment through\nprofitable sales. It is expected that the imposition of measures will restore\nfair trade conditions on the Union market, allowing the Union industry to\ncompete on equal footing. The likely decrease in imports from the PRC should\nenable the Union industry to increase their sales in the Union and thus better\nutilise the available production capacities in the short term. This in turn may\nbring economies of scale. While it is possible that the prices of the like\nproduct will raise in a short period of time due to the measures, the overall descending\nprice trend is likely to be maintained also thanks, on the one hand, to the\nfurther decrease of cost of production of the product under investigation, and,\non the other hand, the competitive pressure from the third countries'\nproducers, which would also compete in the Union market.\n(346)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (227) and (231) to the provisional Regulation, with\nthe exception of the employment figure referred to in recital (344) above,are\nconfirmed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of unrelated\nimporters\n(347)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, the unrelated importer which provided a questionnaire reply prior\nto the imposition of provisional measures and had been considered to constitute\nthe provisional sample claimed that the conclusions with regard to the impact\nof the measures on unrelated importers was only based on its own questionnaire\nreply which could therefore not be considered as representative. \n(348)\u00a0\u00a0 The provisional Regulation\nbased its findings with regard to unrelated importers on one company given that\nas explained in recital (232) to the provisional Regulation the major activity\nof only one out of the three provisionally sampled importers consisted in\ntrading of the product concerned. As stated above in recital (21) subsequent to\nthe imposition of provisional measures, the sample was enlarged, more unrelated\nimporters were contacted and out of the five additional questionnaire replies\nreceived only three were sufficiently complete and allowed for meaningful\nassessment. At definitive stage, the sample for unrelated imports was therefore\nexpanded to include four importers. Overall, during the\nIP, the activity of the four sampled cooperating unrelated\nimporters related to the product concerned varied\nbetween 60% and 100% of their total business. In addition, the four cooperating\nunrelated importers sourced from the PRC between 16% to 100% of their total\nimports of modules, only one sourcing exclusively from the country concerned.\nThe profitability of the four sampled cooperating unrelated\nimporters related to the product concerned was on\naverage 2.3% in the IP. \n(349)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party argued\nthat the impact of the duties on the unrelated importers was underestimated as\nthere are no immediate alternative sources of supply that could replace the Chinese\nimports of the product concerned if the duties were imposed and that changing a\nsource of supply is difficult in view of the fact that the major production is\nbased in the PRC and this would entail additional significant costs. \n(350)\u00a0\u00a0 In this respect, it is\nrecalled that the imposition of measures should not result in the disappearance\nof the imports of the product concerned from the PRC. The investigation indicated\nthat the possible decrease of imports from the PRC will impact in particular\nthose importers that source the product concerned exclusively from the PRC,\nwhich is the case only for one out of the four cooperating unrelated importers.\nConcerning the impact of measures on the unrelated importers' financial\nsituation, it was not excluded that it can be negative, but it has been\nconcluded that this will largely depend on their capacity to switch sources of\nsupply or to pass at least part of the possible price increase on to their\ncustomers. For operators importing the product also from other sources than the\nPRC or importing also other products than the product concerned the negative\nimpact will be further limited. The Commission therefore considers that\nalthough there is likely to be a negative impact on the importers of the\nproduct concerned, this impact will, on average, remain limited.\n(351)\u00a0\u00a0 One unrelated importer\nargued that it needs significant working time and financial investment before\naccepting the products of a new supplier. In this respect a claim was made in\nreply to the final disclosure that relevant evidence was provided to the\nverification team at the time of the on-the-spot visit on the long testing\nrequirement that an importer must do before taking the decision to supply from\na particular exporter.\n(352)\u00a0\u00a0 It is acknowledged that the\nsetting of a new relationship between an importer and a supplier may entail\nadditional costs and time investment (e.g. in testing the product). At the same\ntime, changing suppliers seems to be a normal risk calculated in an importers'\nprofessional activity and is related to the fact that the PV market is maturing\nand thus undergoes constant changes (e.g. bankruptcies, consolidations)\nrequiring switching to new suppliers. Moreover, it can be assumed that new\ntypes of modules that reach the market on a constant basis (containing e.g. new\nefficiency characteristics) also require testing. In this respect, testing of a\nnew product (even from the same supplier) appears to be a standard rather than\nan unusual activity. The argument is therefore rejected. \n(353)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure two parties reiterated the claim that the interest of the unrelated\nimporters was not properly considered. One party claimed that the lack of the\nnon-confidential version of the replies to the questionnaires by the additional\ncooperating importers did not allow a proper assessment by the parties. It\nquestioned the Commission's assessment regarding the possibility that other third\ncountry imports in the Union would increase thus allowing the importers to\nswitch their supplies, on the basis of the allegation that other third markets\nare booming. To this end, the party claimed that such assumption is in\ncontradiction with the conclusions in recital (336), which argued that imports\nfrom other third countries would not be massive. Another party questioned\nwhether the Commission respected the principle of non-discrimination as the\nUnion producers were given more prominence in the Commission's assessment than\nthe other operators.\n(354)\u00a0\u00a0 First, it is confirmed that\nthe non-confidential version of the replies to the questionnaires received\nafter publication of the provisional Regulation by the additional cooperating\nimporters was included in the file for consultation by interested parties.\nSecondly, there is no contradiction between the assumption that the imports\nfrom other third countries can increase in response to lower imports from the\nPRC and that such increase should not be massive in view of the growing demand\nfor PV installations world-wide. At the same time, as the Union industry is\nexpected to retake a certain part of the market share that was previously held\nby products from the PRC, a certain loss in business for unrelated importers\ncannot be excluded. However, it is observed that the overall size of the PV\nmarket is expected to continue to grow in the long term, as grid parity is\nreached in more and more locations. Finally, it is clarified that, as in all\ntrade defence investigations, while the situation of the Union industry was\nassessed in order to establish if it suffered material injury due to the dumped\nimports, in the context of the Union interest analysis the interest of the\nUnion industry was assessed on an equal basis to the other economic operators,\nincluding the unrelated importers. It is also clarified that the investigation\nwhether or not the Union industry suffered material injury is governed in\nparticular by Article 3(5) to the basic Regulation which set the minimum\nstandards of such investigation. The Union interest is only analysed once a\npositive determination of injurious dumping was made in accordance with the\nstandards set out in Article 21 to the basic Regulation. As a result it was\nconsidered that the likely negative impact of the measures on certain\nimporters, in particular those sourcing exclusively from the PRC, did not\noutweigh the benefits of the measures for the Union industry and the mid- and\nlong term benefits to the Union PV market resulting from fair competition\n(355)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, on the basis of the information covering the four sampled\nimporters, recitals (233) and (234) to the provisional Regulation were confirmed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of upstream\noperators\n(356)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, several parties reiterated the claim that a majority of inputs in\nthe PV value chain comes from the Union and that such advantageous situation\nmay cease should the duties be imposed as production in the PRC of the product concerned\nwill decrease as a consequence of the duty. In reply to the final disclosure\none party pointed out that the measures in this case may trigger other\nmeasures, which the PRC may impose on the Union products. \n(357)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, as mentioned in recital (239) to the provisional Regulation,\nChinese imports are expected to continue to supply the Union market even with\nduties in place. In addition, various publicly available sources in the PV\nsector, such as EPIA\u2019s Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017, forecast\nthat the possible contraction in demand in the Union should be only in the\nshort-term (in 2013 and 2014) since consumption in the Union will increase further\nin the following years. Furthermore, as concluded in recital (239) to the\nprovisional Regulation, addressing unfair trade practises is likely to allow\nbuilding a sustainable growth in the PV market in the Union in the mid and\nlong-term, from which all operators in the Union should benefit. Finally, as\nregards the argument on the possible retaliation of the PRC in reply to the\nmeasures in this case, it is recalled that the PRC as any other WTO member, may\nhave a recourse to trade defence investigations only in justified circumstances\nand any such investigation has to comply with strict WTO rules. The Commission monitors\nany such investigation to ensure that the WTO rules are respected. The argument\nwas therefore rejected.\n(358)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties contested the\nconclusion in recital (239) to the provisional Regulation that the decreased\nexports of the Union PV upstream operators to the PRC might be compensated by\nexports to other markets arguing that the duties will decrease the world-wide\ndemand for the product. \n(359)\u00a0\u00a0 In\nthis respect, it is firstly noted that Chinese imports are not expected to\ncease completely as a result of the duties. In addition, the information\ncollected in the course of the investigation did not establish any direct correlation\nbetween the development of the imports from the PRC in the Union market and the\nexports from the PRC to other markets. Moreover, publicly available sources, such\nas EPIA\u2019s Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2013-2017, forecast that the\nPV market world-wide will grow in the next years. As far as the Chinese market\nis concerned, there are indications that the domestic consumption in the PRC\nwill increase substantially (e.g. as indicated by EPIA). In view of the above,\nthe exports of the Union upstream operators to the PRC are not expected to drop\nsignificantly as a consequence of the imposition of measures. \n(360)\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be noted that\nthe contraction of demand in the Union in 2013 and 2014 mentioned in recital (357)\nabove may have a negative impact on the upstream operators. This however cannot\nbe linked, at least not for its major part, to the duties as it was foreseen\nwell before the imposition of provisional measures. Moreover, concerning the Union\nproducers of machinery for the PV industry, as also mentioned in in recital\n(239) to the provisional Regulation, due to the existing substantial spare\ncapacity in the PRC, it is unlikely that their exports to the PRC can\nsignificantly increase even under the scenario that the Chinese producers\nincrease their production volume. Finally, the information gathered during the\ninvestigation indicated that the machinery producers may also be impacted by\nthe Chinese 12th five-year plan for Solar Photovoltaic Industry\nwhich foresees that by 2015 80% of the manufacturing equipment for cells should\ncome from the PRC. As long as this change is achieved in compliance with WTO\nrules, this may also further limit the possibility of manufacturers of\nmachinery in the Union to compete in the Chinese market. The above argument was\ntherefore rejected. \n(361)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure the GOC argued that the 12th five-year plan for the Solar\nPhotovoltaic Industry offers only some general guiding principles that are not\nbinding as there are no enforcement powers foreseen, and that therefore it\nshould not be considered as an indication that the possibility of manufacturers\nof machinery in the Union to compete in the Chinese market will be limited. In\nthis respect it is noted that the GOC included the PV industry amongst strategic industries in the 12th\nfive-year plan and also issued a specific plan for the solar photovoltaic\nindustry. In this plan the GOC expressed its support for \u201csuperior\nenterprises\u201d and \u201ckey enterprises\u201d, committed itself to \u201cpromote\nthe implementation of various photovoltaic support policies\u201d, and \u201cformulate\noverall preparation of supporting policies on industry, finance, taxation \u2026\u201d.\nFurthermore, as the plan contains\nessential directives to be achieved by the Chinese industry during the period\nof five years it has a deep\nimpact on the business landscape, both within the PRC and in countries that do\nbusiness with the PRC. Considering the above,\nthere are clear indications that the freedom of choice of the Chinese\nmanufacturers of cells and the competitive pressure of the Union producers of\nthe manufacturing equipment exporting to the Chinese market is restricted by\nthe plan. Therefore this argument was rejected.\n(362)\u00a0\u00a0 One cooperating raw material\nproducer contested the prospect of other markets compensation for the decreased\nproduction on the Chinese market, in view of the substantial installed\nproduction capacity in the PRC, which could not be easily built elsewhere. \n(363)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nin recital (359) above this argument is dismissed since there are no\nindications of the alleged decreased production on the Chinese market.\n(364)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\ncontested the number of employees in the upstream sector quoted in recital\n(236) to the provisional Regulation.\n(365)\u00a0\u00a0 It is clarified that the\nnumber of 4 200 employees reported in the provisional Regulation only referred\nto the cooperating upstream operators, such as equipment manufacturers and\npolysilicon supplier, based on their questionnaire replies, and not to the\nwhole sector. \n(366)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the exclusion of\nwafers from the product scope, the producers in the Union of this product\nshould nevertheless benefit from the imposition of duties, since the Union\nindustry is expected to increase its production of cells and modules.\n(367)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (235) and (240) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of downstream\noperators\n(368)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmentioned in recital (329) above, after the imposition of provisional measures\nfurther verification visits were carried out to two project developers. \n(369)\u00a0\u00a0 In\naddition to seven questionnaire replies of the downstream operators whose\nactivity is directly related to the like product (namely the project developers\nand installers), the analysis of which constituted the basis for the assessment\nof the downstream operators in the provisional Regulation, six additional replies\nto questionnaires submitted at provisional stage and considered not to be\nsufficiently complete (see recital (241) to the provisional Regulation) were\nfurther analysed as they provided indications on the relative importance of\ntheir PV related activity as compared to their total activity.\n(370)\u00a0\u00a0 The six\nadditional operators concerned were service providers in the PV sector\n(logistics, transport, public relations, etc.) thus operators whose activity is\nnot directly related to the product under investigation. Despite certain\ndeficiencies in the replies, the data in the questionnaires showed that the PV\nrelated activity of these operators was marginal as compared to their total\nactivity. Indeed, during the IP the PV related activity represented on average\nonly around 5 % of their total turnover and 8 % of their total employment. Profitability\nwas on average around 7 %. However, it is noted that data concerning\nprofitability were not complete, as not all operators reported on this item. \n(371)\u00a0\u00a0 On\nthe basis of the further analysis, it was concluded that in the light of the\ndata provided, any possible impact of the measures on the economic situation of\nthe service providers in the PV sector is unlikely to be significant. \n(372)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional and\nfinal disclosure, several parties contested the representativity of the data\nconcerning the downstream operators on turnover, profitability and employment\nderived by the Commission from the replies to the questionnaires by seven\ndownstream operators. AFASE submitted a \u2018survey\u2019 conducted amongst its members\n(installers) to illustrate that for the majority of the installers the PV\nbusiness constitutes a primary source of income. AFASE further alleged that the\ndownstream operators, in particular installers, in contrast to the findings set\nout in recital (242) to the provisional Regulation would only realise one-digit\nprofit margins which do not allow for absorption of any duties. \n(373)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the\nrepresentativity of the data used in the provisional Regulation the Commission\nhas used all the data provided by those downstream operators that have filled\nin the specific questionnaire, as well as the submissions provided by AFASE, as\nexplained in recital (330) above. \n(374)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the claim that the PV business constitutes a\nprimary source of income for installers, further analysis of the questionnaire\nreplies submitted by the seven downstream operators (installers and project\ndevelopers) confirmed that the activity directly related to the like product under\ninvestigation represented on average around 42 % of the total activity of these\noperators and the profitability equalled on average 11 %. However, when taking\ninto account also their activities (not directly related to the product under\ninvestigation), their overall importance increases substantially for three out of\nthe seven operators. As a result, the corresponding ratio would range from\naround 45 % to 100 % during the IP. In addition, for the seven operators (installers\nand project developers) the profitability of the PV activity including the\nactivities not directly linked to the product under investigation would amount\nto 9% on average. Employment-wise, the PV activity including the activities not\ndirectly linked to the product under investigation would amount to around 660 full-time\njobs in the IP for the seven operators. Apart from PV projects and installations\nthese operators were also active in wind energy installations and production of\nelectrical equipment.\n(375)\u00a0\u00a0 It is considered that any\nimpact of measures on the downstream operators has to be primarily assessed on\ntheir activity directly related to the product under investigation which in the\nIP reached a profitability of 11 % on average. However, even if it is assessed\non the basis of the overall PV activity not directly related to the product under\ninvestigation the conclusions would be similar to the one made at provisional\nstage since, overall, the various factors taken into account, namely\nprofitability and possibility to absorb part of the duty, do not vary\nsignificantly (the profitability decreases from 11 % on average to 9 % on\naverage). In reply to the final disclosure one party on which premises the\nCommission had carried out a verification visit contested the representativity\nof the conclusion on profitability of the installers and developers, which, as\nfar as it is concerned, would allegedly be based only on a single transaction.\nThis argument is dismissed as the Commission calculated the profitability of\nthe downstream operators, on the basis of all data submitted by the downstream\noperators in their questionnaire replies. \n(376)\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the survey\nconducted by AFASE amongst its members, it is firstly noted that all operators\nhad the opportunity to come forward at the initiation of the investigation and\nto reply to the specific questionnaire designed for downstream operators requesting\nthe necessary information for the assessment of the impact of duties on these\noperators. Secondly, the identity of the installers was not provided in the\nsurvey which did not allow for a verification of e.g. the relevance and\nreliability of the data provided. Thirdly, while a number of questions asked in\nthis survey concerned the installers' capacity to absorb the possible duties,\nthe survey lacked any reference to the profit achieved by these installers in\nthe IP, thus missing an important element for the evaluation of the impact of\nmeasures. As a consequence no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from the\nsurvey provided.\n(377)\u00a0\u00a0 A\nnumber of parties contested the conclusions in recitals (247) and (250) to the\nprovisional Regulation that the jobs in the downstream segment will be\nnegatively impacted in the short term and that the overall impact will be\nnegative but only to a limited extent in view of the fact that the PV market in\nthe Union is forecasted to grow in the mid- and long-term. Some parties further\nclaimed that in particular installers, who are dependent on the PV\ninstallations, will suffer from the decline in demand. \n(378)\u00a0\u00a0 The\npossible job losses resulting from the imposition of the duties was further\nanalysed. In general terms, the information gathered during the investigation\nconfirmed that the downstream sector has been experiencing job losses as a\nresult of the contraction of the demand for PV installations in the Union of\nabout 5 GW between 2011 and 2012, as already stated in recital (246) to the\nprovisional Regulation. These job losses cannot be linked to the measures as\nthey reflected a market evolution. Moreover, a further contraction of demand is\nforeseen in 2013 and 2014 and will most likely result in further job losses in\nthe PV sector. Similarly, such evolution of the demand was forecasted by major\nresearch centres such as EPIA before the initiation of the investigation and\ntherefore such job losses cannot be attributed to the imposition of measures.\n(379)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nUnion industry submitted a study by a consultant PriceWaterHouseCoopers ('PWC')\non the possible impact of measure on PV related jobs. The PWC study refers to\nan earlier study by another consultant Prognos, which envisaged high job losses\nin the PV market resulting from the imposition of measures, which was submitted\nby AFASE prior to the imposition of provisional duties and which was addressed\nin recitals (243) to (246) to the provisional Regulation. The PWC study\ncriticised the study by Prognos pointing to the fact that the total job losses\nestimated by Prognos exceeded in fact the total number of existing PV jobs in\nthe Union. Regarding the impact of duties in the Union market, PWC reached\nopposite conclusions than Prognos, forecasting a net positive impact on jobs in\nthe Union and that the benefits outweigh the possible negative effects of the\nduties (e.g. on demand). In view of the absence of new substantiated arguments\non the impact of measures on the employment in the downstream sector, the\nconclusions in recitals (247) to (250) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed. \n(380)\u00a0\u00a0 AFASE argued that the\nCommission did not disclose the source of the margin of error of 20 % for the\ndirect PV jobs calculated for 2011 mentioned in recital (245) to the\nprovisional Regulation. \n(381)\u00a0\u00a0 This margin of error of 20%,\nwhich may apply upward or downward, became apparent during the verification\nvisit at EPIA. It shows the difficulty to assess precise figures on employment\nin the downstream sector as there are few sources, often contradictory, of data\ncollection. \n(382)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final disclosure some\nparties claimed that the Commission's analysis was silent about the fact that\nthe duties will only add to the loss of jobs resulting from the smaller number\nof PV installations after 2011. It was argued that such job losses, in\nparticular in the downstream sector, are closely linked to the fact that the PV\ninstallers are dependent on the solar installations. In addition, AFASE\ncriticised the Commission for not having properly considered the survey it\nconducted amongst its members and a similar survey conducted by a UK Solar\nTrade Association, which allegedly illustrated such dependence. \n(383)\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the alleged\nsilence of the Commission concerning the impact of the duties on jobs,\nreference is made to recitals (377) and (379) above, where the claims\nconcerning the impact of the measures on jobs in the PV sector are addressed\nand where it is acknowledged that indeed the jobs in the downstream sector\nmight be affected in the short term due to the measures. \n(384)\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the survey\nconducted by AFASE and the UK Solar Trade Association, in response to the final disclosure the identity of the\ncompanies participating in the interview was provided. The surveys remained\nhowever deficient, since for example certain replies were incomplete. The\nanalysis of the surveys showed the following. Concerning the survey by AFASE,\nit is firstly noted that the majority of the 50 installers who replied to the\ninterview declared to be exclusively active in the PV market. 15 out of 50\ninstallers declared to be also active in other non-PV activities such heating,\nelectrical installations, and wind to a certain extent. In case of the UK\nsurvey, 21 out of 31 UK companies who replied to the interview had also other than\nPV activities. This result shows that with regards to a nearly a half of the\nproject developers and installers, the finding set out in recital (247) to the\nprovisional Regulation on the ability to perform other activities such as\nelectrical and heating installations, plumbing and other green energies\ninstallations, is correct. It is, however, recognized that this ability may\nexist to a lesser extent than assumed in the provisional Regulation. Its\nmitigating impact on job losses may therefore be less important than initially\nassumed. Secondly, some of the operators surveyed by AFASE and the UK Solar\nTrade Association have been using products produced in the Union and some\nforesee buying non-Chinese products following the measures to avoid a price\nincrease. Thus, their dependence on the Chinese imports and the impact of the\nmeasures is expected to be reduced as they can access products produced in the\nUnion. Thirdly, the estimation of the impact of the measures on the businesses of\nall surveyed operators\u2019 did not allow for firm conclusions as their assessment\nwas very diverse. Some companies were even unable to assess such impact. Fourthly,\nalso the answers to the question about the number of the PV projects that risk\ncancelling in case of duties ranged from 'not many' to 'all projects' in the UK\nsurvey. Some operators were unable to make an estimation. Finally, both surveys\nlacked the question about the profitability of the economic operators\ninterviewed, which is important for the assessment of the possible absorption\nof the price increase, if any, resulting from the duty.\n(385)\u00a0\u00a0 Other parties claimed that\ninstallers cannot easily change their activities or switch to other green\nenergy installations because of the very different technologies and know-how\ninvolved. Therefore, should the duties be imposed, they would go out of\nbusiness. After final disclosure, this claim was\nreiterated by one interested party, arguing that installers have invested\nsubstantial resources in PV specialisation, such a specific training, which\nwould show that their main focus is on the PV sector and that they would not be\nable to switch easily to other activities.\n(386)\u00a0\u00a0 This argument was\ninsufficiently substantiated as it was not demonstrated what precise knowledge\nan installer would need to acquire and how difficult and expensive it is to obtain\nit. Irrespectively, the institutions acknowledge that installers have developed\nknow-how specific to the installation of PV modules. However, the development\nof this know-how is relatively recent and adds to the primary expertise of the\ninstallers being electrical and heating installations, plumbing etc. It also developed\nin response to an unfair practice namely the massive inflow of dumped imports\nfrom the PRC. Independently from the specialised skills of the employees of the\ninstallers, the argument has to be considered in parallel with the analysis made\nin recitals (378) and (382) above on the employment situation in the downstream\nsector which in the short term might be negatively impacted but which, thanks\nto sustainable trade, would lead to an increase in the employment of installers\nin the mid- to long term. Therefore, the argument was rejected.\n(387)\u00a0\u00a0 Several parties contested\nthe argument regarding the ability of the downstream operators to absorb partly\nthe possible price increase mentioned in recital (247) to the provisional\nRegulation. Also this argument was insufficiently substantiated thus preventing\nfrom assessing to which extent this allegation was accurate. As mentioned in\nrecital (374) above, profitability of the downstream cooperating operators related\ndirectly to the product concerned was assessed at around 11 % on average which\nleaves to the operators in question the possibility to absorb at least\npartially some price increase if any. In this context, it is recalled as\nmentioned in recital (335) above that the overall trend of prices is downward.\nThe argument is therefore rejected.\n(388)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure some parties reiterated the claim of the serious risk of contraction\nof demand for solar products in the Union as a result of the measures, which\naccording to these parties speaks against the measures. One party argued that\nthe solar energy currently has a high price elasticity of demand and even a\nlimited increase in the price of solar products would result in a severe\ncontraction of demand. This party estimated that an anti-dumping duty in the\nrange of 30 % may further contract demand by 8 GW whereas a duty of 50 % would\ncontract demand by 10 GW. In the same tone, AFASE referred to a study made by a\nmarket analyst, which also foresees a contraction of demand of up to 2GW in\n2013 as a result of a duty of 50 %, thus a contraction of a much smaller\nmagnitude. \n(389)\u00a0\u00a0 Although different\ncontraction scenarios were submitted by parties during the investigation in\naddition to the ones referred to above, they did not contain comparable\nresults. While it cannot be excluded that the duties might result in a\ncontraction of demand for PV installations, the quantification of such effect\nis difficult to establish in view of the various elements that influence the\nattractiveness of the PV installations in the Union (see for instance recital\n(258) to the provisional Regulation). In addition, even if such contraction\nwere to take place in the short-term, the mid- and long-term benefits resulting\nfrom fair trade are expected to outweigh the short term negative impact.\nFinally, AFASE itself recognised that the assessment of the direct link between\nthe demand and the duties would only be available once duties are in place.\nTherefore, this argument was rejected. \n(390)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (243) and (250) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed. The findings on the six service providers for which the PV related\nactivity constitutes only a small fraction of their broader activities (see\nrecital (370) above) do not change the conclusion contained in recital (250) to\nthe provisional Regulation nor does the distinction of the PV activity not\ndirectly related to the product concerned of the seven project\ndevelopers/installers referred to in recital (374).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest of the\nend-users/consumers\n(391)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, some parties reiterated the argument that the duties would increase\nthe price of the product concerned. Consequently, there would be a decline in\ndemand for PV installations as they would be too expensive for consumers and\nnot attractive enough for the other investors.\n(392)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nalready mentioned in recital (335) above, even if a temporary increase of\nprices may happen as a result of the imposition of measures, the overall trend\nof prices is downward as confirmed by several public sources. While it is\ndifficult to quantify the exact possible price increase resulting from the\nmeasures and a consequent possible contraction of the demand, several elements\nare recalled. Firstly, the product under investigation constitutes up to 50% of\nthe total cost of a PV installation and therefore the duty may be at least\npartly absorbed. Secondly, the competition of the Union industry with the third\ncountries' producers, already present on the Union market, is likely to keep\nthe prices down. At the same time the Union industry should be able to achieve\nbetter financial results thanks to the economies of scales resulting from a\nbetter utilisation of the production plants and reduced cost of production. Thirdly,\nthe demand for PV installations is correlated not only with the price levels of\nthe product under investigation but also with the level of FITs. At present low\nlevels of demand, as compared to those achieved in 2011 and the IP, it is\nexpected that the FITs should not decrease as quickly as in the period\nconsidered, allowing for continuous investment in PV projects. The argument was\ntherefore dismissed.\n(393)\u00a0\u00a0 In reply to the final\ndisclosure one party contested the above reasoning. It claimed that the\ndownward price trend cannot be maintained after the imposition of the measures.\nThe party recalled that the measures represent a very significant cost increase\nthat cannot be fully offset by cost decreases and or imports from the third\ncountries. In addition, it was reiterated that the Union industry will not be\nable to undertake new investments in plants and machinery and the downstream\noperators can absorb a little if their profit is 11 %. Finally there is no\nevidence that suggests that FITs might compensate the price increase.\n(394)\u00a0\u00a0 It is recalled that contrary\nto this claim it is not expected that the price increase resulting from the\nmeasures may be fully offset but rather that a temporary increase in prices following\nthe measures is possible (see recital (247) to the provisional Regulation).\nIndeed, such price increase may result from the difference in price levels\nbetween the Chinese dumped prices and the non-Chinese products. Yet, the\ninformation gathered during the investigation allows claiming that the eventual\nprice increase may be partly absorbed by a number of factors in view of the\nprofits in the downstream sector at the level of 11 %. Finally, regarding the\nclaim that there is no evidence that suggests that FITs might compensate the\nprice increase, it is reasonable to assume that FITs will be adjusted over time\nin line with the development of prices for projects.\n(395)\u00a0\u00a0 One party claimed that in fact\nsince March 2013 modules prices increased by 20% in Europe and that there is a\nsevere lack of stock since 2013. The argument was not substantiated and to the\ncontrary, the public information sources confirm a relative stability of prices\nin the second quarter of 2013. Even if that information was correct, it would\nonly reflect the fact that following registration of imports, the risk of a\npossible anti-dumping duty has been priced in. The argument was therefore\nrejected. \n(396)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party claimed that\nthe PV projects would not generate a return for an investor if the fall in FITs\nis not correlated with falling project costs, including the price of modules,\nas they represent a significant part of the costs in a given project. To this\nend, it was claimed that the duties would put in question the viability of many\nPV projects as they increase the price. \n(397)\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in recital (335)\nabove, the overall trend of prices of the cells and modules is downward.\nFurthermore, the importance of FIT with regard to the market is decreasing as\ngrid parity is likely to be achieved in several regions. On these grounds the\nargument that the price of PV modules could have a negative impact on PV\nprojects including the question of their viability was rejected. \n(398)\u00a0\u00a0 One interested party\nprovided an internal modelling to prove that the viability of many PV projects\nwas endangered if duties were applied. \n(399)\u00a0\u00a0 This modelling did not allow\nfor a proper quantification as to what extent the attractiveness of the\ninvestment in the PV installations (e.g. return on investment) could decline in\nthe event of increased prices of the cells and modules. Nevertheless, the\nassumption that any duty would be entirely passed on to end-users or consumers,\nused in the said modelling, is unlikely in view of the existing profit margins\nof the downstream operators. Moreover, an investment decision is not only based\non the price of modules but also depends on many other factors including inter\nalia the existence of a general favourable framework for PV installations\nin a given country, the level of support respectively the electricity price\n(for grid parity). Therefore, this argument has to be rejected.\n(400)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of any\nfurther comments, recitals (252) and (254) to the provisional Regulation are\nconfirmed.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other arguments\n(401)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure, the argument that the Union industry is not capable of supplying\nthe Union market and that only the PRC possesses the capacity to supply the\nUnion market was reiterated. \n(402)\u00a0\u00a0 The claim was addressed in\nrecital (256) to the provisional Regulation. Even if a more conservative\nassumption on the Union production capacity was made (see recital (183) above),\nthe joint Union and third countries spare capacity would be sufficient to\ncomplement in the short-term the potential decrease of Chinese imports.\nAlso in the medium-term it is reasonable to assume that the Union industry will\nexpand its production capacity to cover demand which will allow it to achieve\neconomies of scale, which in turn would allow for further price reduction.\nTherefore, this argument was rejected. \n(403)\u00a0\u00a0 Some parties reiterated the\nargument regarding the difficulty in achieving the Commission's green energy 2020\ngoals if duties are imposed. This argument has already been addressed in the\nprovisional Regulation recitals (257) to (259), therefore, in the absence of\nany further elements, recitals (257) and (259) to the provisional Regulation\nare confirmed.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion on Union\ninterest\n(404)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the above, the\nassessment in recitals (260) to (261) to the provisional Regulation is\nconfirmed. \n(405)\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, there are no\ncompelling reasons against the imposition of definitive measures on imports of\nthe product concerned originating in the PRC.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING\nMEASURES\n(406)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, definitive\nanti-dumping measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury\nbeing caused to the Union industry by the dumped imports.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Injury elimination level\n(407)\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of\ndetermining the level of these measures, account was taken of the dumping\nmargins found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury\nsustained by the Union producers, without exceeding the dumping margins found. \n(408)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the provisional\ndisclosure one interested party contested the 10% profit margin used to\ncalculate the injury elimination level claiming that this level was too high\nfor this industry in the current market circumstances and it was used both for\nmodules and cells. It is noted that the legal benchmark to determine the profit\nbefore tax for the purpose of calculating the injury elimination level is\nwhether such profit could be reasonably achieved by the industry under normal\nconditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumping. In line with the jurisprudence\nof the General Court, such profit is the one realised at the beginning of the\nperiod considered, i.e. before the increase in dumped imports. Therefore the\ntarget profit was adjusted at 8% on the basis of the weighted average profit\nrealised by the Union industry in 2009 and 2010 for modules and cells when\nprofitable. \n(409)\u00a0\u00a0 Following the final\ndisclosure, the Union industry claimed that the profitability of the year 2010\nshould be used as the level of profitability that Union industry could\nreasonably achieve in the absence of dumped imports rather than the average\nprofit margin of the years 2009 and 2010. In this respect, it was argued that,\nthe profitability in 2009 was insufficient and the circumstances in the two\nyears were clearly distinct given in particular the development in consumption\nin 2010 which alleviated the effects of dumping in that year. In this regard,\nit should be noted that it is not relevant whether the average profit margin\nrealised by the Union industry was \u2018sufficient\u2019 when determining the injury\nelimination level. As already stated in recital (264) to the provisional\nRegulation the injury elimination level should be based on the profit which can\nbe reasonably achieved in the absence of dumped imports. It is the\nInvestigating Authorities\u2019 practice to consider that this level had been\nreached at the beginning of the period considered. As in this case the Union\nindustry realised losses with regard to the sales of cells at the beginning of\nthe period considered in 2009, this methodology was unsuitable and it was\ndeemed more reliable to base the determination of the injury elimination level\non the average profit margin of the first and the second year of the period\nconsidered. In this regard it was also considered that it is irrelevant that\ncircumstances were different in these two years.\n(410)\u00a0\u00a0 Another party reiterated\nthat the different target profits should be established for modules and cells,\nas the profitability of these product types showed different trends during the\nperiod considered. While indicators were shown separately for each product\ntype, the conclusions reached for each indicator refer to the product under\ninvestigation as a whole. It is also recalled that modules and cells are one\nsingle product and therefore the dumping margins and the injury elimination\nlevel were established on this basis.\n(411)\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the revised sample\nof unrelated importers post-importation costs (modified for the reasons\nexplained in recital (21) ) had an impact on the injury margins calculated.\nFinally, all underselling margins were affected by the correction of CIF\nprices, the exclusion of wafers and the new target profit. \n(412)\u00a0\u00a0 One party argued that sales\nof the sampled Union producers focused on the high-end market, such as the\nresidential/small commercial sector, which attracted higher FITs and suggested\nthat the Union industry\u2019s sales price should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\nIt should be noted that this claim should not be decisive for the calculation\nof the injury margin, since the investigation showed that Union producers were\nnot profitable.\n(413)\u00a0\u00a0 In the absence of other\ncomments concerning the injury elimination level, the methodology described in\nrecitals (263) to (266) to the provisional Regulation is confirmed. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitive measures\n(414)\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the conclusions\nreached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Union interest and in\naccordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, it is considered that\ndefinitive anti-dumping measures should be imposed on imports of crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels and cells of the type used in crystalline silicon PV\nmodules or panels, originating in or consigned from the PRC at the level of the\nlower of the dumping and the injury margins found, in accordance with the\nlesser duty rule. In this case, the duty rate should accordingly be set at the\nlevel of the injury margins found.\n(415)\u00a0\u00a0 It is noted that an\nanti-subsidy investigation was carried out in parallel with the anti-dumping\ninvestigation. In view of the use of the lesser duty rule and the fact that the\ndefinitive subsidy margins are lower than the injury elimination level, it is\nconsidered appropriate to impose a definitive countervailing duty at the level\nof the established definitive subsidy margins and then impose a definitive\nanti-dumping duty up to the relevant injury elimination level. On the basis of\nthe above, the rate at which such duties will be imposed are set as follows:\n Company || Subsidy margin || Dumping margin || Injury elimination level || Countervailing duty || Anti-dumping duty \n Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co.

Therefore, they reflect the\nsituation found during that investigation in respect to these companies. These\nduty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to \u2018all other\ncompanies\u2019) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of the products\noriginating in the PRC and produced by the companies and thus by the specific\nlegal entities mentioned. Imports of the product concerned manufactured by any\nother company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this\nRegulation with its name and address, including entities related to those\nspecifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to\nthe duty rate applicable to \u2018all other companies\u2019. \n(417)\u00a0\u00a0 Following disclosure, the GOC\nargued that the weighted average duty rate for the companies listed in Annex I\nand Annex II is in violation of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, since it is\nallegedly based on the weighted average of the duties calculated separately for\nthe sampled exporting producers of cells and modules. This assessment is,\nhowever, incorrect. For the sampled exporting producers, a uniform duty rate\nhas been calculated for all their exports of the product concerned \u2013 and the\nmajority of exporting producers did export cells and modules. The assessment\nthat duties were separately calculated for exporting producers of cells and\nmodules is therefore incorrect, and the argument can therefore not be accepted.\n(418)\u00a0\u00a0 Should the exports by one of\nthe companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates increase\nsignificantly in volume after the imposition of the measures concerned, such an\nincrease in volume could be considered as constituting in itself a change in\nthe pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures within the meaning of\nArticle 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In such circumstances and provided the\nconditions are met an anti-circumvention investigation may be initiated. This\ninvestigation may, inter alia, examine the need for the removal of individual\nduty rates and the consequent imposition of a country-wide duty.\n(419)\u00a0\u00a0 Any claim requesting the\napplication of an individual anti-dumping duty rate (e.g. following a change in\nthe name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales\nentities) should be addressed to the Commission forthwith with all relevant\ninformation, in particular any modification in the company\u2019s activities linked\nto production, domestic and export sales associated with, for instance, that\nname change or that change in the production and sales entities. If\nappropriate, this Regulation will then be amended accordingly by updating the\nlist of companies benefiting from individual anti-dumping duty rates.\n(420)\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure equal\ntreatment between any new exporters and the cooperating companies not included\nin the sample, mentioned in Annex I and Annex II to this Regulation, provision\nshould be made for the weighted average duty imposed on the latter companies to\nbe applied to any new exporters which would otherwise be entitled to a review\npursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.\n(421)\u00a0\u00a0 Measures\nare imposed to allow the producers in the Union to recover from the injurious\neffect of dumping. To the extent that there would be any initial imbalance\nbetween the potential benefit for producers in the Union and the cost for other\neconomic operators in the Union, this imbalance could be offset by an increase\nand/or restart of the production in the Union.\n(422)\u00a0\u00a0 However,\nthe envisaged scenario of increased production in the Union may not be in line\nwith the market development in this volatile market. As indicated in recital\n(108) to the provisional Regulation, Union consumption of modules increased by\n264 % between 2009 and 2011, only to decrease by 43 percentage points during\nthe 6 month period between 2011 and the IP. The volatility is even more\nimpressive when looking at the period of 2006-2011, where the Union consumption\nof modules increased from less than 1 GW to almost 20 GW or an increase of around\n2000% in just five years. This volatility is expected to continue, and\nforecasts published by business associations show differences of 100% and more\nbetween the different scenarios even for the medium term period of 2014-2015.\n(423)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthese reasons, it is considered appropriate, in such exceptional circumstances,\nto limit the duration of measures to a period of two years only.\n(424)\u00a0\u00a0 This period should be enough for the producers in the Union to\nincrease and/or restart their production, while at the same time not\nsignificantly endanger the situation of other economic operators in the Union.\nIt is considered that the period of two years will be the most appropriate to\nanalyse whether the imposition of measures had indeed the effect of increasing\nEuropean production and thereby balancing the negative effects on other\neconomic operators in the Union.\n(425)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, one Union producer raised the argument that the limited\nduration of 2 years is too short to recover from the injury suffered. In\naddition it was argued that a duration of 2 years would not allow Union\nproducers to file business plans for the current and the coming business year.\nIn this respect, it is noted that the duration of the measures until December\n2015, which should be sufficient for Union producers to file business plans\nuntil 2015.\n(426)\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore,\nthe Union producer did not contest the reasons for which the duration was\nlimited to two years, notably the volatility of the market. The producer even\nexplicitly appreciated a review in case the measures need to be changed due to\nchanged market situation. Since the likelihood of a change in market\ncircumstances within two years is indeed high in this volatile market, it is\nconsidered appropriate to limit the measures to two years from the outset.\n(427)\u00a0\u00a0 Following\nfinal disclosure, the complainant argued that two years are insufficient to\ninvest in production, referring to recital (424) above. However, due to the\nsubstantial spare capacity of the Union industry, an increase in production can\nbe done through a better utilisation of the existing production capacities,\nwhich should be feasible without significant additional investments.\n(428)\u00a0\u00a0 The complainant\nfurther argued that an imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties for a\nperiod of two years is insufficient for the Union Industry to recover from the\ninjurious effects of past dumping. However, the imposition of anti-dumping\nduties cannot only look at the interests of the Union Industry alone, but needs\nto balance the potential benefit for producers in the Union and the cost for\nother economic operators in the Union. On this basis, the decision to limit\nmeasures to two years is maintained.\n(429)\u00a0\u00a0 All parties were informed of\nthe essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to\nrecommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of crystalline\nsilicon PV modules or panels and cells of the type used in crystalline silicon PV\nmodules or panels, originating in or consigned from the PRC and the definitive\ncollection of the amounts secured by way to the provisional duty (final\ndisclosure). All parties were granted a period within which they could make\ncomments on the final disclosure.\n(430)\u00a0\u00a0 The oral and written\ncomments submitted by the interested parties were considered and taken into\naccount where appropriate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retroactivity\n(431)\u00a0\u00a0 As\nconcerns a possible retroactive application of anti-dumping measures, the\ncriteria set out in Article 10(4) of the basic Regulation have to be evaluated.\nPursuant to Article 10(4)(b), one key criterion which needs to be fulfilled is\nthat there is \"a further substantial rise in imports\" \"in\naddition to the level of imports which caused injury during the investigation\nperiod\".\n(432)\u00a0\u00a0 A\ncomparison of monthly average imports[18] of\nmodules and cells with monthly average imports for the period under\nregistration (March 2013 \u2011 June 2013) shows a sharp decrease of import\nvolumes after the IP. Indeed, as stated in recital (110) to the provisional\nRegulation, the monthly average import quantity of Chinese modules and cells\namounted to 1 250 MW[19] during the IP. For comparison, during the period of registration\nthe monthly average import volume of Chinese modules and cells was only around\nhalf as high.\n(433)\u00a0\u00a0 Alternatively,\ngiven the volatile nature of the market, the further substantial rise in\nimports could be assessed in relative rather than absolute terms. To assess\nwhether there is a further substantial rise in imports in relative terms, it is\nnecessary to compare the import volumes with the consumption on the Union market,\ni.e. the consumption would have to decrease at a substantially higher rate than\nthe decrease in Chinese imports. Since the import volume of Chinese modules and\ncells during the period of registration was only half as high as during the IP,\nthis decrease in consumption would need to be substantially higher than 50%.\nWhile no precise information concerning the consumption during the period under\nregistration is available, there are no indications that the consumption\ndecreased by more than 50%.\n(434)\u00a0\u00a0 For\nthe reasons stated above, the criterion concerning a further substantial rise\nin imports is therefore not met. As a consequence, it is concluded that the\ndefinitive anti-dumping duty shall not be levied retroactively prior to the\ndate of application of provisional measures. \nH. FORM OF THE MEASURES\n(435)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nto the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures, a group of\ncooperating exporting producers, including their related companies in the PRC\nand in the European Union, and together with the CCCME offered a joint price\nundertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. The\nundertaking offer was also supported by the Chinese authorities. \n(436)\u00a0\u00a0 The\nCommission examined the offer, and by Decision 2013/423/EU[20] accepted this undertaking\noffer. As already indicated in recitals (3), (4) and (7) of this Decision, in\norder to assess whether the price undertaking removes the injurious effect of\ndumping, the Commission has analysed any changed market circumstances of a\nlasting nature concerning, inter alia, the current export prices and the injury\nelimination level which was found lower than the level of dumping.\n(437)\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent\nto Decision 2013/423/EU, the exporting producers together with CCCME submitted\na notification to amend their initial undertaking offer. They requested to\nrevise the undertaking to take account of the exclusion of wafers from the\nproduct scope as described in recitals (31) and (72). In addition, a number of\nadditional exporters, within the deadline stipulated in Article 8(2) of the\nbasic Regulation, requested to be included in the undertaking.\n(438)\u00a0\u00a0 By\nDecision 2013/XXX/EU,[21] the Commission confirmed the acceptance\nof the undertaking offered by exporters listed in the Annex to that Decision with\nregards to the definitive duties.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A definitive anti-dumping\nduty is hereby imposed on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules\nor panels and cells of the type used in crystalline silicon photovoltaic\nmodules or panels (the cells have a thickness not exceeding 400 micrometres),\ncurrently falling within CN codes ex 8501 31 00, ex 8501 32 00, ex 8501 33 00,\nex 8501 34 00, ex 8501 61 20, ex 8501 61 80, ex 8501 62 00, ex 8501 63 00, ex\n8501 64 00 and ex 8541 40 90 (TARIC codes 8501 31 00 81, 8501 31 00 89, 8501 32\n00 41, 8501 32 00 49, 8501 33 00 61, 8501 33 00 69, 8501 34 00 41, 8501 34 00\n49, 8501 61 20 41, 8501 61 20 49, 8501 61 80 41, 8501 61 80 49, 8501 62 00 61,\n8501 62 00 69, 8501 63 00 41, 8501 63 00 49, 8501 64 00 41, 8501 64 00 49, 8541\n40 90 21, 8541 40 90 29, 8541 40 90 31 and 8541 40 90 39) and originating in or\nconsigned from the People\u2019s Republic of China, unless they are in transit in\nthe sense of Article V GATT.\nThe following product types are excluded from\nthe definition of the product concerned:\n\u2013              \nsolar chargers that consist of less than six\ncells, are portable and supply electricity to devices or charge batteries,\n\u2013              \nthin film photovoltaic products,\n\u2013              \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic products that\nare permanently integrated into electrical goods, where the function of the\nelectrical goods is other than power generation, and where these electrical\ngoods consume the electricity generated by the integrated crystalline silicon\nphotovoltaic cell(s),\n\u2013              \nmodules or panels with a output voltage not\nexceeding 50 V DC and a power output not exceeding 50 W solely for direct use\nas battery chargers in systems with the same voltage and power characteristics.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rate of the definitive\nanti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Union-frontier price, before\nduty, of the products described in paragraph 1 and produced by the companies\nlisted below shall be as follows:\n Company || Duty rate || TARIC additional code \n Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co.
