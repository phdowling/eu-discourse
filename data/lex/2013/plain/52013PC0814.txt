Double\r\nnon-taxation deprives Member States of significant revenues and creates unfair\r\ncompetition between businesses in the Single Market.\nA specific example of double non-taxation\r\nwas identified in 2009 in the Business Code of Conduct Group[3] concerning certain financial\r\nhybrid mismatches. Responses to the 2012 Commission public consultation on\r\ndouble non-taxation[4]\r\nhad agreed in general such mismatches were undesirable.\nHybrid loans arrangements are financial\r\ninstruments that have characteristics of both debt and equity. Due to different\r\ntax qualifications given by Member States to hybrid loans (debt or equity),\r\npayments under a cross border hybrid loan are treated as a tax deductible\r\nexpense in one Member State (the Member State of the payer) and as a tax exempt\r\ndistribution of profits in the other Member State (the Member State of the\r\npayee), thus resulting in an unintended double non-taxation. \nTo solve the issue, the Code of Conduct\r\nGroup agreed guidance according to which the recipient Member State should follow the tax qualification given to hybrid loans payments by the source Member State (i.e. no tax exemption should be granted for hybrid loan payments that are deductible\r\nin the source Member State)[5].\r\n\nHowever, the solution agreed by the Code of\r\nConduct Group cannot be safely implemented under directive 2011/96[6], as amended by reason of the\r\naccession of the Republic of Croatia[7],\r\non the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and\r\nsubsidiaries of different Member States (Parent-Subsidiary Directive \u2013 'PSD'). In\r\nthe PSD, subject to various eligibility conditions, Member States are obliged\r\nto exempt from taxation (or to grant credit for the taxation occurred abroad)\r\nprofit distributions received by parent companies from subsidiaries of another\r\nMember State. This is the case even if the profit distribution has been treated\r\nas a tax deductible payment in the Member State where the paying subsidiary is\r\nresident.\nBoth the European Council, in its March\r\n2012 conclusions, and the European Parliament, in its resolution of 19 April\r\n2012, have stressed the need to develop concrete ways to improve the fight\r\nagainst tax fraud and tax evasion. The European Parliament called for a review\r\nof the PSD in order to eliminate evasion via hybrid financial instruments in\r\nthe EU.\nThe Action Plan to strengthen the fight\r\nagainst tax fraud and tax evasion adopted by the Commission on 6 December 2012[8] identifies tackling mismatches\r\nbetween tax systems as one of the actions to be undertaken in the short term\r\n(in 2013). In this respect, the Action Plan states \"Detailed discussion\r\nwith Member States have shown that in a specific case an agreed solution cannot\r\nbe achieved without a legislative amendment of the Parent Subsidiary directive.\r\nThe objective will be to ensure that the application of the directive does not\r\ninadvertently prevent effective action against double non-taxation in the area\r\nof hybrid loan structures\". \nThe Action Plan also announced a review of\r\nanti-abuse provisions in the corporate tax directives, including PSD, with a\r\nview to implement the principles underlying its Recommendation on aggressive\r\ntax planning[9].\r\nIn the Recommendation it is recommended that Member States adopt a general\r\nanti-abuse rule ('GAAR') to counteract aggressive tax planning practices.\nAlthough the current PSD contains an anti-abuse\r\nclause, this lacks clarity and potentially creates confusion. The inclusion of\r\nthe more comprehensive GAAR, adapted to the specifics of the Parent Subsidiary,\r\nalong the principles indicated by the Recommendation on aggressive tax planning\r\nwould remove these difficulties and would improve the efficiency of measures\r\ntaken at national level to counter international tax avoidance, while enhancing\r\ncoordinated actions by Member States and ensuring compliance with Treaty\r\nFreedoms, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU').\nOn 21 May 2013, the European Parliament\r\nadopted a resolution[10]\r\nwhereby it urged the Member States to embrace the Commission's Action Plan and\r\nfully implement the Recommendation on aggressive tax planning. The European\r\nParliament also called on the Commission to address specifically the problem of\r\nhybrid mismatches between the different tax systems used in the Member States,\r\nas well as to present in 2013 a proposal for the revision of the PSD with a\r\nview to revise the anti-abuse clause and to eliminate double non-taxation in\r\nthe EU as facilitated by hybrid arrangements.\nIn its conclusions of 22 May 2013, the\r\nEuropean Council noted the Commission's intention to present a proposal before\r\nthe end of the year for the revision of the 'parent/subsidiary' Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS\r\nWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\nIn addition to the consultation work done\r\nwithin the context of the Code of Conduct Group and the public consultation\r\nlaunched by the Commission on double non-taxation in 2012 (see above under item\r\n1), the Commission held technical meetings with Member States and with\r\nstakeholders in April 2013. \nImpact Assessment\nAn Impact Assessment on amending the PSD\r\nhas been prepared. The impact assessment looks at different options for\r\namending the PSD which are compared with the 'no action' or 'status quo' scenario.\nIt was found that counteracting double\r\nnon-taxation deriving from hybrid financial arrangements and aggressive tax\r\nplanning will have a positive impact on the tax revenue of Member States\r\notherwise affected from the overall reduction of taxes paid by the parties\r\ninvolved and by the additional tax deductions of the costs for tax planning and\r\nrelevant arrangements. It was not possible in the impact assessment to quantify\r\nthe benefits of the preferred amendments. However, the figures involved are not\r\ncrucial in the decision to fight hybrid financial arrangements and tax abuse;\r\nreasons of competition, economic efficiency, transparency and fairness - from\r\nwhich the internal market would greatly benefit - play a determinant role in\r\nthis respect. \nHybrid loan mismatches\nIn the impact assessment, it was found that\r\nthe best option is to deny the tax exemption in the PSD to profit distribution\r\npayments which are deductible in the source Member State. Accordingly, the Member State of the receiving company (parent company or permanent establishment of the parent\r\ncompany) shall tax the portion of the profit distribution payments which is\r\ndeductible in the Member State of the paying subsidiary.\nIt was found that this option was the most\r\neffective option in counteracting hybrid financial arrangements as it will\r\nensure consistency of treatment across EU. This option will help achieving the\r\nfundamental purpose of the PSD, i.e. to create a level playing field between\r\ngroups of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States and groups of parent companies and subsidiaries of the same Member State. The wished\r\neffect is that all enterprises are taxed on the realised profits in the EU\r\nMember State concerned and that not one company can escape taxation by\r\nloopholes from hybrid financing in cross-border situations. The aim is to close\r\nan unacceptable practice whereby companies escape proper taxation.\nAnti-abuse provision\nIn the impact assessment it was found that\r\nthe most effective option would be to update the current anti-abuse provisions\r\nof the PSD in light of the general anti-abuse rules proposed in the\r\nRecommendation on aggressive tax planning from December 2012 and make it\r\nobligatory for Member States to adopt the common anti-abuse rule.\nThis option will be the most effective\r\noption in achieving a common standard for anti-abuse provisions against abuse\r\nof the PSD. A common anti-abuse provision in all Member States will ensure\r\nclarity and certainty for all taxpayers and tax administrations. The existing Member State anti-abuse measures cover a wide variety of forms and targets, having been\r\ndesigned in a national context to address the specific concerns of MS and\r\nfeatures of their tax systems.\nThis option will provide the benefits of\r\nclarity as it will be explicitly stated what Member States shall adopt as an\r\nanti-abuse rule for the purpose of the PSD. It will therefore ensure that the\r\nanti-abuse measures adopted and implemented by EU Member States will raise no\r\nEU compliance issue. Furthermore, there will be an\r\nequal application of the EU directive without possibilities for\r\n\"directive-shopping\" (i.e. to avoid that companies invest through\r\nintermediaries in Member States where the anti-abuse provision is less\r\nstringent or where there is no rule).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE\r\nPROPOSAL\nThe\r\nproposal seeks to tackle hybrid financial mismatches within the scope of\r\napplication of the PSD and to introduce a general anti-abuse rule in order to\r\nprotect the functioning of this directive. \nThese\r\nobjectives require an amendment of the PSD, and therefore the only possible\r\noption is to present a Commission proposal for a directive. In direct tax\r\nmatters, the relevant legal basis is Article 115 of the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) under which the Commission may issue\r\ndirectives for the approximation of provisions of the Member States as directly\r\naffecting the functioning of the Internal Market.\nThe\r\nobjectives of the initiative cannot be sufficiently achieved unilaterally by\r\nthe Member States. It is exactly the differences in national legislation\r\nconcerning the tax treatment of hybrid financing which allow taxpayers, in\r\nparticular groups of companies, to employ cross-border tax planning strategies\r\nwhich lead to distortions of capital flows and of competition in the Internal\r\nMarket. In addition, and in a more general sense, the considerable differences\r\nbetween the approaches of Member States against abusive behaviour lead to legal\r\nuncertainty and undermine the very aim of the PSD as such, namely the abolition\r\nof tax obstacles to the cross-border grouping of companies of different Member\r\nStates. Action at EU level is required to better achieve the purpose of the\r\ninitiative. Therefore the proposed amendments comply with the subsidiarity\r\nprinciple. The proposed amendments also comply with the proportionality\r\nprinciple as they do not go beyond what is needed to address the issues at\r\nstake and, thereby, to achieve the objectives of the Treaties, in particular\r\nthe proper and effective functioning of the Internal Market.\nSubsidiarity principle\nHybrid financial mismatches\nIndividual Member States' reaction to\r\nhybrid financial mismatches would not effectively solve the problem, as the\r\nissue originates from the interaction of different national tax systems.\r\nIndeed, single uncoordinated initiatives may result in additional mismatching\r\nor in the creation of new tax obstacles in the Internal Market.\nAmending Double Tax Conventions between\r\nMember States would not be a suitable method for addressing the matter, as each\r\ncountry pair may arrive at a different solution. Other international\r\ninitiatives, such as those undertaken by the OECD on corporate base erosion,\r\nwould not be able to address the specific EU concerns as these require an\r\namendment of the existing EU legislation.\nFinally, the agreement reached in the Code of\r\nConduct Group for Member States to take a coordinated approach can only be\r\napplied after an amendment to the Parent-Subsidiary directive which Member\r\nStates cannot do without a proposal from the Commission.\nAnti-abuse provision\nThe current Parent-Subsidiary directive\r\nallows Member States to apply domestic or agreement-based provisions required\r\nfor the prevention of fraud or abuse. This provision must however be read as\r\ninterpreted by the CJEU. The CJEU jurisprudence sets the principle that Member\r\nStates cannot go beyond the general Community law principle when countering\r\nabusive behaviour. In addition, the application of anti-abuse measures must not\r\nlead to results incompatible with fundamental Treaty freedoms.\nFurthermore, Member States' existing\r\ndomestic anti-abuse measures cover a wide variety of forms and targets, having\r\nbeen designed in a national context to address the specific concerns of Member States\r\nand features of their tax systems. The current situation gives lack of clarity\r\nfor taxpayers and for tax administrations.\nTaking all these factors into account,\r\nindividual Member States' action would not be as effective as action by the EU.\nProportionality principle\nThe obligation to tax is limited only the\r\nportion of hybrid financial payments which is deductible in the source Member State.\nThe proposed GAAR is in line with the\r\nproportionality limits envisaged by the CJEU case law.\nTherefore, the proposed amendments comply\r\nwith the proportionality principle as they do not go beyond what is needed to\r\naddress the issues at stake.\nCommentary on the Articles\nThe proposal aims at modifying the Recitals,\r\nArticle 1, Article 4 and to update Annex I Part A of the current PSD. The\r\nmodifications and update are contained in Article 1 of the proposal.\nRecitals\nUnder the proposed amendment, the recitals explain\r\nthat, in order to prevent that cross-border groups of parent companies and\r\nsubsidiaries benefit from unintended advantages compared with national groups,\r\nthe benefits of the tax exemption should be denied to distributions of profits\r\nthat are deductible in the source Member State. \nThe fundamental purpose of the PSD is to\r\ncreate a level playing field between groups of parent companies and\r\nsubsidiaries of different Member States and groups of parent companies and\r\nsubsidiaries of the same Member State.\nAt the time the PSD was adopted,\r\ncross-border groups were generally at a disadvantage in comparison to domestic\r\ngroups because of the double taxation to which profit distributions were subject;\r\notherwise, bilateral double tax conventions were insufficient to create within\r\nthe EU conditions analogous to those of an internal market.\nTo achieve the aimed neutrality, the PSD\r\nprovided for the (i) abolition of withholding taxes on profit distributions and\r\n(ii) prevention of economic double taxation of the distributed profits through\r\neither tax exemption or tax credit in the Member States of the parent\r\ncompanies.\nSince then, and in the last decade more and\r\nmore rapidly, the situation has evolved.\nThe increase in cross-border investments\r\nhas given cross-board groups the opportunity to use hybrid financial\r\ninstruments taking unduly advantages from mismatches between different national\r\ntax treatments and from the international standard rules to relieve double\r\ntaxation. This leads, within the EU, to a distortion in the competition between\r\ncross-border and national groups, contrary to the scope of the PSD.\nArticle 1\nThe proposed Directive would allow Member\r\nStates to take measures in order to prevent fraud and evasion. In this respect,\r\nthe Commission service has recalled that tax fraud is a form of deliberate\r\nevasion of tax which is generally punishable under criminal law, and tax\r\nevasion generally comprises illegal arrangements where liability to tax is hidden\r\nor ignored[11].\r\n\nFurthermore, in order to address the risk\r\nof abuse, it is proposed to replace the current anti-abuse provision by\r\ninserting a common anti-abuse rule, based on the similar clause included in the\r\nRecommendation on aggressive tax planning.\nArticle 4\nUnder the proposed amendment, the Member State of the parent company and the Member State of its permanent establishment deny the\r\nbenefits of the tax exemption to distributions of profits that are deductible by\r\nthe subsidiary of the parent company.\nAccordingly, in letter a) of the paragraph\r\nit is specified that the MS of the receiving company (parent company or its\r\npermanent establishment) shall refrain from taxing the received profits\r\ndistribution only to the extent that those profits distributions are not\r\ndeductible in the source Member State (i.e. in the Member State of the\r\ndistributing subsidiary). The Member State of the receiving company shall\r\ntherefore tax the portion of profits that is deductible in the source Member State.\nNo withholding tax would be imposed on the\r\nprofits distributed by the subsidiary as the payment in the Member State of the subsidiary would be treated as an interest payment under the Interest and\r\nRoyalties directive. There is a pending proposal in Council to align the current\r\n25% eligibility shareholding threshold in the Interest and Royalties directive\r\nto the 10% of the PSD[12].\r\nMoreover, typically hybrid financial arrangements are set up in Members States\r\nhaving a zero withholding on interest payments under domestic or double tax\r\nconventions provisions. \nAnnex I Part A)\nThe proposed amendments include eligible companies which have been\r\nintroduced in the company laws of the Member States after the recast of the\r\ndirective. The Commission has received an updating request from Romania.\nTo this purpose, in letter (w) the following two types of companies\r\nare added: \u2018societ\u0103\u021bi \u00een nume colectiv\u2019, \u2018societ\u0103\u021bi \u00een\r\ncomandit\u0103 simpl\u0103\u2019.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUDGETARY IMPLICATION\nThis proposal does not have any budgetary\r\nimplications for the EU.\n2013/0400 (CNS)\nProposal for a\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE\namending Directive 2011/96/EU on the\r\ncommon system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and\r\nsubsidiaries of different Member States\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the\r\nFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 115 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the\r\nEuropean Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative\r\nact to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European\r\nParliament[13],\nHaving regard to the opinion of the\r\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee[14],\nActing in accordance with a special\r\nlegislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Council Directive\r\n2011/96/EU exempts dividends and other profit distributions paid by subsidiary\r\ncompanies to their parent companies from withholding taxes and eliminates\r\ndouble taxation of such income at the level of the parent company.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefits of Directive 2011/96/EU\r\nshould not lead to situations of double non-taxation and, therefore, generate\r\nunintended tax benefits for groups of parent companies and subsidiaries of\r\ndifferent Member States in comparison with groups of companies of the same Member State.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of avoiding\r\nsituations of double non-taxation deriving from mismatches in the tax treatment\r\nof profit distributions between Member States, the Member State of the parent\r\ncompany and the Member State of its permanent establishment should not allow\r\nthose companies to benefit from the tax exemption applied to received distributed\r\nprofits, to the extent that such profits are deductible by the subsidiary of\r\nthe parent company.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to prevent tax\r\navoidance and abuse through artificial arrangements, a common anti-abuse\r\nprovision tailored to the purpose and objectives of Directive 2011/96/EU should\r\nbe inserted.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to ensure\r\nthat this Directive does not preclude the application of domestic or\r\nagreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is appropriate to\r\nupdate Annex I, Part A to that Directive to include other forms of companies\r\nwhich have been introduced in the company laws of Romania.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Directive 2011/96/EU should\r\ntherefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nDirective 2011/96/EU is amended as follows:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Article 1, paragraph 2,\r\nis replaced by the following:\n\"2.
