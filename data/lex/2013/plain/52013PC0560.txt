Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020,\r\ncertain issues stemming from the final outcome of the negotiations should be\r\naddressed. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the European Council of\r\n27 and 28 June 2013 it was considered that a budgetary solution should be found\r\nto address these issues for those Member States most affected, namely France, Italy and Spain.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the\r\ncurrent economic crisis, in order to strengthen the economic, social and territorial\r\ncohesion of the Union, and as a contribution to the special effort needed to\r\naddress the specific situations of unemployment, in particular youth\r\nunemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the\r\nEuropean Social Fund allocations to those three Member States for the year 2013\r\nshould be increased.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to establish the\r\namounts allocated

adjusted. \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the\r\neffectiveness of the increase of commitment appropriations for the year 2013\r\nand to facilitate the implementation of the operational programmes, the\r\nabsorption capacity of the Member States concerned for the Convergence and the\r\nRegional competitiveness and employment objectives of the Funds should be taken\r\ninto account.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to provide for\r\nsufficient time for the operational programmes to benefit from those additional\r\nallocations, it is also necessary to extend the deadline for the budget\r\ncommitments in respect of the operational programmes that are to benefit from the\r\nnew amounts provided for in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that those\r\ncommitment appropriations refer to the year 2013, this Regulation should enter\r\ninto force as a matter of
